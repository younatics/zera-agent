The Army psychiatrist sentenced to death for the Fort Hood shooting rampage has been forcibly shaved, an Army spokesman said on Tuesday. Major Nidal Hasan began growing a beard in the years after the November 2009 shooting that left 13 dead and 30 wounded. The beard prompted delays to his court-martial because it violated Army grooming regulations. He was convicted of all charges last month at his court-martial at the Central Texas Army post and sentenced to death. Major Nidal Hasan, pictured before the 2009 Fort Hood shooting (left). He began growing a beard in the years after the attack. He has now been forcibly shaved, the Army said on Tuesday . Now, Hasan is an inmate at the U.S. Detention Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, home to the military death row. Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt, an Army spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday that Hasan had been shaved. He did not specify when or provide details, however. Officials at Fort Leavenworth previously had said Hasan would be subject to Army regulations. Hasan dispensed with all criminal defense counsel and represented himself during his trial. A message left with John Galligan, Hasan's first criminal defense attorney who still represents him in civil matters, was not returned. Hasan said he grew the beard because his Muslim faith required it and was not meant as a show of disrespect. However, Col. Gregory Gross, the original judge presiding over Hasan's court-martial, ordered Hasan to be clean-shaven or be forcibly shaved before his trial. Convicted: In a court sketch from August 28, 2013, Hasan is pictured with a beard as he is sentenced to death for the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood . The dispute over that decision led to appeals that delayed the trial by more than three months before the appeals court ousted the judge. The appeals court ruled that Gross did not appear impartial while presiding over Hasan's case and that the command, not a judge, is responsible for enforcing military grooming standards. Col. Tara Osborn, assigned to replace Gross as the judge presiding over the case, allowed Hasan to keep the beard for the course of the trial last month. However, she warned that although she would not hold the breach of grooming regulations against the 42-year-old American-born Muslim, the military jurors might.

Not the purrfect escape: A cat trapped inside a metal container tried to escape through a tiny hole but ended up getting trapped . The head of the distressed Italian moggie was spotted by a neighbour in Bolzano, northern Italy. The well-fed feline managed to squeeze its face through the hole in the side of a storage container, but couldn't wriggle its body through the small gap. People walking past could just see a cats head protruding from the container, but nothing else. Firefighters spent an hour carefully cutting through the metal unit until it was wide enough for the feline to get through.

A record-breaking autogyro pilot famous for his work in a James Bond film has died at the age of 97. Retired Wing Commander Ken Wallis was best known for his action sequence flying in the Little Nellie aircraft as actor Sean Connery’s stunt double in the 1967 film You Only Live Twice. Mr Wallis, who was honoured with an MBE in 1996, piloted 24 wartime missions over Europe in Wellington bombers, before spending 20 years in weapons research for the Royal Air Force.

The great-grandfather, who lived near Dereham, Norfolk, was honoured in October by the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators for his lifetime contribution to aerospace. He was also a keen photographer and over the years helped police in aerial reconnaissance, the search for London murderer Lord Lucan and even the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland. Mr Wallis was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire, in 1916 in the middle of the First World War - and trips to air shows sparked his interest in flying. Although he had poor sight in one eye he managed to gain his private pilot’s licence in 1937 without an eye test and he made his first solo flight in a de Havilland Gipsy Moth. He was based at RAF Uxbridge in West London during the Second World War and flew Westland Lysanders after cheating in an eye test.

Mr Wallis spent the next 20 years working in armament and weapon research, but after leaving the RAF in 1964 it was autogyros which became his passion. He started flying them in 1959 and was the first instructor and examiner for the flying machine. Between 1968 and 2002 he set 34 world records, including the 3km (1.9-mile) speed record for autogyros, which he set at 207.7kph (129.1mph). In 1975 he broke the record for the longest flight in an autogyro when he flew the length of Britain.

Last year he said: ‘Sean Connery had . to sit in the autogyro and put on the helmet, but then he had to get out . and it was me who did the first take-off. ‘I had to do 81 flights and was in . the air for more than 44 hours. It was hard work but fun when it was . finished. The funny thing is I don’t even get a mention in the credits.’ Mr Wallis later used the autogyro, which can hover without the pilot touching the controls, to help scan the Sussex Downs for Lord Lucan and in a 1970 search for the Loch Ness monster. Lord Lucan vanished after his family's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was found dead at the home of his estranged wife in London's Belgravia in 1974 after being bludgeoned with a lead pipe.

Farewell: Mr Wallis died early on Sunday and a private funeral will take place at a date to be arranged . Mr Wallis kept a fleet of 20 autogyros, including a replica of Little Nellie, in a mini hangar at his home in Norfolk and last year he was still flying every other day. He said in 2012: ‘They are one of the safest machines to fly because if the engine stops the rotors keep turning, so it can be landed. ‘Unlike other aircraft it can fly in all sorts of conditions, even stormy weather. I used to fly to work every day on the south coast, now I tend to fly more locally.’ Mr Wallis was also an inventor and designed the world’s first electric slot-car race track, pre-dating the earliest Scalextric by 15 years. He was made an MBE in 1996, and this summer finally received his Bomber Command medal for his time in the 103 Squadron based at RAF Elsham Wolds in Lincolnshire 71 years ago.

Officials in New Hampshire have raised the horrifying possibility that up to 13 people in multiple states have been exposed to a rare, degenerative and incurable brain disease through surgical equipment. Authorities at the Catholic Medical Center in Manchester said on Wednesday that they believe one person who had brain surgery in May died of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in August. As the faulty proteins that cause the fatal disease can survive standard sterilization, officials have notified eight people who had brain surgery in that time and say up to five patients in other states could have been exposed.

One is a ‘feelgood’ detective drama set in picturesque English villages, while the other is the Nordic noir genre of brutal violence and twisting plots. But the producers of Midsomer Murders have decided to join forces with hit Danish series The Killing and Borgen for a special anniversary edition. Long-running British drama Midsomer Murders is teaming up with the Danish producers behind The Killing to film its 100th episode . The cast of Midsomer will be dispatched to Copenhagen for the show’s 100th episode. It will be the first time that the ITV drama has been filmed outside of the UK. Two . Danish actresses - The Killing's Ann Eleonora Jorgensen and Borgen's . Birgitte Hjort Sorensen - will feature in The Killings At Copenhagen. Danish crime drama The Killing and political series Borgen, both shown on BBC4, have proved a hit with British viewers. The episode, to be shown in the forthcoming 16th series, will be made with DR, producer of The Killing. DR's series acquisitions executive Kaare Schmidt said: 'Midsomer Murders is a benchmark in television entertainment and Danish viewers' favourite programme for more than a decade. 'It's an honour and a thrill for us to be able to contribute to the series' distinguished line of murder victims and police detectives.' Viewers will see DCI Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and DS Nelson (newcomer Gwilym Lee) travel to Denmark after a body is discovered which links back to a family in Midsomer in the one-off episode, which will also be filmed in Midsomer's first UK murder location, Badger's Drift. Executive producer Jo Wright said: 'Midsomer Murders is incredibly popular on prime-time Danish television. Borgen, with Birgitte Hjort Sorensen as Katrine Fonsmark.

The Killings At Copenhagen will also feature Pernille Birk (Ann Eleonora Jorgensen, third from right) 'It is known as Barnaby and has been running for 12 years, winning 40% of the audience share. 'The idea to shoot in Denmark came about because we wanted to do something special to mark the 100th episode, and it's great to be working with DR, producer of the award winning series The Killing.' In 2011, Midsomer's producer was suspended after sparking a row when he claimed part of the show's appeal was an absence of ethnic minorities. Brian True-May, the drama's co-creator, said that the ITV1 programmes 'wouldn't work' if there was any racial diversity in the village life. 'We just don't have ethnic minorities involved. Because it wouldn't be the English village with them. It just wouldn't work....We're the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way,' he said. He was later reinstated but stepped down from the show the same year. The programme, based on the books by Caroline Graham, was launched in 1997 and is sold to 225 territories around the world.","Episode will be partly shot in Copenhagen and the surrounding area .

A paranoid schizophrenic obsessed with Batman's arch nemesis the Joker was detained indefinitely today after stabbing a stranger 13 times at a leisure centre. Dale Pipe, 21, who had armed himself with 10 knives and an axe, savagely attacked Joshua Henley, 22, as he used a urinal in a gym before posting the Joker's catchphrase 'Why so serious?' on Facebook. After hiding for an hour in the male changing rooms of Belle Vue Leisure Centre in Consett, County Durham, Pipe approached Mr Henley from behind and began to stab him in the back with a filleting knife. 'Dangerous': Dale Pipe (left), who was obsessed with Batman's arch nemesis the Joker, stabbed Joshua Henley (right) repeatedly in the back in a ferocious gym attack . The ferocious assault continued until staff at the centre were alerted by screams from the victim. After he was arrested, Pipe tried to . carve a 'Joker' smile onto his own face and admitted that he wanted to . kill 'as many people as possible.' Jolyon Perks, prosecuting, said: 'When standing at the urinal [Mr Henley] was unaware that he was being stabbed until he could turn and face the attacker. 'He thought that the blows to his neck and back were hard punches. On realising he was being stabbed, he fought for his life in a way that the crown cannot do justice to.' Mr Henley was eventually able to escape, after staff intervened, and it was then that Pipe introduced himself as the Joker. Pipe was obsessed with the Joker (pictured) and after stabbing Mr Henley posted: 'Why so serious?' on Facebook - a line from The Dark Knight . While there he was barricaded in the changing room by staff, Pipe posted Facebook message that read: 'Why so serious?' - the catchphrase of the fictional hero’s . nemesis. When police put a camera under the . changing room door to observe Pipe after his victim had made it to . safety, he was seen posing and preening himself in a broken mirror, which he . had smashed. More knives and a haul of violent films were found when police raided his home. Newcastle Crown Court heard that the police later recovered a range of knives, an axe, syringes, steroids, duct tape and a balaclava from his bag. There was also a notebook in which there was written: 'On the 16th I will kill someone.' After being arrested he made it clear to the police that if he had been successful in killing his first victim, he would then have moved on to others. Pipe, who pleaded guilty to attempted murder and possessing offensive weapons, has also since attempted to mutilate his own face, like that of the Joker, as he said voices in his head were telling him to do so. After the attack Mr Henley was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where he underwent a six-hour surgical procedure. In total he suffered 16 wounds, with the court hearing any one of them could have been enough to have killed him. Sentencing Pipe to an indefinite hospital order, Judge James Goss described him as a very dangerous young man and in need of long-term treatment. Pipe waited for an hour before choosing Mr Henley to attack at Belle Vue Leisure Centre (pictured) 'The terrifying and ferocious nature of the attack was described in the victim statement that was made,' he said. 'Physically . and emotionally his life has been shattered. But for his own bravery, . strength and good fortune he would not have survived the attack. 'He remains compromised by the attack and is understandably very angry.' Pipe will reside at Rampton Secure Hospital, where he will receive medical treatment for his condition. Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Henley said: 'On January 28 2013 my life changed significantly as a direct result of the actions of Dale Pipe. 'I have had to wait some time for the sentencing hearing and I am relieved that the judge has seen fit to impose a sentence that will ensure Dale Pipe will not be a risk to anyone else in the future.' The court had been told that it was only Mr Henley's developed muscle mass that protected his vital organs in the attack. High security: Judge James Goss detained Pipe indefinitely at Newcastle Crown Court today . At a previous hearing, the court heard Pipe had been given a caution after turning up at his former workplace The Royal Derwent Hotel last Halloween wearing a balaclava and armed with knives. He had intended an attack on that occasion, the court heard, but decided not to go through it. Judge Goss said: '[Pipe] requires prolonged medical treatment, which for the foreseeable future, should be in conditions of high security.” Stephen Thornton, defending, said Pipe had had normal relationships with people throughout his life and had recently lost his father. Mr Thornton added: 'He has had auditory hallucinations since the age of 14, the most influential being that of the Joker. 'It was that voice which persuaded Mr Pipe to mutilate himself, his face, while in custody in Durham, he tried to carve a Joker face into his own face.'","Dale Pipe, 21, armed himself with 10 knives and an axe in the attack .

A teenager who died after hitting his head on an overpass when he stood out of the roof of a party bus has been cited as part of the problem that led to his death. A new report into the death of Daniel Fernandez has revealed that the 16-year-old was extremely intoxicated, with a blood alcohol level of 0.209 per cent. While the teen was twice the legal limit, his intoxication was not the only problem found by investigators that they believe they contributed to the August 31, 2012 crash. Horror: Daniel Fernandez, pictured, died on Friday evening after sticking his head out of a double-decker bus which went through an underpass . The driver, Fedna Balthazar, had an oustanding warrant for his arrest over his failure to appear in court for driving on a suspended license. He reportedly had driving and moving related suspensions and violations dating back to the 1980s. ABC News released the highlights of the report, where investigator John Pierotti Jr wrote that Balthazar was not the only adult with a role in the accident. There were supposed to be two adult chaperones to accompany the 64 teenagers on the bus headed to Sweet 16 birthday party. The 64 teenagers were spread among the party bus' two floors which teatured a VIP room with satellite TV and WiFi. First responders: Emergency personnel work the scene of the underside of a highway overpass, along Interstate 95, in Fort Lee . Impact: The roof hatch was found bent back from the impact . Party bus: The double-decker bus was carrying 65 other teenagers to a birthday party in New Jersey . The roof hatch was supposed to be locked using the safety bolt, but that apparently was undone when the bus hit a bump. The fatal accident occurred on the Nw Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge as the students from St. Francis Prepatory School in Queens were headed to a party in Garfield, New Jersey. Fernandez was standing on the top floor of the bus with his head and shoulders outside of the roof hatch. His friends all saw him nearly get decapitated before he fell to the floor. 'Panic ensued,' the report states. Twitter user Kaylan Baez was apparently on the double-decker bus, and wrote early Saturday morning: ‘Never thought I would ever witness something like that. My prayers go out to dan and his family. R.I.P. Daniel Fernandez.’ Shock: One girl apparently witnessed Mr Fernandez's death and tweeted her disbelief . Partying: . Some of the girls partying on the bus with Daniel Fernandez posted this . picture on Instagram shortly before Fernandez was killed . Earlier in the evening, she was tweeting about how excited she was for the party. Another girl who was on the bus tweeted: 'Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a bad dream. I love you so much Dan you were there for me till the last second.' The teenager was hurried to Hackensack University Medical Center, but was pronounced dead on arrival, according to Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman. Fernandez was not the only teen on the bus believed to be drinking at the time of the accident, as it was discovered that they snuck alcohol on board by pouring it into bottles of Arizona Iced Tea. Distraught: Jose and Maria Fernandez, the parents of Daniel Fernandez, greet well wishers at Kearns Funeral Home in Rego Park, Queens, on Monday . Class clown: Teachers and classmates said Fernandez was a promising writer with a great sense of humour . Tweets show how the friends planned on getting ‘sauced’ at the Sweet 16 party. Hours before heading to the party bus, Fernandez asked a friend over Twitter: ‘Are they checking on the bus??’ Another party-goer tweeted: ‘The amount of bottles on this limo is rediculous.’ [sic] .","Daniel Fernandez, 16, was riding with 63 other friends to birthday party in New Jersey from Queens school on Friday .

Malnourished horses on the brink of death have been saved from a Texas ranch with one rescuer saying that the animals' burns were the worst she had ever seen. The 15 horses were removed from a . property in South Bexar, Texas on Sunday after a warrant was served. The owner is facing 19 . counts of animal cruelty amid fears that he may have hidden other injured animals elsewhere. Three dead horses, believed to have died of dehydration, were also discovered on the property. Close to death: The starved horses were rescued from a ranch close to San Antonio, Texas, covered in painful sores . Skeletal: A horse with its ribs protruding through its coat was rescued from a Texas ranch along with 14 others on Sunday . In pain: Sand burns are caused when starving horses force themselves to eat milkweed which then burns them from the inside out . Pictures of the animals revealed how horrifyingly underweight they are, with ribs protruding through their coats and painful sores covering their bodies. The horses were taken to the Meadow Haven Horse Rescue in Nixon. Director of the charity Darla Cherry told MailOnline today that the horses were suffering from the worst case of sand burns that she had seen. Sand burn is caused by horses eating a type of milkweed which grows in the South Texas scrub. The plant makes horses hyper-sensitive to sunlight, burning them from the inside out and leaving bald patches on their coat and . painful open sores. Rescue mission: All the horses were close to death when found at the ranch in South Bexar County . In need of loving care: Meadow Haven Horse Rescue said that they were hoping to gain custody of the horses and rehouse them with loving owners . Ms Cherry said that the sheriff's office had called her organization, which is funded entirely by donations, for help. The animals were so dehydrated that when Meadow Haven rescuers first got to the farm, the creatures gulped seven tall barrels of water that the owner had to be forced to provide. The charity director said that she believed the ranch owner was collecting the horses and castrating them in order to transport the animals to Mexico for slaughter. Ms Cherry said that all 15 horses are still alive and slowly improving. Meadow Haven, which has 150 horses in its care, will ask the court for custody of the animals on Thursday. It is hoped that many of the horses can be rehoused with loving owners. The ranch owner has not been identified but will appear in court on Thursday.

Elegant in a £29.99 cobalt blue top from high street favourite Zara, the 25-year-old joined the tennis star's mother, Judy, to cheer Murray on in his fourth round match against Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. And while Judy was low-key in a simple denim jacket, glamorous Kim added sparkle courtesy of an eye-catching floral necklace from the Spanish brand. Hurrah! Kim Sears jumps for joy in her Zara necklace and top while Judy Murray looks on approvingly . Cheap n' chic: Kim's eye-catching ensemble included a £29.99 necklace and blouse from Zara . Even her bag was a high street hit with the £329 Ted Baker Baillie bag worn to day one of the US Open making a second appearance. Despite occasional nail-biting moments, both Kim and Judy seemed happy and relaxed as they cheered Murray onto victory. Kim's elegant sense of style has become as much of a favourite among tennis fans as her boyfriend's winning performances. And while she always looks a million dollars, thrifty Kim's wardrobe owes more to her penchant for scouring the high street than splashing out on designer names.

France has draconian privacy laws but punishments for breaking them are paltry. Nevertheless, politicians, the powerful and the wealthy happily use them to hide their secrets. Experts say Closer is undoubtedly breaking French law by publishing topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge in Provence. But the magazine is likely to be willing to take the risk of a small fine in return for a huge boost in sales and revenue. The French constitution states that ‘everyone has the right to privacy’ and potentially prevents the media from disclosing intimate details about an individual’s private life as well as taking unsolicited photographs . The system allowed former president François Mitterrand to conceal the existence of his second family and daughter Mazarine up to his death. The French learned about disgraced former banker Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s sexual proclivities only when he was accused of rape in New York. And president Francois Hollande’s girlfriend, Valérie Trierweiler, who works for Paris Match, is demanding £20,000 in damages from Closer for printing pictures of her in a bikini this summer. Miss Trierweiler, 47, has already been awarded £1,200 after the highly unflattering snaps appeared in glossy French magazine VSD. Closer has branded the First Lady’s . demand as ‘the height of hypocrisy’ and magazine editor Laurence Pieau . has issued a full page statement attacking Miss Trierweiler – published . on the page after its photos of topless Kate. Professional: Despite having just heard bad news over breakfast the pair didn't let it show when they met people during a Kuala Lumper walk about today . ‘How dare she complain,’ said Miss Pieau. ‘She was on a private beach in the south of France, but in full view of the boats hired by the paparazzi. 'She must have known she was going to be photographed. And she even works for a magazine that printed them.’ Breach of privacy is a criminal offence . carrying a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a £36,000 fine for . the editor but fines sometimes amounting to a single euro are regularly . handed down.

Arsenal's newest signing Mesut Özil faces sky-high expectations from the fans of his new club - but he is not the only new arrival in London to be creating a buzz. The German midfielder's girlfriend Mandy Capristo is set to be a glamorous addition to Britain's collection of footballing WAGs - with her pop star background leading to the couple being dubbed 'the German Posh and Becks'. Mr Özil, who is of Turkish ancestry, is a devout Muslim, but his girlfriend has become a celebrity in Germany thanks to her flamboyant musical performances and participation in a dancing-themed TV show. Scroll down for video . Power couple: Footballer Mesut Özil and singer Mandy Capristo are set to move to London after the player joined Arsenal from Real Madrid for £42.5million . Together: The couple have been dating for less than a year but seem particularly loved-up . The 24-year-old footballer was signed by Arsenal on transfer deadline day this week, moving from Real Madrid for £42.5million in a bid to shore up the fortunes of the struggling North London giant. He is expected to be accompanied by Miss Capristo, 23, who found fame as a teen performer and member of a girl band before going solo. She will join other WAGs such as Coleen Rooney, Abbey Crouch and - most famous of all - former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham. Mr Özil and Miss Capristo have been dating for less than a year, but are not shy about showing off their dedication to each other. They have a joint Facebook page, on which they frequently post messages of love, erotic sketches and 'selfies' with super-imposed hearts and kisses. Footage courtesy of Radio Hamburg . Glamour: Miss Capristo rose to fame through TV talent shows and is now a popular solo artist too . The new Posh and Becks? The German pair have drawn comparisons to David and Victoria Beckham . The couple make a striking contrast to the likes of Gareth Bale, Özil's £86million replacement at Real, whose relationship with Emma Rhys-Jones is so relaxed and low-key that they have been compared to TV's Gavin and Stacey. Miss Capristo's first brush with stardom came when she competed on a youth talent show, Kiddy Contest, which she won at the age of 11. She later took part in the German edition of Popstars, and as a result became a member of the group Monrose, which sold 3million albums over four years. The singer was named 'sexiest woman in the world' by readers of German FHM in 2010, and last year she boosted her profile by participating in Let's Dance, a TV show similar to Strictly Come Dancing. Miss Capristo released her debut solo album Grace in April last year. Popular: Miss Capristo is set to take the London social scene by storm now her boyfriend has joined Arsenal . Mr Özil is one of the stars of the German national team, and has also been held up as an icon of Turkish immigrants' ability to integrate into German society. He started his career at FC Schalke 04 before moving to Werder Bremen and then, in a €15million transfer, going to Real in 2010. The star was Arsenal's only significant signing of the summer, and is expected to help Arsene Wenger's team challenge for their first trophy since 2005. Mr Özil is devoutly religious, reciting the Koran before each game - and he has even taught verses from the Muslim holy book to former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. 'I pray and my teammates know that they cannot talk to me during this brief period,' he has said about his pre-match ritual. 'I also ask Allah to grant me success. This is the secret of my success.' He has also expressed his regret that he is unable to observe the Ramadan fast, because his job requires him to maintain peak levels of fitness at all times.","German midfielder Mesut Özil has transferred from Real Madrid to Arsenal .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 18:41 EST, 3 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:45 EST, 3 September 2013 . Tesco has been accused of trying to fool customers over the horsemeat burger scandal by attempting to spread the blame to others. The supermarket was the focus of public outrage after it emerged in January that some of its cheap  frozen burgers were as much as 29 per cent horsemeat. At the time, Britain’s biggest food retailer apologised but suggested it was the victim of a widespread problem, saying in adverts: ‘It’s about the whole food industry.’ The Advertising Standards Agency has ruled that a claim by Tesco that the horsemeat scandal was a problem for 'the whole food industry' should not be repeated . The claim outraged the nation’s independent butchers, and in a ruling published today, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld objections to the Tesco claim that this was a problem for ‘the whole food industry’. The advertising watchdog said the statement would be understood by consumers to relate to all food retailers and suppliers, rather than Tesco alone. The ASA said: ‘Because the ad implied that all retailers and suppliers were likely to have sold  products contaminated with horsemeat, and because relatively few instances of contamination had been identified at the time the ad appeared, we concluded the ad was misleading.’ As a result, it said the ad breached industry codes and the claim should not be repeated. The full advertisement read: ‘The problem we’ve had with some of our meat lately is about more than burgers and bolognese. It’s about some of the ways we get meat to your dinner table. Some of Tesco's cheap frozen burgers were found to contain as much as 29 per cent horsemeat . ‘It’s about the whole food industry. And it has made us realise, we really do need to make it better. ‘We’ve . been working on it, but we need to keep going, go further, move . quicker. We know that our supply chain is too complicated. So we’re . making it simpler ... Seriously. This is it. We are changing’. Brindon Addy, chairman of the Q Guild of butchers, welcomed the ruling. He said: ‘It was not only Tesco, but this was a problem of the big boys. ‘They were screwing the prices down to demand cheaper products with the result that cutting plants ended up using horse in manufactured products. ‘Tesco tried to mislead customers, but I don’t think they were fooled. ‘People realised it was problem of less trustworthy supermarkets and have changed to the high-end butchers. ‘As a result, we have seen a 30 per cent increase in sales. The claim that the scandal affected the whole food industry outraged butchers who insist they know the provenance of all of their meat (file picture) ‘This was not a problem of quality butchers, who deal directly with farmers or small, reputable wholesalers.’ Mr Addy said he was surprised that Tesco and others have not been prosecuted. Mr Addy, whose business is based in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: ‘It was wrong to sell horsemeat as beef. It was misleading. If it was me selling horsemeat in burgers, I know I would have been clobbered by the local authority.’ In its defence to the ASA, Tesco produced expert evidence arguing that the contamination was widespread. It claimed that while small butchers do source local food, they do not have the resources to audit suppliers to guarantee its authenticity. Wayne Rooney has been cleared of breaching advertising rules in a tweet for Nike. Watchdogs launched an investigation after receiving a complaint from someone who saw the message when it was retweeted on Twitter. They questioned whether the tweet - 'The pitches change. The killer instinct doesn't. Own the turf, anywhere. @NikeFootball £myground' and a link to a picture - was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. However, the Advertising Standard Authority (ASA) ruled no rules had been broken and cleared the England and Manchester United footballer of any wrongdoing. Nike said the inclusion of the '@NikeFootball' official Nike Football Twitter address would have left people 'in no doubt' that the tweet was a Nike marketing communication, because it directly and prominently referenced the Nike brand and its official Twitter address. The ASA investigated the tweet in connection with rules regarding 'recognition of marketing communications', but did not find it in breach and said no further action was necessary. An ASA spokesman said: 'We considered the reference to Nike Football was prominent and clearly linked the tweet with the Nike brand.'","Tesco said horsemeat scandal was problem for 'whole food industry'

The Indianapolis Colts have released rookie safety John Boyett after he boasted to cops they couldn’t arrest him because he was a football player. A sixth-round draft pick from the University of Oregon this past April, the defensive stand-out became belligerent with a bouncer and cops after not being allowed into an Indianapolis night club early Monday morning because he was too drunk. Mr Boyett was on the non-football injured reserve list and not expected to play in the coming weeks. Coach Chuck Pagano declined to go into details surrounding Mr Boyett’s release while speaking Wednesday afternoon with local media. We hardly knew ya: The Colts waved John Boyett after his arrest Monday morning, only months after drafting the standout safety . Mr Boyett, 23, was drafted by the Colts despite missing his entire senior year at Oregon after tearing the patellar tendons in both knees. The safety underwent surgery last year and has been rehabbing them ever since, according to reports. Despite being unable to make it onto the field, the former Colt found the strength to hobble around town and down several drinks before trying to enter the club. Bouncers at the unnamed club were forced to call police after Mr Boyett became combative when he was denied entry for being too drunk. The sauced safety then tried to talk his way out of being arrested by name-dropping his glamorous gig. ‘You can’t arrest me, I’m a Colts player,’ Mr Boyett said. The drunk defender was then booked on charges of public intoxication, resisting law enforcement and disorderly conduct before being released on his own recognizance, an Indianapolis Police Department spokesperson told MailOnline. No breathalyzer was administered, but Mr Boyett was determined to be drunk by the arresting officer who observed ‘bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and the strong smell of alcohol on his breath,’ the spokesperson added. Jettisoned: The Colts have declined to comment on Mr Boyett's release, instead choosing to focus on Sunday's season opener against the Oakland Raiders . The wounded windbag was released Tuesday by the team, which declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding his release when contacted by MailOnline, but did provide a transcript of Coach Pagano’s comments to media. ‘As you know, we released John Boyett yesterday,’ Mr Pagano said Wednesday afternoon. ‘I’m not going to get into the details. Every situation is different and we’ll handle each of them accordingly.’Mr Boyett tweeted a public apology to team owner Jim Irsay, the organization and city police early Wednesday afternoon. ‘I want to apologize to Mr. Irsay @JimIrsay, the Indianapolis Colts organization @Colts and the Indianapolis police,’ Mr Boyett wrote. ‘The Colts gave me an opportunity and I blew it. My behavior didn't and doesn't represent who I am.’ ‘I am deeply embarrassed and disappointed in myself. All I can do now is learn from it and never repeat it. I look forward to showing my true character in the future.’ A team spokesman did not respond to a message sent for further comment on whether Mr Boyett would have made the team had he not been arrested. The Colts’ first game is this coming Sunday, and it appears the team has already moved on. When asked if the arrest and release of Mr Boyett would be a distraction to the team, Coach Pagano replied ‘’our total focus is on preparing for the Raiders. Period.’","John Boyett had only joined the team in April, as a sixth-round draft pick from the University of Oregon .

Heart disease is currently the biggest killer in . the U.S., accounting for nearly 800,000 deaths a year - about . 30 per cent of all U.S. deaths. But one in four would have been avoided had the victim received screening and treatment for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and . smoking, according to a report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Shock statistic: 200,000 Americans are needlessly dying from preventable heart disease and strokes, a government study has revealed . The report looked at preventable . deaths from heart disease and stroke defined as those that occurred in . people under age 75 that could have been prevented by more effective . public health measures, lifestyle changes or medical care. While . the CDC has long tracked deaths from heart disease, it never previously . issued a report estimating how many such deaths could be prevented. And the research revealed worrying discrepancies along lines of gender and race with the 2010 rate of avoidable deaths in . black men about 80 percent higher than that of white men and black . women. In 2010, the states with the highest avoidable death rates were located primarily in the South, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and . Louisiana, the report stated. The states with the lowest rates were . Minnesota, Utah, Colorado, Connecticut and New Hampshire, according to . the report. Black people are twice as likely to die from preventable heart disease and strokes as whites . CDC officials said that the 2014 launch . of key elements of the U.S. healthcare law signed by President Barack . Obama in 2010 could help reduce avoidable deaths. The law is intended to . provide better access to treatment for millions of uninsured Americans . and routine coverage for preventive screenings. 'Beginning in October, the health insurance marketplaces will provide a new way for people to get health insurance so more patients have access to quality health insurance and coverage beginning as early as January 2014,' CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told a conference call with reporters. States with the highest rates . States with the lowest rates . The new health insurance exchanges are expected to provide coverage for up to 7 million uninsured Americans next year, according to government estimates. The law faces ongoing opposition among Republicans in Congress who say it imposes a financial burden on consumers and state governments. The rate of preventable deaths from heart disease and stroke - those that could have been avoided by treating high blood pressure and cholesterol and by discouraging smoking - fell nearly 30 percent between 2001 and 2010, the report said. There were widespread differences in rates by age, geographical region, race and gender, Frieden said. 'While those who are age 65 to 74 still have the greatest rate of heart attack and stroke, more than half of the preventable deaths - about six in 10 - happen in people under the age of 65,' Frieden said. Frieden said preventable deaths declined much more quickly in people aged 65 to 74, which 'may well be because they have access to health insurance through their Medicare coverage,' the U.S. health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Men were more than twice as likely as women to die from heart disease and strokes that could have been prevented by treating high blood pressure and cholesterol and through smoking-prevention efforts, the report said. The rate of such deaths for U.S. men in 2010 was 83.7 per 100,000 in 2010 compared with 39.6 per 100,000 for women, the CDC said.","Heart disease is USA's biggest killer causing nearly 800,000 deaths a year .

Sydney Leathers is promoting safe sex after saying she regrets having unprotected intercourse in her porn debut with an actor who days earlier slept with a star diagnosed as HIV positive. In a statement today, Leathers said: 'Some might call me a hypocrite for . suddenly having this message about safe sex because I chose not to use a . condom while filming my movie, Weiner and Me. 'I don't think I'm a . hypocrite though. I think it would be foolish of me to not learn from a . teachable moment like this. Had I not said anything about this, it would . have felt like a missed opportunity on my part. And we all know I don't . like to miss opportunities.' Leathers recently made the film Weiner And Me after a sexting relationship with the New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner. Scroll down for video . Debut: Sydney Leathers porn movie where she stars alongside Xander Corvus who previously slept with a porn actress who was diagnosed as HIV positive . The man who played Weiner, Xander Corvus, had previously had sex with Cameron Bay -  a porn actress whose recent HIV diagnosis brought the porn industry to an abrupt halt. The chain of events sparked fears that Leathers may have been exposed to the virus. Leathers said: 'I feel like it's my duty to stress the importance of using condoms.' She went on to advise that condom use is important not just while making porn but if people were thinking about 'having a one night stand in real life'. She added: 'Whether your partner is a porn star or not, you could be putting yourself at risk. You don't know who all they have been with.' Weiner's sexting partner said that she was not contacted about the possibility she may have been infected with HIV but that it was a 'very scary and surreal situation to be in'. She said: 'What's so crazy about this is that the . only time I've been sexually active in many months was during filming, . so just think, ONE sexual experience could put you in a scary situation. It's just worth it to protect yourself and your partner.' X-rated: Xander and Leathers (pictured above) starred in the porn film together, and Leathers said she did have 'some boundaries' when shooting the movie . The newly-minted porn star said that in hindsight she should have used a condom on the set of her film but that she felt safe because the 'porn industry is very good about testing'. Leathers said: 'I bet when you meet a new guy for the . first time he doesn't show you his clean STD test results. That's what's . different about the porn world.' However, she is now on a 'mission' to have the porn industry 'get on board' with using condoms. Leathers added: '...I just hope recent events can help . change some minds regarding this issue. If I can save even ONE girl from . going through what I've been dealing with, then I'd say my mission . isn't in vain. 'So in conclusion, just wrap it up. It's the smart thing to do.' Distraught: Cameron Bay's agent says his client, whose recent HIV diagnosis has brought the porn industry to a standstill, is 'distraught' over the news . Leathers also praised Cameron Bay for her bravery at coming forward to reveal her diagnosis. Bay's agent says his client is 'distraught' after her recent HIV diagnosis but that the 29-year-old . actress is cooperating with the industry trade organization in an . effort to ensure all her partners duly are informed of her status. ‘As . difficult as this news is for me,’ Bay said in a statement, ‘I am . hopeful that no other performers have been affected. I plan on doing . everything possible to assist the medical professionals and my fellow . performers.’ 'Cameron has been a model citizen . acting responsibly at this most difficult time,' said her agent Mark . Schechter. 'Her courage should be lauded.' But Bay admits she now has a long road ahead. 'My long-term plan is to take care of myself and my health,' she said. A recently retired porn performer described some of the struggles Bay will likely face. 'There's . no health insurance, there's no union; there really isn't a safety . net,' Aurora Snow told the LA Times. 'I feel really bad for her. It's . got to be really tough to get that kind of news.' Arrest: Cameron Bay seen in here in mugshots from some of her multiple arrests while in Arizona . Porn Star: Her arrests range from traffic violations to forgery and even assault . MailOnline . exclusively revealed Bay's criminal past this week. The performer's rap . sheet shows more than 17 charges to her name, some of which were . dismissed. She also spent more than a year in prison in Arizona in 2007. Her charges range from traffic violations to forgery and aggravated assault. Cameron Bay is not the porn star's real name. MailOnline knows her true identity, but has chosen not to print it. Cameron . has worked under names including Ashton and Ryder, but before she . embarked on a career in porn she appeared on VH1's Tool Academy in 2009. The . show centers around couples who are sent to relationship boot camp in . order to save their unions. The season ran for eight episodes, and . Cameron along with her boyfriend of 10 years, Clarence - who had . nicknamed himself 'Celebrity' - were eliminated in the third episode. Just . two years before her reality TV debut, Cameron spent a year and six . months in prison for an unknown offense in Arizona. She was released in May 2008. Her latest arrest came in February, where she was arrested for criminal damage and disorderly conduct. She was also arrested in October last year for criminal damage, disorderly conduct and interfering with judicial proceedings. While in August, she was arrested for failing to show her driving license or identification. Risk: Xander Corvus, left, who played Weiner in the movie with Sydney Leathers, had unprotected sex with Cameron Bay, right, a few weeks ago - who has just been told she has HIV . Cameron Bay spoke to Adult Video News to confirm she was the performer responsible for the moratorium on porn production. Cutting Edge Testing lab told Bay on Wednesday that a blood sample drawn the previous day came back positive for HIV. She told AVN that she was 'obviously extremely distraught and in . disbelief', and that an additional test will be conducted to confirm the . result. According to Bay, she received her last clean bill of health on July 27. Just days later she filmed an unprotected sex scene for a series called Public Disgrace. Her male partner was Xander Corvus. Gawker reports he and Leathers also had unprotected sex for the Vivid.com movie. In a statement to the site, Leathers . said both she and Xander got tested prior to shooting their scene, and . both were deemed 'healthy'. However, the presence of STDs sometimes does not come up in tests for up to three months after exposure. It . takes the body two-to-eight weeks to make antibodies against HIV - . known as the window period. Tests done immediately after the exposure or . within this window period may not detect the virus and give a false . negative result. The CDC . recommends that individuals who have been exposed to HIV and have been . found negative before three months have elapsed get retested after three . months. Leathers said in an earlier statement: 'I do not have HIV and have not been exposed to HIV regardless of the reports out there saying otherwise. 'I was not contacted by the Free Speech Coalition to re-test, I reached out to them to see if I should re-test and was told I did not need to. 'I took all the necessary precautions before and after my scene for Vivid and acted responsibly and therefore was able to protect myself from exposure to anything. 'As an added precaution I retested 2 days after my shoot and again yesterday and was negative.' Diane Duke, executive director of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, told the Associated Press in an e-mail about the HIV detection: 'The moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated. Virus: Cameron Bay, who has appeared in adult films since 2010, confirmed last night she was the performer responsible for the moratorium . 'In fact, since 2004 there have only been two cases of performers . testing positive for HIV and neither of those situations involved on-set . transmission,' Duke said. 'The current situation would bring the number . to three cases in nearly 10 years, not just in Los Angeles but . nationwide.' The industry briefly put a similar . moratorium in place last year after nearly a dozen performers were . infected during a syphilis outbreak. Word . of the latest moratorium quickly drew critical responses from porn . industry opponents. Among them was Michael Weinstein, whose group the . AIDS Healthcare Foundation successfully lobbied voters last year to . adopt an ordinance requiring actors use condoms in the making of most . porn films. 'How many adult film performers have to become infected with an array of preventable sexually transmitted diseases - including HIV, which is not curable - before the porn industry actually complies with the law requiring condom use,' he said in a statement. Since the ordinance's adoption, county officials have said they are investigating one violation. Assemblyman Isadore Hall III, who is pushing for the state to adopt a similar law, called Wednesday's news 'devastating and preventable.' 'Exposing workers to this type of harm would not be accepted in any other industry in this nation,' the Los Angeles Democrat said. The industry, which says its audience does not want to see condoms, is fighting the Los Angeles County measure in court.

A giant prehistoric amphibian once burrowed underground to become dormant when water was scarce, according to a new study. Metoposaurus diagnosticus weighed half a tonne and was 10 feet long, but its environment had only two seasons: wet and dry. The Metoposaurus needed water for its lifestyle, but researchers have discovered the extremely long dry season 230 million years ago drove the species to burrow underground and go dormant. Metoposaurus diagnosticus weighed half a tonne and was 10 feet long, but its environment had only two seasons: wet and dry. It needed water for its lifestyle, but researchers have discovered the extremely long dry season 230 million drove the species to burrow underground and go dormant . The burrowing behaviour of Metoposaurus was recently discovered by Dorota Konietzko-Meier, of the University of Opole in Poland and the University of Bonn in Germany, and Martin Sander, also of the University of Bonn. Their study, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, examined both the overall structure of the skeleton of Metoposaurus as well as the microscopic structure of its bones. The broad, flat head, broad flat arm bones, wide hands, and large tail of Metaposaurus diagnosticus led the investigators to conclude that this species swam in lakes during the wet season. The broad, flat head (pictured), broad flat arm bones, wide hands, and large tail of Metaposaurus diagnosticus led the investigators to conclude that this species swam in lakes during the wet season . The Metoposaurus diagnosticus was thought to be a mostly aquatic animal. It had small limbs, sharp teeth and a large flat head. Its diet was mainly fish which it captured with its wide jaws lined. Metoposaurus could reach up to 3m (10 feet) long, weighed 454 kg and was one of the last large amphibians. Many Metoposaurus mass graves have been found. Researchers believe this was probably from creatures that grouped together in drying pools during drought. They also believe it used its broad, flat head and forearms to burrow under the ground when the dry season began. The conclusions were made following a study of cross-sections of Metoposaurus bones which have growth rings, called annuli. These annuli are similar to tree rings, where a band of light and a band of dark indicate one year of growth. In other early amphibians one annulus usually consists of a broad zone of rapid growth that indicates a wet season, followed by a thin band of slow growth, indicating a dry season. But in Metoposaurus, a period of prolonged slow growth was followed by a cessation of growth during the dry season. The study examined a cross-sections of Metoposaurus bones which have growth rings, called annuli. The above image shows annuli in femur samples of metoposaurus diagnosticus. A thick inner phase of fast growth is marked by zI and a broad phase of slow growth can be seen in the middle left image (a1) ‘The histology of Metoposaurus long bones seems to be unique,’ said lead author Doctor Konietzo-Meier. ‘In our interpretation it corresponds to the two-seasonal climate with a short, more favourable wet season and a long dry part of the year when life conditions were worse.’ Dr Michel Lauri, from the Musium National d'Histoire Naturelle who was not involved with this study said: ‘This interpretation is interesting, but problematic in some respects. ‘This animal was much larger than any extant burrowing species I know of, and if it dug, I suspect that the snout and tail played a far greater role than the limbs, as we observe in most extant aquatic vertebrates.’ Dr Michel Lauri, from the Musium National d'Histoire Naturelle said: 'This animal was much larger than any extant burrowing species I know of, and if it dug, I suspect that the snout (pictured) and tail played a far greater role than the limbs, as we observe in most extant aquatic vertebrates' The annuli also give an estimate of age. Co-author Dr Sander said: ‘A common problem with these large amphibians is that you can't tell from the shape of their bones if they are grown or not; sometimes the youngsters get described as a different species from the grown-ups.’ All of the specimens preserved at Krasiejsw in modern day Poland were juveniles.  The smallest specimen was only one-year-old, while the largest specimen was four. Adulthood in these large amphibians was usually reached around year seven. The researchers do not know if this mode of life was unique to juveniles or if adults also burrowed. Dr Sander added: ‘It amazes me time and again how much we can learn from these extinct animals. ‘The techniques we used have been around since the 1840s, but only in the last 20 years have researchers asked the right questions and drawn comparisons with living animals.’","Metoposaurus diagnosticus' burrowing behaviour was previously unknown .

Murdered: Lee Erdmann was shot dead in front of 30 people at his local pub but none of the witnesses would identify the killer . A coroner has condemned a wall of silence protecting a vicious killer after a father was shot dead in a busy pub in front of up to 30 customers. Gym instructor Lee Erdmann, 37, was sat at the bar mourning the loss of his baby daughter to cot death when another regular he had been talking to calmly pulled out a gun and shot him in the back at point blank range. As Mr Erdmann collapsed to the floor the gunman then shot him again in the body with a .38 calibre revolver before repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head as he lay dying from his wounds. Up to 30 drinkers at a 3am lock-in witnessed the shooting of the father-of-four at the Wellington pub in Salford, Greater Manchester. Some rushed him to hospital in a car but he was pronounced dead later from 'catastrophic' injuries. Police interviewed all who saw the shooting but despite a £50,000 olive branch and offers of being placed in witness protection programmes, all were too frightened to identify the killer and the crime remains unsolved. Six men were arrested and released without charge. At an inquest Bolton coroner Jennifer Leeming criticised the lack of cooperation from witnesses as she recorded a verdict of unlawful killing/ . 'Lots of people know what happened and who was responsible but those people are not giving evidence because they are frightened,' said Mrs Leeming. Addressing the victim’s mother Pat, she added: 'I understand fear - I am sure you can too. But we would both also salute courage.

It is thought on the night he was shot dead he had gone out for a drink with friends as he couldn’t sleep. Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick who is leading the investigation into the murder told the hearing: 'At 1.45am Lee got a taxi to the Wellington. He had initially gone home attempting to stay there but due to his feelings didn’t feel he could stay in the house. 'He knew there was an old school disco night on at the Wellington so it would be open. He arrived at the back door at 2am. A police officer saw him.

'My friend came to pick me up and brought me a block of chocolate to cheer me - you know it’s bad when even chocolate doesn’t make the situation any better.' Despite the torments Nichole returned to work the following day, determined not to let the bullying get her down. But later in the week she woke up with serious stomach pains and was diagnosed with a bladder infection. 'The doctors told me I’d only need a week off work, but I didn’t get any better. I had stomach pains, no energy, dizziness, cold and hot sweats - it went on for over a month. I went back to the doctors several times and had blood test and various diagnoses. 'I was eventually diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I cried the entire car journey home. I felt so stupid, humiliated, petty and weak. 'For weeks I couldn’t tell any what was wrong, but when I eventually told a few friends they were really understanding and supportive. 'But it was my mum who was my rock. It must have been awful for her to hear how her daughter planned on killing herself, and I’ll never forgive myself for that.' Proud: Nichole with her parents shortly after triumphing at the Miss Bristol and Avon beauty pageant . Better: Nichole now wants to become a role model and to help raise awareness of mental health issues . After leaving the council and her bullying colleagues, Nichole got a new part time job but it wasn't until October last year that everything changed for the better. When out shopping in Bristol, Nichole was approached by scouts for the Miss Bristol and Avon beauty pageant. 'My sister and friends persuaded me to hand over my email address so they could send over the details,' said Nichole. 'I thought about it for some time - how could I ever be confident enough to put myself up on stage and be judged on how I looked? 'But then I thought, my life has been ruined, I need to challenge myself and inspire others. I made it through to the final and went on to win the Miss Popularity crown, as well as doing a lot of charity work. It boosted my almost non-existent confidence no end.' Since then Nichole has represented Gloucestershire in the Dream Street Beauty UK finals and has been selected to compete in the London heats for the Face of the Globe pageant. Nichole said: 'I want to be a role model and talk to people about mental illnesses. They simply don’t get the attention they desperately need. 'If I can inspire just one person to turn their life around then everything I’m doing will be worth it. I still have bad days and struggle, but then I think what I have achieved. 'In a strange way I am grateful for what happened to me as now I can use it to help others.'

A Tennessee newspaper editor has been fired after writing a headline critical of President Obama. Drew Johnson's editorial, titled, 'Take your jobs plan and shove it, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough,' was published in the Chattanooga Times Free Press earlier this week when Obama visited the city. The timing of the column gave it a national audience it might not otherwise have had. As a result, it went viral online and Johnson,  the editor of the Times Free Press editorial page, has since been let go. Drew Johnson says he was fired from his job as an editor for the Chattanooga Times Free Press for writing an anti-Obama headline on an editorial . The newspaper said it fired Johnson for violating a policy requiring that last-minute changes to headlines be approved by upper management. In a statement published to its website on Friday, the paper stated: 'On Monday night, Johnson changed the . approved headline on his Tuesday editorial from, “Keep your jobs plan to . yourself, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough . already” to “Take your jobs plan and shove it, Mr. President: Your . policies have harmed Chattanooga enough.” 'However, he waited . until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline,' the statement continued. 'That . is a violation of our clear editing practice, and our trust. He . admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for . him.' Johnson claims that the editing policy was implemented after his piece was published earlier this week. He says the real reason he was fired was because of pressure on his bosses from Obama's supporters. '[The editor] said that she was disappointed in the headline, that she thought it was crass and she'd gotten a lot of complaints by Obama supporters,' he said in an interview with Fox News. 'Today I come into work and am told that I'm fired for violating that policy that wasn't put in place until the day after I wrote the piece.' The newspaper said it fired Johnson for 'placing a headline on an editorial outside of normal editing procedures' Johnson said he feels 'confident' that if the headline had referenced former President George W. Bush rather than Obama, that he would still have a job. He also pointed out that his headline was not changed online for several hours after the editorial was published to the paper's website. 'I just became the first person in the history of newspapers to be fired for writing a paper's most-read article,' he tweeted. The paper pushed back against Johnson's claims that his editors bowed to political pressure. 'Johnson’s firing was not about yielding . to political pressure,' the paper said in its statement published online, which was not attributed to a specific person. 'He was not fired for writing an editorial . criticizing President Barack Obama. The body of the editorial was . approved for publication; only the headline was changed.' In a clear dig at Johnson, the paper added: 'The only instance when the Times Free Press ever denied Johnson the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a “miracle product” and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy.' This statement was published to the Chattanooga Times Free Press website on Friday: . Contrary to statements made by former Free Press editor Drew Johnson and national media reports, Johnson was told on multiple prior occasions not to make material changes to editorials or headlines once they were approved by the editor responsible for the page. On Monday night, Johnson changed the approved headline on his Tuesday editorial from, “Keep your jobs plan to yourself, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough already” to “Take your jobs plan and shove it, Mr. President: Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough.” However, he waited until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline. That is a violation of our clear editing practice, and our trust. He admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for him. The language he chose was vulgar and not appropriate for this newspaper. Even Johnson himself admitted that the headline was “harsh and perhaps crass to a fault” in an editorial he wrote for this Sunday, which will not run. Johnson’s firing was not about yielding to political pressure. He was not fired for writing an editorial criticizing President Barack Obama. The body of the editorial was approved for publication; only the headline was changed. The newspaper has allowed Johnson to write his opinions freely and without censorship during the time he worked here – even when he wrote about very controversial topics that many readers complained about. In the past year we have printed at least 46 editorials critical of Obama on the Free Press page. In fact the only instance when the Times Free Press ever denied Johnson the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a “miracle product” and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy. The Times Free Press values having two editorial pages to express both conservative and liberal views. We encourage differing viewpoints and dissent, we believe having competing views makes community stronger. We expect those debates to be respectful.

The mother of a 10-year-old boy who has been missing since 2010 has claimed that a search held at the weekend unearthed 'a lot of things and possibly evidence'. Desiree Young said that she organized the search in Multnomah County, Oregon to look for any clues to the whereabouts of her son, Kyron Horman, who failed to turn up to classes more than three years ago. She said that the two-day search, which was carried out by 60 volunteers, two non-profits and 10 search dogs, was successful but she would not be specific about exactly what they found, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. The items were handed over to the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office and officers are now looking into whether they hold any significance to the case. New clues? Desiree Young, left, speaks out during a new search for her missing son, Kyron Horman, right, at the weekend. She has said that the search possibly turned up new evidence in the hunt for the boy . 'We're not going to find Kyron if we're not searching,' she told KPTV. Kyron was seven-years-old when he went missing from Skyline School on June 4, 2010, and the spotlight fell on his stepmother Terri Horman, who was the last person to see him, but no arrests have been made in the case. According to local news reports at . the time of his disappearance, Horman took her stepson to a science fair . at the school that Friday morning and snapped a photo of him next to his entry. Horman saw Kyron walking to his classroom before leaving, local police reports said. But Kyron's teacher didn’t see him at the 10am start of class, and marked him as absent. His . parents were alarmed when Kyron didn't get off the school bus that . afternoon, and called the school which then called 911 to report . the boy missing. Fresh search: Young would not detail what was found during the search, citing the criminal investigation . Hunt: Around 60 volunteers and two nonprofits helped during the search on Saturday and Sunday . Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, sought a restraining order against Terri when sheriff’s investigators told Kaine that his wife had tried to hire someone to kill him in the months before Kyron disappeared. Kyron's mother also filed a civil lawsuit against Terri, demanding she reveal where the boy or his body is, but it was dropped in July, . Young filed the $10 million suit against Terri Horman last year, alleging the stepmother kidnapped Kyron, but she dropped the case, saying it couldn't move forward without information the police won't release because of the ongoing criminal investigation into the boy's disappearance. Despite dropped the case, she said she has never given up hope that he will be found alive. 'Every . day you are not here safe in my arms is another day of agonizing . torture,' she said at a press conference in Portland in July. 'I will . find you. It's all I want. I will not stop. I will never stop.' Unanswered question: Terri Horman, left, the stepmother of Kyron was the last to see him and was named the 'prime suspect' by a judge in a civil case last August, which has now been dropped .

Heartbreak: Young is pictured with her lawyer earlier this year after dropping her civil case against Horman . Horman hasn't commented on Young's allegation, but the desperate mother urged her to cooperate. 'I'm still going to bring pressure on Terri. I'm not going away,' Young said. Another twist in the case . involves DeDe Spicher, a friend of Terri Horman who has testified before . the grand jury. Spicher's whereabouts were in question the day . Kyron vanished. After Kyron disappeared, authorities searched the condo Spicher was working at on June 4 and investigators also put out a flier with Spicher's photos on it, . asking if anyone noticed her or Terri Horman between 9:45 a.m. and 1 . p.m. on June 4, 2010. But . Spicher refused to answer 142 questions related to his disappearance, . pleading the Fifth Amendment and refusing to identify a picture of her friend, whether she knew her husband and if she had ever met Kyron. Happier times: Young, who said she will never stop searching, smiles and holds her son on the beach . Playtime: A family photo shows a smiling Kyron enjoying the playground .

Court . documents say she was at work but left abruptly at 11.30 a.m. and . returned 90 minutes later. She has declined to say what she did during that . time. Ms Young has accused Horman of knowing what happened to her son, telling the East Idaho News: 'I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is.

She . said: 'We've racked our brains trying to think of reasons why. We . cannot come up with anything. It's like a portal opened up in the school . and Kyron just vanished into it. It's a mystery.'

A teenage boy has become the tenth generation of his family to become a fishermen - continuing a tradition going back 350 years. Levi Miller, whose ancestors have fished off the Dorset coasts since the 1670s, is ensuring the survival of his family’s seafaring past by taking a full-time job on his father's fishing boat. The 16-year-old, who lives with his family in the picturesque fishing village of Lulworth Cove, has just finished school and says that hauling fish in alongside his father is his dream job. Scroll down for video . Levi Miller, 16, is now the tenth generation of his family to become a fisherman in Lulworth Cove, Dorset . Long line: Levi, seen here in his boat Near Enough, is part of a family business that began in 1678 . Family firm: Levis as a child with his father Joe, left, and his ancestor Henry Miller with wife Jane in the 1800s . Levi began fishing as a child, since when he has been counting down the days until he could play his own part in the family fishing dynasty. He says he is proud of continuing the family’s historic line. 'I just love being out on the water, it’s in my blood,' Levi said.  'I have wanted to be a fisherman for as long as I can remember. 'My dad used to take me out on the boat fishing for mackerel when I was just a youngster and I was hooked. 'As I got older I started going out more and more, helping to steer the boat and get the nets in.  I couldn’t wait to finish school so that I could spend more time on the boat.' Levi will help his father catch mackerel on lines, lobsters and crabs in pots and bigger fish in nets, and the catch will be sold fresh at their family shop. In the blood: Levi with his mother, Chris, and father, Joe, at the family fish shop in Lulworth Cove, Dorset . Levi's great great grandfather Edwin, left, making lobster pots, and great great great grandfather, Joseph, right . Charles Miller, Levi's great grandfather, put an old Ford engine in his boat and was the first in Lulworth to have a motorboat . Levi's late grandfather Jim Miller, who was born in 1922, was the eighth generation of fishermen in the family . He added: 'I’m really proud to be carrying on the family tradition, and I’d like to think that one day I will have a family who will grow up to be fishermen too. 'My job is a bit different but my mates think it’s pretty cool and they often come out with us fishing for mackerel.' Levi lives with his father Joe, 53, mother Christine, 44, and sisters Sophie, 22, and Becci, 19 four miles down the road from the village of Tyneham. Ancestor Henry Miller started up a small fishing business in the neighbouring village of Tyneham in 1678. Strong family tradition: Charles Miller, on the left pictured at Lulworth, and his son Jim, Levi's grandfather . Beats the office: The Miller fishing business is run from Lulworth Cove, a picturesque Dorset coastal village . Fresh from the sea: A young Levi gets to grips with a ray, left, while his mother Christine has two lobsters . He handed it on to his son John in the 18th century and after him came his son, also called John. Henry then took over the trade at the turn of the 19th century and he was followed by Joseph and Edwin. Charles was the first Miller to go to sea in a motor-powered boat after he installed an old Ford car engine on it in the late 1920s. Jim succeeded him and Joe became a fisherman 37 years ago. Joe’s daughter Becci had planned to become the family’s first fisherwoman but chose a career in hairdressing instead. Joe has now been joined by Levi and the pair spend their days on their 19ft fishing boat Near Enough. Levi's grandfather Jim look happy out at sea with a seagull on his head .

Joe Miller 1960- . Levi Miller 1997- . At 5.30am they begin laying crab and lobster pots on the seabed and in the afternoon they use large nets to catch mackerel, tuna and a variety of flat fish. Levi added: 'We’re out seven days a week if the weather allows - it means an early start and long days but I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.' Joe Miller said: 'In terms of the methods used, the only thing that has changed from 1678 is we have an engine on the back of the boat where they had sails and oars. 'My grandfather was the first person to put an engine on a boat in Lulworth Cove, using one he had taken out of a car. 'The fishing techniques are still the same - simple pots, nets and lines. Levi, pictured left mending lobster pots like his ancestors before him, is delighted to have joined his father Joe . Father and son: Joe and Levi Miller hope they have many happy years of fishing together ahead of them . 'Lobster was the mainstay back then, although they would also get white fish like cod, sole and plaice. 'They could earn enough money to only have to fish during the summer but for us it's 24/7. 'The industry itself is going full circle. 'My grandfather would fish the same waters in the 30s and they would pull up four or five lobster in each pot, and it would only be him out there. 'My father and I saw that change as more and more people got into fishing - we've seen a lot come but we've also seen a lot disappear. 'Fish stocks locally are around about where they were back in my grandfather's time. 'The fleet has shrunk so much because of regulations and quotas that we no longer feel pressure from trawlers out in the Channel. 'It's not an easy job but it's our life and we are carrying on a simple family tradition. 'There's still a hardcore few fishing these waters and we're in it for the long haul.'","Levi Miller, 16, has joined family fishing business in Lulworth Cove, Dorset .

Skype is developing 3D video calls that could eventually allow workers to send 'body doubles' to meetings.

Mark Gillett, corporate vice-president for Skype, said teams have been working with state-of-the-art tools that capture 3D footage. Skype is developing 3D video calls that could eventually allow workers to send body doubles to meetings . 'We have it in the lab, we know how to make it work and we're looking at the ecosystem of devices and their capability to support it in order to make a decision when we might think about bringing something like that to market,' he told the BBC. Skype, which is owned by Microsoft and marks its 10th anniversary today, hinted at its plans in April when it released an advertisement telling viewers it was searching for a way to create 'body doubles' for workers unable to travel to meetings. Its forays into 3D technology were confirmed as the format appeared to founder in other areas. The BBC's head of 3D announced last month that there were no further plans to use the technology following a two-year trial. It ran a pilot scheme in which it televised a number of programmes in 3D including Strictly Come Dancing and the ceremonies for the Olympics last year. Since its launch, Skype has clocked up more than 1.4 trillion minutes of voice and video calls, which is the equivalent of over 2.6 million years of conversations, made in just a decade . But while an estimated 1.5 million homes have TV sets that can run the technology, only around half of the homes which could watch London 2012 in 3D did so. The broadcaster said the concept had not taken off with the public and many viewers found it a hassle at home. In the past decade, millions of people have used Skype to make video calls from locations around the world, from the top of Mount Everest to research stations in Antarctica as well as proving support to refugee camps and allowing endangered orangutans to enjoy calls.

A newly discovered species of shark that 'walks' along the sea floor to hunt for its next meal, has been discovered by scientists . The shark, which is harmless to humans, grows up to 27 inches in length and two specimens, which differed slightly in colour, were spotted hugging the sea floor to search for small fish and invertebrates to feast on at night. A video captured the creature's unusual hunting habits at the Weda Resort on one of the Maluku Islands. Mark Erdmann, a coral reef ecologist and marine conservationist, filmed the shark on the small island of Halmahera and said his team were very excited at the discovery. He said: 'Local indigenous communities have been aware of the shark for many generations - but it only came to the attention of science once diving began to take off in the region. It has been named hemiscyllium halmahera after the group of sharks it is closely related to and also the place it was found, the eastern Maluku island of Halmahera . 'Walking sharks are an excellent ambassador for marine conservation and for the conservation of sharks in general. Dr Gerard Allen, a biologist at Conservation International, led the team that found the fish, whose research is published in the International Journal of Ichthyology. Its unusual wriggling 'walking' action could help scientists understand how some of the first animals evolved from living in the sea to walking on land. Before now similar types of shark had been confined to the island of New Guinea and northern Australia and scientists from Indonesia and Australia are now working to find a connection between the species. It is thought the species could help save the shark population in the area. Indonesia is well known for exporting shark fins as food or medicine but this discovery comes alongside an announcement by the government to increase marine tourism and conservation. Mark Erdmann, a coral reef ecologist and marine conservationist, filmed the shark on the small island of Halmahera and said his team were very excited at the discovery. He said local indigenous communities have been aware of the shark for many generations but it has only just been spotted by scientists . Angus Dermawan, director of the Marine Conservation Directorate of the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, said: 'There is a growing awareness in our country of the important ecological role that sharks play in maintaining healthy fish stocks and especially in the tremendous economic potential of shark-focused marine tourism.' The shark is very distinctive with its leopard spot pattern together with the darker spots that collect under its 'chin'. Mark Erdmann, who grew up in South Carolina, USA, but has lived in Indonesia for 21 years, thinks this species will help in an important step by the government. He said: 'The local government of Halmahera is now very hopeful that this finding will further promote marine tourism to the area as a sustainable economic alternative to destructive fishing.' The discovery of the animal (pictured) coincides with a move by the Indonesian government to protect sharks and increase marine tourism and conservation .","Scientists found the newly discovered species off the coast of Indonesia although local indigenous people were already aware of its hunting habits .

It's always nice to get a 'like' when you post a status or photograph on Facebook, but research has revealed that the brains of those who use the social networking site the most are more affected by the feedback they receive than less regular users. Scientists have discovered that reward circuits in the brain linked to food, money, sex and reputation can predict how likely a person is to use Facebook. Researchers found that those whose nucleus accumbens in the brain responded most strongly to positive feedback were the same people who used the social networking site most intently. Reward circuits in the brain linked to food, money, sex and reputation can predict how likely a person is to use Facebook, according to a new study . The nucleus accumbens is a ‘small but critical’ part of the brain which processes rewards. Dr Dar Meshi, of Germany’s Freie University, looked at the activity in this part of the brain in 31 people and compared the results to the people’s Facebook usage. Dr Meshi said: ‘As human beings, we evolved to care about our reputation. In today’s world, one way we’re able to manage our reputation is by using social media websites like Facebook.’ Facebook was chosen for the study because interactions on the website are carried out in view of the user’s friends, and the public, and can affect their reputation. People whose nucleus accumbens structure in the brain responds most strongly to positive feedback are most likely to use Facebook intently . ‘Liking’ someone is positive social feedback, and can be considered related to their reputation. Participants completed a questionnaire to show how many friends they had and how many minutes they spent on Facebook. They also participated in a video interview, and were then told whether people thought highly of them. Researchers recorded functional neuroimaging (fMRI) of the participants’ brains during these procedures. Results showed that participants who received positive feedback about themselves produced stronger activation of the nucleus accumbens than when they saw the positive feedback that another person received. The strength of this difference corresponded to participants’ reported intensity of Facebook use. Dr Meshi said: ‘Our study reveals that the processing of social gains in reputation in the left nucleus accumbens predicts the intensity of Facebook use across individuals. ‘These findings expand upon our present knowledge of nucleus accumbens function as it relates to complex human behaviour.’ Dr Meshi said it was not known if the results showed that positive social feedback drives people to interact on social media, or if sustained use of social media changes the way positive social feedback is processed by the brain. The report was published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.","Reward circuits in the brain predict how likely a person is to use Facebook .

This dazzling array of diamonds and precious jewels is among a cache worth £90million stolen at gunpoint from a display in Cannes. The jewels  - belonging to the Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev -  were on show at the same Cannes hotel featured in Alfred Hitchcock's 'To Catch a Thief' when a single gunman walked in to the ground floor show, threatened the handful of unarmed guards, and then disappeared down a side street with the loot, on July 28. An affiliate of Lloyds of London has today released the images as it has announced it will offer a 1 million euro ($1.3 million) reward for information leading . to the diamond collection. They include a huge heart-shaped diamond pendant totalling 23.14 carats and handcrafted in platinum, two diamond-encrusted rings and an Art Deco style emerald and diamond necklace totalling 127.26 carats, hand crafted in platinum and 18 karat gold. A teardrop choker featuring hundreds of radiant cut white diamonds, which was part of an astonishing haul of jewels taken during a heist in Cannes . An intricate diamond and emerald bead necklace totalling 127.26 carats, hand crafted in platinum and 18 karat gold. It is part of the Extraordinary Diamonds Collection belonging to the Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev . The pieces taken include a heart shaped white diamond pendant, totalling 23.14 carats and handcrafted in platinum . It has been reported that 72 pieces were stolen, with 34 items deemed 'exceptional.' It has been said that the thief lost some of the pieces while fleeing. It includes these six extravagant and ornate items, including chokers, rings and pendants featuring hundreds of radiant-cut white diamonds, emeralds and 'fancy coloured diamonds'. The pieces taken include a heart shaped white diamond pendant, totalling 23.14 carats and handcrafted in platinum, and an intricate diamond and emerald bead necklace totalling 127.26 carats, hand crafted in platinum and 18 karat gold. The robber is said to have tipped the diamonds and other precious stone  into a briefcase during the raid in broad daylight at the Carlton in Cannes, said to be a favourite haunt of Hollywood’s biggest film stars. The robber is said to have made off on foot through the exclusive Promenade de la Croisette. The raid, on July 28, ranks among the largest jewel heists in history. Organised gangs frequently target boutiques and hotels in and around Cannes.  In May, jewellery worth £1million was stolen from a hotel safe during the annual Cannes Film Festival. Two of the jewel encrusted rings taken in the raid at the Carlton in Cannes. Both feature radiant cut white and vivid blue diamonds set in platinum . The robber is said to have tipped the diamonds and other precious stones (including this ornate radiant cut diamond brooch) into a briefcase during the raid in broad daylight . An unnamed American woman working for Chopard, the Swiss jeweller and festival sponsor, was keeping the items in her second-floor room at the Cannes Novotel. Chopard had 40 staff at Cannes who tried to persuade stars to wear its products. Among the a listers seen wearing Chopard pieces this year were Julianne Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne. A few days later a necklace worth £1.6million vanished after a festival party in the neighbouring resort town of Cap d’Antibes. The 343-room InterContinental Carlton is a favourite of the stars, and is considered the ‘celebrity HQ’ during the film festival. In August 1994, three men firing machine guns burst into the Carlton and robbed its jewellery store. Later, it was discovered the gang were firing blanks. There have been several high-profile jewellery thefts in Europe this year, including one at Brussels airport in February which saw £32million worth of diamonds taken. Police cars parked outside the Carlton Hotel on July 28, 2013 in the French Riviera resort of Cannes, after an armed man held up the jewellery exhibition 'Extraordinary diamonds' The lone gunman managed to evade security and escape with a briefcase containing the valuable jewellery on foot . Rewards for information leading to stolen jewellery have lead to success in the past. In 2008, a $1 million reward was offered for information about a $105 million jewel heist from the Harry Winston store in Paris which resulted in more than half the stolen pieces being recovered. Vashi Dominguez, a diamond expert based in London's Hatton Garden, told the Telegraph there is a two to three day window in whcih the diamonds can be traced before they disappear forever, adding: 'They will be swiftly cut, polished and turned into something different. It's easily done if the thieves have the right connections.'","An affiliate of Lloyds of London today released the images as it announces it will offer a 1 million euro reward .

The girl allegedly raped by Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell showed no signs of injury during physical examination, a medical expert said yesterday. The girl claims she was raped at the age of six, nine and ten during years of abuse at the hands of the star. But Louise O’Connor said her intimate examination of the alleged victim found no evidence of injury that could be directly attributed to a sexual assault or rape. The doctor added: ‘Having no injuries certainly does not negate any of those allegations – a significant number of children and young people who make allegations of assault and come to us to be examined will not have any injuries.’ Le Vell denies 12 charges of rape, indecent assault and sexual  activity involving a minor. The 48-year-old, who has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 soap opera for 30 years, was charged under his real name of Michael Turner. The jury at Manchester Crown Court was told the physical examination took place two years after the last alleged sexual assault.

Nasa's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument abroad India's Chandrayaan-1 lunar spacecraft (pictured) discovered the magmatic water . A spacecraft has spotted evidence of water on the surface of the moon, which scientists believe hints at a secret source buried deep in the rocky body's interior. 'Magmatic water' - liquid that originates from within the moon's interior - was detected by Nasa's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument aboard the Indian Space Research Organization's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft for the first time from lunar orbit. The find confirms analyses performed recently on moon rocks brought to Earth by Apollo astronauts four decades ago, researchers said. Scientists hope the discovery could help them understand how the moon was formed. The M3 instrument discovered evidence of magmatic water locked in mineral grains on the surface of the moon, having imaged the lunar impact crater Bullialdus, which lies near the lunar equator. Nasa scientists chose to study this area in particular because they could better quantify the . amount of water inside the rocks due to the crater's location and the . type of rocks it holds. The central peak of the crater is made up . of a type of rock that forms deep within the lunar crust and mantle . when magma is trapped underground, according to the study, which is published in Nature Geoscience. 'This rock, which normally resides deep beneath the surface, was excavated from the lunar depths by the impact that formed Bullialdus crater,' said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. The M3 instrument discovered evidence of magmatic water locked in mineral grains on the surface of the moon, having imaged the lunar impact crater Bullialdus (pictured) which lies near the lunar equator . 'Compared to its surroundings, we found that the central portion of this crater contains a significant amount of hydroxyl - a molecule consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom - which is evidence that the rocks in this crater contain water that originated beneath the lunar surface,' she said. In 2009, M3 provided the first mineralogical map of the lunar surface and discovered water molecules in the polar regions of the moon, thought to be a a thin layer that formed from a solar wind hitting the moon's surface. However, Bullialdus crater is in a region with an unfavorable environment for solar wind to produce significant amounts of water on the surface. Simon Pete Worden, centre director at Nasa's Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field, California, said: 'Nasa . missions like Lunar Prospector and the Lunar Crater Observation and . Sensing Satellite and instruments like M3 have gathered crucial data . that fundamentally changed our understanding of whether water exists on . the surface of the moon.' In 2009, M3 provided the first mineralogical map of the lunar surface (pictured) and discovered water molecules in the polar regions of the moon, thought to be a a thin layer that formed from a solar wind hitting the moon's surface . The detection of internal water from orbit means scientists can begin to test some of the findings from sample studies in a broader context, including in regions that are far from where the Apollo sites are clustered on the near side of the moon. For many years, researchers believed that the rocks from the moon were bone-dry and any water detected in the Apollo samples had to be contamination from Earth. Dr Kilma said: 'Now that we have detected water that is likely from the interior of the moon, we can start to compare this water with other characteristics of the lunar surface. 'This internal magmatic water also provides clues about the moon's volcanic processes and internal composition, which helps us address questions about how the moon formed and how magmatic processes changed as it cooled.'","Nasa's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument aboard the Indian Space Research Organization's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft detected the water .

A San Francisco strip club that billed itself as the world's only worker-owned, co-op peep show closed its doors for good in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The venerable Lusty Lady first opened on Kearny Street in the Broadway strip club district of . North Beach in the 1970s. It went on to become the only strip club to successfully become unionized and the first to function as a stripper-run co-operative before announcing two weeks ago that it was being forced to close its doors after its landlord refused to re-sign the lease. Last dance: An exotic dancer performs outside a bar window on Columbus Avenue during a funeral procession to symbolize the closure of Lusty Lady strip club in San Francisco on Monday evening . Employees carried a coffin-shaped box during a funeral procession to symbolize the closure of the strip club earlier this week . Two exotic dancer embrace as the Lusty Lady strip club in San Francisco closes after its landlord refused to negotiate on a lower rent . In 1996 the Lusty Lady became the first - and only - strip club to . successfully become unionized. It also became the first to function as a . stripper-run co-operative after the dancers bought the club in 2003. The club was the second opened by two business associates, the first being Lusty Lady in Seattle, which closed in 2010 citing the financial climate and the online pornography industry for its closure. Originally, the clubs showed 16mm peep show films, but in 1983 live nude dancers were introduced. In 1997, following several grievances, the Lusty Lady became the only successfully unionized sex business in America. A group of exotic dancers perform on the street during a funeral procession to symbolize the closure of the U.S.'s first and only unionized, employee-owned strip club . Exotic dancers hug after participating on the final night of the legendary club which became the only successfully unionized sex business in America . Its dancers, nicknamed Lusties, differ from the usual blonde, pneumatic and tanned women in mainstream strip-joints and are known for their unusual monikers such as Fortune Cookie and Kitty McMuffin. After its owners decided to close the business, the club's workers bought the club for $400,000 in 2003. The club's landlord was Roger Forbes, a . strip-joint magnate who was also a partner in Déjà Vu, a company that . owns most of the adult theaters and clubs in San Francisco. He acquired the building housing the Lusty Lady in 2001 and more than doubled its rent. Forbes, 71, had denied that he was evicting the Lusty Lady because it was a competitor to his other businesses, which number eight strip clubs just in the Lusty Lady's North Beach neighborhood, and instead claimed it was because of a default on rent. 'If I was concerned about [the competition], I’ve had that building . fifteen years now, I could have found a way not to extend their lease . for the last ten,' he told The New York Times. The venerable Lusty Lady first opened on Kearny Street in the Broadway strip club district of North Beach in the 1970s . Employee shake hands as the Lusty Lady strip club prepares for closure in the early hours of Tuesday morning . The Lusties disagreed, saying, 'You can say it was because you’re delinquent on rent… but the truth is . that there’s $80,000 that walks through this door every . month that, once you close, is likely going to go to one of [Forbes’s] . other establishments in the neighborhood,' said Scott 'Big Red' Farrell, the Lusty Lady’s general manager. One Lusty Lady worker, identified only as Tora, was more direct: 'Our landlord is a dildo and didn’t want to . negotiate,' she told The New York Times. Unlike the dancers at Forbes' clubs who actually pay the club for their stage time and work as independent contractors, the Lusties belong to the Service Employees International Union and earn hourly wages and overtime. Forbes business partner is Harry . Mohney, known as the 'Howard Hughes of Porn'. According to SFGate, Mohney, Forbes and their companies have recently been named in a federal lawsuit that alleges the 'leases' they force their lap dancers to sign for their stage time are a scam designed to avoid their legal responsibility to pay minimum wage and employment taxes. People congregate outside the Lusty Lady strip club on Monday - the last ever evening for the local institution forced to close . Michael Jackson impersonators dance in the entrance lobby of the Lusty Lady strip club on its final night . 'Mohney and Forbes have created an elaborate scheme of corporations, business entities, trusts, straw men, consulting agreements and licensing agreements, all for the specific purpose of concealing their ownership, operation or control of these clubs, and avoid compliance with various federal and state labor laws,' said the suit, filed in April on behalf of five Déjà Vu dancers. Many see this latest closure of a San Francisco institution as a sign the city is losing the eclectic small businesses and liberal attitude that has made it so culturally rich. A message on the Lusty Lady Facebook page reads: . 'Dear Ladies and Friends in the Community, . It is with shaking hands & tear stained cheeks that I write to say, we just heard from our land lord, they will NOT agree to a new lease, they are closing our doors. They have given us just TWO WEEKS. WE CLOSE OUR DOORS AND SAY GOODBYE on 9/2/13 . Please help us spread the word, and make it a glorious & glamorous two weeks! Thank you so much for all the love and support over the years! - The Lusties' Participants hold up umbrellas during a funeral procession to symbolize the closure of Lusty Lady strip club . Originally, the clubs showed 16mm peep show films, but in 1983 live nude dancers were introduced . The two Lusty Lady strip clubs spawned numerous books, articles and film references. Lily Burana, who worked in the San Francisco Lusty Lady documented her experiences there in the 2001 book Strip City: A Stripper's Farewell Journey Across America. Another Lusty Lady alumnus Carol Queen, pHD, also wrote about the club in Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of a Sex-Positive Culture. She told blogger Vanessa L. Pinto: 'When I began there in 1990, it already had a reputation of hiring interesting, edgy women who would not necessarily have fit at other clubs.  We had punks, dykes, women’s studies majors plus one sexology grad student, me.' A worker at the club, named Prince$$ told The New York Times that if people want to keep their small local strip clubs, they should support them financially. 'I tell people, if there’s a local place they love, hollah with a dollah. You can’t pay the rent with Facebook likes,' she said. An employee holds a coffin-shaped box during a funeral procession to symbolize the closure of Lusty Lady strip club in San Francisco . Lusty Lady workers once described the worker-owned strip club business model as 'a rare and ideal situation' but 'not without its challenges,' but it seems the club couldn't overcome its biggest challenge, rising rents and increasing homogenization that has touched even the stripping industry. Dancer Courtney Crimson told Vanessa L. Pinto that even though the club is closing, the ideals it embraced will live on.

The U.S government topped the list, requesting information on 21,000 users, while India asked for data on 4,144 users in second place, and Britain came in third with 2,337 requests. However, not all of these requests were granted; Facebook handed over information in only 79 per cent of U.S requests, half of India's requests and 69 per cent of the demands from the UK.

Germany   2,068                 37 per cent . France     1,598                  39 per cent . The report shows which countries requested information from Facebook about its users, the number of requests received from each of those countries, the number of users/user accounts specified in those requests and the percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to disclose at least some data. These figures cover the period ending June 30. Facebook plans to publish similar reports in the future and Google, Twitter and Microsoft already disclose government requests. The data requested falls into three categories - subscriber data, traffic data and use data. Subscriber data, as defined by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, includes all data relating to a subscriber. 'Back in 2000, that would have probably been a landline number, a home address and bank details, but because of the expansion of the internet, that's changed considerably,' explained Nick Pickles, director of privacy watchdog Big Brother Watch. 'With Facebook, this basically applies to everything within the person's user profile. In my opinion, the law needs updating.' The second category - 'traffic data' - relates to location of a user. Approved authorities can request information from Facebook including where a person was when they posted a message, where they 'checked-in' on a certain day and confirming whether a PC or a mobile phone was used to access the site. This can be helpful when trying to find a missing person, for example. The third category relates to use. In terms of Facebook, this refers to how you use the site - for example whose wall you post on, who you chat to in the in-built messenger service and who you send private messages to. The U.S government topped the list, requesting information on 21,000 users, while India asked for data on 4,144 users in second place, and Britain came in third with 2,337 requests. A Facebook world graph of connections between its 500 million user base is pictured . Colin Stretch, Facebook General Counsel said in the report: 'We have stringent processes in place to handle all government data requests. 'We believe this process protects the data of the people who use our service, and requires governments to meet a very high legal bar with each individual request in order to receive any information about any of our users. 'We fight many of these requests, . pushing back when we find legal deficiencies and narrowing the scope of . overly broad or vague requests. 'When we are required to comply with a particular request, we frequently share only basic user information, such as name. The report shows which countries requested information from Facebook about its users, the number of requests received from each of those countries, the number of users/user accounts specified in those requests and the percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to disclose at least some data . 'We hope this report will be useful to our users in the ongoing debate about the proper standards for government requests for user information in official investigations.' The company added that 'the vast majority of these requests relate to criminal cases, such as robberies or kidnappings. In many of these cases, these government requests seek basic subscriber information, such as name and length of service. Other requests may also seek IP address logs or actual account content.' Mr Pickles added: 'Given recent debate about both the police’s ability to access data and the scale of surveillance being carried out by intelligence agencies, transparency is the only way to ensure that Parliament can make an informed choice about new legislation and the public can have confidence powers are being used properly.'

Ms Ennis, who has worked at ABC News for ten years, has gone from balding to bombshell, a transition which she says began seven years ago, but was kept a family secret until now. Debuting her new name and identity on her Facebook page last week, Ms Ennis added that it was not 'dress-up or make-believe'. ‘Trust me, this is NOT the midlife crisis I was counting on — I’d much prefer to have bought a sports car,’ Dawn wrote on the social network on Friday . ‘Even an affair, I think, would have been something we might have recovered from.’ ‘It is my affirmation of who I now am and what I must do to be happy, in response to a soul-crushing secret that my wife and I have been dealing with for more than seven years, mostly in secret.' Big change: Dawn Ennis, pictured as Don before her transition with wife Wendy, has left her wife of 17 years and their three children to live as a woman . Support: Ms Ennis, left as Don, says that although she is 'heartbroken' to have moved out of the family home, her wife Wendy, right, has 'encouraged her to start a new life' Ms Ennis suffers from a ‘hormone imbalance’ as a result of her mother feeding her estrogen as a child in order to halt puberty, believing it would ruing Ms Ennis’ career as a child actor, The New York Post reports. This resulted in Ms Ennis eventually developing breasts and a lifelong medical condition which she says doctors have been unable to explain of cure. Using social media, Ms Ennis has spoken of how her transition has ‘wrecked’ her marriage and on YouTube, where she has been active as Dawn for the past two years, she says she is ‘jealous’ of one transgender woman whose wife ‘stood by her’. On Saturday, the day after she revealed her true identity to her colleagues, Ms Ennis moved out of the family home. 'Despite the heartbreak, [Wendy] has encouraged me to start this new life that we both believe better fits who I now am,' Ennis, a National Assignment Editor at ABC News, wrote on Facebook. True to herself: Dawn Ennis' new Facebook profile as she begins her new life with a new identity . New me: Dawn Ennis 'officially' became a woman on Friday and announced her new female identity on Facebook with an Adam Lambert video . Long journey: A post written prior to her full transition shows the brave battle Dawn faced before taking the final step . Prior to her full transition, Ms Ennis said she feared she might lose her job if she 'came out' as a woman. She says one of the reasons for her delay in becoming a woman ‘full-time’ is her fear that as a freelance journalist, she would have no protection should her workplace have issues with her transition. ‘I have begun transition, just not at work, and the job/wife/family dynamic is what's stopping me from full-time, and probably rightly so,' she wrote in a YouTube comment from last year. However, colleagues at ABC News have been fully supportive of Ms Ennis transition from Don to Dawn and celebrated with glitter and cake when she arrived for her first day as a woman on Friday. She also received a note of support from ABC News President Ben Sherwood, and is working on a book deal. 'I’m overwhelmed by the strong support I’ve received from my coworkers, and I’m looking forward to telling my story when I’m ready,” Ennis said in a statement to the New York Post.","ABC News producer Don Ennis, 49, has become Dawn Ennis .

The man credited with discovering some of the biggest names in modelling has died at the age of 70. John Casablancas, who launched the careers of Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell, lost his battle with cancer in Rio de Janeiro on Friday evening and will be mourned in a funeral ceremony later this week. He launched Elite model management in 1972 and signed models such as Gisele Bündchen, Stephanie Seymour, Alessandra Ambrosio, Naomi Campbell, Heidi Klum, Eva Herzigová, Alessandra Ambrosio, Stephanie Seymour and Anna Nicole Smith. John Casablancas, pictured with some of his models in 1991, was 'a man who loved women, lots of women' The glamorous champagne lifestyle he . encouraged his models to lead was largely at odds with the prevailing . business ethos at the time. His rival agency Ford was pioneering a clean and ethical business practice within the modelling industry, introducing modern accounting practices and standardised pay and working hours. 'Models were just models,' Casablancas told New York Magazine in 2005. 'We started creating the myth behind the looks.' He encouraged Cindy Crawford to strip for Playboy. That year, she became the world's highest earning model. Linda Evangelista famously said 'We . don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day' in 1990, a comment that came to . define the supermodel era. At its height Elite was earning up to $65 million in bookings per year. But as Casablancas' success in the industry rocketed throughout the 80s and 90s, it was also rocked by scandals. In 1983 the businessman indulged in an affair with 16-year-old Stephanie Seymour, he was 41. Elite model Alessandra Ambrosio tweeted in mourning . Casablancas with his wife in 2008 and in 2000 with Claudia Schiffer just after she chose Elite to represent her . The fling ultimately ended his second marriage to Jeanette Christjansen, a former model and the 1965 Miss Denmark. 'I . had the understanding of a guy who loved beautiful women, and above all . who liked the sensuality of it all,' he said in a 2010 video interview . with the blog Modelinia. 'All . of the other agents were either women or gay guys. They had their own . approach, which in certain instances was probably superior to mine, but I . had something I thought was unique. I looked at my models as women.' Casablancas was increasingly being faced accusations of engaging in relationships with underage models and resigned from his agency in 2000 following a BBC One undercover exposé. The programme showed some of Elite’s European agents bragging about using drugs and having sex with young models. He later turned bitter towards the women he helped dominate the catwalk, calling them 'spoilt pains'  surrounded by 'idiots and leeches'. Linda Evangelista on the catwalk in 1990, around . the time she made the famous comment, and Heidi Klum, who Casablancas . names a 'talentless German sausage' He described Heidi Klum as a 'talentless German sausage' and Naomi Campbell as 'odious'. He said, as reported by the Independent: 'Apart from Linda Evangelista, no supermodel has ever thanked me  when she got to the top.' Casablancas died on Friday, as confirmed by Women's Wear Daily over the weekend. He is survived by his young wife, . Aline Wermelinger, a brother, Fernando, and by five children from his two marriage, including Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas. 'Elite World and The Society Management [a division of Elite World] are deeply saddened [by] Mr. John Casablancas’ passing,' said Stefania Valenti, chief executive officer of Elite World as reported WWD. 'As a man of extraordinary talent, Mr. Casablancas was instrumental in formulating the global success of the Elite brand. His vision changed the model management concept, driving the careers of iconic top models.'

A Monopoly set played by the Great Train Robbers using real money while lying low at a farm has emerged 50 years after the infamous £2.6million heist. The tatty board game came to light after it was brought to the Antiques Roadshow for valuation, revealing the little-known story of its part in the 20th century's most notorious robbery. It was discovered by police in a farmhouse hideout days after the brazen hold-up on a Royal Mail train in 1963. Heist: At the time there was no other crime to rival that of the audacious Great Train Robbery. It netted the gang £50million at today's prices .

Hands off my stash: The Great Train robbers were rumoured to have used real cash stolen from the job to play the board game with . Clues: Ronnie Biggs and his accomplices left their fingerprints all over the Monopoly set, which eventually led to their convictions . The train had been travelling from Glasgow to London but was set upon at Ledburn in Buckinghamshire by the gang, who had tampered with signals. The robbers stormed the train and took all but seven of 128 highly-prized sacks. In today's terms they made off with the equivalent of nearly £50million. Following the robbery the gang, including ringleader Bruce Reynolds, Buster Edwards and Ronnie Biggs, retreated to a nearby farmhouse to hide from the police. While they were there they played the board game to pass the time using real money to buy the streets, houses and hotels. It proved to be their undoing. When the police turned up at the farmhouse, the 15 robbers made their escape, but in their haste they left the Monopoly set - with their fingerprints all over it.

Also recovered from the site were chequebooks, a driving licence, a diary and a real five pound note. The Monopoly set was saved from police archives and put on display at the private Thames Valley Police Museum. Experts from the BBC's Antiques Roadshow valued to Monopoly it at £200. Ken Wells, former curator at the museum, said: 'In 1963 a Royal Mail train was held up in Buckinghamshire and £2.6million was stolen. 'Knowing they would need somewhere to hide after the hold-up, the criminals had purchased a farmhouse where they could lie low. While they were there they killed time by playing Monopoly, among other things. Hideout: Leatherslade Farm in Buckinghamshire, where the notorious gang laid low to escape the clutches of the police . Haul: The robbers made off with 171 bags stuffed full of cash, which they used to play Monopoly with. The set can be seen here among other evidence found at the farmhouse . 'Meanwhile the police had decided to search properties within a 25-mile radius of where the robbery took place. 'When the lair was eventually discovered police found the robbers had made a hasty getaway. 'The farmhouse had been stocked full of food supplies and bedding by the robbers. 'It is rumoured they paid a someone £12,000 to clean up the evidence behind them but when police arrived they found fingerprints all over the Monopoly set.

"PUBLISHED: . 06:13 EST, 3 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:21 EST, 3 September 2013 . Mexican prosecutors said Monday they are investigating claims that a woman who killed two bus drivers last week in this northern border city was seeking revenge for alleged sexual abuse of female passengers. The claims made in an email from the self-styled 'bus driver hunter' echoed deeply in Ciudad Juarez, which has a grim history of sexual violence against women aboard buses. A woman wearing a blond wig - or dyed hair - boarded one of the school bus-style vehicles that serve as transport in Ciudad Juarez on Wednesday morning. Pink crosses mark the place where eight women were found murdered in Ciudad Juarez: The city has a terrible reputation for violence and sexual assault . She approached the driver, took out a pistol, shot him in the head and left the bus. The next day, apparently the same woman did exactly the same thing to another driver on the same route. Over the weekend, media outlets began receiving emails from the address 'Diana the hunter of bus drivers.' 'I myself and other women have suffered in silence but we can't stay quiet anymore,' the email said. 'We were victims of sexual violence by the drivers on the night shift on the routes to the maquilas,' a reference to the border assembly plants that employ many residents in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. 'I am the instrument of vengeance for several women.' The newspaper Diario de Juarez reported that a witness quoted the killer as telling the second victim, 'You guys think you're real bad, don't you?' before shooting him. Diana the goddess of the hunt, in a bronze statue . Diana was worshipped in ancient Roman religion and is revered in Roman Neopaganism and Stregheria. Romans believed she was the goddess of the hunt, the moon and birthing and was associated with wild animals and woodland. They believed she had the power to talk to and control wild animals. Diana therefore, reflects the heavenly world (diuum means sky or open air) in its sovereignty, supremacy, impassibility, and indifference towards such secular matters as the fates of mortals and states. At the same time, she is also seen as active in ensuring the succession of kings and in the preservation of humankind through the protection of childbirth. Diana was known to be the virgin goddess of childbirth and women. She was one of the three maiden goddesses, Diana, Minerva and Vesta, who swore never to marry. As goddess of the hunt, Diana often wears a short tunic and hunting boots and is often portrayed holding a bow, and carrying a quiver on her shoulder, accompanied by a deer or hunting dogs. Like Venus, she was portrayed as beautiful and youthful. The crescent moon, sometimes worn as a diadem, is a major attribute of the goddess. Authorities have not verified the authenticity of the email, or of a Facebook page set up under a similar name August 31. But Arturo Sandoval, spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, said the vigilante claim is considered one of the working hypotheses in the crimes. There was no apparent robbery involved in the killings. 'Now that we have the email in the case file, it indicates that this could have been someone who had a run-in with a driver or one of his relatives,' Sandoval said. The government announced it will put undercover police aboard some buses and conduct weapons searches to prevent further killings, and said a citywide search for the suspect is already on. 'We have a police sketch of the suspect and we are looking for her,' municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. Many of the women murdered during a string of more than 100 eerily similar women's killings in Ciudad Juarez in the 1990s and early 2000s disappeared after boarding buses. Their bodies were often found weeks or months later, raped, strangled and dumped in the desert or vacant lots. Mexico's . Ciudad Juárez which sits on the border of the Rio Grande, just south of . Texas, has not only become synonymous with a bloody drug war - but also . for violence against women of horrific proportions. The number of reported women murdered each year is in the hundreds; and hundreds more are reported missing. The . murders hit their high in 2010, when 304 women were found dead. Media . reports helped curb the violence against women but last year it was . reported to be back just as bad. By . mid 2012 at least 60 women had been killed in the city, according to . the New York Times and at least 100 were reported missing. Human . rights activists claim they fear people in Ciudad Juárez are not . alarmed by the horrific violence against women because they think it is . normal, it is so engrained in the social culture. The . local government has made pledges to take the killings more seriously. However, it is often difficult to arrest, let alone prosecute in the . city, according to campaigners. Killings are the result of jealous husbands, jealous fathers-in-law, women killing women and other reasons, reports have said. Organizations . to aid the families of the missing women have sprung up in recent . years, helping them band together to find out what happened to their . mothers, daughters and sisters. Several bus drivers were arrested in connection with those killings, but the cases against them always appeared weak, or their confessions coerced. One driver had his conviction overturned, and his co-defendant, another bus driver, died in prison before sentencing. The head of the Chihuahua Women's Human Rights Center, Lucha Castro, said that perhaps the killer 'or someone close to her suffered some abuse by one of these guys.' 'It's a fact that there are sexual abuse cases on the bus routes, but it's no greater than women disappearing from the streets in downtown, in human trafficking rings,' Castro said. But, she added, like the still-unresolved identities of most of the 1990s killers, 'The most tragic thing is that the public may never know what the truth is.'","Police claim shootings were revenge for alleged sexual abuse of passengers .

Israel and the U.S. today carried out a joint missile test in the Mediterranean, firing two rockets which later fell into the sea. News of the secret drill came this morning when the Russian defence ministry reporting that a radar system had detected the launch of two 'ballistic objects'. There were no reports of missiles hitting Syria, prompting confusion over the origins and consequences of the apparent launch. Scroll down for videos . Fighting: As the carnage continues in Syria, pictured, Israel and the U.S. have conducted a missile test in the eastern Mediterranean . Later today, Israel's defence ministry revealed that it had conducted a test of missile designed to be used as a target in an anti-missile system funded by the U.S. A Russian official said that the launch was detected at 6.16am GMT by an early warning station near the Black Sea, designed to detect missiles fired from Europe and Iran. The Israeli test took place just one minute earlier, at 6.15am GMT, suggesting that the two events were in fact the same. Markets immediately fell upon news of the rockets being detected, with the FTSE 100 index tumbling nearly one per cent in just a few minutes. Stock markets in Germany and France saw similar losses as traders reacted to fears of renewed global instability. Defiant: Bashar Assad has warned that if the West attacks Syria, it could ignite a regional conflict . A spokesman for the U.S. Navy said . that American forces did not fire any missiles, but did not confirm . whether or not the U.S. was involved with the Israeli operation. 'No missiles were fired from U.S. ships in the Mediterranean,' he said. 'The trajectory of these objects goes from the central part of the Mediterranean Sea toward the eastern part of the Mediterranean coast,' the Russian ministry said. Officials within Syria said there were no signs of any missile attacks in Damascus. Russia and the West have been locked in a war of words over the possibility of intervention in the Syrian civil war. Disagreement: Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin are at loggerheads over plans to attack Syria . Five U.S. destroyers and an . amphibious ship are in the Mediterranean, poised for possible strikes . against Syria with cruise missiles. 'The pressure being applied by the United States causes particular concern,' Russian defence ministry official Oleg Dogayev said. 'The dispatch of ships armed with cruise missiles toward Syria's shores has a negative effect on the situation in the region.' Barack Obama has called for punitive strikes on the country in retribution for the Assad regime's apparent use of chemical weapons to attack civilians in a Damascus suburb. However, Assad has refused to back down, telling a French newspaper that the West could ignite a regional conflict if it launches even limited strikes on Syria. Obama is set to seek a congressional vote on the decision to attack the country after David Cameron lost a vote of British MPs over whether or not to launch strikes.","Launch of two missiles into eastern Mediterranean detected by Russia .

A healthy and active five-year-old who has his own vegetable patch has been branded overweight by a government initiative. Oliver Knight completed a medical as part of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) to assess his body mass index (BMI). Measuring 1.085m (3ft 6in), and weighing 20.6kg (3 stone, 3lb), Oliver's BMI is in the 91st percentile, putting him in the 'overweight' category. This percentile means he weighs more than 91 out of 100 of his peers. Green fingers: Oliver has a love of healthy food and even tends to his own vegetable patch in his back garden . Still growing: Oliver eats healthy meals every day, with a typical dinner consisting of potatoes and salad . Energetic: Oliver's puzzled mother Sharon describes her child as 'absolutely full of energy' His . mother Sharon, 40, was shocked to receive the letter from Oldham . Council, claiming her son is energetic and loves vegetables, but says . she won't tell Oliver about the result because of the way it could . affect him. Mrs Knight said: 'Oliver is such a skinny little thing. I couldn't believe what I was reading. 'Firstly, I can't believe they're doing this to five-year-olds. They're still growing, and they need three meals a day. Oliver Knight has been classed as overweight as his BMI percentile is 91 . 'But Oliver eats healthily all the time - we have our own vegetable patch and he loves salad. 'The other mums at school get wound up because their children won't eat as many vegetables as he does. 'And we don't buy sweets or sugary treats, because I have an autistic son and if he eats them it doesn't do him any good. 'He needs to eat healthily, so I just don't have them in the house.' Mrs . Knight says a typical meal in the family household would be chicken, . with salad and potatoes, and that Oliver has Weetabix for breakfast plus . the healthy lunch the school provides. She added: 'He exercises all the time, . because we have family days out where we go walking or cycling. He's . absolutely full of energy.' Back in February, Oliver took part in a school project on healthy eating. His mother says that when he got . home, he didn't want to eat his tea or breakfast the following day . because he was so scared of getting fat, and she's scared that if he . sees the letter, the same thing will happen again. Sharon . said: 'There is just no way Oliver is overweight. It's concerning to . think that they are saying this to people who are so young. 'They wonder why so many young people have eating disorders, and then they do this. It's really annoyed me. 'As . a family, we just eat healthy meals and get out and about. I've been . told not to take it to heart, but you can't say that to a child. 'According to the Royal College of . Paediatrics and Child Health UK 2-18 years growth chart, a child with a . BMI above the 91st is classed as overweight, while a child above the . 98th centile is clinically obese. Shocked: Sharron Knight brandishes the letter from Oldham Council which branded Oliver 'overweight' Banned: The Knight's house is free from sugary sweets and drinks. Instead Oliver enjoys healthy fruit and veg . A Public Health England spokesman said: 'The NCMP is recognised as being fundamental to efforts to tackle childhood obesity in England. It records the height and weight of children in two age groups at state maintained schools every year. The results inform local authorities about levels of obesity in their populations. 'Parents also receive these results because they have said, through focus groups, it's important and they want to be aware of potential issues with their child's health. 'Evidence shows parents and health professionals do not always recognise overweight in children, which is why an objective measure rather than visual assessment is important.' Mum's the word: Mrs Knight has vowed to keep the letter secret from her son.

A couple aged 76 and 79 said 'I do' for the second time yesterday - 58 years after they first got married. Ollie Ingram, 76, and Wills Holmes, 79, from Drayton Bassett tied the knot back in 1955 but broke up ten years later and then married new partners. But the couple met up at a family party 18 months ago when they were both widowed and rekindled their relationship. Wills and Ollie Holmes are now married for the second time - 58 years after they first said I do to each other . They got married for the second time in a civil ceremony at a hotel in Tamworth, Staffs., using the exact same rings they bought at 17 for their first wedding. The grandparents walked down the aisle to the apt Barry White song 'My first, my last, my everything'. They were joined by 100 friends and family for the 30-minute ceremony - before enjoying a party with the music provided by a band rather than a gramophone like their first wedding .

A tycoon who was charged almost £1million for destroying protected woodland has come under fire for bulldozing rural property in order to build himself a holiday home. Phillip Day, one of Britain's richest men, has knocked down a quaint country cottage in rural Cumbria, near Carlisle, and plans to build a three-storey holiday house in its place. The 47 year-old businessman faced was charged £950,000 in July after turning woodland where Hadrian's wall was quarried into a wasteland to improve his pheasant shoot. Tycoon Phillip Days was charged almost £1million in July for tearing down woodland near his home. His new plans for a holiday house have been met with the outrage of local residents . Mr Day's plans for the new house, which will accommodate 24 if finished, have been met with local outrage. The development is set to include an underground swimming pool, spa, hot  tub and gym, and would almost double the population of the tiny village it is to be built in, which is home to just 24 properties now. Residents of Townhead in Cumbria claim the plans threaten environment and wildlife, including . colonies of bats which roost in local homes. The quaint keeper's cottage that Mr Day destroyed in order to build his dream holiday home was much more in keeping with the other houses in the area, residents of Townhead . The holiday home would lie just two miles from the tycoon's permanent home. Plans include an underground swimming pool, hot tub, spa and gym . Local residents fear the ostentatious house won't fit in in the rural hamlet which is home to just 24 properties . There are concerns over . noise and increased traffic along narrow country lanes, as well as fears that the ostentatious property will stand out in the village which is filled with 200 year-olds converted barns and farms. But residents of the picture postcard community in rural Cumbria, seven miles from Carlisle - so remote it does not have street lights - are fighting the project. Michael Aldersey and Alison Clarricoats, who live next to the proposed development, told the council: 'The original building that was demolished was a pretty two-bedroom stone-built cottage which blended in with the surroundings. 'It is now to be replaced with this new monstrous development which will dwarf the village and will be totally out of character. Last month Mr Day was charged £950,000 for destroying protected woodland which he ruined while building a better route to his pheasant shoot . A view of how the Hadrian's Wall woodland looked before Philip Day chopped down trees and carved out a track near Brampton in Cumbria, England . 'Townhead is a quiet, peaceful hamlet and we do not understand how the planning department could think of ruining this by allowing an industrial scale development to be created.' Businessman Koi Chatterjee, who lives at Townhead Farm, said: 'The structure is just grotesque, ugly and not in keeping with the nearby properties not conducive to the surroundings of what is definitely a picturesque quintessentially English hamlet.' In July, Mr Day was fined £400,000 with £450,000 costs when contractors tried to drive a road through the site, allegedly to give shooting parties better access. Last week Mr Day’s lawyers failed to get the costs reduced when Judge Peter Hughes QC - who said during the trial that the entrepreneur with a personal fortune of £300m had tried 'to use the power of his wealth to avoid responsibility' - said the public would regard it as 'an affront to justice'. Mr Day was granted permission to knock down the cottage and replace it with eight separate holiday lets almost two years ago. He is now applying to amend his original plans with the new building, which some objectors described as a ‘boutique hotel’ and a ‘fortress’. The plans will be discussed by the council’s Development Control Committee on Friday (Aug 30). Despite objections from 15 households, planners are recommending it be approved.","Phillip Day knocked down keeper's cottage to make room for holiday house .

Stranded: Stephanie Molina has been left scrambling to find a new venue for her May wedding after the Excalibur Event Center abruptly closed, taking with them her $5,000 deposit . Secrets: The banquet hall closed last month while allegedly only contacting some of their clients who had given them deposits that are still yet to be returned . 'He just said the place was closed down, and he would need three weeks before he could give me my money back. And I haven't heard from him since,' she said. Aimee Vasquez is also without a place to hold her August wedding's reception while short the $1,500 she put down. 'I honestly don't even know where to start anymore,' she told KDVR while on the verge of tears.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond became the first senior Government figure to admit that MPs could be asked to return to the issue . PICTURE JEREMY SELWYN . 29/08/2013 . Senior Tory and Labour MPs last night called for a second Commons vote on military action in Syria despite polls showing most voters oppose British strikes. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond became the first senior Government figure to admit that MPs could be asked to return to the issue after they stunned David Cameron last week by refusing to support even the principle of a strike on Damascus. Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have insisted there is no prospect of a second vote after Parliament made its will clear. But senior Tories, including former Cabinet ministers Andrew Mitchell and Liam Fox, London Mayor Boris Johnson and former leader Lord Howard, insisted it was vital not to rule out another vote. An ICM poll for the BBC found 71 per cent of people think MPs were right to reject military action, and that Mr Cameron handled the issue better than Labour leader Ed Miliband. But Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French president Francoise Hollande accuse Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad of using chemical weapons on civilians. However, Assad said Syria would hit back if it was attacked by France, adding: ‘There will be repercussions, negative ones obviously, on French interests.’ He also raised the threat of a ‘regional war’ if the West launched strikes, telling French newspaper Le Figaro: ‘The Middle East is a powder keg, and today the spark is getting closer. ‘One must not talk only about the Syrian response, but also about what could happen after the first strike. 'No one can know what will happen. Everyone will lose control of the situation once the powder keg explodes. Chaos and extremism will spread. The risk exists of a regional war.’ Threats: Bashar Assad said Syria would hit back if it was attacked by France adding there would be repercussions . Mr Hammond admitted last night that a second Commons vote could take place if circumstances changed ‘very significantly’. Amid growing signs of Labour disarray over the stance taken last week by Ed Miliband – who is accused of indicating support for the Government only to pull the plug at the last minute – Shadow Cabinet ministers Jim Murphy and Chuka Umunna suggested a second vote may be needed. Defence spokesman Mr Murphy said he was ‘uneasy’ at the stance of ‘indefinite inaction’ left by Thursday’s defeat at the hand of Labour and 30 Tory rebels. He added: ‘An attack on an ally  by Assad or further chemical atrocities would give the Prime Minister a right to bring this back to Parliament.’ Business spokesman Mr Umunna said: ‘We certainly didn’t rule out military action.’ Former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said it was ‘nonsense’ for ministers to rule out military intervention in Syria in all circumstances, and Tessa Jowell, another former Cabinet minister, said there should ‘of course’ be a second vote on Syria ‘if circumstances change’. However, Tory sources said there was no prospect of a second vote because Mr Cameron would have little option but to resign if he was defeated again on a matter of war.","Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has admitted MPs could be asked to return to the issue .

The super-size loan highlights how the capital’s housing market means only the rich, the very well-paid or those with generous parents can afford to buy. In many parts of the capital, such as Kensington, Chelsea, Westminster and Camden, the average asking price is more than £1million. First-time buyers in London are typically required to take out a mortgage of nearly £200,000 and pay a deposit of more than £64,000, figures have shown (file picture) The figures, from the Council of . Mortgage Lenders, showed that the average first-time buyer in London . takes out a mortgage of £192,640 with an average household income of . £52,130. In London a . typical first-time buyer puts down a 25 per cent deposit because . otherwise mortgage rates are prohibitively expensive. That means the average price paid is £256,853 and the typical first-time buyer needs a £64,213 deposit. The . household income of £52,130 is double the amount the average worker . with a full-time job earns – the national average full-time salary is . £26,500.

It's definitely a dog's life for taste tester Lucy Postins after landing a job sampling bowls of pet food, but at least she is guaranteed strong teeth and a nice shiny coat. While the mere thought of eating dog food is enough to turn most people's stomachs, Ms Postins, originally from the UK but now based in San Diego, USA, says she absolutely loves her job.

Ms Postins insists on all the recipes being made in a human food facility instead of a pet food rendering plant, and then tests for the likes of flavour, aroma and colour which is an indication of freshness. Her company The Honest Kitchen was the first pet food manufacturer to achieve a 'human grade' rating from the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) which means the final product is legally allowed to be described as 'human grade' on the product labels. This is because the ingredients are sourced directly from the human food chain and production takes place alongside 'people foods'. Treats: Human taste tester Lucy Postins, not only samples every individual ingredient that goes into the pet food but even tries the final product too . Teamwork: Ms Postins is both the human taste tester and CEO of pet food company The Honest Kitchen - the first pet food manufacturer to achieve a human grade rating from the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) Lucy, who studied in Warwickshire, believes that by producing pet food in this way animals receive stacks of health benefits including improvements to their skin, fur and general immunity. The dog food - which includes everything from free range chicken, ranch-raised beef and sweet potatoes to eggs, bananas and even dandelion greens - is carefully blended before being mixed with water by the buyer to help bring the mixture together. CEO Lucy, whose family includes two pet Rhodesian Ridgebacks and a Pug in San Diego in California, USA, said: 'There are a lot of people who think their pets are inferior and don't deserve quality food. 'But so many people are becoming educated on conventional pet food ingredients and production that they want to make a move away from that.

A set of identical twins who happen to both be American astronauts will soon become subjects of a NASA experiment about the genetic-level effects of living in space. Mark and Scott Kelly are genetically indiscernible from one another and researchers hope to use that biological fluke to their advantage by comparing the brothers’ bodies when one goes to space while the other stays behind on Earth. The study is the first of its kind and will take place as Scott Kelly becomes the first American to spend an entire year living in space. Cosmic twins: Scott Kelly (left) and Mark Kelly are identical twins and will soon become the focus of NASA research into possible genetic-level effects of extended stays in space . ‘It’s not the kind of research that we in the human research program normally like to do,’ chief scientist John Charles told Discovery News. ‘[but] there may well be insights that can be gained that have not been investigated yet.’ NASA’s Human Research Program has previously investigated the interacts between and intersections of human physiology, technology, and the space environment, but research into possible effects of living in space at the genetic level is a new undertaking. Researchers aren’t altogether sure what they’ll learn from the experiment, but say it could yield breakthroughs simply by virtue of its newness. ‘The way we wrote the proposal is essentially anything that researchers think is relevant to understanding the genomics,’ said Charles, ‘that can be deduced from a study of one astronaut in flight and one astronaut who is retired and not flying and living the good life in Albuquerque.’ Unprecedented: The brothers' unique situation makes them perfect subjects for such research as both Scott and Mark will be tested throughout Scott's year-long stint on the International Space Station in 2015 . In 2015, Scott Kelly will begin his unprecedented stay aboard the International Space Station alongside Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. Kelly will be the first American to spend a year in space, while five Russians have done so previously. Meanwhile, Mark Kelly will remain firmly planted on Earth. The retired brother served as pilot or commander of multiple Endeavor space shuttle missions and may be even better known as husband to former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in Tuscon, Arizona in 2011. Both brothers will submit blood and tissues to researchers for the year-long experiment. Scott’s sample will serve to determine what, if any, genetic changes occur during extended stays outside Earth. New territory: Physiological impacts of space travel like those pictured have long been a focus of NASA's Human Research Project, but genetic changes have not been studied . Mark’s will serve as the control samples. 'This is sort of our first foray into the genetic aspects of spaceflight. This really is the wave of the future,' said Charles. Kelly was among four astronauts on NASA's short list for the assignment. Each had served as a commander aboard the space station, and was able to perform spacewalks and robot arm operations. Medical information also went into the selection: A crew member could not have exceeded his limit for exposure to cosmic radiation, for instance. Kelly said he has no idea how or why he ended up being chosen. He will set a U.S. space endurance record with this mission. No American has spent more than seven months in space at a time. Cosmic radiation exposure and the possible increase of the likelihood of certain cancers is one known physiological danger of prolonged space flights. The deterioration of weight-bearing bones and certain muscle groups is another effect commonly associated with astronauts and space travel. Researchers hope this new type of experiment will help us better understand space travel’s less obvious effects so that they can prepare for the in the future.","Scott Kelly will become the first American to spend a year in outer space in 2015 .

When pretty Drew-Ashlyn Cunningham steps into the wrestling ring her male opponents may be taken aback. But, despite her feminine looks and curves, . the 5ft 11in, 57kg stunner packs a serious punch when she fights under her alter ego, Harley Ryder. The 34C beauty is in fact the UK's only transgender wrestler and, after months of training, is preparing to take on the men in her first wrestling matches. Drew-Ashlyn always felt there was something different about him as a young boy (left) and, after transitioning from man to woman in 2007, chose to pursue his dream of becoming a female wrestler (right) At 5ft 11 and with a 34C bra size, Drew-Ashlyn's feminine appearance doesn't detract from her performance in the ring . The 24-year-old was so obsessed with . female wrestlers when she was a teenager that she decided to become one - . despite having been born a boy. She said: 'Wrestling has always been a passion of mine and I grew up with it for many years. I’ve been inspired by Lita from WWE, she was my idol as a wrestler and it’s who I want to be like.' Drew-Ashlyn changed from man to woman after telling doctors she was trapped in the wrong body as a teen. It encouraged her to pursue her dream of becoming a wrestler after idolising women in the sport throughout her childhood. The make-up artist, who works in Leeds, was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was 18 after telling doctors how she felt about her body . Drew-Ashlyn Cunningham (pictured left as a boy aged five) idolised female wrestlers throughout her childhood and when she transitioned to a woman was able to pursue her dream to be one . And for the last three months, she has been in the ring training as a wrestler and is now preparing for her first fight. Drew-Ashlyn, from Wakefield, admits: 'It is tough. I come away with lots of bumps and bruises but at the end of the day if it’s not in your heart you’re not going to make it. 'I think it takes a strange breed of person to get into this business. You have to be a bit different to jump into a ring and say ‘I’m going to beat myself up today.’ She continued: 'The men are very comfortable with me. They’re all nice and make sure they care for me. Every time they give me a move they will ask me if I am OK. They do make sure I am in safe hands. 'It’s not an issue for them. The guys are really supportive and in a way it’s really surprising because that world, the wrestling world, can be masculine and macho.' Drew-Ashlyn has struggled with her transition into a woman; being bullied and suffering with depression . She trains for hours a week with professional wrestling company, UK Wrestling, completing thousands of press-ups, sit-ups, running intense drills and now manages routines for other wrestlers. 'We do a huge workout at the beginning of the session,' she said. 'Then we do a lot of moves. We learnt how to take a backdrop and how to land on the mats because when you fall back, you hurt you back and you’ve got to know how to do it properly.' Drew-Ashlyn, who appeared on the hit reality show ‘My Transexual Summer,’ started her transition to a woman in 2007. The make-up artist, who works in Leeds, was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was 18. The 57kg beauty is putting her stamp on the wrestling world and wiping the floor with her male opponents . The condition leaves sufferers feeling there is a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity. The journey from man to woman hasn’t been an easy one for her. She battled with depression, self-harming and was abused in the street by strangers. She said: 'I used to get bullied a lot. People would shout at me in the street just randomly, saying that I looked like a man or yelling ‘tranny’ - just really horrible things. I didn’t look like I do back then. I had braces, my hair was white and I didn’t know how to do my make-up. 'Because my childhood was quite open I never understood why I was getting bullied. People would always put me down and call me gay and poof. 'I used to stop myself from eating and starve myself and hope that I wouldn’t wake up and hope that I would die in my sleep. 'I used to play with Barbie dolls and dress up but because my family was really open minded, no one questioned my behaviour and so I didn’t question it myself. 'When I was eight or nine years old that’s when I really got this feeling that I was trapped in the wrong body.' She admits she was apprehensive about joining the masculine world of wrestling at first. 'I rang them up and explained that I wanted to get into wrestling but that I was very nervous because of being transgender and that I know it is a very male-orientated environment,' she explained. 'I was quite scared about being in that situation where it is hands on and you’re with the guys and I was worrying about that.' The wrestler, who has never revealed her former male name, has been taking hormone supplements for the last three years and with the help of a padded bra is now happy with her new look. 'I’m quite lucky in terms of the way I look but I’m planning on a couple of surgeries. I want a couple on my face so it’s kind of a lengthy process but I’m quite happy now,' she said. 'The things that I would like are kind of cosmetic. Hopefully by the time I’m 30 I will be fully complete. 'It has been an amazing journey for me. It’s been a crazy experience and I am very thankful.'","Drew-Ashlyn Cunningham adopts the name Harley Ryder when wrestling .

An artist fascinated by the effect the digital world is having on human interactions has published a short film of people's last cell phone photos. Ivan Cash was blown away by how open and honest people he approached in San Francisco's streets were, sharing personal stories, some touching, some funny. From one night stands, to moments of natural beauty, an office picture to prove a boyfriend was at work and not cheating, to a bent-over stripper - the collection is a glimpse into moments in people's every day lives. Scroll down for video... Newly-weds: One of the happy pictures shared as part of the project was of two newly-weds eating their wedding cake together . Speaking to the Mail Online, Mr Cash, 27, said his project was to raise awareness of the friction between 'human inaction and interaction and the role of the digital medium plays in it'. He said there was a certain 'irony' that 'technology that's trying to connect us more... can also pull us apart'. For example, he said people on Facebook may have hundreds of 'friends' but have little human interaction and connection with them. Mr Cash has been coming up with local interactive art projects in his San Francisco home for several years, self-funded and in his spare time. He has recently also completed a similar project, asking people to share and explain their last text message. Artist Ivan Cash, pictured, said it was heart-warming how open and honest people in San Francisco were when he approached them in the street and asked about the last picture on their phone . One man, left, took a photo of his van after it burst into flames when he and his friends were driving to a music festival. The silver lining he said was the kindness shown by strangers, who offered money and food . 'Both projects are based on the idea that we all have our phones on us at all times. Most of us have smart phones so we can stay connected at any time. But the irony is, when you look around in a public space, half the people are on their phones, and it feels really isolating when people are not open to what's going on around them.' Mr Cash has urged others to follow his lead and expand upon the project, by asking people in their neighbourhood to share their last phone photo and explain the significance of it. In doing so he hopes to create more human interactions.

Yet tireless South Carolina nurse-midwife Maude Callen - who delivered hundreds of children, cared for the elderly and educated midwifery students in a 400-mile area 'veined with muddy roads' - never considered herself a hero. Her's was a labor of love, captured in these extraordinary black and white photographs taken by legendary shooter W. Eugene Smith for LIFE magazine. Smith's 20 picture-strong essay, splashed across a dozen pages in December 1951, was considered 'one of the most extraordinary photo essays ever to appear in [LIFE] magazine.'

The LIFE magazine spread, Nurse Midwife, chronicled Callen’s vital work, including the terrifying delivery of Alice Cooper's baby. According to the original LIFE article, Callen raced to the village of Pineville on the edge of Hell Hole Swamp, when the midwife noticed signs of trouble in Cooper's birth and hastily called for Callen. When the experienced midwife arrived after 6pm, Cooper’s labor grew more severe, lasting through the night until dawn. She luckily delivered a healthy son - something that LIFE said was not commonplace in the South in the 1950s when superstitious 'granny' midwives still presided over births.

Tragic: Marijuana activist Jennifer Friede was killed in a head-on collision in Denver with a suspected drunk driver . A prominent medical marijuana activist who insisted that the drug was safer than alcohol has been killed by a suspected drunk driver. Jennifer Friede, 34, died on Saturday when the car she was traveling in was involved in a head-on collision on a freeway in Denver. Police arrested the driver of the other vehicle, which was allegedly being driven the wrong way down Interstate 25, on suspicion of DUI and vehicular homicide. Speaking to The Denver Post, Jeremy DePinto, Ms Friede's boyfriend, said for years the couple had rallied at the Capitol for the expansion of access to marijuana, '...trying to tell people that cannabis was safer than alcohol'. 'It's ironic that it was an uninsured drunk driver that killer her,' he told the news service. The crash happened at around 1am Saturday when the couple were on their way home from a concert. DePinto was driving north in the high-occupancy lane of Interstate 25, near the city's Park Avenue. Quoted in the Denver Post, he told friends at a gathering to celebrate his girlfriend's life, he saw the other car coming towards him: '...you get a little blur, for a second, of disbelief'. When he realised it was a vehicle headed straight for him on the wrong side of the road, he said he looked left and right, realised he was trapped, then veered to the left. He said the other car veered into him. DePinot was seriously injured in the crash; his girlfriend Ms Friede, mother of four children, was killed. Ms Friede was a passenger in a car being driven by her boyfriend on Interstate 25, in Denver (pictured), when the fatal collision happened . The driver of the other vehicle, Rebecca Maez, 27, has previously been arrested by Edgeware Police for DUI, speeding in a construction zone and driving while her licence was under restraint in 2009, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. She remains at the Downtown Denbver Detention Center on $80,000 bond, according to the news service. DePinto described his girlfriend, also known as Jenny Kush, as a talented artist and dessert chef. Less control: Ms Friede and her boyfriend Mr DePinto have campaigned for easier access to cannabis for years . Marijuana has been . decriminalized since 1975, when the state legislature passed a bill . making the possession of the drug a $100 civil fine - not an arrestable . offense. In 1996, .

However, voters remain opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. A . 2010 ballot proposition that would have legalized all possession of one . ounce of marijuana or less for adults age 21 and over. It would also . have allowed for the establishment of marijuana cafes and other . businesses. The measure failed 54percent to 46percent.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:19 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:28 EST, 5 September 2013 . A judge has ruled today that controversial bite mark evidence can be used in a New York murder trial, disappointing critics of the technique, who have called it a 'victory for the flat Earth society'. Evidence from bite marks on victims' bodies has helped trap notorious rapists and killers, including Ted Bundy, but at least 24 men have had convictions overturned since 2000 because of flaws in the forensic method. In the trial of murder suspect Clarence Brian Dean, Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley said today that bite analysis does meet the standards of evidence in New York law. Evidence: Forensic dentist Richard Souviron presenting bite analysis at the trial of Ted Bundy in 1979 . The forensic technique involves comparing bite marks left on the flesh of victims with the teeth of suspects. But, in the past 13 years, several convicts have been exonerated, some after spending more than a decade in prison or on death row, according to an AP study and findings by the Innocence Project, which helps wrongfully convicted inmates win freedom through DNA testing. The AP analysis is the most comprehensive count to date of those exonerated after being convicted or charged based partially or entirely on bite mark evidence. In allowing bite mark analysis in his courtroom, Justice Wiley declined to spell out his reasoning, but said it met New York law guidelines and was 'obviously a field that has not been looked at closely by the courts in a long time'. Chris Fabricant, director at the Innocence Project, was at Thursday's hearing and said the judge's decision was 'contrary to the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community'. 'It's a victory for the flat Earth society,' he said. The Innocence Project and other defense attorneys slam bite mark analysis as sham science and argue that it should no longer be allowed in courtrooms. Trial: Bite analysis will be used in the case of Clarence Dean, charged with murdering Kristine Yitref . Many forensic dentists defend the practice as useful, especially when trying to eliminate suspects, and say it has helped convict murderers and rapists, most famously serial killer Ted Bundy. In the New York trial of Dean, the 41-year-old is accused of killing 33-year-old Kristine Yitref, whose beaten and strangled body was found wrapped in garbage bags under a bed in a hotel near Times Square in 2007. A forensic dentist concluded that a mark on her body matched the teeth of Dean, a fugitive sex offender from Alabama. Dean told police he killed Miss Yitref in self-defense, saying she and another man attacked him in an attempted robbery after he agreed to pay her for sex. No other man was found. His attorneys declined to comment after Thursday's hearing. Prosecutors wanted the bite mark evidence allowed at his trial to help convince jurors of Dean's guilt. His defense attorneys wanted it barred because of past mistakes involving the practice and how powerful bite mark evidence can be to jurors, even with opposing testimony. Dr David Senn, a San Antonio forensic dentist, testified in last year's hearings that bite mark analysis is valid when used in a closed population of suspects and that problems of the past can be blamed on individual dentists, not the science itself. 'The issue is not that bite mark analysis is invalid, but that bite mark examiners are not properly vetted,' he said. Dr Senn added that he couldn't imagine a case today in which he would identify a biter unless 'there was other very strong corroborating evidence'. Testifying for defense attorneys at the hearings was Dr Mary Bush, a University of Buffalo researcher who has used computer models to study bite marks made on bodies using a vice grip and dental models. Analysis: Forensic dentistry studies links between a suspect's imprint and marks left on victims . Convicted: Serial killer and rapist Ted Bundy, center, was found guilty based, in part, on evidence taken from a bite mark . Her research, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found human dentition is not unique and cannot be accurately transferred to skin. Dr Bush acknowledged that a significant limitation of her research included its use of dead bodies that have been frozen and thawed, and using machinery to create bite marks - a method far from recreating a real-life bite made on a live person during an act of violence. She testified that she did not feel bite marks should be admissible in courtrooms, but that more research in the field is needed.","Forensic technique was used to help prosecute serial killer Ted Bundy .

Swedish furniture giant IKEA has been left red-faced after the name of one of their products was translated into something less than appropriate. A customer put the name of £35 pillow Gosa Raps into Google Translate which interpreted it as Cuddle Rape. The translation of Raps, the Swedish word for rapeseed, was cut in half by the online dictionary, creating the unfortunate combination. Lost in translation: The name of IKEA's pillow Gosa Raps translates into not-so-comfortable Cuddle Rape when put into Google's online dictionary . The customer posted the findings on Reddit, but was soon calmed by Swedish speaking users of the site. Although Cuddle Rape was a result of words ‘lost in translation’, this is not the first time IKEA has found itself in trouble over the meanings of their Swedish product names in other languages. Hanger Bumerang, knife Slitbar and pot Skanka have all caused much amusement to customers across the world, but there are other products that might sell significantly less were they to be translated into English. Pillowcase Skarblad, named after a flower, translates into the not-so-romantic sounding ‘cut blade’. Worse is spatula Gubbrora, a name which makes perfect sense to a Swede set to make the traditional dish after which the product is named, but when translated into English becomes the rather less appetizing ‘old man touch’. Falling flat-pack: The Swedish furniture giant's native product names does not always work when translated into foreign tongues . Last year the company hired translators before printing their catalogue in Thai, after it was discovered that some items had a whole different meaning in parts of South-East Asia. IKEA bed Redalen was found to sound ‘uncomfortably close’ to the word for third base when pronounced in Thai, and plant pot Jattebra, a world which ironically means ‘really good’ in Swedish, sounds like a slang word for sex. The flat-pack giant was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943, celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. IKEA is the world’s largest furniture retailer, recording an annual net profit of £3.2billion in 2012, achieving sales of £27.6billion in 44 countries. In the UK, where the company first set up shop in 1987, it was voted the country’s most popular shop in a survey. There are more IKEA catalogues than bibles printed each year, and it is said that one in ten Europeans is now conceived on an IKEA bed.","Name of IKEA pillow Gosa Raps translates to Cuddle Rape on Google .

An assistant principal and an administrator have been accused of sexually assaulting and stealing from underage students at a Brooklyn high school. William Abreu, assistant principal at Progress High School, has been accused of raping a 17-year-old student in his office in 2009 and abusing others. Juan Martinez, the administrator of an after-school program, has been accused of forcing a 16-year-old girl to perform oral sex on him in his office in 2011 and abusing other students, according to investigators. The men are accused of sharing the girls they abused and Abreu even stole over $1,000 from the mother of the girl he raped, Department of Education Special Commissioner for Investigation Richard J. Condon said in a report released Wednesday. Depraved duo: Juan Martinez (right) and WIlliam Abreu (left) are accused of abusing several female students, with Abreu even raping one in his office after school . Mr Abreu and Mr Williams, according to the report, conspired to scare the girls into not ratting on their perverse, ongoing sexual abuse – even using the immigration status of one victim against her. The graphic report, which leaves nothing to the imagination, says that Mr Abreu ‘forcibly raped a 17-year-old female recent Progress High graduate (‘Student B’) in his school office.’ Mr Martinez ‘forced a then 16-year-old female student (‘Student A’) to perform oral sex on him in his office at Progress High,’ the report said, before adding that both men sexually abused the students. Mr Condon’s report then goes into detail describing the depraved molestation of both students and on-going sexual advances made by the school administrators. After offering student A an after-school job, the girl was told by Abreu that having sex with both him and Martinez was a condition of her employment, according to the report. ‘It’s even more horrifying because they were sharing these girls,’ Mr Condon told NY1. ‘One pervert is bad enough, when you have one person having sex with a girl and sending her onto another person.’ House of horrors: Williamsburg's School for Progress was allegedly the scene of ongoing sexual abuse of students by Mr Abreu and Mr Williams . As if not craven enough, Abreu then ‘asked the student to have sex with others in exchange for money,’ the report said. ‘Apparently, Abreu also propositioned the one girl that he would take her on trips with him and have her have sex with other people – and she would get paid for that,’ Mr Condon added.Student B, the girl Abreu raped in his office, was an undocumented immigrant, which led Mr Abreu down an even darker path to coercion. Mr Abreu offered to help the girl fix her immigration status, saying he could help her find a lawyer to sort out the paperwork, ‘but she would have to pay for the attorney,’ according to the report. When the girl objected, saying she couldn’t afford the fees, Abreu replied ‘Well, you could be my girlfriend,’ said the report. After she declined, that’s when Abreu forced her onto a couch and said ‘if you don’t allow me to touch you, I will have to call Immigration,’ before fondling the girl over her clothes, then undressed and raped the helpless student, the report detailed. ‘If you don't come back, I am going to have to go to Immigration,’ Abreu said after committing the horrific act of betrayal, according to the report . Mr Abreu continued to molest the girl until sending her to Mr Martinez after she refused to comply with his requests about a month later, the report said. When the tortured girl fought off Martinez’s advances, Abreu set his sights on another target, the girl’s mother. Not just sexual abuse: Mr Abreu is also accused of stealing $1,500 from the mother of his rape victim . Saying that he could introduce an attorney to help student b address her immigration status, Mr Abreu invited her mother to his office and told her to bring $1,500 in cash, the report explained. The abused girl’s mother was introduced to a ‘Hyman Rodriguez’ at the school, in Brooklyn's Williamsburg section, and paid him $1,500 to help with her daughter’s immigration struggles, said the report. The woman never heard from Mr Rodriguez or Abreu again, and Abreu did not return any of her messages, she told investigators. Both men declined to be interviewed by Mr Condon’s office, the report said. This is not the first instance of Mr Abreu being accused of sexual conduct with students. Just last year, the now-suspended assistant principal was accused of sexually abusing three 15-year-old students at the same high school, according to NY1. Both men have also been accused of coming on to students and encouraging them to dress provocatively in the past as well, according to multiple reports. The accused pervert was ‘convinced’ those accusations were going to go away and ready to move on with his life, close friends told NY1. The Kings County (Brooklyn) District Attorney’s office is looking into the incidents and considering filing criminal charges, reported NY1. The New York City Department of Education, Mr Condon, and attorneys for both men could not immediately be reached by MailOnline for comment.","The incidents happened at Progress High School in Brooklyn's Williamsburg section, between 2009 and 2011 .

The city of Peekskill, New York will pay out a $5.4 million settlement to a man who spent 16 years in prison for a murder he didn’t commit. On Tuesday, the city approved the settlement with Jeffrey Deskovic, who has been a public face of wrongful conviction and imprisonment since his name was cleared in 2007. Deskovic, now 39, was 16 when he was charged with the November 1989 killing of his 15-year-old high school classmate and has won two other multimillion dollar lawsuits in the years since his release. Compensation: Jeffrey Deskovic embraces MarryAnn Lubas, director of the National Freedom March for the Wrongfully Convicted. Deskovic spent 16 years in jail for a murder he didn't commit starting in high school . In a statement to MailOnline on Thursday, Deskovic expressed gratitude for the settlement, while also shaming authorities, who agreed to the sum without admitting wrongdoing. 'I am pleased that after many years of litigation we were able to work out a settlement with Peekskill so that I can continue focusing on rebuilding my life as well as my anti-wrongful conviction advocacy, . 'At the same time, I am concerned that even in the face of a $5.4 million dollar settlement,  Peekskill and the Peekskill officers involved still refuse to admit their misconduct or the harm it caused me. There is much more at stake than a personal apology; Peekskill’s silence suggests that they have not learned any lessons from my case and I remain concerned about wrongful convictions and criminal justice in Peekskill going forward.' Praying: Jeffrey Deskovic is pictured at 17 with his aunt, moments before a jury wrongly convicted him of murder . Wealthy: Deskovic's Tuesday settlement of $5.4M brings his total compensation since his 2007 release to $11.9M . His conviction and sentence of 15 years to life came after a confession that was later deemed to have been coerced. While imprisoned—mostly at the maximum security Elmira Correctional Facility in Chemung County, New York—Deskovic missed the funeral of his beloved grandmother. ‘My grandmother raised me along with my mother,’ Deskovic would later write. ‘She passed away while I was incarcerated. I was faced with the horrific decision of either going to see her while she was on her death bed but in a coma, or to attend the church service once she passed away.’ Making good: Deskovic was 17 when he began a 16 year sentence, served mostly at the max security Elmira Correctional Facility (pictured). He now gives speeches and works as an advocate for the wrongfully imprisoned . He was freed from prison in 2006 after DNA linked the killing to another man named Stephen Cunningham. Cunningham was already serving a life sentence by then for killing a woman four years after he killed Correa. Visitation: Jeffrey Deskovic with his aunt circa 1991. She was visiting him at Elmira Correctional Facility, where he spent most of his 16-year sentence . Deskovic spent months on public assistance following his release, but was eventually able to make a living by booking speeches about wrongful incarceration. ‘I believe that everybody who has been released following wrongful conviction should be given immediate funds, aside from what is awarded from a lawsuit, to cover housing, cost of living, mental health services, education, health insurance,’ wrote Deskovic on his website in 2007. The former inmate now has enough to survive and then some. Deskovic previously received $1.8 million from the state of New York for the wrongful imprisonment. He also won $6.5 million from Westchester County to finally settle his lawsuit against that county and used $1.5 million of it to start the Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice, reports the Journal News. While in prison, Deskovic received an associate’s degree. Upon his release, he was given a scholarship to New York’s Mercy College and this year he received his master’s degree from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Deskovic now runs the The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice, an organization dedicated to anti-wrongful conviction advocacy.","'There is much more at stake than a personal apology': Jeffrey Deskovic, 39, still shamed officials, who admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement .

But now you might just find it’s a man standing on your door step offering up beauty tips. According to new figures, the ‘Avon man’ is the newest phenomenon of the recession, as men turn to direct selling after losing their jobs because of the downturn. There’s been a five per cent increase in representatives in just two years, with men making up a quarter of that number — a 26 per cent increase in three years. Game changer: David Heffernan had more than 50 unsuccessful job interviews and now earns more as an Avon salesman than at his previous job in insurance . ‘I knock on the door and say, “You clearly need this anti-wrinkle cream, do you want it?” And, bizarrely enough, that sales technique works,’ says David Heffernan, 39, from Knutsford, Cheshire, one of a growing number of unlikely beauty gurus. ‘When I was a child, I didn’t imagine I’d one day be selling lipsticks through letterboxes. I got a lot of raised eyebrows from customers when I started being an Avon man, but I enjoyed that surprise. Brush up: It seems some of the new generation of Avon men may still need to brush up on some essential skills that ladies have down . ‘At first, I didn’t have a clue about . the products, but women seemed to like that naivety and now I use it to . my advantage to help me sell.’ When he was made redundant from his job in insurance last March, David had more than 50 job interviews. None was successful. ‘I was on the scrapheap,’ he confesses. ‘Every day I looked at my two sons, knowing I was supposed to be making something of myself for them. I felt like a failure.’ David’s wife of seven years, Emma, was an Avon sales rep and asked him to help her out. They started door-to-door together and, six months later, were managing 70 other representatives. David is now earning more than he used to in the insurance industry. But while making inroads in a women’s world, it seems some of the new generation of Avon men may still need to brush up on some essential skills. ‘Demonstrating make-up is a bit beyond me,’ confesses David. ‘I make the pitches, but I’d lose  customers if I showed women how to apply foundation and mascara. ‘I can do an Adam Ant look, but that’s about it.’","There’s been a five per cent increase in .

Yahoo has adopted a new logo for the first time since shortly after the Internet company's founding 18 years ago. The redesigned look unveiled early this morning is part of a makeover that Yahoo has been undergoing since the Sunnyvale, California, company hired Google executive Marissa Mayer to become CEO 14 months ago. She has already spruced up Yahoo's front page, email and Flickr photo-sharing service, as well as engineering a series of acquisitions aimed at attracting more traffic on mobile devices. The new Yahoo logo and (inset) the old one which has now disappeared . The shopping spree has been highlighted by Yahoo's $1.1billion (£720million) purchase of Tumblr, an Internet blogging service where the company rolled out its new logo. The logo was shown in purple spelling out the word Yahoo!, with no letters touching and ending with an exclamation point. 'We wanted a logo that stayed true to our roots (whimsical, purple, with an exclamation point) yet embraced the evolution of our products' a statement on the website said. In an effort to drum up more interest in the changeover, Yahoo spent the past 30 days showing some of the proposed logos that Ms Mayer and other executives cast aside. The revision is the first time that Yahoo has made a significant change to its logo since a few tweaks shortly after co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo incorporated the company in 1995. Ms Mayer's overhaul of Yahoo has attracted a lot of attention, but so far it has not provided a significant lift to the company's revenue. Yahoo depends on internet advertising to make most of its money, an area where the company's growth has been anaemic while more marketing cash flows to rivals such as Google and Facebook. Yahoo's stock has climbed by nearly 80%, but most of that gain has been driven by the company's 24% stake in China's Alibaba Holdings Group.

A customer has sued luxury fashion label Prada after being unable to remove a stain from a silk skirt. Catherine Whitty, 40, a physiotherapist from Melbourne, spent £971 ($1,660 in Australian dollars) on the skirt but spilled champagne on the garment during birthday celebrations. When Whitty took the piece to the drycleaners, she was told that it couldn't be removed, according to reports in Australian paper, the Herald Sun. Irate: Catherine Whitty was outraged when she was unable to remove a stain from her Prada skirt . What's more, reported the paper, Whitty was 'surprised' to be told that in addition to champagne, any liquid - including rainwater and even accidental splashes of water during hand-washing - would stain and indeed permanently damage the fabric. Incensed, Whitty launched legal action against the brand, claiming that sales staff were told the outfit was being purchased for a champagne celebration and should have warned her. She argued that she had chosen the 'timeless' A-line skirt because she expected to be able to wear it again and assumed it would be fit for 'common usage'. But Prada argued that retail operations manager Albin Cheng said that it was Ms Whitty's responsibility to care for the skirt. Success: Whitty took the Italian luxury label to court and was awarded a full refund by the tribunal . He told the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal that staff had recommended the purchase of the skirt based on fashion, and not on what would be served during celebrations. Cheng also said that Whitty's failure to have the skirt cleaned immediately compounded the problem and increased the damage. But despite his protests, tribunal member Peter Moloney found in Ms Whitty's favour and ordered the brand to hand over a full refund. He added that unless sold with a warning, garments should be expected to withstand splashes of water, or, indeed, champagne.","Physiotherapist Catherine Whitty, 40, from Melbourne sued Prada .

Charged: Keelen Armstrong, 24, has been arrested and charged in connection with the shooting of toddler Londyn Samuels . Police in crime-riddled New Orleans have arrested and charged a 24-year-old man in connection with the fatal shooting of a toddler who was being carried home from a park. Keelen Armstrong has been booked with first-degree murder in the slaying . of 13-month-old Londyn Samuels. He was also booked with attempted . first-degree murder in the wounding of the child's caretaker. Londyn was being carried by her . 18-year-old nanny on their way home from the park when someone opened . fire on the teen. One of the bullets entered the baby sitter's back and . then struck the toddler in the chest, killing her. The tragic shooting left the New Orleans community reeling after it happened at around 8.20pm on Thursday, August 29, in the city centre. Mayor Mitch Landrieu declared that 'enough is enough' after the shooting in a city struggling with violence. Londyn's heartbroken father, Keion Reed, 20, got a frantic call from his daughter's wounded baby sitter on the night of the shooting telling him that she and the one-year-old had been shot. 'In the back of my head, this is a bad dream I haven't woken up from yet,' Mr Reed told NBC News. Ironically, . at the time of the attack, Londyn's mother, 22-year-old Andrea . Samuels, was working at a non-profit cafe promoting anti-violence. Mayor Landrieu and his police chief appealed for . the public's help in finding the person responsible for the shooting . death of the 13-month-old girl. Innocent victim: Londyn Samuels, age 1, was shot dead while being carried by her 18-year-old baby sitter on a New Orleans street . Sunny baby: Described by her loved ones as a joy and a blessing, little Londyn was just starting to learn her to walk . ‘This . community has got to stand up and with force and power, speak with one . voice and say this is unacceptable,’ a somber Landrieu said at an . afternoon news conference. He announced plans for an evening vigil at an intersection near where Londyn Samuels was killed. The . shooting happened in the Central City neighborhood, one of the hotspots . for crime that has marred the city's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. Police . Chief Ronal Serpas said he was surprised at the lack of tips to . Crimestoppers, which offers rewards and promises anonymity to people who . phone in information. ‘We know that people in our community know more than they are telling us,’ Serpas said. ‘We would ask the people of New Orleans that know something about this to ask yourself, “What kind of a man would shoot at a woman holding a child?” That's not the kind of person you want to protect.’ 'Persons of interest': New Orleans police released these grainy photos from a surveillance video showing people walking past the crime scene where Londyn and her nanny were shot . Stand-off: Members of the New Orleans Police Department SWAT team move toward an apartment on the 2800 block of LaSalle in New Orleans after three people refused to cooperate with the shooting investigation . The 18-year-old baby sitter and little Londyn were returning home at 8.20pm Thursday when two shots rang out near the intersection of Washington Avenue and South Saratoga Street. The nanny suffered a non-life threatening wound to the back and was able to reach a neighbor's home and call for help. The motive for the shooting was unknown. Londyn's relatives described her as a happy baby who loved music and food, and was just starting to learn how to walk. ‘She was playful. She was a joy and a blessing,’ her aunt Ashley Samuels told NOLA.com. As police officers fanned out throughout the neighborhood to question local residents overnight, two woman and a man were taken in for questioning following a four-hour standoff with a SWAT team in an apartment building in the 2800 block of LaSalle Street. A $5,000 reward is being offered by Crimestoppers. Police issued images from a surveillance video that shows two people — described as ‘persons of interest’ — walking past a house in the area of the shooting. Tragic trend: Londyn, pictured left with her father and right with her aunt, is the fourth child to be killed in Central City neighborhood since 2010 . Mayor Landrieu, who made the fight against violent crime a major issue in his 2010 campaign, said the city has had some success in cutting the murder rate, noting that there have been 97 so far this year, down from 130 at the same point last year. But he said the death of child demonstrates the need for more community involvement. Since 2010, three children between the ages of one and five fell victim to gun violence in the Central City section of New Orleans. ‘It is a lifestyle of murder and death,’ said Brother Walter Umrani, a community activist who patrols the inner-city neighborhood with his New Orleans Peace Keepers, reported the station WWLTV.","Keelan .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 15:58 EST, 4 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 4 September 2013 . The defense rested today in the trial of a South Carolina woman accused of murdering her boyfriend in 2010, and then blaming the crime on a bogus Hispanic assailant. Julia Phillips, of Gafney, was arrested in 2010 and charged with murder in the slaying of the town's former mayor, 79-year-old Melvin Roberts, who was her live-in boyfriend. Roberts was a popular defense attorney for a half century. He served on York city council in the 1960s and was elected to a 2-year term as mayor in 1972. Roberts lost a 1976 run for the South Carolina Senate. Suspect: Julia Phillips, right, is escorted from the York Police Department in May 2010 during her arrest in the February murder of the boyfriend . On February 4, 2010, Roberts was discovered strangled to death on his property. Police said a bullet hole was found in the victim's clothing, but the round did no strike the man. At the time, Phillips told investigators that a stranger who appeared Hispanic broke into their home, robbed her, wrapped her head and face with duct tape, bound her wrists and ankles with zipties, shoved her in the mud and then attacked her boyfriend. The woman told police her assailant was a man between 5 feet 9 and 5 feet 11, weighing 200-240 pounds and that he spoke with an accent. Following a three-month investigation, police reached a conclusion that Phillips was the one who murdered Roberts and then tried to make it look like a burglary gone awry committed by a stranger, the station WBTV reported. According to investigators and the prosecution, Phillips was likely in cahoots with another person, who has never been identified. This theory was partially based on the presence of foreign DNA on the zipties used to bind Phillips’ wrists and ankles. Slain: Melvin Roberts, 79, a popular defense attorney who once served as York mayor, was found murdered on his property February 4, 2010 . On Wednesday, which marked the 7th day of the trial, one of Phillips' attorneys told the presiding judge that the defendant has decided not to testify. Before the jury entered the courtroom in York, Phillips personally told the judge her decision regarding her testimony. 'I've been up since 4am praying and in all my interest, best not to,' she said, adding, 'I grew up a Christian. I am a Christian. My confidence is in God not the courtroom.' The prosecution rested in the trial Tuesday after calling more than 20 witnesses. The case against Phillips rests on several small but crucial pieces of evidence, including traces of gunshot residue found on the woman's blouse, and the fact that on the night of the murder, her clothes were not wet, even though she had claimed that the mystery attacker pushed her into the mud. The defense has claimed that the gunshot residue could have come from different locations. But according to a forensic scientist testifying for the prosecution, the smudge proves that Phillips was not behind a brick wall at the time of the murder, as she had claimed, but rather close to the gun. Prosecutors called a dozen different witnesses testified about Phillips' inconsistent and often contradictory statements. Crime scene: Roberts was discovered strangled to death on his property. Police said a bullet hole was found in the victim's clothing, but the round did no strike the man . On their part, the woman’s attorneys called a private investigator hired by the defense, who told the court about his failed attempts to identify the owner of the mystery DNA found at the crime scene, as well as some of her neighbors. Jerome French, who lived near Roberts’ house in 2010, testified that he saw two men he did not know walking from a wooded area around the time of the murder. Another neighbor, Gina Bass, told the jury that twice during the week of Roberts' slaying she spotted a black Lincoln operated by a young African-American man enter and exit the former mayor's driveway at a high speed. The prosecution said the murder plot was financially motivated because Phillips feared that Roberts, a long-time attorney and former mayor, was going to break up with her and stop giving her money – a support she had come to rely on after her boutique had fallen on hard times. However, her attorney Bobby Frederick noted that his client still had resources after Roberts’ death, as evidenced by the fact that she was able to pay $50,000 for her defense. She also had family to care for her. Under cross examination, Frederick’s paralegal and wife clarified that it was Phillips' sister who has been covering her trial costs. A former investigator with the State Law Enforcement Division testified that police believed two people were involved in the murder, one of them being Phillips. Scott Williams said when he interviewed the woman two weeks after the murder, her story kept changing. Motive: The prosecution says Phillips feared that Roberts was going to break up with her and stop giving her money ¿ a support she had come to rely on after her store had fallen on hard times . He said Phillips couldn't explain how she was able to talk to the attacker if her mouth was covered with duct tape, and how she saw her attacker had curly hair or dreadlocks and a tan coat with her eyes covered. According to Williams, Phillips told him that she issued two prayers during the attack, the first being for God to send her an angel to free her from the duct tape covering her head and limbs, Charlotte Observer reported. As to her second prayer made after Roberts was attacked, she told Williams: 'in my heart I prayed God would let him die.' The SLED investigator added that at one point Phillips told police she suspected one of her boyfriend's sons was involved in the killing. On Tuesday, the jurors also heard from Phillips and Roberts’ friend, Diane Rayfield, who shed light on the couple’s relationship, which had reportedly grown tense and cold in the months preceding the murder. Rayfield recalled that she once asked Phillips what she would do if Roberts died. ‘She wasn't worried about it because she would be well taken care of,’ Rayfield said. ‘She'd be well taken care of the rest of her life.’ During Roberts' memorial service, Phillips laughed and joked, Rayfield said. ‘You would have thought she was at a party,’ she said.","Julia Phillips accused of killing her boyfriend, 79-year-old attorney Melvin Roberts, in February 2010 .

Vanna White is fighting to save her teenage son after fears that he is being brainwashed by a monk from the Hare Krishna movement, it has been revealed today. The 56-year-old's son Nicholas, who likes to be called Nikko, is living with a monk twice his age while both attend the University of Arizona. The 19-year-old reportedly has been living with Hare Krishna devotee Jaycee Akinsanya, 34, in his small house in Tucson.

According to the National Enquirer, Ms White, who is worth an estimated $40million, is refusing to give her son the $1million he has demanded to build a new ashram for Hare Krishna followers. With their distinctive saffron-colored robes, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness - or Hare Krishnas as they are commonly known - have seen a rapid growth in the movement since it started in the mid-Sixties in New York City. The belief system is based on Indian scripture and aims to spread the practice of bhakti yoga as devotees dedicate themselves to pleasing the Supreme Lord Krishna. The community has 400 centers worldwide, 50 schools and 90 restaurants. The popular nickname comes from the mantra they often chant in groups, which repeats:      'Hare Krishna Hare Krishna' over and over. The four central principles of the movement are no eating of meat, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication of alcohol, caffeine, tobacco or other recreational drugs. The TV star is said to be terrified about losing her son to the organization. The Hare Krishna movement previously has been accused of brainwashing in a lawsuit for false imprisonment, among other claims. Sophomore student Nikko reportedly met Mr Akinsanya, who is a freshman at the same university, last year. After Wheel Of Fortune star Vanna and her ex-husband and Nikko's father George Santo Pietro, refused to give the money, the Enquirer claims that the monk has been trying to cut his teenage housemate off from his family, advising that Nikko 'follow his own path'.

Ahead of his $41.5 million fight on September 14, undefeated boxing champ Floyd Mayweather has lifted the lid on his manic and extravagant lifestyle. The 36-year-old, widely considered pound for pound the best fighter in the world today, is nicknamed ‘Money’ and judging from the photos he regularly posts on his social media accounts it isn’t hard to guess why. Mayweather is constantly being photographed showing off bundles of dollar bills and he isn’t shy about spending it either. Floyd Mayweather poses for a picture with his favorite thing - a large pile of cash . I'll take these please: Mayweather poses with several boxes of Prada shoes that he's about to buy, right, while he even takes a nap under a sheet with money on it, left . The boxer likes to pay cash for most things and typically one of his entourage carries round a Nike duffel containing ziplock bag filled with thick wads of $100 bills . His extravagance is such that he insists on wearing his sneakers just once before he leaves them in hotel rooms. He also only wears his boxer shorts one time before they too are thrown away. Cars are another extravagance and he has two sets of identical luxury cars color-coded by mansion to help him remember which city he is in – if the car is white he’s in Las Vegas, while black means he must be in Miami. Inside the ring Mayweather has a reputation for being a showman, while outside it his life maintains the aura of a circus with a vast entourage of hangers on who must be ready to any minute to do whatever he desires, even if that means playing basketball at 2am. Pound for pound, the 36-year-old Mayweather, left, is widely considered the best fighter in the world today . Mayweather isn't shy about spending his cash and insists that his four body guards travel in a separate jet . Naturally his entourage goes by the name of ‘The Money Team,’ which also doubles as the name of his apparel business. ESPN reporter Tim Keown recently followed the fighter on a promotional tour to whip up interest in his fight next week against undefeated Mexican star Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez, during around which he spent his money as if it were monopoly notes. The tour took Mayweather to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he insisted that he and his entourage played basketball. No one had any gear with them, but that didn’t matter as he simply took everyone to Foot Locker where he splashed out on gear for everyone. While in the store, Mayweather showed the ESPN reporter his bank account receipt which read $123 million and he said, ‘One account, baby.’ Unquestionably an impressive amount of money, but Mayweather clearly has a seriously spending habit and doesn’t seemed to have considered divesting his wealth into other assets. Mayweather's love of the good life is such that he never wears a pair of sneakers or boxer shorts twice . According to Forbes, Mayweather was the highest-earning athlete in the world from 2011 to 2012. During the 11-city press tour, Mayweather flew via on his own private plane, a G5, meanwhile he insisted that his four massive bodyguards fly on a separate plane, a G4, because of his irrational fear of sharing a cabin with that much human bulk. The staff on his private jet includes a masseuse and a personal barber, even though he keeps his head shaved the majority of the time. On the first stop on the tour, New York City, the cocky fighter spent close to a quarter of a million dollars on earrings and a necklace for his 13-year-old daughter, Iyanna. His entourage - Team Money - typically include at least 20 associates who spend most of their time waiting for Mayweather to determine with happens next. ‘We don't know what we're doing until we do it,’ said one of his assistants. ‘You get used to it.’ Of course for his birthday, Mayweather was presented with a cake in the shape of some of his favorite things .

A man convicted of imprisoning a 9-year-old girl for 17 days in a suburban New York dungeon has been found dead in his prison cell. A state corrections spokeswoman said John Esposito, 64, was found unresponsive in his cell at Sing Sing Wednesday. She said the death was under investigation but didn't appear to be suspicious. He was serving a 15-to-life term for kidnapping Katie Beers and hiding her for 17 days under his Bay Shore, New York, home in 1992. Final chapter: John Esposito, 64 (left), was found dead in his prison cell from 'natural causes' while serving a 15-to-life term for kidnapping Katie Beers (right) in 1992 when she was 9 years old . Behind bars: Esposito was found unresponsive in his cell in Sing Sing shortly after returning from a parole board hearing . Linda Foglia said a corrections officer observed Esposito ‘not breathing’ around 3.30pm at the Ossining, New York, correctional facility. Officials said they believe the 64-year-old inmate died of natural causes. According to Beers, her tormentor was found dead in his cell after appearing before a parole board to find out if he would be released after serving 20 years in prison, News 12 Long Island reported. Miss Beers said in a statement to CBS-TV she is saddened at the loss of a life, but at the same time happy Esposito will ‘never be granted parole or have the opportunity to hurt anyone ever again.’ The survivor of the kidnapping also took to Twitter to share her thoughts on the passing of her abductor. Survivor speaks out: Beers released this statement online after learning of her abductor's death . ‘Less than 24 hours apart, the world lost 2 monsters - Ariel Castro & John Esposito,’ she wrote. Miss Beers was referring to the convicted kidnapper from Ohio, who committed suicide Tuesday night less than a month after being sentenced to 1,000 years in prison for holding three women captive for about a decade in his Cleveland home. Memoir: Beers published a book about her captivity in January, which she had co-written with a reporter . In a statement that was posted on Beers’ Google+ account, the 30-year-old married mother of two wrote that she was saddened for Esposito’s family. ‘They lost John a long time ago, but now they've lost him forever,’ she stated. In January, Beers granted an exclusive interview to CBS to promote her book about her ordeal, offering chilling details of her captivity and abuse. At the time, the woman said she can never 'fully have closure' on the events that she suffered as a 10-year-old girl. Beers was kidnapped three days before . her tenth birthday on December 27, 1992 by family friend Esposito. He took . her to his house and imprisoned her in a padlocked cabinet the size of a . coffin. During her period in captivity, Beers . recalls that Esposito repeatedly molested her and provided only a diet . of soft drinks and candy, including After Eight mints. 'Big John came down to my cage regularly. It seemed like once a day,' she told People magazine. 'He would bring me a toy or juice, and then he would rape me.' Dungeon: A crane raises a 6 foot by 9 foot bunker out of the earth at the property of John Esposito in this January 18, 1993 file photo . Now: Katie is a 30-year-old married mother-of-two and has finally decided to speak about her ordeal in her book Buried Memoirs . Then: Katie vanished just days before her tenth birthday and was kept chained in an underground dungeon by John Esposito . Beer's kidnapping attracted nationwide . attention in early 1993, when revelations surfaced while she was still . missing that she had suffered years of neglect from her mother and had . been repeatedly sexually assaulted by her godmother's husband since she . was a toddler. After kidnapper Esposito admitted to detectives on January 13, 1993, that he . had kidnapped Beers and showed them the dungeon where she was hidden . for 17 days under his Bay Shore, New York, home, the little girl was . placed in foster care and raised in a comfortable East Hampton home with . four siblings. Ordeal: In the book, Katie also writes that she was molested and raped by her godmother's husband from the time she was a toddler . Her foster . parents not only imposed newfound discipline into her life, making her . go to school regularly and do small chores around the house, but they . also shielded Beers from intense media interest. Beers is now a 30-year-old married . mother of two who earned a degree in business management and works in . insurance sales near her home in rural Pennsylvania. Little has been seen or heard of . Beers since then until this past January, when she has reintroduced herself to . the world at large as part of a media blitz to promote a book she co-wrote titled 'Buried Memories: Katie Beers' Story.'. Twenty years later, she described her abduction as 'the best thing that happened to me.' 'I would have never gotten out of the abuse situation I was in,' she reasoned. She went on to play volleyball at East Hampton High, participated in drama productions and went to college in Pennsylvania, where she earned a degree and in 2004 met Derek, the man who would become her husband and the father of their two children. 'There's no point really in me right now being sad or wondering what if,' she told the AP. 'I try not to be sad about what happened, because ultimately it made me who I am today, and I'm very satisfied and happy with my life,' she said. Beers agreed about four years ago to co-write the book with WCBS-TV reporter Carolyn Gusoff, although she had thought about writing a book for many years. Dungeon: After 17 days John Esposito finally confessed to police that he abducted Katie and led them to the underground bunker, which was hidden by a 200lb concrete wall built underneath his Long Island home . 'I want to be able to help people who might not know where to turn,' she explained. 'To see that there is a road to recovery.' She has declined to disclose her exact hometown, married surname or college alma mater, citing privacy concerns for her family. In . the book, Beers writes that she had been molested and raped by Sal . Inghilleri - her godmother's husband - from the time she was a toddler. Inghilleri, who served 12 years in prison for molesting Beers, died in jail in 2009 following his arrest on a parole violation. Beers . also wrote that Esposito raped her in the dungeon, explaining that she . repressed her memory of the sexual assault for many years as a defense . mechanism. Breaking her silence: Katie, pictured during an interview on Monday, was found in 1993 after 17 days held captive in a neighbor's dungeon-like bunker . Esposito, who pleaded guilty to kidnapping, was never charged with rape. At . a 2007 parole hearing, Esposito described himself as asexual and said . while he kissed the child, he never engaged in sexual relations. He told Gusoff in a letter published in the book that he believes he deserves to be released. 'I . think Katie knows I will always wish her well,' Esposito wrote. 'I'm . sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry I even thought it up. It was a . mistake.' During her time in the dungeon, Beers said in the book, she rarely slept, fearing abuse from Esposito. She said she was afraid Esposito . might molest her while she slept, but also was concerned that he would . photograph her sleeping and send the image to police. She feared if police thought she was dead, they might stop looking for her. She . 'celebrated' her 10th birthday while a prisoner of Esposito's and was . heard on an audiotape found in the dungeon after her release singing . 'Happy Birthday' to herself, although she says today she has no . recollection of that. Esposito, . she writes, fed her primarily junk food and soda; to this day she is . repulsed by After Eight mints because they were a staple in captivity. She . did have access to a small television, but says she can no longer . listen to Whitney Houston's version of 'I Will Always Love You' because . it played incessantly on MTV and VH1 while she in the dungeon. She didn't realize it until many . years later, but says now that she frequently watched Gusoff - then a . reporter for Long Island's News12 cable station - filing reports on the . police search for her while she was missing. 'It was like I had known her for 16 years' when they met in 2008 to begin work on the book, she said. Neglect: Marilyn Beers, Katie's mother, often left her young daughter with her godmother and husband, who sexually abused and raped her for years . Gusoff notes that as abhorrent as . Beers' sexual abuse and neglect was at the hands of her elders before . the kidnapping, it may have steeled her into a survival mode. Dominick . Varrone, the Suffolk County detective who led the investigation, . agreed, telling Gusoff in the book that 'because of her upbringing, the . sexual experiences, the abuse, and street smarts and toughness, she was . much more advanced than the normal nine-year-old, and we believe that . contributed to her survival.' Marilyn . Beers, who is described in the book as a hard-working but largely . absentee mother who ceded responsibility for raising Katie and her older . brother to Inghilleri's wife and others, did not return a telephone . message seeking comment about the book. 'I . hope that more does come out of the book,' Katie Beers said. 'I would . love to be able to help other kids or adults or to be an inspirational . or motivational speaker, something like that. But if I go back to my life in rural Pennsylvania and go back to my insurance sales job I would love that, too. 'I'm very happy with where I'm at.'

Thrill-seeking campers with a head for heights can now pitch their tents at the world's most extreme 'campsite' - 500ft up a sheer mountain face. Daredevils pay an eye-watering £750 - the same price as a suite at The Ritz - to spend the night suspended in the air on a small platform halfway up a mountain. The accommodation comes in the form of a 'portaledge' - an incredibly strong yet lightweight reinforced aluminum frame covered in canvas. Ultimate thrill-seekers' camping: Suspended 500ft above the ground on a canvass and aluminium ledge, thsi new experience in Germany is only for the fearless . The two-man platforms are hauled up the cliff face in the German Alps and secured to the rock using high strength climbing ropes and shackles. Campers have to scale the mountain to get to their bed for the night - and can only bring with them the bare essentials of a sleeping bag, a rope and a basic dinner. Fearless adventurers sleep alongside an instructor, who takes up the outside position just inches from the 500ft sheer drop. The two campers wear a safety harness to stop them falling should they roll off the portaledge in their sleep. Guests pay premium prices to get the opportunity to watch the sun set and rise from such a perilous position . Effort: Campers have to scale the mountain to get to their bed for the night - and can only bring with them the bare essentials of a sleeping bag, a rope and a basic dinner . The extreme camping experience is the brainchild of staff at Waldseilgarten-Hollschlucht, an outdoor activity centre in Pfronten, Bavaria. Included in the price is a day's climbing tuition by the centre's expert staff. The Waldseilgarten also offers a tree-top package where campers can sleep on portaledges dangling from the branches of giant beech trees or wooden platforms suspended above the ground. Robin Currie, a climbing expert and guide at Waldseilgarten, said there are three types of camping experiences on offer at the Waldseilgarten. 'With all of our camping you sleep in your harness for safety,' he said. 't would be pretty hard to roll off the edge of the platforms but if you did, you wouldn't fall far.' The first experience is on wooden platforms that are suspended above the ground, and is for beginners. There is also the chance to opt for a less scary, tree hanging ledge . When the weather is clear, the views are spectacular, although the ledges can swing rather a lot in the wind . Then there's the 'exposed' tree-top . camping, he said, where guests can sleep on a portaledge dangling 20ft . above the ground from the branch of a big beech tree in a forest . overlooking mountains. 'You can only get to the portaledge by climbing up a rope that hangs down from underneath it - so getting into bed is part of the challenge. 'The sleeping platform is pretty exposed - if it's windy, it will sway in the breeze,' warned Mr Currie. But he said the final option, known as the Big Wall, is the 'most extreme, and only for the most hardcore thrill-seekers'. 'As part of the ultimate experience you climb halfway up a mountain then pitch a portaledge right there on the face. Don't look down: These bizarre lodgings are not suitable for those with vertigo . But with those with a head for heights, they get to see the beautiful German Alps from a unique perspective . 'You're as high as 500ft and you're completely exposed to all the elements - we call it ""camping in the air"". 'The beauty is you don't have to be an experienced climber to take part, but you really do need a head for heights. 'It is without a doubt the most extreme form of camping you could possibly do. 'There's no-one else in the world offering this kind of camping experience - we are unique. 'It's certainly not cheap but it is an once-in-a-lifetime experience you will never forget.'","Thrill-seekers can spend a night on two-man platforms suspended on stilts, hanging from trees, or the ultimate accommodation - 500ft up a cliff face .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 12:14 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:15 EST, 5 September 2013 . A Narragansett man has filed a lawsuit against church officials, including the Pope, to try to silence the bells at a church opposite his Rhode Island home. John Devaney claims St Thomas More Church's bells have disrupted his life and contributed to the demise of his marriage. The 64-year-old, who is seeking unspecified monetary damages, said the electronic bell is sounded at least 700 times a week, which caused emotional distress, bad moods and arguments with his wife. Peal plea: John Devaney claims the chiming bell at St Thomas More Church, opposite his home, is disruptive . He has asked a court to order the church to lessen the amount of times the bell sounds so he can enjoy his property in peace, according to CBS Connecticut. Mr Devaney claims that when he bought his home - the former rectory - opposite the Catholic church 18 years ago, the bell was not working. About six years ago however, a kindly parishioner donated money to restore it. Since then, he claims it sounds three times a day, during the week, at 8am, noon and 6pm. On weekends, it sounds at 4.45pm on Saturdays, and 7.45am on Sundays, as well as for special occasions such as weddings or funerals. 'It's just a lot for a small neighborhood, a small historical neighborhood,' Mr Devaney told the Providence Journal. He added that the digital bell was amplified and broadcast on loud speakers, and said it rang out more than 36,000 times a year. The Catholic diocese has said in a statement that the ringing is reasonable and within its rights. A . spokesman said: 'So many in the community have enjoyed hearing the bell . for more than 10 years for but minutes a day. The parish believes the . brief ringing of the bell is reasonable and well within its rights.' Mr Devaney has argued that state law denies his rights under the First and Fourth Amendments to 'peaceful enjoyment of his property', . Defense: Church officials say the ringing is reasonable and within their rights as a place of worship . Gift: Narragansett church had been silent for years, until a parishioner donated money to restore the bell . He has named attorney-general Peter F Kilmartin, Diocese of Providence Bishop Thomas J Tobin, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, and the Pope as defendants in his lawsuit, and asked the town to enforce noise laws. A letter written last year to Mr Devaney, by the then town center manager Grady Miller, explained 'devices used in conjunction with places of religious worship' are exempt from noise laws, NBC 10 reported. A statement from the diocese said: 'The parish community is saddened that a sole individual would continue personal, inappropriate attacks harassing visitors, worshippers and staff of St Thomas More Parish. As a community of faith, we will pray for peace and understanding and that all our neighbors know of our charity and concern.'","64-year-old names Pope in lawsuit calling for ringing to be silenced .

It has been nearly 10 years since Jerry Carswell died suddenly while having treatment for kidney stones - but his wife claims she is still waiting for the hospital to return his heart. Mystery continues to surround exactly what happened to the former high school teacher's heart after he died unexpectedly at Christus St Catherine Hospital in Katy, Texas in 2004. His wife Linda claims the hospital continues to hold on to the organ, an allegation hotly denied by the hospital, which says it only ever removed a small sample to conduct an autopsy. Legal battle: Mrs Carswell (left) is still fighting to have her husband Jerry's heart (right) returned, nearly 10 years after he died suddenly in Christus St Catherine Hospital . Following her husband's death, the hospital had promised Mrs Carswell . that a full autopsy would be conducted to establish the exact causes. The mother-of-two claims that when the body was returned to her for burial, the heart was . retained by the hospital. A prolonged court battle has been raging ever since, which resulted in Christus being ordered to hand over $2million to Mrs Carswell in 2010 for medical malpractice. A jury ruled it had fraudulently obtained Mrs Carswell's permission to conduct an autopsy that she later found to be incomplete. The hospital was cleared of causing his death through negligence. But despite having to pay the financial compensation, Mrs Carswell claims the hospital remained in possession of the missing organ. The hearing also upheld much of the 2010 judgement. Mystery: The reasons Mr Carswell's death, at Christus St Catherine Hospital, have never been established . Mrs Carswell's lawyer, Neil McCabe, said the heart on its own could not prove Mr Carswell, who was a state championship-winning high school track coach, had died wrongfully. But according to The Huffington Post, his client would like to bury it beside her husband's body. Speaking to Houston television station KTRK, Mrs Carswell said: 'As . a family we can respectfully bury Jerry and come to some sort of . closure that we've done the right thing for the person we love.' According to Propublica website, the cause of Mr Carswell's death has never been established. In 2011, they claimed lawyers for the hospital did not want to return the heart, claiming it could be used as evidence if ever there was a retrial. In a statement, Christus said: 'It has been claimed that, without his family’s consent, Mr Carswell’s heart was removed during autopsy and that he was buried without it. 'However, the jury ruled otherwise, specifically finding that neither Christus nor the independent pathologist who performed the autopsy improperly retained any organ or portion of any organ from Mr Carswell’s body. 'Instead, a tissue sample from Mr. Carswell’s heart was retained by an independent pathologist, pursuant to written consent given by Mrs. Carswell.' The statement added: 'Tissue samples taken during an autopsy are extremely small, and a deceased person’s body remains essentially intact for burial.' Christus said in a . statement that it would appeal the issue of whether it . fraudulently got Mrs Carswell's permission for the autopsy to the . Texas Supreme Court. But spokeswoman Abby Lowe McNeil said Christus would not file any more motions related to Mr Carswell's heart tissue. St Joseph Medical Center said to KTRK that it would cooperate fully provided there were no more medical interventions. Mr McCabe said he is continuing to work with St Joseph's management to retrieve the heart.","Dispute continues to rage over what happened to Jerry Carswell's heart .

A photograph taken moments after the blast shows Bauman gray-faced with nothing but exposed bone below his knees and has become an iconic image of the terror inflicted on the city that day.

'We are very excited about this project,' Matthew Ballast, the Vice President and Director of Publicity for Grand Central, told TODAY.com.

A man applied tourniquets to his legs and then he was scooped into a wheelchair by Carlos Arredondo - a man in a cowboy hat - who helped rush him to an ambulance. The men have become firm friends since the blast - which left three people dead - and have been pictured side-by-side in hospital and as guests at Red Sox games. On the day of the bombings, Bauman underwent an emergency amputation to remove his legs at the knees, and two days later, flesh was amputated until four inches above the knees. Authorities have praised Bauman, who . also lost much of his hearing in the blast, as key to stopping Tsarnaev . and his brother Dzhokhar after he helped identify them as the suspects. Firm friends: Carlos and Jeff meet for the first time after the bombings at Boston Medical Center . Together: Bauman is wheeled out by Arredondo to throw out the first pitch at Fenway Park on May 28 . 'Even in the ambulance ride I was trying to say something, trying to say, like, ""I knew who did it, I knew what went on"",' he said in an earlier interview with NBC News. 'And then I think they were kind of thrown back by that.' Bauman added that he is now looking forward and, while he could wonder how differently he could have acted that day to avoid the blast, there is no point. Instead, he is focusing on his recovery, which has impressed doctors. 'It's insane,' he said. 'I'm a quick healer.

The father of a Cherokee girl at the center of a custody battle is to be extradited to South Carolina to face accusations that he interfered with a court order to give her adopted parents visitation rights. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed the extradition papers yesterday, ordering Dusten Brown to South Carolina for 'disobeying a court order'. Mr Brown has been granted an emergency stay to keep three-year-old Veronica, but he is accused of denying visitation rights to Matt and Melanie Capobianco, her adopted parents. Family history: Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . He surrendered to the Sequoyah County Court earlier today and was released on bond, according to Wistv 10. The Capobiancos, who have cared for the little girl from birth, have been locked in a custody battle for years with Mr Brown, the child's biological father. Veronica's birth mother put her up for adoption but Mr Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, fought the Capobiancos' adoption of her under the Indian Child . Welfare Act. Order: Governor Mary Fallin has signed extradition papers for Dusten Brown . In a statement yesterday, Governor Fallin said: 'Unfortunately, it has become clear that Dusten Brown is not acting in good faith', Fox News reported. 'He has disobeyed an Oklahoma court order to allow the Capobiancos to visit their adopted daughter, and continues to deny visitation.' The couple had their adoption approved by the courts on July 31, but last month Mr Brown refused to hand Veronica over, which led to an extradition order being requested. He faces charges of custodial interference in South Carolina. Governor Fallin had said last month she would not sign the extradition order if Mr Brown showed a willingness to work with his daughter's adopted parents. But, in her statement, she said: 'He is acting in open violation of both Oklahoma and South Carolina courts ... he has cut off negotiations with the Capobiancos and shown no interest in pursuing any other course than yet another lengthy legal battle.' An attorney for Mr Brown however, said the extradition order doesn't mean he will be extradited. Mr Brown will have a judicial hearing to argue South Carolina doesn't allege a crime, just a violation, according to News 9. Clark Brewster added that the Capobiancos had visited Veronica a lot, and said his legal team has offered to meet Ms Fallin to explain the situation but so far she has declined their invitation. Last week, Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to keep Veronica with her biological father. Access: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has granted an emergency stay to keep three-year-old Cherokee girl Veronica with her biological father . Court order: Dusten Brown leaves a custody hearing at Oklahoma Supreme Court on Wednesday . Denied: Melanie and Matt Capobianco have not been allowed access to their adopted daughter, according to the extradition order signed by Governor Fallin . Both sides were in a Nowata County . court last Friday. The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to . the Nowata court's ruling that Veronica should be transferred . immediately to the Capobiancos. The stay comes after Mr Brown turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina, where the Capobiancos live, and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption. 'This is my daughter,' Mr Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.' Mr Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office. Battle: Veronica with her biological father, Dusten Brown, who wants to raise her . Adopted parents: Matt and Melanie Capobianco were awarded custody of the girl they raised from birth . Last week, a lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of the three-year-old asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents - a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31. The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009 after which they raised the girl for two years. But Mr Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth. Mr Brown had never met his daughter . and, after Veronica's mother, who is not an American American, rebuffed . his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no . child support after the girl was born. The . legal proceedings began when Mr Brown found out Veronica was going to . be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored . the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl. South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos. South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Mr Brown's arrest, charging him with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4 — a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.","Adopted parents Melanie and Matt Capobianco awarded custody of three-year-old .

At peaks of 98 decibels, the black and white feline is as loud as the London Underground and a hand drill. And the 12-year-old rescue cat loves the sound of his own purr. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Purrfect pitch: Merlin, the loudest purring cat in the world, with his owner Tracy Westwood from Devon . He purrs when he wakes up. He purrs when he's hungry. He even purrs when he plays with his owner's Yorkshire terriers Bobbie and Muppet. But what he especially likes is being fussed over. Music concert: 140dB . Jet taking off: 140dB . Drum kit: 115dB . Pneumatic drill: 110dB . Night club: 110dB . 250cc motorbike:  95dB . Tube train: 85dB . Large office: 70dB . Owner Tracy Westwood, a tarot card reader and candle magic practitioner, said: 'Because of what I do people say I have bewitched it. 'It's a witch's cat. 'But that's just what Merlin does. He purrs really loudly.' The reason why cats purr remains a mystery. Domestic cats share the habit with cheetahs, pumas and tigers. They do it not only when contented, but often when they are sick or nervous, too — emitting a noise that comes from air flowing over their vibrating vocal chords. Mrs Westwood, from Torquay, Devon, rescued Merlin when he was just a kitten from an animal rescue centre in Kingskerswell. She said: 'It has always purred very loudly. I guess I'm used to it now. 'But when I'm on the phone I often have people asking me what on earth is the noise in the background. It's just Merlin the cat.' Mrs Westwood, 47, mother of Lucy, 28, and Alice, 19, knew Merlin was a contender for being the loudest cat in the world when she read about Smokey, the current record holder, in the Guinness Book of Records, which was officially recognised as the loudest purring domestic cat on record in 2011. Deafening: Merlin is tipped to be crowned the world's loudest domestic cat by Guinness Book of Records . Record: Merlin hopes to be crowned loudest cat after his purr was recorded at 98 decibels (pictured) Smokey is said to purr at 67.67dB which is about as loud as a classroom full of students engaged in a conversation. Owners Ruth and Mark Adams, from Northampton, said the 12-year-old British Shorthair can even drown out TV and radio shows and phone conversations with her ‘cooing purr’. Most cats produce sounds around 25 decibels. But Mrs Westwood said: 'We've measured Merlin at peaks of 100dB. 'We know he is much louder than that.' Merlin has been recorded on a decibel app on a smartphone at 75dB on average with peaks reaching an earsplitting 95dB and 98dB. Charts show that noise levels of 90 to 95dB can result in hearing loss after prolonged exposure. One chart puts the London Underground at 95dB but Merlin was recorded purring at 98dB which is as loud as a hand drill. Mrs . Westwood, who is hoping to have Merlin officially validated as the . loudest cat around, said: 'My oldest dog is completely deaf. 'Maybe Merlin's purred him to deaf.' While Merlin and Smokey’s purring may cause a right racket, the sound they make is a whisper compared with some of the real loudmouths of the animal kingdom. In fact, they can both be beaten by a saltwater shrimp, just 4cm long, which uses its vocal power to stun prey and the blue whale which reaches can reach an astonishing 188 decibels.

Before: The pool, one of two in the Victoria Baths building that received £3.4million of funding from the BBC, pictured empty . Unused: In the past, the pool was used to train both male and female professional and synchronised swimmers . First opened in 1906, the pool was the breeding ground for numerous swimming champions before it closed in 1993. At the time, swimmers took to the streets in protest to try and prevent the closure of the building - which includes two swimming pools and a Turkish Bath area. But as the Baths were expensive to run, they closed on 13 March 1993. Ten years later, the building won a public vote to receive £3.4m . of funding from the BBC show. Thousands of viewers voted for the beautiful building to receive the funding and work started almost immediately. Since then, that money has been spent restoring the building - . including a new £13,000 ‘Aqua’ stained glass above the gala pool, which was unveiled yesterday.

The striking window was created by glass specialist Design . Lights, based in Bolton, and includes 493 individual pieces of glass set into 12 panels. It was made using archive images of the original window, which had been boarded up since the Bath's closure. An additional £2million has been raised by the Victoria Baths Trust and spent on the work. But those behind the project say the . baths are a long way from being fully restored - and need an additional . £20million of funding to complete the necessary work. Gill Wright, Project . Manager of the Victoria Baths Trust, said the anniversary was a great day for the . baths and it signaled a landmark in its continued restoration. She said: 'Seeing the gala pool filled again today has reignited the excitement around the baths and our vision for the future. 'Had the baths not won BBC Restoration ten years ago, we would never have been able to achieve what we have. In action: Synchronised swimmers, Aquabatix, performed a routine in the gala pool . Making a splash: The swimmers performed a series of athletic jumps and dives to celebrate the 10-year anniversary . 'There’s still a long way to go but we are absolutely determined . in our mission to reopen the Turkish baths and one of the pools to the . public once again. We would like to thank those who have supported our . progress both locally and across the country, and invite them to join us . at our upcoming Heritage Open Days, which will be another chance for . people to explore the building and join in the celebration.'

"By . David Martosko In Washington . PUBLISHED: . 18:51 EST, 2 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:23 EST, 3 September 2013 . Syrian strongman Bashar Assad has challenged the U.S. and France to prove that he used chemical weapons against his own people. He claimed on Monday that while his armed forces might possess chemical weapons, Syrian soldiers would never have used them in an area where they themselves might be killed. French newspaper Le Figaro asked Assad to 'demonstrate' that his army 'did not resort to using chemical weapons on August 21 in the suburbs of Damascus in an attack that killed more than 1,000 people,' according to a translation published by Al Jazeera. Proof: President Assad says the U.S. and France need to show evidence that he used chemical weapons against his own people . President Obama and French President . François Hollande have accused him of presiding over the attack, which . U.S. sources said on Monday included the use of sarin nerve gas. But those claims, Assad said, remain mere accusations. And 'someone who makes accusations needs proof'. 'We challenged the U.S. and France to show us proof,' he said. 'Mr Obama and Hollande were incapable even when asked to do so by their own peoples.' Barack Obama is plotting more extensive action in Syria to crush Assad’s military and topple the dictator, it emerged today. The US President has been thought to be planning limited and targeted strikes to deter use of chemical weapons, after the deadly attack in Damascus which killed more than 1,400 people. But White House briefings for senior senators suggest the US military intervention will be much wider and more devastating. General Jack Keane, a former Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army, said Mr Obama wanted to ‘degrade’ Assad’s military forces while at the same time ‘upgrading’ those of opposition forces to trigger regime change. Speaking after talks with senators including John McCain, who has been briefed by the President, General Keane said: ‘The President has decided to deter the use of chemical weapons but also to degrade military capacity of the Assad regime. ‘At the same time he has upgraded the capacity of the opposing forces.‘And it’s the opposing forces that hopefully would be able eventually to topple the Assad regime,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Assad left open the question of 'whether . or not the Syrian army possess these types of arms'. But he suggested . that since some of his soldiers were among the casualties, any claim . that the attack originated with them was illogical. 'Suppose that our army wished to use weapons of mass destruction,' he speculated. 'Is it possible that they would do so in an area where they are themselves, and where soldiers were wounded by these arms, as was stated by the U.N. inspectors who visited them in the hospital where they were treated?' 'Where is the logic?' The Assad regime has suggested since August 21 that rebel groups launched the chemical attacks, a position that has won little backing internationally. But there remains little global appetite for military intervention in what has become a protracted civil war with near-global implications. The U.S, Britain and France quickly . lined up last week to recommend targeted military strikes, but David . Cameron suffered an embarrassing defeat when Parliament voted down his . proposal. The French . parliament will debate a similar measure on Wednesday, but with the . promise of new disclosures from the country's intelligence services, . which reportedly have tracked the Syrian chemical weapons cache dating . from before the Iraq war. The . U.S. may be the last to act. President Obama said on Saturday that he . will ask Congress to approve any military action, even though he has the . authority to order strikes without their permission. Mr Obama also has the power to recall . the full Congress from its summer break for an emergency session, but . he has not done so. With a scheduled return date of September 9, any . vote will be at least a week away. The Washington Post published . an informal 'whip count' on Monday afternoon, estimating current levels . of support among House and Senate members based on legislators' public . statements to date. No logic: Syrian dictator Assad tells a French newspaper his armed forces would not use chemical weapons in an area where they would also be affected . Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . 'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria . That accounting shows 57 of 100 senators undecided, with 23 in favor of military action and 20 opposed. It would take an effort of 40 senators to block any resolution. In the House, however, only 16 representatives have said they will vote to authorize military action against Syria and 91 said either that they strongly oppose it or are leaning toward a 'no' vote. Another 88 have said they are undecided, . and 240 have made no public statements. At least 217 'yes' votes will . be required to pass a House resolution. Investigation: UN inspectors collect samples from Zamalka, near Damascus . Report: Inspectors examine potential evidence of the chemical weapons attack in Ain Terma . Foreign affairs panels in the Senate and House will return to Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to hear testimony from Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel - a former Senate dove whose marching orders are now decidedly hawkish. Rather than being part of an open debate, however, those presentations are seen as components of a White House persuasion effort aimed at sparing Mr Obama the defeat Mr Cameron experienced on Thursday. As part of that effort, Mr Kerry and Mr Hagel, joined by National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, spoke to about 125 Democratic lawmakers during a conference call on Monday, with Mr Kerry insisting that Assad is a 'two-bit dictator' whose time has come and gone. Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President Biden meet with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to discuss Syria on Sunday . Assad, however, warned in the interview excerpts Le Figaro published online that military attacks against Syria could result in a regional war that would spiral out of control. 'The Middle East is a powder keg and the fire is approaching today,' he said. 'You can’t only talk about what the Syrian response will be, but what could happen after a first strike. And no one knows what would happen.' 'Everyone will lose control of the situation when the powder keg explodes. Chaos and extremism will be widespread. The risk of a regional war exists.'","Assad says attack would have been illogical as his soldiers were also among the victims .

The flight of the bumblebee might seem effortless to humans, but to stay airborne and give the impression of gliding along, the insects beat their tiny wings two hundred times a second. Scientists have long pondered just how the bees have the energy to achieve such a feat but now two biophysicists have studied the mechanics behind the insect's flight by capturing the action in molecular detail. The researchers filmed live bumblebees at 5,000 frames per second to conclude the insects' muscles might work by using 'stretch activation' - the same mechanism that makes vertebrate's muscles move. The researchers filmed live bumblebees at 5,000 frames per second to conclude the insects' muscles might work by using stretch activation - the same mechanism that makes vertebrate's muscles move . Dr Hiroyuki Iwamoto and Dr Naoto Yagi at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, explored whether insects have a special mechanism to stay airborne, or if they use nervous signals that lead to muscle contractions, like vertebrates. 'Once the insect flight muscles are activated by nerves, they oscillate simultaneously' Yale Goldman, a muscle physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told Nature. He said the oscillations are triggered by . 'stretch activation,' which means the force generated by the . antagonistic flight muscles increases in strength when they are . extended, to pull the wing back. The same technique is used in the human heart and other muscles that beat rhythmically, according to Kenneth Taylor, a molecular biologist at Florida State University. But because of difference in how the technique works in insects, there is 'no upper limit to the wing-beat frequency,' he said. To investigate what triggers stretch activation, Dr Iwamoto and Dr Yagi measured changes in the insects' muscles while they were trying to fly, at molecular level. To do this, they glued live bees onto the end of a thin metal tube and then put the insects in the path of an X-ray beam. They then studied the pattern of bright spots formed when the X-rays were scattered by the muscles, which they recorded at 5,000 frames per second. They concluded stretch activation is caused by the interaction of actin and myosin in the muscle- which is the same trigger as in vertebrates, suggesting that insects do not have a special technique to keep them airborne.","Biophysicists have studied the mechanics behind the insect's flight by capturing the action in molecular detail .

When used with a 3D printer, the Makerbot Digitizer can create anything from toys to practical objects such as furniture, simply by scanning a device that¿s already in existence . Created by New York-based 3D printing company, Makerbot, the scanner requires no special expertise or 3D modelling software knowledge. It works by scanning the contours on the surface of an object using several lasers. These lasers help capture details as small as 0.5 mm, and surface depth as shallow as 0.5 mm. The device then turns the data points into a computer model that can be used to replicate the object using a 3D printer. The system works by scanning the contours on the surface of an object using several lasers. These lasers help capture details as small as 0.5 mm, and surface depth as shallow as 0.5 mm . The device turns the data points that were collected with the help of lasers into a computer model that can be used to replicate the object using a 3D printer . The output is a standard 3D model file format (STL) and can be modified and improved in third-party 3D modelling programs, like Autodesk’s free software MeshMixer. Users can also upload their designs to Thingiverse, a website where 3D designs can be shared. However, the company has warned that expectations for the device should be realistic. 3D printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file. They work in an extremely simple way, by building up a 3D object from layers of material. Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base. Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Shoes, jewellery and even dresses have been created, with designs often sold online. Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms . allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a . replacement part for a broken household appliance. ‘You will not be able to, for example, scan a hamburger and then eat the digital design. Expectations for precision should be realistic, too. ‘The MakerBot Digitizer is not ideal for engineers who require very high precision scanning.’ The system is also unable to scan objects with surfaces that are shiny, reflective or fuzzy.

Last month electronics company Maplin became the first major high-street retailer in the UK to sell 3D printers. The group is currently selling the Velleman K8200 for £700. Tesco customers could also soon design their own items, go into a supermarket and have them printed in 3D. The group said it is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores. Ideas include digitally making clothing, furniture, personal gifts and even food in their shops.

Salinger starting in 1949 and waited 60 years to discuss her time with the reclusive author is finally spilling her secrets. After the author's death in 2010, Jean Miller finally opened up about the relationship to filmmaker Shane Salerno, who has made a soon-to-be released documentary on Salinger. Miller was just 14 when she began the relationship with the secretive Salinger and the flow of such revelations has gone from trickle to flood thanks to the upcoming film and a new biography. Scroll down for video . Revealed: It has now been revealed that Jean Miller discussed her relationship with reclusive author JD Salinger in 2010 after keeping silent for 60 years . Recluse: Many new revelations about J.D. Salinger have come out of a new documentary and biography about the author, including details of his relationship with Jean Miller, which began when she was 14 . According to CBS, Miller’s silence was a sort prerequisite to being a friend of Salinger’s. ‘I didn't want to talk about it because I knew [Salinger] didn't want me to talk about it,’ she said in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning. Miller opened up about Salinger, for the first time since she last saw him 60 years before, to Salerno after the author’s death. Among the intimate revelations—descriptions of Salinger’s spiritual nature and how deeply affected he was by WWII—was the disclosure that Miller had been just 14 when she met Salinger. Miller says the two met at a Daytona Beach, Florida Sheraton hotel. Salinger was 30. ‘I was sitting at a pool, I was reading Wuthering Heights. And he said, “How is Heathcliff?""’ Despite warnings from her mother, Miller continued the relationship, which consisted of long walks on the beach and the exchange of many letters. For five years, the friendship blossomed. Then, the two had sex for the first time and Miller would only see Salinger once more for the rest of her life. ‘I saw this glass curtain come down, and I just knew it was all over,’ she said. But she still remembers him fondly. ‘He wanted to go below the surface of your life,’ Miller said. ‘Jerry Salinger would say to me, a young girl, “Do you believe in God?” No adult had ever talked to me [like that]. Not only that, no adult had ever listened to me. ‘He once said to me, “If you ever lose track of me, just read my stories.""’ The authors of a new J.D. Salinger . biography are claiming they have cracked one of publishing's greatest . mysteries: What 'The Catcher in the Rye' novelist was working on during . the last half century of his life. Jean Miller was just 14 when she began her relationship with the secretive Salinger . Letters: Pictured is an excerpt from one of dozens of letters Salinger exchanged with Miller, a woman who would a model for the title character in his story For Esme With Love and Squalor . Questionable? Miller revealed she was just 14 when she first met Salinger and that the last time she saw him was after the first time they had sex 5 years later . The . new book and related film will be released next week and they both . claim that the novelist instructed his estate to release at least five . new books. Some of the work is brand-new, while other volumes extend existing stories and characters. Starting between 2015 and 2020, a series of posthumous Salinger releases are planned, according to Salinger, co-written by David Shields and Shane Salerno and scheduled to be published Sept. 3. Salerno's documentary on the author opens Sept. 6. In January, it will air on PBS as an installment of 'American Masters.' Providing . by far the most detailed report of previously unreleased material, the . book's authors cite 'two independent and separate sources' who they say . have 'documented and verified' the information. One . of the Salinger books would center on Catcher protagonist Holden . Caulfield and his family, including a revised version of an early, . unpublished story The Last and Best of the Peter Pans. Other volumes would draw on Salinger's World War II years and his immersion in Eastern religion. A . publication called The Family Glass would feature additional stories . about the Glass family of Franny and Zooey and other Salinger works. Salinger does not identify a prospective . publisher. Spokesman Terry Adams of Little, Brown and Company, which . released Catcher and Salinger's three other books, declined to comment . Sunday. Salinger's son, Matt Salinger, who helps run the author's literary estate, was not immediately available for comment. If the books do appear, they may well not be through Little, Brown. Scroll down for video . New classics? The new book, released next week, (left) claims the five upcoming works from J.D. Salinger will be both be completely new and add to much-loved stories like The Catcher In The Rye (right) In the mid-1990s, Salinger agreed to allow a small Virginia-based press, Orchises, to issue his novella Hapworth 16, 1924, which first appeared in The New Yorker in 1965. But after news leaked of the planned publication, Salinger changed his mind and Hapworth was canceled. No Salinger book came out after the early 1960s, as the author increasingly withdrew from public life. Over the past 50 years, there has been endless and conflicting speculation over what Salinger had been doing during his self-imposed retirement. That Salinger continued to write is well documented. Friends, neighbors and family members all reported that Salinger was writing in his final years and the author himself told The New York Times in 1974 that he wrote daily, though only for himself. 'There is a marvelous peace in not publishing,' he said at the time. But there is no consensus on what he . was writing and no physical evidence of what Salinger had reportedly . stashed in a safe in his home in Cornish, N.H. The . Salinger estate, run partly by Matt Salinger and Salinger's widow, . Colleen O'Neill, has remained silent on the subject since the author's . death in January 2010. Excitement: This billboard for the new film appeared on the Sunset Strip . The two did not cooperate with Salerno and Shields. Until now, neither Salerno nor Shields has been defined by his expertise on Salinger. Salerno is a Hollywood screenwriter whose credits include Armageddon, the Oliver Stone film Savages and a planned sequel to James Cameron's blockbuster Avatar. Shields is an award-winning author whose books include the novel Dead Languages; a nonfiction work on pro basketball that was a National Book Critics Circle prize finalist; and Reality Hunger, a self-described 'manifesto' for modern literature. Their 700-page Salinger biography has new information well beyond any possible posthumous fiction. Nine years in the making and thoroughly documented, Salinger features many rare photographs and letters, unprecedented detail about the author's World War II years and brief first marriage, and a revelatory interview with the former teenage girl, Jean Miller, who inspired his classic story For Esme - With Love and Squalor. It also has an account of how Salinger, who supposedly shunned Hollywood for much of his life, nearly agreed to allow Esme to be adapted into a feature film. Salinger both fleshes out and . challenges aspects of the author's legend. He is portrayed as deeply . traumatized by his war experiences and stunned by his post-'Catcher' fame. But he also . comes off as far less reclusive and detached than long believed. He does . agree to the occasional interview, even initiating discussion with The . New York Times, and appears sensitive to his public image. His . affinity for young people is not confined to his books, and Salinger's . biographers closely track his history of intense attachments to teens, . from Oona O'Neill in the 1940s to Joyce Maynard in the 1970s. The . book is structured as an oral history, featuring hundreds of new and . old interviews, excerpts from newspaper accounts and previous . biographies and commentary from Shields and Salerno. Those . quoted range from Salinger's children to authors Tom Wolfe and Gore . Vidal to Mark David Chapman, who cited Catcher as a reason he murdered . John Lennon in 1980. Salerno has been promising to make headlines ever since announcing the biography and film shortly after Salinger's death. Earlier . this year, he quickly arranged lucrative deals with the Weinstein Co. for a feature film, the producers of 'American Masters' for TV rights . and Simon & Schuster for the book. The . filmmaker himself has proved as effective as Salinger at keeping a . secret, with only a handful of people even knowing of the project's . existence during Salinger's lifetime. Fame: Salinger was an international celebrity before becoming reclusive . Salerno spent some $2 million of his own money and traveled throughout the U.S. and Europe in search of material. He is also adept at revealing secrets, with recent stories by The Associated Press and other media outlets, featuring photographs never previously published. Salinger never authorized a biography, but several unauthorized books have come out over the past 30 years, notably one by Ian Hamilton. In 1987, Salinger successfully blocked release of Hamilton's 'J.D. Salinger: A Writer's Life,' citing the use of previously unpublished letters. Hamilton described his legal battle in 'Searching for J.D. Salinger,' published in 1988.","Jean Miller met Salinger in Daytona Beach, Florida when she was 14 years old and the relationship lasted five years .

A pair of procrastinators have come up with a shocking way to tackle their Facebook habits -  a keyboard device that electrocutes them when they spend too long on the site. The Pavlov Poke gadget sits under the wrist of a computer user and monitors which sites and applications are used. If the user is meant to be working, but keeps getting distracted by Facebook, for example, or spends too long chatting on forums, the device sends an electric shock. Scroll down for video . Pavlov Poke, pictured, connects to a keyboard, monitors which sites are visited and gives users electric shocks when they procrastinate too much. It was created by doctorates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who wanted to reduce the amount of time they spent on sites such as Facebook and Twitter . Pavlov Poke is made of an Arduino board - a board that can be used to develop applications and service - that sits under the wrist of a user. The board is connected to a computer by USB. Users must install application logging software that is designed to monitor and track which programs and sites are used. The device connects to this software - the developers use the Apple Mac UI Inspector - and tracks usage. If the users spend too long on a site, a warning message will appear on the screen. If they continue to use it, the board will electrocute them. It was developed by Ph.D students Robert R. Morris and Dan McDuff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A video explaining the concept of the device claimed the pair 'wasted 50 hours a week procrastinating online' and they needed a way of tackling this. Pavlov Poke uses what McDuff calls 'counter-conditioning' techniques. It was named after Ivan Pavlov, famous for developing the theory of conditioning in dogs to make them behave a certain way.

There is also a phone version that involves a stranger calling the user, rather than an electric shock, and shouting at them for their internet use.

A cat who was found with a 27-inch arrow shot through his abdomen has survived after undergoing life-saving emergency surgery. A woman discovered the bleeding animal in a field in Waterville, New York 10 days ago and rushed him to Waterville Veterinary Clinic with the projectile still lodged in his side. The weapon had entered the cat's right side between two ribs before exiting from the left side of his body just behind his ribs - lacerating his liver, stomach and spleen. James Gilchrist, the managing veterinarian at clinic, said he and his team rushed the feline into surgery for the first of two operations. Cat-astrophe: In a photo taken August 22, the cat can be seen with a 27-inch arrow in its abdomen. The animal was found in a field and taken to a veterinarian clinic, where it underwent two operations . But Gilchrist shared the good news with the Utica Observer-Dispatch in an email. 'Two hours of surgery later followed by another surgery four days later, he is finally going to make it!!!' he wrote. It was initially reported that the cat has been adopted by a clinic employee and would go to his new home on Thursday, but a family also reached out to the clinic to ask if it was their pet, who went missing last month. Staff are looking into the call. It was suggested that the cat should be called Robin Hood or Arrow but the employee adopting the animal did not want a name reflecting the injury and he has temporarily been named Norman. Before he leaves the clinic, he will have his stitches removed but he is otherwise well. Feline much better: The cat, who has been named Norman, is now recovering after the surgeries . Missing death by a whisker: Police are investigating who shot the cat, who is expected to go home on Thursday .

The projectile pierced his ear and came out the back of his neck. Ninja ran away, but returned that night without the arrow. His family was stunned to discover that the feline had somehow managed to remove the arrow. The cat was taken to a local veterinarian to be treated for his injuries and is expected to make a full recovery, even though he still has a hole in his ear and neck.","Arrow lacerated his liver, stomach and spleen but he is now on the mend .

Charged: Royal Editor Duncan Larcombe (pictured) and two others will face court in May after being accused of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office . The Sun's chief royal correspondent has been charged after allegedly paying £23,000 for stories relating to Sandhurst over a period where Prince William and Prince Harry had been training there. Duncan Larcombe, 37, will face court alongside John Hardy, 43, who served as a Colour Sergeant at the Royal Military Training Academy, and his wife Claire Hardy, 39, the Crown Prosecution Service said today. It is alleged that between February 10, 2006 and October 15, 2008, 34 payments were made to either John or Claire Hardy. All three are to be charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. In a statement released by his solicitors later today, Mr Larcombe denied the charges. It read: 'Mr Larcombe categorically denies any wrongdoing and is entirely confident that the matter will be resolved and he will be exonerated in full. 'He is extremely shocked and disappointed that he has been charged with this offence. 'Mr Larcombe is renowned within the industry as being an upright and trustworthy individual and fully expects to clear his name.' Tracey Bell, 34, a Ministry of Defence employee, who worked as a pharmacy assistant at Sandhurst Medical Centre, has also been charged with one count of misconduct in public office. It is alleged that the civil servant received £1,250 between October 17 2005 and July 7 2006 relating to five articles published in The Sun regarding matters at Sandhurst. All these charges cover a period where the Royal princes were doing their officer training. Prince Harry entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in May 2005 and in April 2006 completed his officer's training. William joined in January 2006 and graduated from Sandhurst in December 2006, a ceremony famously attended by The Queen, his father the Prince of Wales and his future wife Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge. Allegations: The Queen inspects a smiling Prince William at his Sandhurst graduation in 2006, a period where The Sun's Royal Editor Duncan Larcombe is accused of paying for stories from inside the military training academy . Occasion: William's future wife Kate Middleton was also in the stands at Sandhurst with her mother Carole and a friend . The charges have come as a result of investigations under Operation Elveden, Scotland Yard's probe into alleged corrupt payments to public officials. Pleased: Prince Harry smiles broadly as his grandmother, the Queen, at his Passing Out . All four defendants are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 8. Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) announced the charges, adding 'There is insufficient evidence to charge a second member of the public with any criminal offence. 'These decisions were considered carefully in accordance with the DPP's guidelines on the public interest in cases affecting the media,' she said. 'These guidelines require prosecutors to consider whether the public interest served by the conduct in question outweighs the overall criminality before bringing criminal proceedings.' The charges come as a former Surrey police officer today became the latest person to be arrested under Operation Elveden, which is being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and is running in conjunction with phone-hacking inquiry Operation Weeting. The 41-year-old man was arrested at 6am this morning at his home in Sussex on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, Scotland Yard said. The arrest was the 62nd under Operation Elveden.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:27 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:27 EST, 1 August 2013 . America's most active death penalty state is running out of its execution drug, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said today. Texas' remaining supply of pentobarbital expires in September and no alternatives have been found. It wasn't immediately clear whether two executions scheduled for next month would be delayed. The state has already executed 11 death-row inmates this year, and at least seven more have execution dates in coming months. Death chamber: Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials say their remaining supply of pentobarbital - which is what they've been using to execute inmates in chamber like this one . 'We will be unable to use our current supply of pentobarbital after it expires,' agency spokesman Jason Clark said. 'We are exploring all options at this time.' Texas switched to the lethal, single-dose sedative last year after one of the drugs used in its three-drug execution process became difficult to obtain and the state's supply expired. Other death-penalty states have encountered similar problems after some drug suppliers barred the drugs' use for executions or have refused, under pressure from death-penalty opponents, to sell or manufacture drugs for use in executions. No executions in Texas were delayed because of that shortfall. 'When Texas raises a flag that it's having a problem, obviously numerically it's significant around the country because they're doing half the executions in the country right now,' Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-death penalty organization, said today. 'The states really scramble to go all over to get drugs,' he said. 'Some went overseas, some got from each other. But these manufacturers, a number them are based in Europe, don't want to participate in our executions. So they've clamped down as much as they can,' Dieter said. Executions take place in Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit (pictured) Some death penalty states, most recently Georgia, have announced they're turning to compounding pharmacies, which make customized drugs that are not scrutinized by the Federal Drug Administration, to obtain a lethal drug for execution use. Missouri wants to use propofol, the anesthetic blamed for pop star Michael Jackson's 2009 death - even though the drug hasn't been used to execute prisoners in the U.S. Its potential for lethal injection is under scrutiny by the courts and its first use isn't likely anytime soon. The Missouri Supreme Court has declined to allow execution dates to be set in that state until the legal issues are resolved. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster recently suggested that if a suitable execution drug can't be found, the state should consider the gas chamber. State law still allows for execution by lethal gas, though Missouri no longer even has a gas chamber. A return to the gas chamber or electric chair anywhere would be difficult, Dieter suggested. 'Those things just raise the spectacle level and I don't think it's where states want to go,' he said. Pentobarbital, which has been used along or in concert with other drugs in all executions in the U.S. the past two years, was more readily available because it was commonly used as a sedative. 'But I guess restrictions have been put on its distribution,' Dieter said. 'It's uncertain where all of this goes because it's inherently a medical kind of procedure involving some health professionals who are largely focused on keeping people alive. It runs into contradictions with executions - people strapped to a table. Executions aren't exactly what the medical model is.' Texas has by far executed more inmates than any other state in the U.S. since the Supreme Court allowed executions to resume. Since 1982, six years after the high court's order, Texas has executed 503 inmates. Virginia is a distant second at 110. As of May 2012, Texas had 46 of the 2.5-gram vials of pentobarbital, presumably enough to execute as many as 23 prisoners since each execution requires a 5-gram dose. The execution Wednesday of an inmate convicted in two road-rage killings was the 20th lethal injection since that disclosure.","Texas' remaining supply of pentobarbital expires in September and no alternatives have been found .

The claims state that the youngsters at the notorious St. Martin state-run care home near the Swarovski Austrian plant at Schwaz were employed to do 'piece work' on the crystals which are used in jewellery, fashion accessories and clothing. Reports stated they were paid next to nothing for their efforts. Forced labour: Swarovski has been accused of profiting from the forced labour of girls doing 'piece work' on crystals to be used in jewellery and fashion accessories . One girl - now aged 61 and identified as Johanna P. in an account in Austrian daily Kurier - claimed: ‘I was given a box with lots of little stones, tiny crystal stones. I had to lay the stones on pre-designed templates. ‘We worked from seven or eight in the morning until five or six in the evening. It was assembly line work. I do not remember getting a penny for my work.’ The homes housed many girls who had been sent there by their parents because they were unmarried teenage mothers. A former resident identified only as Hermine R. said: ‘It was exploitation of these young mothers. It was made out to be good work, but it was piece work. Love the bling: Celebrities around the world adorn their bodies, accessories and homes with Swarovski crystals including Katie Price, left, who has crystal studded tiara, piano and TV and Paris Hilton, right, who has a crystal encrusted mobile phone . ‘You would have expected youngsters . like us to have been paid good money but it was all collected by the . bosses who ran the place. 'This was exploitation of young girls who at 16 had become mothers and were assigned there by their parents or the state.’ The last names of both women were witheld from reports in accordance with Austrian media laws regarding privacy. The . reports stated that between 20 and 25 ‘nimble fingered’ girls were . employed on the Swarovski assembly line out of the factory and that most . of the work for the girls aged between 15 and 18 was implanting . crystals on to straps. St. Martin earned notoriety because of its strict regime and the fact that . the only 'crime' that most of its inhabitants had committed was falling . pregnant in the strictly Catholic region. Following . the report on Tuesday it emerged that two other Austrian companies - a . jam and marmalade making concern called Darbo and a light bulb . manufacturer - also took advantage of the cheap labour which was . arranged though the offices of the local authority before a stop was put . to it entirely. Encrusted mp3: David Beckham, pictured with wife Victoria, has an mp3 player that is studded with 12,000 Swarovski crystals . Swarovski board spokesman Markus Langes-Swarovski said an independent historian will be appointed to probe the claims. He said: ‘This has made me very concerned. I know nothing of such charges in connection with Swarovski thus far. 'An independent historian will be entrusted with the search for the facts.’ Swarovski is beloved the world over by admirers of bling: as well as necklaces, earrings and watches adorned with the firm's crystals, David Beckham has an mp3 player that is encrusted with 12,000 Swarovski crystals. Paris Hilton has a cellular phone encrusted with them while Jennifer Lopez's wedding band of white gold encrusted with Swarovski sparklers while Nicole Kidman appeared on the red carpet of the 2008 Oscars wearing a necklace that was a combination of diamonds and Swarovski crystals. Katie Price is the one who seems to be most addicted to the Swarovski crystals. She has a tiara made out of them, a piano studded with them and a TV smothered in them.","Austrian Swarovski firm has been accused of profiting from forced labour of teenage girls .

Merritt Landry, 33, of New Orleans, is facing a second-degree attempted murder charge after shooting Marshall Coulter in the head . A 14-year-old boy is in critical condition after a homeowner shot him in the head on suspicion that the child was about to rob his house. Merritt Landry, 33, of New Orleans, is facing a second-degree attempted murder charge after shooting Marshall Coulter in the head at 2 a.m Friday. The teen was unarmed and standing near Landry's vehicle, which was parked in the gated driveway in front of Landry's house on Mandeville Street, when he was shot. Police say the teen, who has a history of burglary arrests, did not pose an 'imminent threat,' according to the Times-Picayune. Landry . claims otherwise, saying Coulter made a quick movement 'as if to reach . for something,' so he shot him out of concern for his own safety, . according to an arrest warrant. Coulter was shot from 30 feet away, according to evidence recovered at the scene. He can't move the left side of his body and doctors say if he survives, he will likely suffer severe brain damage. The case has national implications in the wake of the George Zimmerman case, as Landry is white and Coulter is black. Zimmerman, of Hispanic descent, was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges after he shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed. Prosecutors claimed Zimmerman had targeted Martin because he was black. Landry . is an employee of the City of New Orleans. He works as a building . inspector for the city's Historic District Landmarks Commission. He is . married with one daughter and his wife is pregnant with their second . child. David Coulter, the brother of injured teen Marshall Coulter, says his brother has been involved in petty crimes but has never been violent . The teen was unarmed and standing near Landry's vehicle, which was parked in the gated driveway in front of Landry's house (pictured) on Mandeville Street, when he was shot . The teen had allegedly climbed over the gate to Landry's driveway, pictured here . Coulter's family says the teen has been involved in petty crimes, but has no history of violence. 'He would steal - he was a professional thief, sure,' Coulter's 23-year-old brother, David, told the Times-Picayune. 'But he would never pick up a gun, not in a million years. He was too scared to aim a gun at the grass, let alone aim it at a person. No way. Before he'll ever pick up a gun, he'll be your friend first.' 'He's still a little boy,' the brother added. 'Who pulls a trigger on a 14-year-old? What if it was your little brother or your sister? How would you feel?' Marshall Coulter's mother and grandmother are by the teen's bedside at the hospital. He is the second-youngest of eight children. The Times-Picayune spoke to a neighbor of Landry's, Charles Hazouri, who has surveillance video from the night of the shooting. He said the video, which he gave to detectives, shows two teens talking in the middle of Mandeville Street outside of Landry's house. One of the teens then climbed over Landry's fence, Hazouri said, while the other watched from Mandeville Street, according to Hazouri.","Merritt Landry, 33, of New Orleans, is .

The $8 cups quickly became fodder for jokes on social media and have just as quickly become a collector’s item. 'Figthing Irish'? Concession cups at Notre Dame football stadium were sold Saturday with the team's name spelled incorrectly . The Catholic University is known for its brawling leprechaun mascot more than for biblical fruits and the cups were, of course, supposed to read ‘Fighting Irish.’ Notre Dame refuses to say how many cups were shipped, but insists the error will be corrected by the next home game. Luckily for them, the typo only appeared on the larger size cups and not the more popular 32-ounce cup. A spokesman also declined to say how the error occurred or who’s to blame. Not telling: Notre Dame officials declined to disclose how many cups were sold or shipped with the error . ‘It's an institutional responsibility,’ Dennis Brown told ESPN.com Tuesday. ‘We're not going to be blaming individuals.’ The school has until September 21, the date of their next home game, to fix the problem. How will they accomplish this? ‘The solution is to correct them, which we will do,’ a clearly unamused Brown told ESPN. ‘It was an unfortunate mistake.’ Reactions on Twitter were more colorful. ‘Anyone else notice on the $8 cup they spelled fighting Irish as figthing Irish,’ asked user ‏@McMahon_Jerry63. ‘Nice,’ tweeted @kordr. ‘Let's go Irihs!’","The 50-ounce cups were sold at Notre Dame stadium in Indiana, which boasts room for over 80,000 fans .

Welcome to Sandy's Bar, not at the end of the street but plonked right in the middle. Just days ago this was part of The Sugar Bowl, summer hangout at Breezy Point's shore. Until it was ripped from its moorings by Hurricane Sandy and delivered to Gerritsen Beach, according to the people living there. Incredible: The Sugar Bowl bar was swept for seven miles from the Breezy Point area of New York to this location in Gerritsen Beach . How it used to look: The Sugar Bowl in Breezy Point before its extraordinary journey. It turned up in Gerritsen Beach complete with tables and chairs, shot glasses and an impressively stocked bar . An incredible journey of around seven miles, across the bay and made even more remarkable by the fact that it turned up complete with tables and chairs, shot glasses and an impressively stocked bar. With its clapboard walls and freshly painted window sills it looks like something straight out of The Wizard of Oz. Little wonder one local speculated that it had been picked up by the wind and dropped where it sat on Madoc Street, Gerritsen Beach. In fact one man knew exactly what had happened. Astonishing: The Sugar Bowl floated into Gerritsen Beach on floodwaters, ending up in the middle of a street. Locals quickly renamed it 'Sandy's Bar' Intact: The building's interior remained in remarkably good condition despite the extraordinary seven-mile journey . Venue: Gerritsen Beach resident Lawrence Lowey enjoys a beer in the abandoned bar which turned up in the middle of his street .

He said: 'I looked out my bedroom window and I saw what looked like a house just flying past. The water must have been five, six feet deep. 'I said, ""Ma we're in trouble!' It came in Jamaica Bay and smashed my gazebo, through my gate, ran over a car and just went down the road about five miles an hour like a steamroller.' Cycling up to where the bar sat askew .

According . to resident Billy Gooch, 'All of us here, we'd had the panic we'd been . through hell and the day after the storm we'd worked all day to save . what we could. Journey: This illustration shows how the bar was swept out into the water from its original location in Breezy Point before being washed up at Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn. Witnesses said it was travelling in floodwater up to six feet deep . Renamed: The revellers called the bar 'Sandy's Bar' after the superstorm and marked 'BYOB' on the side of it to instruct guests to bring their own bottles when the drink ran out... ...but the fun couldn't last forever, and the police ordered for the bar to be demolished and cleared away .

The first refreshed logo for Yahoo! in its 18 years was planned to the smallest, minute detail by CEO Marissa Mayer with her design team and comes after the Internet giant ran a month-long media campaign parading each rejected logo every day. Designed to build up expectation for the unveiling in a month which will see the launch of the new iPhone 5S and the final episode of AMC's 'Breaking Bad', Yahoo! finally released their logo at midnight EDT. Described by some tech-bloggers as having a 'parade of all the people you decided not to marry before your wedding', some of the designs have been praised, while others have been greeted with relief that Mayer did not plump for that particular one. Day One: This was the first logo released by Yahoo to illustrate how they came to choose their new logo . This futuristic logo was rejected by Yahoo! and released as the 22nd (left) such discarded while on the right the 20th logo released was clearly never going to be used . Day 5: Yahoo! CEO wanted to create an air of anticipation around their new logo and this effort was released on August 5th . Day 10: Despite the choice of CEO Marissa Mayer and Yahoo! executives, the logo unveiled on day 10 proved to be the most popular . Indeed, Kara Swisher at All Things D had some acerbic words for the rejected logos, calling Day 20 'what happens when I let those kids of mine play on my computer and they screw up the fonts.' While the new logo was apparently the best of the 29 options available to Mayer from her design team, the company still displayed the previous 29 online and asked the public to vote on them. Polar, the photo imaging app that allows users to compare two photos and vote on them reveals that the most popular of the 30 logos, including the chosen one, was the 10th day of the project. However, the new logo is not just an aesthetic change by Mayer. This jazzy logo was the 21st unveiled by Yahoo! and came just 10 days before the internet giant revealed their choice . On the left is the 4th rejected logo that Yahoo considered using while on the right is the 3rd that bears some passing resemblance to the original one . Yahoo's 11th logo was reminiscent of Coca Cola's iconic logo that has been in use for over 100 years . Since taking over as CEO of the web giant in July 2012, she has made a remarkable number of changes to Yahoo! and its products, including updating Flickr and Yahoo.com. Notably, Mayer has begun purchasing start-ups, including Tumblr for more than one billion dollars. The redesigned look unveiled early this morning is part of a makeover that Yahoo has been undergoing since the Sunnyvale, California, company hired Google executive Marissa Mayer to become CEO 14 months ago. She has already spruced up Yahoo's front page, email and Flickr photo-sharing service, as well as engineering a series of acquisitions aimed at attracting more traffic on mobile devices. The new Yahoo logo and (inset) the old one which has now disappeared . The shopping spree has been highlighted by Yahoo's $1.1billion (£720million) purchase of Tumblr, an Internet blogging service where the company rolled out its new logo. The logo was shown in purple spelling out the word Yahoo!, with no letters touching and ending with an exclamation point. 'We wanted a logo that stayed true to our roots (whimsical, purple, with an exclamation point) yet embraced the evolution of our products' a statement on the website said. In an effort to drum up more interest in the changeover, Yahoo spent the past 30 days showing some of the proposed logos that Ms Mayer and other executives cast aside. The revision is the first time that Yahoo has made a significant change to its logo since a few tweaks shortly after co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo incorporated the company in 1995. Ms Mayer's overhaul of Yahoo has attracted a lot of attention, but so far it has not provided a significant lift to the company's revenue. Yahoo depends on internet advertising to make most of its money, an area where the company's growth has been anaemic while more marketing cash flows to rivals such as Google and Facebook. Yahoo's stock has climbed by nearly 80%, but most of that gain has been driven by the company's 24% stake in China's Alibaba Holdings Group. Investors prize Alibaba because it has emerged as one of the fastest growing companies on the internet.

Crippling staff shortages and a failing system to screen criminals have left Britain’s borders in a state of chaos, officials warn today. Terrorists and offenders are slipping through the net, while tens of millions of passengers are arriving on flights and ferries without proper background checks, they say. In a devastating report, Westminster’s spending watchdog highlighted massive security flaws at the country’s ports and airports. Chaos: Officials were more worried about queuing times than rigorous checks . Open border: Crippling staff shortages mean that officials are being pulled off key checks for drugs, weapons and illegal migrants . The inquiry by the National Audit Office found the database used to stop terrorists, dangerous criminals and illegal immigrants getting into Britain – the Warnings Index system – is deeply ‘unstable’. Border security is being undermined by staff shortages, with immigration officials being pulled off checks on drugs, weapons and illegal migrants to help hit passenger queue targets, it said. It also uncovered a ‘culture of fear’ within the agency that prevents staff from raising the alarm over border lapses. Meanwhile, personal details on one third of the 106million people entering Britain every year are not handed over in advance, meaning nearly 40million do not undergo background checks before they land. Flying visit: MPs warned that border checks are so lax that so-called 'easyJet criminals' are flying into Britain and out again on the same day . The audit’s results came as MPs warned border checks in Britain are so lax that the country is at the mercy of ‘easyJet criminals’ who fly in and out on the same day without detection. In an evidence session with police, Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said foreign nationals with convictions overseas can enter the UK, go on a crime spree and then leave hours later without being caught. Even if police are hunting them, they are not stopped because border guards are not checking people as they leave the country. Revelation: Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said foreign nationals with convictions overseas can enter the UK, go on a crime spree and then leave hours later without being caught . Of the criminals who are being trapped by Britain’s biggest force, an astonishing 28 per cent a year – or around 70,000 – are born overseas. Half of them are from inside the EU, where cheap flights to Britain on budget airlines are readily available. Some 35 per cent of the foreign criminals have convictions at home but nothing was done to stop them entering the UK. Incredibly, 8 per cent of the foreign nationals picked up by the Met in London were wanted by police in their homeland but still arrived here unhindered. Police commander Allan Gibson replied: ‘That is a matter for the UK Border Agency because I don’t police people leaving the country.’ The NAO inquiry focused on the Warnings Index system to check for foreign criminals. It was set up in the early 1990s and was designed to last just seven years, but it has now been running for more than 20. Fed by intelligence from immigration authorities, police, security services and foreign governments, it will raise a ‘red flag’ when a suspect trying to enter the country has their passport scanned. This should prompt immigration officials to detain them for questioning. John Vine, of Borders and Immigration, has described it as the ‘single most important electronic check carried out by the Agency on passengers arriving in the UK’. But the NAO said the Warnings Index system ‘contains a great deal of out-of-date information’. Officials warned that as well as duplicate data it also contains a raft of errors such as the misspelling of a name which could allow a wanted criminal to waltz into Britain unchecked. Worrying: Officials warned that as well as duplicate data it also contains a raft of errors such as the misspelling of a name which could allow a wanted criminal to waltz into Britain unchecked . The whole system is ‘now unstable and at risk of collapsing’, they said. As part of the £1.2billion e-borders scheme to check those entering Britain, airlines and ferry companies are meant to send information about their passengers in advance of flights arriving in Britain. Labour ministers had intended the scheme to cover 95 per cent of flights by 2010 but the report revealed they are only collecting information on 63 per cent of passengers, meaning nearly 40million out of 106million arrivals are not advance checked before they reach Britain. Furthermore, a ministerial edict to hit queue targets, combined with staff shortages, meant there were not enough officials to carry out lorry searches for illegal stowaways or to search for weapons, drugs, counterfeit goods and cigarettes, the report said. Auditors said lorry searches were suspended 22 times in three days in April this year to deal with queues or to allow staff to take meal breaks. Staff were also ‘too busy’ to properly interrogate arrivals suspected of intending to remain in Britain illegally – allowing in hundreds every month who should have been turned away. In April last year the numbers refused entry fell to 64 per cent of the target. MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the public accounts committee, said it was ‘deeply worrying’ that the Border Force drive to cut queuing time came ‘at the expense of its other responsibilities’. Between 2010 and 2012, some 500 staff were cut out of the 8,000 Border Force workforce, as its budget fell by nearly £50million. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ‘The Border Force must be able to check both goods and passengers at the same time – border security cannot be an ‘either/or’ choice.’ Immigration minister Mark Harper said: 'The UK operates one of the most secure borders in the world and I am pleased the National Audit Office recognises the success of Border Force in implementing full passenger checks while also reducing queue times. ‘We inherited an organisation with significant challenges and, while some of these remain, I am confident that under the long term leadership of the new director general, Sir Charles Montgomery, Border Force will continue to build on its many areas of excellence. ‘We have recruited more Border Force staff, established command centres to deploy those staff more flexibly and effectively and are reforming working practices.’ Concern: Margaret Hodge, Labour Party Member of Parliament and chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), described the report findings as 'deeply worrying'","A National Audit Office report found massive flaws at UK ports and airports .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:29 EST, 4 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:02 EST, 5 September 2013 . The family of a 17-year-old found dead in a high school gym mat have called for investigators to reopen his case after a second autopsy found that his death resulted from non-accidental blunt-force trauma. The independent report, which was released by experts hired by Kendrick Johnson's family who had their son's body exhumed, directly contradicts the results of an autopsy performed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which named positional asphyxia as the cause of death. Lowndes County Sheriff's Office ruled the 17-year-old's death an accident, saying that the Lowndes high School student became lodged inside a rolled-up mat after falling in while reaching for a shoe. However, the family has a number of questions around the death particularly related to a group of students who were recorded on security cameras heading into the gym moments after their son. Scroll down for video . Life cut short: Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in January inside the school gym after going missing a day earlier. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT These gruesome photos handed to CNN by the Johnson family attorney show Kendrick's body wrapped in the mat (left), and his swollen, grotesquely misshapen face (right) His body was discovered on the morning . of January 11 in the high school's gym after his parents reported him . missing the night before. Now, attorney . Chevene King, who represents the boy's family, has sent the new autopsy . report cited by CNN to the U.S. Department of Justice-Civil Rights Division, the . GBI, the U.S. Attorney for Georgia’s Middle District and the Lowndes . County Coroner for review. The . next step in the case would be to call a coroner's inquest to decide . the cause of death in a process resembling a grand jury. After . noticing inconsistencies in the first autopsy report, the Johnson . family asked a judge for permission to exhume their son's body and . conduct another autopsy - a request that was granted in May. Kendrick's . body was scrutinized June 15 by the Florida-based forensic expert Dr . William Anderson, who concluded that the teenager died from blunt force . trauma to the right neck and soft tissues near the carotid artery, 'consistent with inflicted . injury.' King said the findings appear consistent with a possible assault. The results of the . independent autopsy appear to dovetail with the report written by EMTs . who first examined Kendrick’s' body on January 11, 2013, which indicated . that they observed 'bruising' to the right side jaw. Evidence: This sneaker was discovered next to the teen's body in the gym. It has been suggested that he fell into the mat while reaching for it . Inconsistencies: Kendrick's parents insist that their son, whose shoulders were 19 inches across, could not have even fit into the opening of the rolled-up mat . The . first responders' findings, however, were later refuted by subsequent . reports filed by the crime lab that handled the case and the GBI's . autopsy, which cited no significant injuries. A . spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the agency . stands by its report after reviewing the findings of the independent . autopsy. King said Johnson's family doesn't expect neither the GBI nor the sheriff’s office to take an objective second look at the case. Kendrick Johnson's parents have always questioned the official version of what happened to their son on the day of January 10, 2012, rejecting the idea that the athletic boy accidentally suffocated after being lodged in a rolled-up mat while retrieving a shoe. The parents suggested that their son, who was 5-foot-10, would not have tried to reach all the way down into a mat to grab his sneakers since the mat was about 6 feet tall and there was no way his arms could reach the bottom. Another key factor is the width of the opening of the rolled-up mat measuring 14-and-a-half inches across. The parents claim Kendrick, whose shoulders measured 19 inches across, would not have even fit into the opening. Also, a question has been raised as to why none of the people who visited the gym that day spotted Johnson’s legs sticking out of the mat, which would have been the case had he fallen in with his arms stretched out. It is likely the boy would not have lost consciousness at once, leading those skeptical of the investigators' version of events to wonder: why didn't Kendrick scream for help, and if he did, why none of the students who came to the gym to play basketball heard his voice? The sneakers, which are at the heart of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s theory, present another problem. If Kendrick fell while reaching to retrieve his shoes from the bottom of the mat, why did they end up lodged between his lower body and the inside of the mat, as if they fell in after him? Droplets of blood, which did not belong to Kendrick, were found on a wall not far from the teen's body, but according to the Johnsons, no effort has been made to determine whose it was and how it got there. Perhaps the biggest gap of all in the story is the mystery video showing Kendrick walking into the gym on the day of his death, followed by several other students. The sheriff's department has not released the footage, citing the fact that it depicts minors. ‘We have really no recourse but to see whether or not the Justice Department or U.S. attorney's office would come in and reopen the investigation,’ King said. The sheriff and his detectives spent nearly four months investigating Johnson's death before closing the case in early May. From the very beginning, Johnson's father, Kenneth, has been claiming that his son was murdered. 'I want to express how did my son go missing during school hours in broad . daylight? 'We know our son was murdered while he was at Lowndes High . School. We do know that,' he told a local television station in January. The teen's aunt, Anastasia Roe, said her nephew was a good student but ran into problems with another student last year, FoxNews.com reported. But the GBI autopsy found no signs of a struggle, officials said. It has been suggested by investigators that Johnson may have been reaching for a shoe that had fallen into the mat. A shoe was found at the scene, but it is not known whether it belonged to Kendrick. 'We feel like he was trying to reach a shoe that was down that hole,' the sheriff told the Valdosta Daily Times, adding that no one knows for sure why he reached into the mat 'but him and the good Lord.' Kendrick Johnson, a 5-foot-10, . 160-pound multi-talented athlete, attended classes on the morning of . January 10, 2012. Just after 1pm, he entered the gym, never to come out . alive. Some 8 hours . later, his mother, Jackie Johnson, started to worry that her son did . failed to make it home, Grantland.com reported. At around 11pm, she drove to and from school . looking for her son. After . midnight, the mother called 911 to report him missing, and was told by a . dispatcher that he was probably 'just out with some fast-tailed girl.' But . Mrs Johnson knew that her son always called if he was planning to stay . out late. At around 4am, she called police again and prayed through the . night. At around . 8.30am the following morning, Jackie drove to school to ask around about . her son. She was sitting in a guidance counselor office when she heard . the fateful words on the phone: 'the found a body in the gym.' According . to the sheriff’s department, a school security camera captured the teen . entering the gym at 1.09pm. What happened next remains unclear. Lingering questions: Kendrick's parents have questioned the official autopsy report, suspecting that their son was murdered . Second try: The Johnson family asked for and received permission to exhume their son's body for another autopsy in June . Harrowing discovery: The teen's body was found in the old gym at Lowndes High School in the south Georgia town of Valdosta . There was a gym class afterward and basketball practice in the gym that evening. Nobody found Johnson's body until the next morning. The sheriff told The Valdosta Daily Times on May 3 that students who didn't have lockers kept personal belongings such as gym shoes on top of rolled-up wrestling mats left propped up behind the gym bleachers. Investigators found some of Johnson's books and one tennis shoe near the body and believe they tumbled from atop the mat when a gym coach frantically pulled it over trying to free Johnson after students spotted his feet. ‘We did everything we knew to do, and this is a tragic accident,’ Prine told the newspaper in May. ‘But that's all it was - an accident.’","Kendrick Johnson, 17, was reported missing by his parents when he didn't come home in January .

Derek Thompson, 69, broke 22 ribs when he was attacked by an 800kg bull on his farm in North Yorkshire . A farmer who suffered 22 broken ribs after being trampled by a bull is on the mend - after being put back together with ‘Meccano’ surgery. Derek Thompson, 69, spent three months fighting for life in intensive care after being hit by the animal while rounding up his cattle earlier this year. Surgeons attached a number of titanium plates - similar to those in the construction toy Meccano - to his broken ribs to speed up the healing process, relieve pain and reduce the risk of complications. The intricate procedure was the first of its kind performed by surgeons at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Mr Thompson, from Northallerton, in North Yorkshire, said: 'I would think I was one of the most difficult cases they have ever had to save. 'Nearly all my ribs were broken, there was not much left. They are now held in place with plates that look like bits of Meccano. 'They are doing a marvelous job, there’s no doubt about that.' Mr Thompson was inside a pen, picking out bulls to take to the market, when an 800kg bull charged him. 'I had my back to one of them when he decided to hit me. He knocked me over and hit me again,' said the father-of-two and grandfather-of-four. 'My son knocked him off me and I walked up to the farmhouse and rang my wife.' He was taken to the local Friarage Hospital before being transferred to Middlesbrough and was in a coma until cardiothoracic surgeon Joel Dunning and orthopaedic surgeon James McVie operated on him. Until recently, the only treatment for rib fractures was to strap them up and take painkillers while they healed naturally - a process which can take months. They cannot be immobilised with splints in the same way as other broken bones are, as the ribcage needs to be able to expand and contract for a patient to breathe. But the pain - which can make taking deep breaths and coughing excruciating - can lead to complications such as pneumonia, because phlegm can build up in the lungs and become infected. Mr Thompson had surgery to attach curved titanium plates to each of his broken ribs (pictured). The surgery speeds up healing, relieves pain and reduces the risk of complications, such as pneumonia . Rib plating was first attempted in the 1970s and 1980s using metal plates and screws designed for other bones, such as forearms, but they were not flexible enough. Newer techniques, such as the Synthes MatrixRIB system, developed in Switzerland five years ago, use curved plates sculpted to fit the contours of a ribcage. Cuts are made to expose the affected ribs, which are repaired by attaching the plates with screws or wires. The operation typically takes around two hours and patients can be home within days depending on their condition and other injuries. Fractures then usually heal within six to eight weeks. The procedure, which costs around £6,000 to the NHS, was approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in 2010. The procedure was the first of its kind performed at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Image shows cardiothoracic surgeons Joel Dunning and James McVie who operated on Mr Thompson . Cardiothoracic surgeon Mr Dunning said: 'We now offer rib plating for major fractures and are one of only eight centres nationally doing this. 'This procedure will be a major help to our most critically injured patients and as a major regional trauma centre we estimate that this will help a lot of patients from the whole region, increasing survival rates and reducing their days on the intensive care unit.' Mr McVie added: 'I’m really pleased that Mr Thompson is recovering well from his major chest injury and surgery. It’s great that we can now offer this surgery here at James Cook as it will help future trauma patients.' In a study, fewer patients who had the surgery developed pneumonia than those whose ribs were left to heal naturally, and those who did not have the operation stayed an average of 10 days longer in intensive care. Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed. This could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity. The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, sees patients undergo a two hour operation which is available both on the NHS and privately. During the surgery, tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain. Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs. The recovery time from the operation is only a few days. The plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient's life.","Derek Thompson, 69, was trampled by an 800kg bull on his farm .

A father who feared his little girl would never hear him say ‘I love you’ has hailed the miracle treatment which has allowed her to hear for the first time. When Emily McMullan was born 22 months ago, doctors noticed something was wrong with her hearing and specialist tests revealed she was severely to profoundly deaf. Her father Paul, 34, and mother Rose, 29, struggled to deal with the news Emily may never hear, but threw themselves into trying to help her. Emily McMullan, 22-months, was born severely to profoundly deaf but can now hear after being fitted with a cochlear implant. She is pictured with her brother Adam, four, and her parents, Paul and Rose . The couple, from Baillieston, Glasgow, have now seen Emily come on leaps and bounds after she was fitted with a cochlear implant, which means she can hear and interpret sounds. Last December, when Emily was just 13-months-old, she had an operation to fit the implant. The following month it was ‘switched on’. Since then, there has been no stopping Emily, who can say ‘dada’, ‘mama’ and ‘look’. Accountant Mr McMullan said: ‘When we were told Emily was deaf, it was very emotional and upsetting. ‘I remember thinking, “She will never hear me say I love you”. ‘When she was four-weeks-old she went through three hours of tests at Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow, where they confirmed she was severely to profoundly deaf. Since the implant was fitted, Emily has learned to say 'mama', 'dada' and 'look'. Her parents say that she has come on in leaps and bounds since being able to hear . ‘But we realised there was all kinds of support available from the National Deaf Children’s Society and Yorkhill. ‘We were referred to the cochlear implant unit at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, were Emily was assessed for suitability to be fitted with implants.’ Doctors gave Emily the thumbs-up for implants but, in the end, they could operate only on her right side because a previous illness had left her with a calcium build-up under the skin around her left ear. However, even one implant is having a huge effect on the lively girl. Mr McMullan said: ‘Every time we hear a new word it is emotional and wonderful. Emily (pictured with her brother, Adam) was found to be deaf when she was just four-weeks-old. Her father, Paul, says he feared she would never hear him say 'I love you' ‘When I come home from work at night I wait at the front door and shout “Emily” and my wee superstar comes running out for a hug. ‘We can also take her swimming and she can keep her implant on rather than taking it off because they have developed a thing called an aqua kit to keep the device safe. ‘We are so proud of Emily. She has been through a lot in the first 22 months of her life but she is always smiling and is a happy wee person.’ The National Deaf Children’s Society has arranged weekends for parents of young deaf children and Emily’s parents say they have learned a great deal from speaking with others in similar positions. A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound. It . will not cure deafness, but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing. The . sooner a child receives the implant, the less therapy will be needed to . help him or her learn speech. The . device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic and the . procedure takes up to five hours. It involves making an incision in the . skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into . the inner ear. The . devices receives sound, processes it, and sends small electric currents . near the auditory nerve. The currents activate the nerve, which sends a . signal to the brain, which the person comes to learn as hearing. In the U.S., around 42,600 adults and 28,400 children have received the implants. Mr McMullan is so impressed with the charity’s work, that he is running the Great North Run half marathon on September 15 to raise funds for the Society . He has never run long distance before, but has been training for the big day. He said: ‘I felt I wanted to thank them for all the support they have given us over the past 22 months. ‘I want to make Emily as proud of me as we are of her. I am hoping to raise £1,000 and anything else is a bonus.’ Mr McMullan said: 'When I come home from work at night I wait at the front door and shout ""Emily"" and my wee superstar comes running out for a hug' Mr McMullan is running the Great North Run half marathon on September 15 to raise funds for the National Deaf Children's Society . Emily’s older brother Adam, four, is also enjoying being able to communicate with his sister. He even understands when she has not got the implant activated and asks his parents to turn it on. And the family is set for a new arrival because Rose is expecting her third baby, due to be born in eight weeks. Mr McMullan said: ‘It couldn’t be better for Emily - she has a big brother who will look after her and will soon have a wee sister or brother she can look after as they grow up.’ If you wish to contribute to Mr McMullan’s fundraising effort, log on to justgiving.com/Paul-McMullan2 .","Emily McMullan, 22-months, was born severely to profoundly deaf .

A photograph of missing teenager Kara Nichols has appeared on a Las Vegas escort website. The picture of the 19-year-old aspiring model appeared on MyRedBook.com but police said the photograph was taken from another source and that Miss Nichols did not post it. The advert promised that the girl pictured was the actual escort. But when officers called an accompanying phone number, members of Miss Nichol's family confirmed it was not her voice on the other end of the phone. Police leading the search for the model said that claims she was in LA were untrue. El Paso County Sheriff's Detective Cliff Porter told Fox News that escorts and prostitutes often use random pictures lifted from the Internet to advertise online. He said: 'We have no evidence that supports the claim that she's in Las Vegas.' She went missing after leaving her Colorado Springs home on October 9 and was last seen with a brown-haired woman who detectives believe may have information about the young woman's whereabouts. El Paso County Sheriff's Office previously called the case suspicious and said that Miss Nichols may have been exploited by an individual or group claiming they could further her modelling career.

Aspiring model: Police called a number linked to the advert but Miss Nicols's family said the voice was not hers . 'Even if this young lady has no information, just the simple fact that she could tell us how they parted, what her parting words might have been, could be huge,' Detective Cliff Porter previously told ABC News. Police are also seeking a second brunette who they said associated with Nichols, however they would not elaborate on the nature of their relationship or frequency of their contact. Mystery: Police in Colorado say it is 'really uncharacteristic' for Kara Nichols not to be in contact with friends and family . Miss Nichols told her roommate she might go to Denver on the day she vanished but left behind her purse. Friends and family said the woman was active on social media and regularly used her cell phone, but neither have been used since she went missing. 'All of a sudden that stopped -- no communication since then, especially from a person who was an extrovert, who was always reaching out to people,' Sheriff Terry Maketa said, adding that this made the case 'more concerning'. According to ABC News, images of the unnamed brunette released yesterday have resulted in numerous leads and the El Paso Sheriff's Office has recruited the help of external investigators to help with the case. 'Tuesday's press conference has resulted . in a number of valuable leads, and we are working tirelessly to follow . up on these leads. They are labor and manpower intensive, and we have . called on other units to assist us,' Detective Porter told the . station. Police said there was a strong possibility Ms Nichols was targeted by an organised group designed to exploit wanna-be models. Vanished: There has been no trace of the 19-year-old lingerie model since she made a call from her mobile phone at 11.45pm on October 9 . 'These . aspirations, we believe, have caused Kara to fall prey to a subculture . of modeling-business fronts that many times involve illicit drugs and . prostitution,' Sheriff Maketa said. This subculture could have exploited . a teenage girl who may have lacked the life experience to see the . inherent risks.' The 19-year-old lingerie model disappeared more than a month ago on her way to work. Police searching for the missing teen . said the young woman never made it to her job, and added that it was .

For instance, Mackenzie, the lone girl in the family, has always been comfortable on her own. 'She plays with the boys, but she's used to being an individual more than the boys,' Mrs Byler said. However, some of Mackenzie's brothers weren't so happy about the arrangement. 'Jackson, he cried,' Mrs Byler said. 'I'm not kidding you, he cried all the way to the classroom.'

A grandmother was murdered by a stranger in a blue pinstriped suit who tricked his way into her home as she prepared to go on a Saga cruise. Rosemary Shearman, 72, was waiting for a taxi to take her  to the airport when a man knocked on her front door. The widow is thought to have let him into her £500,000 detached house in a suburban street in Hornchurch, Essex, on Tuesday morning. He then killed her before using a weapon to injure himself, police believe. The taxi driver who was booked to collect her alerted neighbours when there was no answer at  her door. Last night one report claimed she was found with her hands and mouth bound with tape. Footage captured on a neighbour’s CCTV system shows Mrs Shearman pulling into her drive at around 10.30am. Moments later the camera  captures a man in a suit walking past and then following her into her house. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Rosemary  had come home in her car. Then just a few moments later a man in a dark suit appeared, just looking at the house. ‘He disappeared back up the street for a bit but then two  minutes later appeared back in shot, walking with real purpose towards the house. ‘He was carrying a big carrier bag which the police found in the house, but I don’t know what was  in it. ‘Then a couple of hours later the police arrived, there was some shouting, and we saw the same man in  the blue suit being carried out to the ambulance. We had never seen  him before. ‘It’s very strange, you don’t often see people hanging around in suits. Maybe he was just an opportunist. He may have seen her arrive back and saw the door open.’ The widow is thought to have let him into her house in Hornchurch, Essex, before he killed her . The man then used a weapon to injure himself, police believe and he was then seen leaving her home . Another neighbour added: ‘It is a . horrific thing to happen to an old lady who lived by herself. She was . lovely, a real character, and it is horrible what someone has done.’ Detectives . arrested the man, aged 50, at the scene.

"PUBLISHED: . 06:33 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:34 EST, 5 September 2013 . A bold plan to breath new life into Houston's ailing space industry has been unveiled with a futuristic spaceport designed to cope with increased demand from thrill-seeking tourists. The city announced yesterday that it had applied for a licence to build the United States' latest and biggest spaceport, and has already drawn up a detailed proposal of what the state-of-the-art facility would look if it gets the green light. The spaceport, which would be built on a 450-acre site that is currently home to the US military and NASA operations at Ellington Airport, would include a sleek passenger terminal and an aviation museum. Lift off: Houston has applied to build the latest spaceport in a bid to enter the commercial space race . Mario Diaz, director of Houston's Department of Aviation, said the spaceport would provide tourism from a terminal similar to airports, where . people would board and take off much as they would an aeroplane. But, according to the Chron, . when the aircraft arrived over the Gulf of Mexico, it would head straight up and give passengers a tour of outer space, before returning to earth and landing at the spaceport. The plan also includes providing accommodation for reusable launch vehicles, facilities to build space vehicles, training facilities for astronauts, and the ability to launch microsatellites. Mr Diaz said: 'How does the city dubbed ""Space City . USA"" hold onto the title in the 21st century? We think this is the . answer: the Houston spaceport.' Mr Diaz added with Houston's history of involvement in the space industry, it was natural that the city would want to build the latest space port. The city received a double body blow in 2011 when first the space shuttle fleet was retired, and then NASA decided to contract out future space station work to private companies. Although Houston remains home to more than 50 aerospace contract companies, the city has suffered the fallout from job losses. Futuristic: The spaceport would allow flights for space tourists, and would also provide facilities for commercial operations . The full cost of the spaceport has not yet been calculated, but Mr Diaz said the application process with the Federal Aviation Administration could take up to 15 months. If it is granted the licence it would hope the spaceport would be operational within five to 10 years. It could be paid for by a combination of funds from the private sector, city bonds and federal grants. Houston mayor Annise Parker said: . 'This is a new and exciting sector of the 21st century economy that . carries amazing potential for growth. 'We . believe a licensed spaceport in Houston would not only serve as an . economic generator for the city but it would also enhance Houston's . well-deserved reputation as a leader and key player in the aerospace . industry.' There are currently eight licensed spaceports in the US, including facilities in Alaska, California and New Mexico. Eight other locations, including Houston, are in various stages of development. Other areas in Texas working on spaceport proposals include Brownsville and Midland.","Houston enters commercial space race with bold plan for new spaceport .

Researchers at the University of Cambridge say the two conditions share many features, including narrow interests and rigid or obsessive behaviour . An anorexic girl’s obsession with food and calorie counting could be linked to autism, more commonly seen in boys. Teenage girls with anorexia have an above-average number of autistic traits, a new study has found. Some might even have autism that hasn’t been diagnosed. Researchers at the University of Cambridge say the two conditions share many features, including narrow interests and rigid or obsessive behaviour. And understanding the link could lead to new ways of treating anorexia, which accounts for around 10 per cent of the UK’s 1.6million cases of eating disorders. The researchers put 66 girls aged from 12 to 16 through tests used to identify autistic traits, comparing their results with those of some 1,600 healthy girls of the same age. Those with anorexia proved to be poorer at empathising – like  people with autism, who often have difficulty distinguishing people’s different emotions – and scored more highly on tests of ‘systemising’, an interest in pastimes with rules and patterns. In a broader test, five times more of the anorexic girls got a score within the range typically associated with autism. Researcher Simon Baron-Cohen, a leading expert on autism, said: ‘Traditionally anorexia has been viewed purely as an eating disorder. ‘But this research is suggesting that underlying the surface behaviour, the mind of a person with anorexia may share a lot in common with the mind of a person with autism. ‘In both conditions, there is a strong interest in systems. Anorexia is an eating disorder more commonly seen in girls, while autism, a neurodevelopmental condition, is more commonly diagnosed in boys. The new study has managed to link the behaviours in both . ‘In girls with anorexia, they have latched onto a system that concerns body weight, shape and food intake.’ Writing in the journal Molecular Autism, the researchers said it might be possible to help anorexics by shifting their focus away from foods to horse-riding, rowing or other pastimes that involve lots of rules and patterns. Dr Tony Jaffa, who co-led the study, said: ‘Recognising that some patients with anorexia may also need help with social skills and communication and with adapting to change also gives us a new treatment angle.’","Anorexics were found to have an .

Dante Dixon, 45, from Miami, Florida and Christopher Henderson, 32, of Akron, Ohio were both arrested on Monday in Ohio after authorities discovered their ruse. They face wire fraud charges. The two men made at least four flights between May and June after contacting Jet Aviation, a business aviation provider based at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and claiming to be top execs. Under the name 'Josh Stevens', they provided a fake email address they said was linked to the company - and were able to tap into a sham $350,000 line of credit issued by the company. High life: Dante Dixon and Christopher Henderson allegedly claimed to be bank execs to set up a $350,000 line of credit with Jet Aviation, which is based in Teterboro, NJ (pictured), for private jets . A man using that name called Jet Aviation's offices in Chicago, Illinois and Van Nuys, California in May to enquire about its private charter flight services, according to the criminal complaint released by the FBI. In the draft charter agreement, which was signed after being sent to the fake email, Dixon was listed as a vice president . and Henderson as a vice president of international affairs of the company. Jet Aviation was never paid for $164,911 spent on the charter flights between California, Ohio, New Jersey and Miami or $10,879 for limousine services used between May and June this year.

Russian mogul Boris Berezovsky may have been heavily in debt when he died, according to receivers . Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky may have left debts of more than £300 million when he died in 'tragic and mysterious' circumstances, the High Court heard today. A High Court judge said there was a dispute about whether or not Mr Berezovsky’s estate was solvent. But Mr Justice Morgan said reports from receivers who had analysed Mr Berezovsky’s financial affairs suggested that the estate was insolvent. And he said debts could total as much as £309 million. Detail emerged at a High Court hearing in London after one of Mr Berezovsky’s daughters asked to be allowed to become an executor of the estate. Mr Justice Morgan was told that Ekaterina Berezovskaya disputed that her father’s estate was insolvent and questioned receivers’ analysis. 'The dispute is whether the estate is solvent or insolvent,' said Mr Justice Morgan. 'Information from receivers points to insolvency.' He added: 'The receivers have told me a great deal about what they have uncovered.' The judge said he had seen detail of alleged debts and said the level of insolvency could be as high as £309million. Anthony Trace QC, for Ms Berezovskaya, said the judge was not in a position to decide whether Mr Berezovsky’s estate was insolvent. He said there were a 'number of things' receivers 'have not done' and questioned the adequacy of their investigation. Mr Trace said Ms Berezovskaya had been appointed executor by her father who had 'died in tragic and mysterious circumstances'. The home of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky in Ascot, where he was found dead in March . The judge is being asked to decide whether Ms Berezovskaya should be made a temporary administrator of her father’s estate pending further litigation. The hearing is due to end later today. Mr Berezovsky, 67, was found dead at his home in Ascot, Berkshire in March. A coroner has heard that he was found on a bathroom floor with a ligature around his neck. The oligarch, who last year lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, could have run up more than £100 million in legal bills since 2011. The 'Thunder B' yacht, which Russian authorities said belonged to Berezovsky, was seized on the French Riviera at the request of Russian authorities . In July 2011, he paid out Britain's biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova.Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100 million. He later built up fees totalling more than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout much of his battle with Mr Abramovich. Mr Berezovsky fell out with Russian President Vladimir Putin and often feared for his life - prompting speculation in Britain and Russia over the manner of his death. Even though police said they have found no evidence that anyone else was involved, it has not stopped widespread speculation.","Berezovsky was once the most powerful oligarch in Russia .

A Facebook user posted this photo of what she said was 'fizzy' yogurt that made a hissing sound when opened . Chobani, which is based in New Berlin, N.Y., did not say how many of its cups or what varieties were affected. The effort was voluntary and it is not issuing a formal recall. A representative for Kroger, the nation's largest traditional supermarket operator, said Chobani issued a product withdrawal Friday. 'It was not a food safety issue,' Kroger spokesman Keith Dailey said in an email. On Tuesday, Chobani was responding to people who were complaining about their yogurt cups on Twitter. One person described her cup as 'unnervingly fizzy,' another said the cups were like 'yogurt soup' and another said it tasted like 'wine.' Yet another person said the strawberry flavor they bought tasted 'really old.' Chobani, which says it uses only high-quality, natural ingredients, has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2005. Greek yogurt in general has surged in popularity as well, with fans saying they prefer its thicker consistency and relatively higher protein content when compared with the sweeter yogurt varieties that have long been sold in American supermarkets.

Seaside piers across Britain are under threat from rising maintenance costs and rocketing insurance bills, new research has claimed. Too many piers are trapped in a cycle of neglectful ownership with only periodic attempts at conservation, according to Jess Steele, the author of the People’s Piers report published today. She believes that a new option of taking piers into community ownership, which is being pioneered for Hastings Pier, could be the answer to the problem. Popular attraction: Despite around six million people visiting Britain's piers, including Brighton Pier, pictured, many could fall into disrepair (Stock photo) The report claims that 57 seaside piers are under threat, not only from corrosive sea water but from owners who fail to make provisions for the high maintenance costs and insurance bills, estimated at around £33m over the next five years. The study, published by the trade association Co-operatives UK, examines the ownership, usage and future of Britain’s piers. It highlights the crisis, offering a blueprint for their future revival as co-operatively owned assets for the benefit of the community. Seaside piers remain as popular as ever, with six million people a year visiting them, according to the research. Hastings Pier, which was ravaged by fire in October 2010, has been returned to local ownership ahead of a £14 million project to revive the battered Victorian structure. Most of the money has been raised by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), with help from the Coastal Communities Fund, the Community Assets Fund, Hastings Borough Council and East Sussex County Council. Work will start this month on the Grade II-listed pier in East Sussex and will be completed by spring 2015, turning it into the 'People’s Pier', officials said. Wreck: The Victorian Hastings Pier in Hastings, East Sussex, was one of many piers to have been hit by disaster when it was destroyed by fire in October 2010 but has been saved as part of a £14 million restoration project . Up to 95per cent of the pier was left a burnt-out eyesore when it was almost destroyed in an arson attack three years ago following years of neglect. Two men, then aged 18 and 19, were arrested shortly afterwards but the Crown Prosecution Service later said there was not enough evidence to bring charges. Ravenclaw, the Panama-registered owners, failed to do anything to the structure and when they could not be contacted Hastings Borough Council sought a compulsory purchase order so the pier could be handed over to specially set up trust called the Hastings Pier Charity. Salvation: Piers could be saved for the nation if more are taken into community ownership, the study claimed (Stock picture) Now it is in their hands, work will begin to renovate the substructure, refurbish the only pavilion still standing and to build a new visitor centre, a spokesman for the trust said. At present 56 per cent of piers are privately owned, with 39% in local authority hands and 5% in community ownership, the report said. It is calling for a fast-track compulsory transfer process to rescue important community and heritage assets and a presumption in favour of local communities taking ownership. Ms Steele said: 'More people live by the seaside than live in Wales and 10% of our national heritage assets are within a mile of the sea. 'Seaside piers make us smile. But too many piers are trapped in a cycle of neglectful ownership with only periodic attempts at conservation. 'We believe that there is a new option, now being pioneered for Hastings Pier, which is to take piers into local community ownership.' John Penrose, Coalition Minister for Tourism and Heritage until 2012, said: 'For piers across the country, exposed at all times to sea and weather, there is a real challenge in meeting the high financial costs of upkeep and insurance. 'I applaud the search for new solutions to our national assets that can harness the passion and commitment that comes with co-operative and community models.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'The complete turnaround in Hastings Pier’s fortunes is yet another great example of what is happening across the country when government gives power back to communities to decide how best to run things locally. 'A host of important local assets, from football stadiums to shops and pubs, are now being listed as community assets and I’d encourage seaside communities to nominate the piers they care about with their local councils as a first step to securing their future.'","57 piers across Britain could be closed forever, study finds .

In the Hollywood 3D blockbuster Avatar, the Tree of Souls mesmerised audiences with its vibrant blue and purple colours. But there's now an Earthly version giving the alien tree a run for its money - the breath-taking 10,000 square foot wisteria vine grove in Japan. These amazing photographs were captured at Japan's Ashikaga Flower park, home to hundreds of enchanting wisteria vines. Scroll down for video . Rare sight: A vibrant wisteria plant has been trained with careful pruning over numerous years to grow upright into a tree at the Ashikaga Flower park in Japan . Like something out of a fairy-tale: The view from beneath the wisteria trees in Ashikaga Flower park in Japan earlier this month . IT support worker Jeff Matsuya visited the park in May, and was blown away by the beauty and immense number of vines, held up by special poles that allow the plants to climb upwards. 'Most people react in surprise when they see the Wisteria, as at first sight you wouldn't guess it were a real plant,' said Jeff. 'This is always followed by pure amazement - it's hard to take your eyes off the wisteria when you're standing in the fairy-tale environment.' Jeff came across the park while researching online and decided he had to see it first-hand. Magical garden: The park contains a 10,000 square foot wisteria grove which visitors can walk through with the plant dangling overhead . Spot the difference: The wisteria plants at the Ashikaga Flower park bear a striking resemblance to the Tree of Souls in the Hollywood 3D blockbuster Avatar, pictured . He added: 'As soon as I saw images of the wisterias online, I immediately knew that I had to go and see it for myself.' Wisterias are climbing plants related to the pea native to North America, China and Japan. They were imported to Britain in the 18th Century and can be seen flowering this time of year across the country. Through careful pruning wisteria can be 'trained' to stand upright in a tree-form, rather than just climb up surfaces as is natural for them. These breath-taking photographs, also captured by photographer Koji Tajima, show how the vines range through a spectrum of colours from white, light pink, purple and red. A wall of flowers: The hanging wisteria is so thick in some parts of the Japanese park it is impossible to see through it . Years in the making: Wisteria vines normally grow along walls but with pruning and the use of special poles to hold up the branches, they can be manipulated into tree shapes . The park is home to hundreds of these spell-binding trees, ranging from shrubs, draped wisteria, to 260-foot-long tunnels and are said to be the most beautiful wisterias in the world. 'Having lived in Japan for ten-years, I couldn't believe I hadn't visited before,' said Jeff. 'There are so many places I'm discovering for the first time and this was just one of the ones that took my breath away. 'I spent the entire day walking around and taking photos as various scenes caught my eye, there was so much to see. 'Photographers will always continue to visit this magical place year-after-year, just to capture the growing beauty.' One of the largest wisterias, known as a 'Fugi Tree' in Japan, has been growing for 100-years, and forms a living umbrella of leaves over visitors.

These ghostly images reveal the forgotten harbour built off the coast of Normandy that for six months after D-Day became the world's busiest docks. British scientists have found the remnants of Mulberry B on the Channel seabed, which allowed the Allies to land troops, vehicles and equipment on French soil without having to capture a port first. The makeshift harbour, nicknamed Port Winston because it was the brainchild of Churchill, was the size of Dover and is considered to be one of the greatest military achievements of . all time. Discovery: The foundations of an breakwaters of Mulberry B - the celebrated World War Two harbour of Normandy - has been found by British scientists . Remarkable: The temporary harbour (pictured in 1944) was Churchill's brainchild and allowed troop, vehicles, weapons and supplies to be brought into France with ease . Vast: A vertical aerial photograph of Mulberry B taken by 541 Squadron on 27 October 1944 shows its scale and design . Its development was even described by Albert Speer - . Hitler's architect and armaments minister - as 'genius'. It allowed 220,000 men, 50,000 vehicles and 600,000 tones of supplies to be landed in France and undoubtedly helped win the war. Experts from the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO), which is part of the Ministry of Defence, have found that its structure still remains remarkably intact just months before the 69th anniversary of its construction. They fired a 'multi-beam echo sounder' at the sea bed off Arromanches Sur Mer and the 3D images it produced show that large sunken 'beetles', which supported floating roadways, can be found at a depth of five metres. There are also large chunks of breakwater structures. which protected it from storms. 'It was amazing to discover how much remained despite being pounded by the sea for all those years,' said Chris Howlett, who was leading the UKHO research. Structure: This 3D image shows a concrete beetle resting upright on the seafloor just north of the historic harbour . Haunting: The long length of breakwaters and floating 'beetles' has been found at a depth of five metres off the Normandy coast . Winston Churchill had proposed a similar . concept in World War One but it became a reality in the next war thanks . to Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes. Mulberry B was one of two temporary harbours built after D-Day. Mulberry A was installed at Omaha Beach, for . American invasion forces; Mulberry B was set up at Arromanches (Gold . Beach) for the British and Canadians. Only two weeks after D-Day, a massive storm destroyed Mulberry A. Mulberry B also sustained some damage, but was reinforced to keep it . operable at least until the end of October. Winston Churchill personally ordered the temporary harbours, sending a directive on May 30, 1942 to Admiral Mountbatten (centre), the head of combined operations. Hitler's architect Albert Speer (far right, with the Fuhrer) called the jetties 'an idea of simple genius' Mulberry B was left open until November 19 and Hughes was involved throughout, making adjustments and reinforcements. The pre-fabricated harbours were towed across the English Channel in chunks and put into place on the Normandy beaches. The plans were drawn up during an intensive seven-week period, from June 17 to August 6, 1942 - two years before D-Day. Churchill personally ordered the temporary harbours, sending a directive on May 30, 1942 to Admiral Mountbatten, the head of combined operations. It stated curtly: 'Piers for use on beaches. They must float up and down with the tide. The anchor problem must be mastered. Let me have the best solution worked out. Don’t argue the matter. The difficulties will argue for themselves.' Defence: A photo taken from the gun turret at high tide, probably showing Mulberry B's western breakwater. Note the open tops and gun turrets, equipped with a 40mm anti aircraft gun . Pride: Piers being built in a dry dock in Britain, probably in Southampton, before they were shipped across the Channel . Hughes was chosen to head the project with instructions to prepare plans for 'prototypes of landing piers to be towed across the Channel and sunk into place'. The piers were to be 'capable of carrying the heaviest tanks and artillery ... [and] of being towed from one assault beach to another....' He would also have to account for projected tidal and wind conditions at the beaches in France. Tasked with validating the plans, Hughes selected the estuary of the River Conwy in North Wales as a test site. Historic: This original sketch is by Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes, who devised two types of device, codenamed 'Hippos' (concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads) and 'Crocs' (steel roadways linking them together) Today: Remains of Mulberry B at Arromanches (Gold beach) in Normandy, used by the British and Canadians during WW2 . In late 1942 and early 1943, he recruited almost a thousand workers for the construction and testing of the mobile harbours. The project was so secret that even the men working on it were unaware of its true purpose. Hughes devised two types of device, codenamed 'Hippos' (concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads) and 'Crocs' (steel roadways linking them together). These were subsequently towed to another secret test site in south-west Scotland. There, Hughes’ efforts were integrated with prototypes developed by two other teams. The work at Garlieston, Wigtownshire in Scotland included development and testing of breakwaters, the idea for which came from engineer Robert Lochner. He had noticed while having a bath that when he made waves on one side of the flannel, on the other side the waters were calm. The Mulberry harbours were completed by May 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after. They were, as Churchill later wrote, 'to form a principal part of the great plan'.","Large chunks of Mulberry B have been found by British scientists .

A five-year-old Palestinian boy was filmed being dragged away for throwing a stone at Israeli soldiers who then blindfolded and handcuffed his father and marched them both in full public view to a police checkpost. Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said seven soldiers and an officer detained the boy, named as Wadi' Maswadeh, in Hebron for two hours before handing him over to the Palestinian Police. Video of the incident shows Wadi'a in floods of tears as he is dragged into an army vehicle before being taken to his home. Scroll down for video . Screaming: An Israeli officer drags five-year-old Wadi'a Maswadeh towards an army vehicle after he threw a stone at soldiers . According to B'Tselem, his mother refused to let soldiers hand him over to Palestinian authorities until his father came home. Around half an hour later, when the father Karam Maswadeh did return, both he and his son were taken to an Israeli army base where the father was blindfolded and handcuffed. Mr Maswadeh said: 'When I got home, I saw several soldiers standing at the entrance to my house. An officer came up to me and ordered me to get my son, Wadi'a. 'Before I got home, the soldiers had tried to persuade my wife to hand Wadi'a over, but she had refused to do it until I came back. 'The officer told me that he was going to arrest Wadi'a and hand him over to the Palestinian Coordination. Arrest: Plain clothed Israeli officers arrest the youngster on a Hebron street . Detained: Israeli soldiers surround the youngster as they wait for a vehicle to arrive . Ordeal: Clearly upset, the boy is led into the vehicle before being driven to his home . 'I asked him: ""Why arrest a five-year-old boy?"" 'A soldier standing next to the officer showed me a stone and claimed that my son had thrown it, and that it had hit the car of a settler who was driving north, near 'Abed checkpoint. 'I tried to persuade the officer not to take Wadi' to the DCO, but he said that if I didn't bring him, I'd be arrested. […] I went inside the house and got Wadi', who was hiding there. He was crying.' After handcuffing and blindfolding Mr Maswadeh, the soldiers walked him  together with his son, in full public view, to a police checkpoint, where they were detained for a further thirty minutes. At that point, a lieutenant colonel arrived whom the father, who speaks Hebrew, understood to be an Israeli coordination officer from the DCO. Smirk: An Israeli soldier grins at the camera as the boy is detained next to his blindfolded father . Humiliation: The boy is sat next to his blindfolded and handcuffed father at an Israeli police checkpost . The officer questioned Wadi' and asked . him why he had thrown stones. He also reprimanded the soldiers for . arresting the father and son in the presence of video cameras, and . complained that 'you're harming our public image'. The officer made it clear to the soldiers that, when detainees are held with cameras around, they must be 'treated nicely. At that point the father's hands were untied, his blindfold removed and he was given a drink of water. The soldiers then handed the pair over to the Palestinian police. They were taken to a Palestinian police station and briefly questioned before being released. Superior: An Israeli officer arrives and remonstrates with his soldiers over their treatment of the father and son while the incident was being filmed . The boy's father Karam Maswadeh eventually had his blindfold removed and was given a drink of water . B'Tselem Director Jessica Montell said detaining a child below the age of criminal responsibility, especially one so young, had no legal justification. She said: 'The footage clearly shows that this was not a mistake made by an individual soldier, but rather conduct that, to our alarm, was considered reasonable by all the military personnel involved, including senior officers. 'It is particularly troubling that none of them apparently thought any part of the incident wad problematic: not the fact that they scared a five-year-old boy out of his wits, nor threatening him and his parents to 'hand him over' to the Palestinian Police, nor threatening to arrest the father on no legal grounds, nor handcuffing and blindfolding the father in front of his son.'","Youngster was detained in Hebron for two hours before being handed over to the Palestinian Police .

Samsung has applied for trademarks for a ‘smartwatch’ that connects to the internet and can make phone calls. The Korean company is racing against its rival Apple to deliver the first watch that can surf the internet and make calls. Trademark applications in the US and South Korea describe the ‘Samsung Galaxy Gear’ as a wearable digital electronic device in the form of a wristwatch, wrist band or bangle. It has a flexible display that curves around three quarters of the device. A trademark application to the U.S patent office, pictured, has confirmed Samsung is working on a wearable device worn on a user's wrist. The filing affirms the company is working on a smartwatch-style device and that it will be called the Galaxy Gear . The first so-called smartwatch to become a mainstream product was the Pebble that launched via a Kickstarter campaign. It let users sync their phones to a wrist-worn device and receive notifications from Facebook, Twitter as well as texts and emails without getting their phone out of their bag. Rumours then emerged that Apple was working on what's been dubbed iWatch after a number of patents were filed suggesting it was looking to develop wearable technology. Androidly became the world's first fully-featured smartwatch earlier this year and comes with a 2-inch screen and runs the Android operating system. Sony announced its SmartWatch 2 in June but this device works in a similar way to the Pebble and not a fully-featured device. Rumours about a Samsung smartwatch began following a patent filing in June that suggested the device would be called Gear. This latest filing confirms that the name will be Galaxy Gear and it will be a wearable device capable of making and receiving calls. Apart from replicating the services of a smartphone, it could also serve as a health monitor. The device is also being rumoured to launch at an upcoming Samsung Unpacked event on 4 September. According to the filing, originally discovered by Dutch fan site Galaxy Club, Samsung's Galaxy Gear range will be 'wearable digital electronic devices in the form of a wristwatch, wrist band or bangle capable of providing access to the Internet and for sending and receiving phone calls.' It continues that the wristband will also be used for 'storage and/or transmission of data and messages and for keeping track of or managing personal information; smart phones; tablet computers; portable computers.' This latest filing follows one previously submitted in June by Samsung that described the smartwatch as a Samsung Gear, rather than Galaxy Gear. The Galaxy addition to the name would mean the device would fit in with Samsung's existing range of Android-powered Galaxy smartphones. Invites to Samsung unpacked event at this year's IFA conference in Berlin on 4 September have begun being sent out to journalists. Samsung could use this event to launch . the smartwatch as well as a new Galaxy Note 3 phablet - a cross between a . phone and a tablet. Samsung announced earlier this month it is 'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. Samsung's watch concept, pictured, shows a solid wooden band, and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running, for example . Sony announced its SmartWatch 2 in June but this device is classed as a 'phone remote' worn on a wearer's wrist rather than a full smartwatch with its own operating system. The SmartWatch 2 syncs with any Android phone and shows notifications on a small screen attached to a wristband. Samsung was expected to launch a smartwatch at an event in San Francisco last month but instead just confirmed it was 'investing heavily’ in wearable computers. The company also revealed it is developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. Sony announced its SmartWatch 2 in June but this device, pictured, is classed as a 'phone remote' worn on a wearer's wrist rather than a full smartwatch with its own operating system.

Officer, Young Sogn, told the Mobilebeat conference. ‘In three or four years, the number of people wearing computers will increase dramatically,’ Mr Sogn added and he believes that by 2020 the technology will be widely available. If Samsung does unveil a smartwatch in Berlin it could do so before rival Apple and its rumoured iWatch. Apple is set to announce a new high-end iPhone handset, as well as a cheaper model in September and it could use the same event to announce the watch. Dates for this announcement have varied between the end of August and October.","Trademark application to the U.S. patent office has confirmed Samsung is working on a wearable device .

A recent study shows that the more wealth a person gains, the more likely they are to become both stingier and lonelier. Patricia Greenfield studied a Mexican village for forty years and watched its residents grow progressively distant from one another as they became richer. And she says the same thing has happened to the United States as a nation. By surveying the contents of a million books printed between 1800 and 2000, Greenfield found that Americans have used progressively fewer words like ‘give’ and more like ‘get’ over the last 200 years, indicating a serious trend toward individualism she says is all because of money. Care to give: Studies find that getting richer often means getting stingier and lonelier because people require communities less as they become wealthier . ‘The frequency of the word “get” went up, and the frequency of the word “give” went down,’ Greenfield told NPR. Greenfield, a researcher with UCLA’s department of Psychology, used Google’s Ngram viewer to assess changes in word use over the years. ‘Words that would show an individualistic orientation became more frequent,’ Greenfield said. ‘Examples of those words were “individual,” “self,” “unique.” Words that would represent a more communal or more family orientation went down in frequency. Some examples of those words are “give,” “obliged,” “belong.”’ Greenfield’s findings also use her forty years of tracking families in Chiapas, Mexico, where she found that as villagers grew richer, tendencies toward individualism grew stronger and community bonds became weaker. Make more, give less: A study in 2001 found that the less money a household makes, the higher percentage of their income they contribute to charity . And Greenfield is not alone in her assessment that poorer people are more communal. ‘I saw it personally — I feel it in myself,’ said UC Berkeley researcher Dacher Keltner. ‘That somehow, when I am thinking hard about making more money and rising in wealth and enjoying materialistic benefits, I do feel personally that I am not as responsive to the needs of others.’ Keltner grew up poor and says he frequently attended barbecues and other community events. As he’s become wealthier and more independent, those backyard cook-outs have become much less frequent. To give or receive? Greenfiled assessed a million American books and found that the use of 'give' has declined markedly since 1800 . Still going: After the 1970s, the word 'get' sees a spike in use in American books, while give continues to drop . The professor of psychology studied money’s effect on individualism and generosity. He found that increased wealth leads to less generosity, charitableness, trust, and helpfulness. ‘In just about every way you can study it,’ he said. ‘Our lower-class individuals volunteer more, they give more of their resources — they're more generous.’ Both researchers have concluded that the poor simply need social connections more, that they’re more reliable on the community safety net. ‘The wife may make the clothes for the whole family,’ Greenfield found while studying the Mexican village. ‘The husband grows food and builds the shelter for the whole family. Therefore giving, social obligation, belonging to a family are very important.’ America’s wealth has come at a price, said Keltner. ‘As we rise in wealth, along with that rise in wealth comes ideas of individuality and self-expression and autonomy and freedom,’ he said. ‘And loneliness.’","A study from UC Berkeley's Dacher Keltner finds that isolation and a decrease in generosity occur as personal wealth increases .

The US president said proposed strikes against the regime were part of a ‘broader strategy’ to topple Bashar Assad, who is accused of killing hundreds of civilians with chemical weapons. The suggestion of ‘regime change’ emerged as tensions in the region were heightened further by the Israeli firing of two missiles in the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of yesterday. Scroll down for video . Confident: US President Barack Obama, who today met members of Congress in the Cabinet Room of the White House, said he thought a resolution paving the way for military intervention in Syria would be passed . President Obama’s remarks helped win support in Washington from sceptical Republicans, who have cast doubt on the value of a ‘symbolic’ strike in response to the use of poison gas. But they also suggested there is already ‘mission creep’ in the planned US intervention in the wartorn country, reflecting the fears of Tory and Liberal Democrat rebels who joined with Labour to defeat David Cameron over plans to join military action last week. Despite the crushing blow to the Prime Minister’s plans, Downing Street yesterday repeatedly refused to rule out doing more to support rebel leaders in Syria. Briefing: President Barack Obama held talks with Republican senators John McCain (left) and Lindsey Graham about his plans to degrade the Syrian regime . Sources said providing arms to the . rebels – a move opposed earlier this year by more than 80 Conservative . MPs – was ‘not on the cards’. However, . it is expected that Britain could provide more technical support and . equipment, including chemical weapons protection kit, and assistance in . areas opposition forces have taken from the regime. Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons that Britain is already the second-largest donor to humanitarian causes in Syria and promised that ‘we will do more’. Britain remains ‘highly active’ in seeking an end to the violence, he told MPs. Israel yesterday carried out a joint missile test with the US in the Mediterranean, leading to heightened tensions in the region. The firing was part of a  test of Israel’s Arrow defence system. The country’s defence ministry said the system successfully detected and tracked a Sparrow medium-range guided missile. Experts say the missile test is a sign Israel is taking seriously the possibility that any US air strikes could lead to retaliatory attacks, either by Syria itself or by its ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. Out: David Cameron, pictured with Michael Gove, announced in the wake of the Commons vote that Britain would play no part in military action against Syria . Mr Obama stressed last night that his . primary objective remained ‘limited and proportional’ attacks to degrade . Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities. But, . suggesting he plans to boost the rebels to bring about regime change, . he added: ‘It also fits into a broader strategy that can bring about . over time the kind of strengthening of the opposition and the . diplomatic, economic and political pressure required – so that . ultimately we have a transition that can bring peace and stability, not . only to Syria but to the region. Condemnation: William Hague used Foreign Office questions in the House of Commons to attack the Syrian regime for preventing vital humanitarian aid from reaching refugees . ‘We have a broader strategy that will . allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition, allow Syria . ultimately to free itself from the kinds of terrible civil war, death . and activity that we’ve been seeing on the ground.’ The . US president’s shift was welcomed by Republican Senator John McCain, . who offered to help him avoid a humiliating defeat in Congress next week . in exchange for a pledge to do more to back the rebels. London Mayor Boris Johnson said he believed Congress would back Mr Obama and insisted Parliament should ‘think again’ about UK involvement if Assad was confirmed as being behind the gas attacks. Mr Cameron said however: ‘Parliament spoke very clearly and it’s important to respect the view of Parliament, so I am not planning to return to Parliament to ask again about British military action.’UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned last night any ‘punitive’ action taken against Syria for an alleged chemical weapons attack would be illegal without Security Council approval or a sound case for self-defence. ‘As I have repeatedly said, the Security Council has primary responsibility for international peace and security,’ Ban said. ‘The use of force is lawful only when in exercise of self-defence in accordance with article 51 of the UN Charter and or when the Security Council approves such action.’ He also warned that a military strike against Syria could unleash more turmoil and bloodshed in a crisis that has already killed more than 100,000.","US President plotting wider attacks on Syrian regime, says ex-General .

A teenage waitress was handed a role in the new Richard Curtis film About Time - after serving the British director a slice of pizza. Set for stardom: Waitress-turned-actress Rachel Chew appears in the new Richard Curtis film . Rebecca Chew, 18, was working at a seaside cafe when Curtis, who is famous for romantic comedies Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually, came in for dinner with his family. Rebecca failed to recognise the famous diner, who was in Polkerris in Cornwall to film scenes for About Time, which stars Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams. After serving pizza to Curtis and his family, the teenager thought nothing more of last summer’s encounter until a month later, when she received a call from an assistant director. He explained that Curtis was on the hunt for someone to play a waitress in the time-travelling comedy and had been so impressed with Rebecca's service skills, he wanted her for the part. Rebecca was on holiday in Mallorca when she took the call, after completing a diploma in singing while working at Sam’s On The Beach restaurant. The teen, who accepted the role immediately, then joined Hollywood stars including Bill Nighy and Rachel McAdams on set. She said: 'I was on holiday so it was all very surreal. The assistant director called me up and said Richard Curtis would like me to play a small part in the film. 'I was in shock. I think he must just have seen me at Sam’s on the Beach and thought I might fit the role. 'It was a massive surprise. It’s quite an honour really and I love his films, like Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Rom com: Richard Curtis (front) with About Time cast members at the Somerset House premiere .

'Rachel McAdams came in later in the evening so the pizza must have gone down well.' Rebecca described filming her scene, in which she serves a sandwich to Irish Harry Potter actor, Gleeson, in a cafe as 'very nerve-racking' but says she hopes that catching Curtis’ eye will help her launch a career in musical theatre. Rebecca said: 'He certainly wouldn’t be a bad contact to have. There were quite a few takes but I don’t think that it was because I did anything wrong. 'I hadn’t done anything like this since school plays, and usually I was just a backing dancer or something.' Love story: Domhnall Gleeson plays time travelling Casanova Tim opposite Rachel McAdams' Mary . Curtis returned to Cornwall over the weekend for the premiere of the About Time, which opened in cinemas this week. The film follows the adventures of Gleeson’s character, Tim, who discovers he can travel in time and change what has happened in his own life. He uses his powers to romance Mary, whom he meets after moving to London to train as a lawyer.Speaking at the glitzy showbiz event in St Austell, Curtis lavished praise on Rebecca’s waitressing skills. He said: 'She was so sweet when she was giving pizzas to our kids that we cast her in the film and she came up and acted a crucial part of a waitress in Pret A Manger.

In Bournemouth, Dorset, the beach was crowded from early in the morning as sun seekers fought for the best spots. While some were there just for a day at the beach, thousands had travelled down to watch watch the annual Bournemouth Air Festival. People were forced to squeeze up for the final day of the specular show that featured marvellous stunts from the Red Arrows.

She said: ‘The weather is fantastic, I hope this is a sign of more to come. ‘We haven’t had a summer like this in years, so when I saw it was the first day of September on the calendar I felt disappointed as it means it’s coming to an end. ‘But with a gorgeous day like this it looks like I’m wrong, I’ll be keeping my fingers crossed for an Indian summer.’ How fly: A man prepares to launch a bird shaped kite at the Bristol International Kite Festival, held on the Ashton Court Estate on Sunday .

Graphic warnings on the back of cigarette packets will not deter teenage smokers, researchers have warned. Even though pictures tend to put young people off smoking more than the written warnings on packets, they are often put on the back of packs making them less visible and less effective, according to research published online in the journal Tobacco Control. The results come from two surveys - one of more than 1,000 11 to 16-year-olds in the UK in 2008 and a further 1,000 questioned in 2011. Graphic warnings on the back of cigarette packets will not deter teenage smokers, researchers have warned . Delay: Ministers say they want to consider the . impact of laws passed in Australia mean cigarette packets like these . show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking . Most of the teenagers in both surveys (68 per cent to 75 per cent) had never smoked while 17 per cent to 22 per cent had experimented with cigarettes, and around one in 10 were already regular smokers - defined as at least one cigarette a week. Half of those questioned in both surveys said they had 'often' or 'very often' noticed the warnings on packs, and around one in five had read them very often or looked closely at them. The number of teens saying the warnings put them off smoking increased between the two surveys, but not among regular smokers. In this group, the proportion who said that the warnings stopped them from having a cigarette fell from 32 per cent to 23 per cent. The teenagers' ability to recall images depicting diseased lungs, rotten teeth and neck cancer, remained below 10 per cent while three text warnings on the back of packs with no supporting images were recalled by less than 1 per cent in either survey. The authors, from the Centre for Tobacco Control Research at the University of Stirling, said: 'As warnings need to be salient to be effective, positioning pictorial warnings only on the less visible reverse panel limits their impact.' Glamour: Health minster Anna Soubry said she took up smoking because she liked the 'gorgeous' St Moritz packets . They said the fact the UK has used the same pictures since 2008 may also have increased the 'wear out' factor, particularly for regular smokers. 'Positioning pictorial warnings only on the back of packs may have had a deterrent effect on never and experimental smokers, but for most measures no significant differences were observed. 'The impact on regular smokers was negligible.' Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK's head of tobacco policy, said: 'This research boosts the extensive evidence that picture health warnings are very effective in reminding smokers about the dangers of tobacco. 'We know that well-placed picture warnings work and discourage young people from starting to smoke so we're delighted that the European Parliament will vote on legislation for picture warnings to appear on both sides of cigarette packs. 'UK law requires picture warnings to appear only on the back of the pack. This research shows why European legislation is so important. 'In the UK 207,000 young people start smoking every year and - of those who go on to be long term smokers - half will die of a smoking-related illness. 'We must do all we can to protect the next generation from becoming tomorrow's tobacco addicts.' Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said: 'The evidence is clear: warnings on cigarette packs help deter young people from taking up smoking, and the larger and more graphic they are the better. 'However, to be really effective, picture warnings need to be on the front of the packs. 'Currently the EU doesn't allow this but next week the European Parliament is due to vote on a directive which will require larger picture warnings on the front of all cigarette packs. The tobacco industry is lobbying hard against this. 'Ash urges MEPs not to let the tobacco industry succeed in its multimillion- pound campaign to delay the vote and derail the directive.' Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said: 'Everyone, including teenagers, knows there are health risks associated with smoking. 'Increasing the size of the warnings, or putting them on the front of the pack, will make no difference. 'If you want to smoke you will smoke, regardless of the size or position of the warning. 'If governments want to reduce youth smoking rates they should crack down on shopkeepers who sell cigarettes to children and tackle illicit trade. 'They could also ban proxy purchasing and make it illegal to buy cigarettes if you are under 18. 'Instead, tobacco control campaigners are obsessed with headline-grabbing measures, like plain packaging, that merely highlight the failure of previous initiatives.'","Warnings on back of packs making them less visible and less effective .

Reunion: Mark Newbould with partner Susan Garner, who was told her partner was dying by hospital staff and comforted the wrong man in an ambulance . Blundering hospital staff wrongly told a patient’s partner and son that he was fighting for his life. They were ushered into an ambulance to accompany Mark Newbould to a specialist unit. Susan Garner and Ryan Newbould were told that Mr Newbould, 53, who had gone to A&E with a bad back, had suffered a severe heart attack and was critically ill. In the ambulance, a distraught Miss Garner comforted the patient, whose face was obscured by an oxygen mask, kissed him on the forehead and told him she loved him. But staff at A&E had put the wrong relatives in the ambulance and the man Miss Garner kissed was a stranger of similar age, build and appearance to her partner. It was only when a paramedic referred to the patient by a different name that Ryan took a closer look – and realised from his moustache that the man was not his father. Mr Newbould, an industrial cleaner, had called an ambulance to his home in Skipton, West Yorkshire, because of agonising back pain. Miss Garner, 63, his partner of 14 years, came home and spoke to him as he was treated in the ambulance. ‘He didn’t look well, but he was certainly not on his deathbed,’ she said. She and Ryan, 26, followed the ambulance to hospital in their car. As they walked into the A&E unit . at Airedale Hospital in Keighley, a woman approached them and said: . ‘Susan, can you come with me? Your partner is seriously ill and we need . to get him to Leeds General Infirmary urgently.’ Confused: Susan Garner, 63, even kissed the . mystery patient on the head and told him 'it'll be okay', not recognising . him because of his gas mask . Error: While his family were on their way to Leeds, Mark Newbould was sitting in A&E at Airedale Hospital, West Yorkshire (pictured) waiting to be assessed and wondering where they were . Miss Garner said she did not question this as two years earlier Mr Newbould had nearly died from a serious heart condition.

Miss Garner said: ‘I really thought it was a sick prank, but they assured me it wasn’t. ‘My only slight comfort was that if . this man knew what was going on, he might have felt better knowing . someone was there from him.’ Miss Garner and Ryan had phoned their . workplaces to say Mr Newbould could die.

If the paramedics had asked Susan or Ryan if I . was allergic to anything or on any medication, they would have said “No” and this man could have been given something that may have potentially . killed him.’ Mr Newbould spent four hours in .

"By . Sheila Flynn and Gerard Couzens . UPDATED: . 20:19 EST, 14 January 2012 . Seven Mexican babies have been seized from Irish couples after ­police in Guadalajara smashed an international child-­smuggling ring. Officials said the couples believed they were following proper adoption channels but that the babies were actually being sold by their mothers. Up to 11 Irish families . were being questioned this weekend in connection with the scam, centred in the Guadalajara region of central Mexico, where four local women have been arrested. On display: The three Mexican women held this week over the allegations . The Irish couples, all of whom remained unnamed yesterday, were shocked and heartbroken to be told of the scam and to have to return the infants. ‘Some of them had the babies we’ve rescued with them because they were told that living with them was part of the process they needed to go through to adopt these youngsters,’ State Attorney Tomas Coronado Olmos said. ‘We have rescued nine babies in total, boys and girls. Two were removed from one of the women we arrested and another seven from the custody of ­foreign couples. ‘They are currently in state care,’ Mr Coronado Olmos added. ‘One is two years old and the rest are aged between two and eight months.’ Local DPP Tomás Coronado Olmos . Officials are thought to have uncovered the scam after arresting a 21-year-old Mexican woman in the town of Zapopan, about 10km northeast of Guadalajara, as she allegedly tried to sell one of her children for €1,000. The woman’s sister-in-law is thought to have reported her to the authorities. Three Mexican women, all aged in their early 30s, were subsequently arrested on suspicion of belonging to a child-trafficking gang. They are suspected of using newspaper advertisements to find expectant mothers who did not want to keep their babies – then buying the infants from the women and handing them over to wealthy foreign couples who travelled to Mexico seeking to adopt. The Irish couples were reportedly given the babies at a hotel in Guadalajara and sent to the nearby town of Ajijic, a popular retirement destination for Canadian and American expats, to spend a fortnight with the babies while adoption papers were processed. The processing was done in the neighbouring state of Colima. It is not clear whether suspected gang members intended faking documents or had corrupt local officials in their pay. The birth mothers are said to have been paid €70 a week plus medical expenses while they were pregnant. One local paper reported that after the mothers gave birth, the child-trafficking suspects got them to sign a contract permitting them to ‘hire’ their babies for €30 a day over a fortnight for use in photoshoots for publicity contracts. Instead, the babies were handed over to the foreign couples and the birth mothers were given a copy of the contract, which they used to justify their babies’ absence to friends and neighbours. Mexican authorities said the Guadalajara-based firm Lopez & Lopez Associates was involved in drawing up those contracts. It is not clear whether the mothers knew their babies would be given up permanently or whether they expected them back after the fortnight. Mexican lawyer Carlos Lopez has been arranging private adoptions in Mexico for Irish couples for at least seven years. He has been pictured in albums with other families who travelled from Ireland to adopt and is listed on various adoption websites. When the Irish Mail on Sunday called a number for his office, the number did not exist. Local sources said Lopez was facing child-trafficking charges and was now on the run. Officials have not ruled out further arrests. Investigators believe the prospective new parents were sent to Ajijic so they could blend in with the thousands of foreigners who have made the popular holiday town, on the shores of Lake Chapala, their home. Irish couples have been travelling to the resort town for years, mainly staying in the gated communities of La Floresta and El Parque. One woman, who has helped to arranged accommodation for Irish families in the past, said they stay anywhere from three to eight months to comply with Mexican government guidelines on adoption. ‘The women stay and the husbands often go back to Ireland to work,’ she said. As the arrests and investigation unfolded during the past few days, Ireland’s Adoption Authority issued a release on Thursday about intercountry adoptions involving Mexico. The Mexican authorities stated that all documentation must be sent by the ‘Adoption Authority of Ireland, or a body accredited by the AAI, to the Federal Central Authority’ – as per the Mexican notice on the Hague Convention website. The release also pointed out that Irish visa applicants must clearly state the actual purpose of their visit to Mexico and prospective adoptive parents need to obtain an adoption visa. ‘While some individual States within the Federal United States of Mexico may allow for private domestic adoptions outside public entities, there is no provision for private adoptions in the context of intercountry adoption,’ the release said. ‘No children under five years of age should be proposed for intercountry adoption, the only exceptions being children with special needs or sibling groups. ‘On the basis of the foregoing, prospective adoptive parents should not enter into any private arrangements with private individuals or private agencies.’ Previous adoptions advertised by Lopez – resulting in adoptions by Irish couples – had been described as ‘private’. A new life: The resort of Ajijic on Lake Chapala, where the Irish couples were told to go . Ajijic hotel owner Steve Cross, originally from Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh, says he has been in regular contact over the years with adoptive parents who have travelled to the area from Ireland. ‘This ran very smoothly until about eight months ago,’ he said. ‘One of the problems was that a social worker in Guadalajara – about 45 minutes from here – was telling the birth mothers just to sign up for the adoption process because the Irish couple would pay all their medical bills but then you could change your mind at the end.’ He said he hadn’t been aware of the current scam involving the 11 couples but he did know of continuing problems and changes within the adoptive process. ‘I know there’s one couple here at the minute who said they were given the all-clear to adopt – and then when they got to Mexico, the first email they opened was: “Don’t go to Mexico any more; it’s closed to adoptions.”’ Claire McGettrick of the Adoption Rights Alliance said: ‘We have always urged caution with inter-country adoption. However, unwittingly couples become part of such scams. We strongly urge child sponsorship programmes rather than adoption. ‘Intercountry adoption is really seen as a last resort after all other avenues have been explored. ‘There is a lot of money involved and this can lead to corruption. ‘If it is for the sake of the children, couples should look into fostering. There are so many kids in need of loving foster homes. ‘We come across this kind of  thing regularly. Guatemala, for example, is riddled with corruption. ‘People need to take a stand but we have a long way to go. ‘This was a near miss for the children and families involved.’ A spokesman from the Department of Foreign Affairs said: ‘Our embassy in Mexico is aware of the reports and is in contact with a representative from the group and a lawyer representing the group. ‘The embassy has requested details surrounding the circumstances of the case from the Mexican authorities.’ sheila.flynn@mailonsunday.ie .","Mother, 21, tried to sell baby for one thousand euros .

Tragic: Elouise Keeling, 14, died after she had an asthma attack while she was at an Air Cadet meeting . An inquiry has been opened after a 14-year-old girl died from an asthma attack while an ambulance went to the wrong address. Paramedics were called when Elouise Keeling collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets meeting at an RAF base. But a call handler is said to have sent the ambulance to another base seven miles away. By the time a second ambulance arrived at the correct location, crews were unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at the scene. Last night her mother Karen Keeling, 33, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘We are totally devastated by Elouise’s death. ‘We hope no one ever has to go through pain like this.’ Elouise was at an Air Cadets sports day at RAF Brampton on June 25 when she suffered the severe asthma attack despite not having participated in any games. A senior cadet called 999 at 7.44pm and asked the call handler to send an ambulance. But the crew was wrongly dispatched to RAF Wyton, on the other side of Huntingdon. When no ambulance arrived, cadet leaders made a second call to 999 and another ambulance was sent to the correct address. It arrived 19 minutes after the first call, more than twice the target time of eight minutes. The East of England Ambulance Service Trust yesterday admitted the delay may have contributed to her death and launched an investigation into whether it was the decisive factor. Delays: Emergency services were called when Elouise had an asthma attack but paramedics did not reach her in time and she died . Elouise’s mother had already reached the base when paramedics arrived and watched in horror as they tried to save her. Last night at the family’s £290,000 home, Mrs Keeling said: ‘We just want justice for our Ellie. ‘She was a bright, happy and healthy young girl who had so much ahead of her and so much of her life to look forward to. Missed: Elouise was described as bright, bubbly and popular by her school tutor . ‘We hope our daughter’s death means that no family has to suffer in this way again.’ She said: ‘They have heard the recording of the call and it was the handler who made the error. They sent it to the wrong place.’ Elouise was described by teachers at Hinchingbrooke School as ‘a bright, bubbly girl who was very popular, particularly with her tutor group.’ The ambulance service is investigating the death as well as another incident where paramedics arrived late. John Martin, interim director of clinical quality at the Trust, told its board meeting: ‘Both of these incidents focus around delays and they are being investigated to find whether this was the specific cause.’ Cambridge MP Julian Huppert criticised the Trust yesterday, saying: ‘It has been well-documented that there have been catastrophic problems with this service due to poor leadership which has resulted in the resignation of many of the directors.’ An inquest has been opened by the local coroner. Lost: Three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took 26 minutes to reach her after she had a fit and got lost again on the way to hospital . In December, 79-year-old Barry Edwards died after an ambulance took two-and-a-half hours to arrive. Mr Edwards only lived just over a mile from Addenbrooke Hospital, Cambridge, where he was eventually treated, but it was only after three calls to 999 that an ambulance was sent from 83 miles away in Great Yarmouth to take him to hospital. He died the next morning. In January an unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission warned the East of England Ambulance Service Trust to improve its care of patients after receiving several complaints from people who had waited up to three hours for an ambulance to take them to hospital. Later that month, police officers complained that they were having to take patients to hospital 'on a daily basis' because no EEAST ambulances were available, and were regularly having to wait 'an inordinate amount of time' for their paramedic colleagues to arrive at the scene of an emergency. A week later, firefighters warned that something was 'going seriously wrong with the 999 response' of the EEAST. They said they were waiting 'longer and longer' for ambulances to arrive and found paramedics often arrived alone on motorbikes or cars and were unable to transport patients to hospital. Keith Handscomb, of East Anglia FBU, said: 'Fire officers tell us of their desperate frustration at being told to . wait in line when chasing up emergency requests for the attendance of an . ambulance. Sometimes they are told the ambulance sent to their emergency has been . redirected to another call due to there being no other ambulance . available.' In March, three-month-old Bella Hellings died after she suffered a fit and the ambulance that was supposed to be taking her to hospital got lost twice. The driver had been relying on a satnav and took 26 minutes to reach her at home in Bury St Edmunds, more than three times the target time of eight minutes. They got lost again on the way to hospital, where Bella was pronounced dead.","Elouise Keeling died after having an asthma attack and collapsing .

Nolan was . said to have had a problem with their friendship. On . the day of the attack, Miss Hippisley sent a message to Nolan saying . she was going to a party with Mr Maxse and asking him to babysit their . daughter, but he replied saying he wanted to go to the party as well. She then sent him ‘a stern text message’, accusing him of trying to control who she was friends with. She . wrote: ‘I have tried not to hurt you but YOU AND ME ARE OVER NOW. You . cannot keep me captive any longer and decide who I can be friends with. I . will make my own choices. Get on with your own life.' Nolan sent a text back saying he did not mind who she was friends with and agreed to babysit. That . night, Miss Hippisley went to a pub with Mr Maxse. After they returned . to her house, Nolan appeared at the rear patio doors. Mr Kelly said: ‘He . strode past Miss Hippisley and said something like “how could you or . how dare you” before repeatedly punching Mr Maxse.’ Mr Kelly said 5ft . 6in Mr Maxse stood little chance against Nolan, who is 6ft 1in. Miss . Hippisley tried to restrain her ex-boyfriend, but he shook her off and . pinned his victim to the wall where he punched him again. Mr .

Deqa Hassan, 16, who grew up in Brixton, south London, was caught in the suspected suicide bomb blast in Cairo . A British teenager lost her leg during an assassination attempt on a high-ranking Egyptian government official yesterday. Deqa Hassan, 16, who grew up in Brixton, south London, was caught in the suspected suicide bomb blast in Cairo and has had her left leg amputated below the knee. Last night she described the attack, which police say was aimed at interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim. ‘I was walking with my friend and at the end of the street we heard the sound of an explosion,’ she said from hospital. ‘I just hit the floor. People were screaming everywhere. It was very scary.’ Deqa, who is of Somali origin, had returned to her parent’s home in Cairo from Dubai to attend school days earlier. Last month she wrote on her Twitter page she was afraid of returning to Egypt because of escalating violence. She said she now wants to return to Brixton. Deqa is among the more than 20 people reported to have been hurt in the blast. She and a child are among the most seriously injured. She added: ‘The people nearby were yelling that they were injured and being shot at. Eventually two policemen walked up to us. We were screaming for help but they just walked away. It wasn’t human.’ The minister was driving in a convoy near his ministry when the bomb exploded. Two alleged attackers were said to have been killed by security services. Eyewitnesses said they heard a man cry  ‘Allahu akbar’ after the explosion and a brief gun battle followed which left bullet holes down the side of the minister’s vehicle. Two men alleged to be attackers were said to have been killed by the security services. Mr Ibrahim  - who has overseen a violent crackdown on supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi - condemned the bombing which injured more than 20 people. ‘It was a heinous attempt. Even if I am martyred, another minister of interior will come and continue the war on the evil terror until we secure the country,’ he said. The attack is the first in the capital since the Muslim Brotherhood’s leader Morsi was deposed by the military in July. Scroll down for video .

The Director of Public Prosecutions is under pressure to review the ‘dangerous’ decision not to charge two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions for women who did not want girls. There was anger yesterday at the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to bring the cases to court, even though officials admitted there was a realistic prospect of conviction. The DPP, Keir Starmer QC, said it was ‘a very difficult and finely balanced decision’ but would reveal no more details about why it was reached. The reasons would be made public ‘in due course’. A CPS official said that pursuing the case was deemed not to be in the public interest because no abortions were carried out and because the doctors could be suspended or struck off by their professional body, the General Medical Council. Keir Starmer QC, the director of public prosecutions, says the CPS will not charge two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions for women who did not want girls . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has asked Attorney General Dominic Grieve for ‘urgent clarification’ of the reasons, and said abortion for reasons of gender selection is ‘completely unacceptable’. Nineteen months ago, the two doctors were secretly filmed by undercover journalists from The Daily Telegraph having consultations with pregnant women who pretended they wanted an abortion only because of the sex of their unborn child. This is illegal under the 1967 Abortion Act, which states that abortion is allowed up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy if having the baby poses a risk to the mental or physical health of mother or child. One consultant, Prabha Sivaraman who worked for private and NHS hospitals in Manchester, was recorded telling a woman: ‘I don’t ask questions. If you want a termination, you want a termination.’ At the Calthorpe Clinic in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Dr Palaniappan Rajmohan was also filmed agreeing to the procedure, telling the woman he would put down on the paperwork that she was too young. Sources close to the Scotland Yard investigation told the newspaper the cases were not being pursued for ‘political’ reasons because the case was ‘sensitive’. Yesterday Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry said the decision not to prosecute was ‘scandalous’. Prabha Sivaraman who worked for private and NHS hospitals in Manchester, was recorded telling a woman: ¿I don¿t ask questions. If you want a termination, you want a termination¿ . In a strongly-worded letter to Mr Starmer, she demanded he urgently review the decision, which she said would ‘completely undermine’ efforts to tackle violence against women and girls, and Parliament, which makes the laws. ‘This is a profound mistake’, she told the Mail. ‘Are they saying people who have a professional body should be pursued that way, and only people who don’t have one need to go to court and face criminal charges? This is ridiculous on so many levels. ‘Abortion on grounds of gender selection is a terrible crime, and the law is crystal clear on this.’ Official statistics released last year showed unusual variation in ratios of boys and girls born to mothers from certain countries. Mr Starmer’s predecessor, Lord McDonald, said he hoped the decision not to prosecute had not been made for reasons of cultural sensitivity. He said: ‘These offences are obviously sensitive, they are very difficult to detect and the statistics seem to show that they may be becoming more common in certain communities, so where they are detected I would have thought there’s a strong public interest in prosecuting them... to deter other people. ‘I certainly hope it’s not [for cultural reasons] because that would be a serious error and it would lead to partiality in prosecution decisions.’ Lord McDonald told Radio 4’s Today programme it was ‘a highly dubious proposition’ to say a professional alleged to have committed a crime should only answer to their regulator, and avoid charges. Jenny Hopkins, deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said allowing a termination on the basis of sex selection alone was a criminal offence. But officials had ruled there was no public interest in pursuing it because no abortion was actually carried out and because the doctors could be suspended or struck off by the General Medical Council. ‘On balance there is enough  evidence to justify bringing proceedings for an attempt,’ she said. ‘The evidence in this case was finely balanced and the law gives quite a wide discretion to doctors to determine when a risk to the health and well-being of a pregnant woman exists.’","Prosecutors will not bring case against the two doctors .

Shadow Attorney General called decision ‘scandalous’"
"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:35 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:35 EST, 5 September 2013 . Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said workers will strike if they do not benefit from improving economy . Britain could be hit by a wave of strikes if workers are not given bumper pay rises after five years of pain since the recession began, the boss of the TUC warns today. Frances O’Grady said people are feeling ‘frustrated’ and that they will demand ‘their fair share of the rewards’ over the next 12 months if the anticipated economic recovery gathers pace. Ms O’Grady said: ‘For most people, well for everybody that I’ve ever met, strike action is always the last resort. But people are feeling frustrated. ‘And I think what we will see perhaps if the economy is on the road to recovery people will want their fair share of the rewards. They’ve been told to tighten their belts for years now. They are looking to have a fair share of that recovery.’ There is growing evidence that Britain’s economy is recovering with the strongest growth spurt for more than 15 years. And the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicts Britain will be the best-performing major economy for the rest of the year. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke criticised Miss O’Grady. He said: ‘The Government has been working tirelessly to build the recovery and get people back into work. No sooner do things start looking up and the TUC want to take them out on strike again. They are completely out of touch.’ Ms O'Grady said the public was against the Royal Mail sell-off and was not in favour of firefighters working later in life. She said she had met with unions who have held or are planning ballots, and despite the 'hurdles' surrounding industrial action, there were ways the TUC could help spread messages to the public. Last year's TUC Congress called for a study into the practicalities of a general strike, but Ms O'Grady said it was more appropriate to focus on the disputes which were breaking out in a number of industries and sectors. Ms O'Grady said workers want a 'fair share of the rewards' after years of belt-tightening. (File picture of GMB Union rally) The TUC leader said she wanted to shine a spotlight next week on what was happening to ordinary families across the country, often struggling to make ends meet. 'Signs of economic recovery are obviously welcome, but they are not based on wage growth, they are based on household debt. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said the TUC 'are completely out of touch' 'There has been a 6 per cent cut in real pay since the crash, and people are still finding things very tough. 'We have big problems with youth unemployment and the new phenomenon of under-employment. Four out of five jobs created since the crash are in low paid industries, and nearly half are temporary.' Ms O'Grady said full employment, decent and affordable homes and fair pay were issues the TUC will be campaigning on, amid complaints of growing pay inequality. 'A smaller share of the national cake goes into wage packets, yet one of the best ways to boost demand is to improve workers' bargaining power. 'We must aspire to create more decent jobs rather than a new servant class on rubbish pay and precarious conditions.' Ms O'Grady said she believed Labour leader Ed Miliband will get a good reception when he addresses the conference next Tuesday, despite tensions over his planned affiliation reforms. The GMB has announced it will cut its affiliation funding from £1.2million to £150,000 from January following Mr Miliband's call for union members to opt in to joining Labour rather than being automatically affiliated, a decision which could cost the party millions of pounds. She said the payout of one year’s pay was ‘custom and practice’ for TUC leaders, which must be agreed by its executive committee. She added: ‘Who knows where we will be when I get to retire?’","Frances O'Grady said workers will demand 'their fair share of rewards'

Accusations: Paranormal medium Chris Date was giving a ghost tour around a hotel when a man was discovered hiding in the attic after 'ghostly sounds' were heard from the roof . The ghost hunters were gathered in awed silence in the stables of the inn when they heard a clear message from the other side – two knocks on the ceiling. It sent a shiver around the room, but one seeker of the supernatural still wasn’t satisfied. He chose to hang around in the hope of a close encounter – and  minutes later got more than he  bargained for when a ‘ghost’ popped out of the attic, very much alive. Now a row has now broken out between paranormal medium Chris Date who led the £12-a-head ghost hunt and the owner of the hotel who are both accusing each other of pulling the stunt. Hotel owner Paul Francis said he spotted the man leaving the attic just 20 minutes after the ghost tour and has accused the psychic of foul play. But Mr Date, 38, who calls himself the Knight Guider, yesterday denied being to blame for the mystery man in the attic at the Halfway Hotel in Llanelli, South Wales, and claimed he has been set up. The historic hotel has been used as a . coaching house with stables, a hospital, abattoir and even a prison over . the course of its 225 year history. There have been numerous sightings of ghosts over the years - including the spirit of a five-year-old boy. Mr Date brought seven paying guests on the ghost hunt to try and contact the spirit world. The ghost hunters were led into the stables of the hotel when medium Mr Date asked a spirit to knock twice in answer to a question. And the guests were hushed as two ghostly knocks were heard from the ceiling above. But just 20 minutes later, hotel staff and members of the public saw a man climb out of an attic near where the knocking sounds had come from. Location: Staff at the Halfway Hotel, pictured, in Llanelli, South Wales, claim they spotted a man climbing out of the attic after the ghost tour and promptly made him leave the premises . Halfway Hotel owner Paul Francis said: 'We gave him the keys to the hotel around 4pm in the afternoon to set up and I think he used that time to put someone in the attic. 'During the hunt later that night he was calling out to the ghost world and asked for them to knock as an answer. Well, it sounded like someone knocking on the front door. 'A member of staff . and a member of the public wanted to see if someone came down from the . attic where the knocking was coming from. 'Twenty minutes went by and then this guy jumped down. Our staff grabbed the guy and threw him out. 'He [Date] wanted his first evening running a ghost hunt to go with a bang but it backfired in a big way. Halfway Hotel owner Paul Francis said the man jumped down from the attic 20 minutes after the 'ghostly knocking' from the ceiling . 'He didn’t get away with what he expected to get away with.' Ghost hunt guest Mike Grimble, 43, said the attic man claimed he was homeless and had nothing to do with the spooky sounds. But sceptic Mr Grimble claims the 'homeless man' was wearing 'designer jeans'. He claimed psychic medium Mr Date drove away from the hotel shortly after the man was caught climbing down from the attic. Mr Grimble said: 'In life the only certainty, other than being born, is death. 'Billions of people have a religion and they are all looking for the same thing - that there’s something else after death. 'People who are looking for answers could be vulnerable.' Professional medium Mr Date denied allegations he planted a man in the attic to pretend to be a ghost. He said: 'It was nothing to do with me, I believe the whole thing was orchestrated to try and set me up, which is one of the reasons why I left. 'The knocking did not sound like what I am used to. I said on several occasions that it was odd, the noise was too extreme. 'I take what I am doing very seriously. I believe in what I do so I would never do anything like this. 'I have got a very good track record. It’s disgusting, I would never do that.' On Mr Date’s website he is described as 'a great intuitive reader who speaks from the heart'. It tells potential customers: 'If you are lost and need to find your way again or if you need reassurance then a reading from Knight Guider is for you. 'A male medium with a strong spiritual guide who comes forward to help enable connections with those who have passed over.'

Michael Gove yesterday told teachers they had never had it so good – as a fresh round of strikes was launched. The Education Secretary said there was ‘no excuse’ for the industrial action that will close thousands of schools and disrupt the education of millions of children.

"By . Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 18:46 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:44 EST, 6 September 2013 . Mr Duncan Smith said officials had kept him in the dark about problems . Iain Duncan Smith accused his own civil servants of a lack of ‘professionalism’ yesterday as the row deepened over the Government’s troubled  welfare reforms. The Work and Pensions Secretary said he had ‘lost faith’ in the ability of Whitehall mandarins to deliver the  flagship Universal Credit scheme, and had now turned to outside experts. Mr Duncan Smith said officials had kept him in the dark about problems with the £2.4billion scheme, which was severely criticised by the National Audit Office yesterday. He said some officials ‘did not tell the truth’ about how the project was going. In a devastating report, the Whitehall spending watchdog said Universal Credit has been beset by ‘weak management, ineffective  control and poor governance’. The scheme, which will replace a string of out-of-work benefits, is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours. The NAO said the complex project, which so far has only been tested in pilot schemes, has ‘not achieved value for money’ – and suggested plans to extend it nationally by 2017 should be delayed. But, in a finding that was seized on by Mr Duncan Smith, the watchdog also accused officials of developing a ‘fortress mentality’ and a culture of only passing on good news. He insisted the scheme would be delivered ‘on time and in budget’, despite problems with the computer system that have already led to £34million of equipment being written-off. The BBC reported yesterday that a further £162million could be written off in the coming weeks. Former chancellor Alistair Darling accused him of ¿blaming all those around him for letting him down¿ . Mr Duncan Smith said he had intervened last year to bring in new managers to get the project back on track. ‘I never expected to have to do that,’ he told the Commons. ‘When I arrived, I expected professionalism to be able to do this.’ His comments angered Labour MPs, who said Mr Duncan Smith should take responsibility for the problems with the project. Former chancellor Alistair Darling accused him of ‘blaming all those around him for letting him down’. He added: ‘I’ve listened to you, claiming that this is on track and in budget, which I find extraordinary since the National Audit Office says this is anything but.’ Mr Darling said he had looked at a similar scheme when he was in Government and been warned it would be ‘technically difficult, if not impossible, to deliver at a reasonable cost’. Labour MP Andrew Miller told Mr Duncan Smith: ‘Can I remind you that it was you who signed off the contract which led to those project management failures. So, rather than simply blaming civil servants, why don’t you accept the blame yourself?’ During angry exchanges Labour work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne suggested Mr Duncan Smith had misled the public and MPs by repeatedly claiming the project was going well, despite major concerns behind the scenes. He urged him to apologise. Referring to Mr Duncan Smith’s description of himself as ‘the Quiet Man’ when he was Tory leader, Mr Byrne said: ‘The Quiet Man must not become the Cover-Up Man.’ Mr Duncan Smith snapped back that Mr Byrne’s criticisms were ‘pathetic’. He was backed by Downing Street yesterday, which said it was confident the 2017 target would be met, despite a string of delays. The NAO report underlines concerns within Whitehall that the Government’s biggest single reform is in danger of going off track. The report found the IT system could not identify potentially fraudulent claims, meaning manual checks were needed on claims and payments. ‘Such checks will not be feasible or adequate once the system is running nationally,’ it added. Mr Duncan Smith insisted that all of the report’s concerns had already been addressed. The civil service is a ‘failing organisation’ that needs sweeping reforms to bring it into the 21st century, MPs warned last night. The Commons public administration committee said in a report that Whitehall mandarins were ‘in denial’ about the scale of the problems facing an organisation once likened to a Rolls-Royce machine. MPs said Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude was right to try to reform the civil service, but his plans were ‘too modest and piecemeal’ and were ‘bound to fail’. The convention of ministers  taking responsibility for major mistakes in their department has gone and there is an ‘atmosphere’ of  ministers blaming officials and  vice versa. The result is that ‘few ministers or officials seem to be held accountable when things go wrong’. The report said: ‘The civil service exhibits the key characteristics of a failing organisation in which most people know the system is failing, where nobody knows how to address failure, and the leadership are in denial about the scale of the challenge they face.’ MPs called for a Parliamentary committee to be established to address the problems from scratch.","The Work and Pensions Secretary said he had ‘lost faith’ in the ability of Whitehall mandarins .

Keatings, who is registered blind and walks with the support of a stick, drove for less than a mile before he came within inches of knocking down a pedestrian. Paul Keatings, 42, persuaded a friend to let him take to the road for the first time before he crashed into a boulder . His journey came to a halt just moments later when he smashed into a boulder at the entrance to the New Lanark Mill Hotel in Lanakrshire near Glasgow. Keatings was charged by police following the incident on May 25 and appeared at Lanark Sheriff Court today where he admitted driving dangerously through blindness. He also admitted to driving without insurance and with only a provisional licence, which he gained before he turned almost completely blind due to a congenital eye condition in his late twenties. He was disqualified from driving for . 32 months, told he would have to sit an extended driving test before . gaining a licence if his sight ever improves and placed under supervision for two years. Speaking about the incident last month, Keatings, of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, told how his motoring dream ended in disaster. He said 'I used to have a provisional licence and driving has always been a lifelong dream. 'When my friend suggested I give it a try I jumped at the chance. 'He drives a Subaru which is the same model as the rally driver Colin McRae famously drove. 'He had one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the hand brake.

Keatings was disqualified from the road for 32 months after admitting to driving dangerously through blindness . 'I’m really embarrassed about the whole thing.' His friend Brian Gillon, 33, whose father’s car was the vehicle involved, was also banned for 32 months after he admitted allowing a person unfit through blindness to drive the car and permitting a person with no insurance to drive the car. Gillon was also given a two year community payback order and told he must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Keatings crashed into a boulder near the entrance of The New Lanark Mill Hotel (pictured) in Scotland .

He added: 'I have Leber’s disease which is a hereditary condition passed down from my mum’s side. 'I started going blind when I was 28 and within a month I’d almost completely lost my sight.' The court heard that at around 3pm on May 25 visitors to New Lanark noticed a car being driven erratically down the hill towards the centre of the village, swerving across the road and nearly hitting a pedestrian. The car then careered into one of the boulders at the side of the entrance gates to the hotel and was it was captured by CCTV cameras.

"By . Simon Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 17 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:36 EST, 18 August 2013 . Actress Naomi Watts believes Princess . Diana gave her ‘permission’ from beyond the grave to  play her in a new . film about her love life. The . British-Australian actress,  44, admits the claim will sound unusual, . but says the experience left her feeling more comfortable in the title . role of the movie Diana. Playing the Princess was, says Watts, her hardest ever role. Call from beyond: Naomi Watts found herself asking for 'permission' to play Princess Diana in the new biopic . ‘I . kept wondering to myself “Would she like it?”,’ she reveals. ‘So I . found myself constantly asking for her permission to carry on.  I had . saturated myself with Diana and her life and I felt this enormous . responsibility of playing this iconic woman. ‘It . felt like I was spending a lot  of time with her. There was one . particular moment when I felt her permission was granted. That won’t . sound right in print, I know.’ The . blonde actress, whose previous film roles have included The Impossible . and Mulholland Drive, feared that she was not physically similar enough . to Diana, who died in 1997. ‘There was a lot of hesitation on my part before I agreed to do it,’ she says in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine today. ‘Obviously I was taking on one of the most famous women of my  time, and an awful lot of pressure comes with that. Iconic: Naomi (left) wears replicas of many of Diana's best known outfits in the film, such as this dress from a tour of Australia in 1996 . 'She (Diana) had a very expressive face. And she had that sideways smile we all remember, and those big eyes and a strong, athletic walk,' said Naomi . ‘You . want to get it right, and everybody is going to have an opinion  on the . film and how she should be portrayed. It’s very daunting. ‘But . then I also knew the best roles come with a risk. In the end, I decided . that I couldn’t not do it. This was a story that had to be told – it’s . an important story – but it  was definitely the hardest thing  I’ve ever . done. It’s as close as I ever want to get to a character.’ The . biopic, which opens next month, focuses on the final two years of . Diana’s life and includes details of her relationships following her . divorce from Prince Charles – notably with Dodi Fayed and with heart . surgeon Dr Hasnat Khan. Dr . Khan, played by Lost actor Naveen Andrews, met Diana in 1995 and their . relationship is understood to have grown very intense – even talking of . marriage together and starting a new life in Australia. Producer . Robert Bernstein has explained how the film-makers approached the . relationship sensitively after discussions with Hasnat and his family. Public work: Naomi recreates Diana's visit to a minefield in Huambo, Angola in 1997 . Naomi recreates a visit Diana made to Luanda, Angola, in January 1997 . He . said: ‘The way we are treating the relationship is one of a romantic . and tender nature, in keeping  with how we feel about Diana  and her . life. ‘It’s a very . aspirational, sympathetic portrait and not voyeuristic. Our sense of . their relationship  was that it was very spiritual and sensitive, as . well as difficult,  obviously. We are handling it very sensitively.’ Watts . adds that her own approach involved a great deal of research, including . meeting many of Diana’s friends. ‘It meant I could pick up little . details and make sure I was doing it right,’ she says. ‘People . were unanimous in their praise of her extraordinary sense  of humour . and her cheekiness.  They also all said she had quite a rebellious . streak, something I always admire.’ Watts . believes  her own experience of losing her father at a young age helped . her to empathise with Diana’s sons Princes William and Harry. Speaking . of the Princes, she adds: ‘I would hate to upset them. I hope they feel . good about it. It’s a  piece of history we’re all interested in and at . some point the story had  to be told.’ Healing: Dr Hasnat Khan (left) met Diana in 1995.

Superintendent Phil Davies from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Public identification of victims of sex abuse, in particular child victims engaged in court proceedings, can cause both immediate and long term distress and harm, especially in cases as serious as this. 'The same principles apply to social media as they do to the mainstream media, and we are investigating this matter robustly. 'People may not understand that when they use social media they are required by the law to keep victims anonymous in exactly the same way as people who work in main stream media.

Chaps, thinking of indulging in one last free swimming session before Autumn is well and truly here? Well, it's not just the forecasted plunge in temperature that might make it a bad idea - a piranha-like fish known for biting and eating testicles may be on its way to Britain. The Pacu, known as 'The Nut Cracker' and 'The Ball-Cutter', was recently discovered in the Seine river in Paris. The nightmarish beast is usually found the Amazon, can grow to up to 90cm and grow to 25kg. On it's way here? The piranha-like Pacu could soon be in the UK . May want to reconsider: This man was pictured in The Thames yesterday. Experts fear the Pacu could soon be found in UK waterways . Fishermen in South America have reportedly bled to death after losing their testicles to the vicious teeth of the fish, a relative of the piranha. When Pacu turn up in strange places, it is usually because the owner of an exotic aquarium has dumped one. It was found in European waters for the first time in August with experts warning men to keep their trunks on if swimming in the Øresund channel between Denmark and Sweden . Now it has migrated to France, there are fears it could be on its way to the UK's lakes and rivers. But British men fearing for their manhood take heart - the chillier weather will . soon ensure that fish like the Pacu could not survive. A fishing competition on the river some years ago - today, when a Pacu turns up in strange places, it is usually because the owner of an exotic aquarium has dumped one . Fish expert Henrik Carl told the Local . earlier in August: 'The Pacu is not normally dangerous to people but it . has quite a serious bite. There have been incidents in other countries, . such as Papua New Guinea, where some men have had their testicles . bitten off. 'They bite because they're hungry, and testicles sit nicely in their mouth.' A fisherman in Paris called the river . police when he reeled in the frightening looking fish, which can weigh . as much as 25 kilos, last Friday morning . 'He . sent us an image of the picture through his smart phone and it turned . out to be a Pacu,' said a police spokesman. 'It is a fish with a very . dangerous bite!' The . Pacu is technically a vegetarian, . but tends to be attracted to male genitalia for unknown reasons. Pacu grow quickly in captivity and, unlike goldfish, will outgrow aquaria, so owners release them into whatever pond they can find locally . When one was found in Denmark last month, . Copenhagen University professor Peter Rask Moller said: 'All we . suggested was that swimmers keep their pants on until we know if there . are more of these fish out in our brackish waters.' 'Pacu are commonly kept in aquaria because they are fairly docile, but look like piranhas,' Peter Moyle, a fish biologist, told the Los Angeles Times last month. 'They grow quickly in captivity and, unlike goldfish, will outgrow aquaria, so owners release them into whatever pond they can find locally.'","The Pacu could come to UK after being discovered in Western Europe .

An alcoholic who brutally murdered a grandmother by stabbing her repeatedly in the face with a pitchfork while she lay sleeping in her bed has been jailed for life. Anthony Hall, 48, wanted to steal 57-year-old Rhoda Youson's bank card so he could withdraw cash for a takeaway. A court heard the grandmother-of-seven had her face 'caved in' by Hall as he bludgeoned her with a wooden bat and stabbed her again and again with the fork. Murderer: Anthony Hall, left, left Rhoda Youson, 57, so disfigured that her face was unrecognisable after he battered her with a wooden bat and stabbed her in the face with a pitchfork . The attack left her so disfigured that her facial features were unrecognisable. Hall was one of a number of homeless people for whom Mrs Youson would cook dinners in her home in Coventry, West Midlands. Two days after the attack, Hall bragged to a friend - who reported him to the police - about 'bashing someone with a pitchfork'. Hall was later arrested and officers forced their way into Mrs Youson’s flat in Coventry, West Midlands. They discovered her lifeless body in bed on November 22 last year. The pitchfork was later found tossed aside in a car park along with a carrier bag containing the broken bat. She had massive injuries to her head and there was nothing left of her facial area. Blood was splattered on the walls. Hall went on trial accused of her murder which he denied on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was found guilty by a jury in July. Passing sentence today Judge Patrick Thomas said Hall meted out gross violence to his victim and showed 'a complete willingness to destroy a life'. He said: 'The reality of this case is that the lady whom you killed was small, frail and ill. 'She . was a lady who demonstrated to the end of her days - to others but also . to you - levels of generosity and care that are apparent to all. 'I am satisfied that the motive for this was your desire to have her bank card so that you could use it, as you did.' During the trial prosecutor Philip Bennetts told the court Mrs Youson was attacked after she took pity on a group of ‘street drinkers’ for whom she often cooked meals for at her home. He said: 'The following day Hall told several people that he had done something bad. 'He mentioned to a customer at a betting shop that he had killed someone and told a friend that he had killed Rhoda and had caved her face in. 'Generous': Mrs Youson invited Hall to her house to cook for him and gave him and other homeless people money . 'She became friendly with street drinkers - she was generous with money for homeless people she met. 'Hall was one of those people who she used to invite to her home and cook meals. 'She had massive injuries to her head and there was nothing left of her facial area. Blood was splattered on the walls.' After the case, Mrs Youson's family said a statement through Warwickshire Police: 'Rhoda Youson had a heart of gold and would always help others without being asked. 'She was kind and generous to her friends offering support, food, shelter, shower and clean clothes when needed just as Anthony Hall knew after she walked him to hospital despite not being in the best of health herself. 'Words alone can not describe how we are feeling or how we’ve managed to function on a daily basis, and we would never, ever want any other family to go through what we have gone through over the last nine months. 'She is greatly missed by her daughters and grandchildren, her sisters, mother and friends.'","Anthony Hall, 48, found guilty of murder of Rhoda Youson, 57 .

Guilty plea: Shaun Ruane, pictured outside Burnley Magistrates Court, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm of Hayley Truelove . A teenager ran over his girlfriend and left her lying in the road after finding out she was expecting his first child. Shaun Ruane, 19, had been in a relationship with Hayley Truelove for three months when she found out she was ten weeks pregnant and announced she wanted to keep the child. Bricklayer Ruana said he would stand by her but the next day erupted into a rage and ran over Miss Truelove, also 19, before driving off. He admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving but was given a suspended youth custody order. Burnley magistrates heard the bricklayer’s mind was 'all over the place' at the time because of his concerns over the unplanned pregnancy. There had been discussions between their families about the child but 19-year-old Miss Truelove made the decision to keep the baby the night before the incident on August 2. Ruane, from Burnley, Lancs, was said to be a 'little upset' by the decision, but decided to support Miss Truelove who he began dating in May. Prosecutor Andrew Robinson told the court the couple went out in his Ford Fiesta but he began 'showing off' behind the wheel and driving too fast. The court heard Ruane kept jerking the steering wheel after Ms Truelove asked him to not to, saying repeatedly: 'Please stop, I’m pregnant.' But Mr Robinson said Ruane just 'didn’t seem to care that his driving was making her upset'. Miss Truelove asked Ruane to stop the car as she wanted to get out because she didn’t feel safe. She opened the door, undid her seat belt and placed her left leg on the road when he sped off across the junction. Miss Truelove fell out of the van onto the road and the rear passenger wheel went over her right ankle and foot. Ruane then shouted abuse at Miss Truelove and punched his own van before driving off for a second time. He surrendered himself to the police about an hour and 20 minutes later. Miss Truelove was taken to hospital by ambulance and treated for a serious sprain. In court: Ruane was given a 17 week youth custody order suspended for one year at Burnley Magistrates Court, pictured . Ruane who has since lost his job, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving. He was given a 17 week youth custody, suspended for a year, and was ordered to complete 200 hours unpaid work. He was also banned from driving for 15 months, must take an extended retest and was ordered to pay £100 compensation and £85 costs. In mitigation defence lawyer Rachel Griffiths said: 'His mind was in overdrive and all over the place as he didn’t know how both of them were going to cope after the pregnancy news. 'He will say he didn’t realise the car door was open. If he had realised it was open, he would have stopped and allowed her to alight from the vehicle.' Miss Griffiths told the court Ruane immediately returned to the scene, almost hitting a tractor, when he looked in his wing mirror and saw his partner by the roadside. He got out to check she was OK, but was approached by a man who accused him of pushing her out of the van and simply didn’t know what to do. The solicitor said : 'Rather foolishly, and the thing he regrets more than anything, he drove off.' Miss Griffiths added: 'At no stage during this incident has he tried to evade the consequences of what would come. He is truly remorseful for the way things have turned out. The defendant is hopeful of a reconciliation with his partner. If he could turn the clock back, he would.' Miss Truelove was not at court. Her family declined to comment.","Shaun Ruane, 19, and Hayley Truelove had been dating for three months when she found out she was ten weeks pregnant .

Kevin Wright, who used money from charity cancer appeals for himself, pictured at court today . A man who stole nearly £1 million from children's cancer charities, including one he set up to help his own son, has been jailed for five years. Kevin Wright was sentenced today at Nottingham Crown Court. He had been convicted of ten counts of theft and two of fraud by false representation. Jurors heard significant sums of money were donated to the appeals Wright set up, but that little of the cash went towards treatment. Instead the 50-year-old spent the majority of the money on the charities' running costs and funding his own 'interests, investments and personal lifestyle'. Sentencing, Judge Gregory Dickinson said: 'I believe you have a genuine desire to help families in the same position - however that does not fully explain your actions.' 'You abused the generosity of the public. Your actions risked damaging the confidence in the system of charitable giving.'The court heard that Wright set up a string of appeals following the success of charities established to help his own son, Bobby. Wright set up Bobby’s Fund and The Bobby Wright Cancer Fighting Fund after his son, then aged three, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of cancer, in April 2005. The money was to treat Bobby at a specialist centre in the U.S., but it was later decided that he no longer needed treatment and Bobby, now 11, later recovered. It . was then Wright turned his attention to fundraising for other children - . enterprises which Judge Dickinson said were 'fradulent from the . outset'. Wright poses in 2006 with his wife Jacqui and son Bobby. He was fundraising to treat Bobby's cancer, but spent the money on himself . He established appeals for Callum Kaye, Armani Mohammad and Jessica Magnus, saying donations would be used to bring the youngsters to the specialist Sloane-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center in New York. But none of the money was ever used to treat the children, and Wright instead used the money to fund his own lifestyle. Judge Dickinson said: 'These appeals were a fraud on the public. They were fraudulent from the outset,' adding that they were used 'in part to maintain your lifestyle and image'. The court heard that Wright, formerly of Kenn, near Exeter, Devon, stole a total of £171,500 from the Bobby Wright Cancer Fighting Fund, including donations of £60,000 made by charities Caudwell Children and Janet Nash. He also took more than £749,340.79 from the three appeals he set up to raise money for Callum, Armani and Jessica. The judge said: 'I accept that you did help other children. 'But you were being generous with other people’s money given for a different cause.' Bobby Wright, pictured here aged 4, suffered from a neuroblastoma. He has since recovered from the disease . The court heard that it was 'impossible' to say how much money exactly went into Wright’s bank account as he kept no accounts. However, he used £30,000 of money donated to the Bobby Wright Cancer Fighting Fund to buy the Toad In The Hole restaurant in Exeter and invested £20,000 in a used car business. Another £60,000 from the fund was put into Premium Bonds by Wright. In mitigation, Nicolas Gerasimidis, said: 'He is not the typical fraudster. This is not a case where he has enriched himself or lived a lavish lifestyle. Wright was sentenced to five years in prison today at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured). He had been convicted of ten counts of theft and two of fraud by false representation . 'His primary motivation was his desire to help other kids. Clearly temptation got in the way because of the sheer amounts of money involved.' But judge Mr Dickenson said: 'I do not for one second see him as some sort of latter-day Robin Hood. 'There was, in my opinion, a very considerable element here of personal benefit and self-promotion as well as benefit to other children. 'I will not accept any suggestion that all he was doing was trying to help other children'. The judge said there was 'something more selfish and arrogant' than that.","Kevin Wright, 50, established a cancer charity for his ill son, Bobby .

She was rushed to Royal Bolton Hospital where she later died . A pensioner died after trapping her leg in a stairlift on the way to get a cup of tea. Jacqueline Ann Whitehead, 73, lay helpless for 15 hours before she was found at home in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The pressure caused rapid muscle breakdown and she died in Royal Bolton Hospital shortly before midnight on 11 June. Despite using the stairflift to get up the stairs, it is thought Mrs Whitehead then decided to go back down for a cup of tea, and as she attempted to get out of the seat, she slipped and trapped her leg. She developed metabolic acidosis, caused by intense pressure and rapid breathing. An inquest into Mrs Whitehead's death at Bolton Coroner's Court ruled the stairlift was working before the incident. Alan Walsh, deputy coroner for Bolton, said: 'The stairlift appeared to be working as it took Mrs Whitehead up the stairs just before she fell. 'There had been an inspection of the machine in February and between them and the day of the incident the company had received no reports of malfunctioning.' Mr Walsh recorded a verdict of death as a result of an accident. He said: 'I am enormously sad that Jacqueline died in these circumstances in what was a horrendous experience being trapped for between 12 and 15 hours. 'She was a strong, resilient, independent lady and I am very sorry for the family that she should die like that.' The widow, whose husband and business partner William died in 2005, began to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and mobility issues in the last few years. Speaking at the inquest, Mrs Whitehead’s brother Peter Jackson, said he grew closer to his sister as he helped her get around: 'Jacqueline and her husband William had both run successful businesses in the past, a butchers and a dress shop in Harwood. 'They enjoyed their life together, travelling and playing golf. 'We became more in contact than we had before and because she was unsteady on her feet she was a bit more dependent on me at times.' Harwood Golf Club in Bolton where Jacqueline Ann Whitehead had been a member, captain and president . Tributes flooded in for the former dress shop owner and golf club president. David Johnson, secretary of Harwood Golf Club, said: “Jackie is, and will continue to be a very much missed member of the golf club. 'Both she and her husband Bill participated widely in the club and devoted much of their time to being here.' Jackie became lady captain of Harwood Golf Club in 1984, three years before her husband was handed the position. In 2010, she took on the presidency herself. 'They lived in a cottage just behind the club, and they enjoyed being here very much.' Mr Johnson added. 'Even after Bill’s death, and with Jackie’s trouble getting around, she was a very social member and she would still come and meet the ladies and they would have lunch together. 'She will certainly be much missed by all at Harwood Golf Club, and we offer our condolences to her family.'","Jacqueline Ann Whitehead, from Bolton, was trying to go downstairs for a cup of tea .

Theory: A hired assassin with military experience may have murdered a British family and a French cyclist in the Alps for just £420 each, a witness has claimed. Engineer Saad al-Hilli, pictured, was killed alongside his wife and her mother . A hired assassin with military experience may have murdered a British family and a French cyclist in the Alps for just £420 each, a witness has claimed. The chilling claim was released today on the first anniversary of the massacre which left Iraqi-British . engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, . 74 all dead. One French investigating source said: 'The contract could be linked to an inheritance dispute within the Al-Hilli family.' The . source confirmed that an 'English witness' had suggested the entire . Al-Hilli family was targeted by a 'mercenary' from the Balkans who was . paid the equivalent of just £1680. British police officers involved in the . Anglo-French investigation have so far refused to comment on the . enquiry, but their counterparts in Annecy confirmed that suspicions . about a contract killing are 'high on the agenda'. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was . also killed in the shootings, close to Lake Annecy in France. The Al-Hilli's daughters, Zainab, . eight, and Zeena, five, who were both in the car, were left orphaned and traumatised following the shooting on September 5 last year. A total of 21 bullets were used, with none damaging the bodywork of the family BMW in which the Al-Hillis were sitting. Instead, bullets passed straight through a car window before finding their human targets. At least five others ended up in the body of the cyclist, Mr Mollier, with the gunman reloading at least twice, ballistics reports suggest. French detectives are also following up claims that a French convict was offered '100,000 euros (£84,000 ) 'to eliminate an Iraqi settled in England', according to today's Le Figaro newspaper. Grim: A source says an 'English witness' suggested the entire Al-Hilli family was targeted by a 'mercenary' from the Balkans. This shows the family car at the murder scene . The horrific killings of the Al-Hilli family in one of the most scenic areas in the French Alps has baffled detectives. Since the murders a year ago, a number of theories have emerged as to why the family were slaughtered. French investigating sources believe an inheritance dispute within the Al-Hilli family could be a motive. Speculation: The killings in the French Alps have left a trail of suspected theories. This shows French Gendarmes close to the murder scene last year . There have also been revelations of a possible connection to the former regime of Saddam Hussein. It followed claims that the deposed tyrant may have deposited £840,000 into a Swiss bank account in the name of victim Said al-Hilli's father. At one stage, detectives believed they had been shot by a serial killer with a hatred of tourists. Police said they had linked the murders of the British family with the mysterious death of another tourist last July. Other theories have speculated that the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old nuclear industry worker, was the primary target. There have also been claims that a mystery motorcyclist seen around the Alpine beauty spot could have carried out the killings. This suggests that someone may have explored a number of options before finally ordering a hit. Saad's . brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, was arrested at his home in Surrey in June . on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, but has since been bailed. Zaid, . who has proved he was in the UK this time last year, denies any . wrongdoing and there is no concrete proof for any of the claims about . the killings being commissioned. Suspect: Saad's brother Zaad Al-Hilli, 54, pictured, was arrested at his home in Surrey in June on suspicion of conspiracy to murder but has since been bailed . But . the French now routinely leak information allegedly linking Zaid to the . murders, while attempting to close down other lines of enquiry. Annecy . prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the brothers were in dispute over their . father's inheritance, which included the £1 million family home in . Claygate, Surrey. 'Saad was scared of his brother,' said Mr Maillaud. 'It's for this reason that he changed the locks of the house.' Today there were also claims from the French sources that the brothers had a 'visceral hatred' for one another and that Saad's 'paranoid fear' was so great that he kept an illegal Taser stun gun for personal protection. Saad had also started using satellite technology through his smart phone which enabled friends to track his every move. The brothers' father, Kadhim, died in . Spain two years ago aged 85, leaving several properties and the . equivalent of more than £600,000 in a Geneva account. The French now claim Zaid had attempted to 'siphon' money from the account, and to fabricate his father's will in his favour. However, Mr Maillaud admitted that . there was currently not enough evidence to charge Zaid, and that other . theories could not be discounted. The murder scene - an . isolated mountain layby - reopened a few days after the killings, and . today floral tributes were already beginning to appear where the family . BMW had been parked. Probe: Sources close to the investigation have suggested that the killings could be linked to an inheritance dispute within the Al-Hilli family. But no evidence has been produced to support the suspicions. This is Saad Al Hilli's home . Saad's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was beaten over the head with the butt of the suspected murder weapon - a Luger P06 in 7.65mm Parabellum. Her four-year old sister, Zeena was left deeply traumatised after hiding beneath the skirts of her dead mother in the back of the BMW for eight hours before being discovered by gendarmes.

Cyril Osment, who had his nose removed because of skin cancer said his life was transformed after he was given the prosthetic replacement . A pensioner who had his nose removed because of skin cancer has appealed for helping after losing the artificial replacement. Cyril Osment, 83, said his life was transformed after he was given the prosthetic appendage three months ago following the operation. But he is now worried about leaving the house after losing the nose during a trip to the dentist. The grandfather-of-seven is appealing for residents near his home in Alweston, Dorset, to keep an eye out for the rubber mould. Mr Osment was diagnosed with skin cancer in autumn last year and immediately went under the knife at Salisbury District Hospital, Wiltshire. On Monday he set off in his original Mini on the one mile journey to Wessex House Dental Practice in Westbury, Dorset. The retired newsagent is sure his nose was still on when he got to the surgery. It was only when he got home that he noticed it was missing. He said: 'When I got home from the dentist I caught a glimpse of myself in my bedroom mirror and realised my nose was no longer attached to my face.' He said that the prosthetic nose had changed his life and without it he doesn’t feel confident enough to go out. 'I’m just hoping someone sees it and I get it back,' he said. 'It was one of the most wonderful things for me, having this done. 'At the moment my face is covered with bandages and dressings and people keep asking me what has happened to my nose - it’s made me worried about going out.' Mr Osment was diagnosed with skin cancer in autumn last year and immediately went under the knife at Salisbury District Hospital, Wiltshire . The divorcee is hoping he will be able to get a replacement nose - worth around £1,500 - from the same hospital where it was fitted. 'I already have an appointment with a consultant about getting a new nose,' he said. 'I’m really worried that I won’t be able to get a new one though as the first thing they said to me before was ""make sure you don’t damage it as you won’t get another one"". 'I’m hoping that maybe I’ll be allowed a new one though as I think that the magnets had begun to fail in my previous one. 'My nose was beginning to fall off quite regularly; the day before I lost it it fell off three times whilst I was gardening. 'Usually . the magnets are so strong they pull the nose out of my hand and on to . my face, but recently I’d started noticing it wasn’t quite as strong. The grandfather-of-seven is now appealing for residents near his home in Alweston, Dorset, to keep an eye out for the rubber mould . 'I just really hope that I’ll be able to get another one and carry on with my life.' In August last year, MailOnline reported how nasal cancer patient Bert Eastham had found a novel way of ensuring he did not misplace his prosthetic nose, by sticking it to the side of his fridge. Mr Eastham's nose was removed three years earlier when it was found to contain cancerous cells. In July 2012, the 64-year-old was fitted with a prosthetic nose which was held on to his face using magnets.","Cyril Osment had to have his own nose removed because of skin cancer .

A teenager was bullied to death by cruel taunts on Facebook, her distraught parents said today. Jasmine Griffiths, 18, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was found hanged at her home after receiving ‘dozens’ of messages telling her to kill herself. Jasmine’s stepmother Kirsty, 35, said the unnamed bullies continued harrassing Jasmine even when she blocked them and also targeted her friends. She said: 'It was Facebook that did it. It was all over it and that’s what started it. 'They had lots of profiles and they kept adding new ones to get to her when she blocked them. 'They said things like ""go die in a hole"", ""you’re worth nothing"", and ""go kill yourself"". 'She loved her family and her friends. 'It was not the kind of thing you would think people would say to an 18-year-old. 'Did they bully her? Of course they did. 'And when her friends went to stick up for her they went after them too, e-mailing them terrible things.' Kirsty spoke out alongside Jasmine’s father Neil after a coroner chose not to include the Facebook allegations in the inquest into her death. Dr Peter Harrowing said he could not be sure the hairdressing student intended to kill herself on the day she died and recorded an open verdict. The hearing at Flax Bourton near Bristol heard how Jasmine was found dead after a party at her home in April last year. College friend Rebecca Hemmett said her pal was excited about the party but had been upset by a text message. Rebecca, who studied hairdressing with Jasmine, told the inquest: 'In the few days before the party she was making really weird comments like ""what would you do if I killed myself?"" 'I thought it was a bit strange but then it was Jasmine being Jasmine - she came out with silly things all the time.' Jasmine's stepmother Kirsty, 35, said the unnamed bullies continued harrassing Jasmine even when she blocked them and also targeted her friends . The inquest heard Jasmine had a number of drinks and two or three lines of the stimulant Mephadrone - known as Mcat - at the party. Friend Zoe Conway thought Jasmine was acting strangely as the party ended around 4am and begged her to come home with her. Zoe said: 'She was not herself. Fighting back tears, Zoe added: 'I didn’t want to leave her. I really didn’t want to leave her but she gave me no choice in the end. 'She practically pushed me out of the door.' Jasmine was found by her brother the following afternoon. Tests found traces of Mcat in her blood and a postmortem confirmed she had died from hanging. Dr Harrowing, the assistant deputy coroner for Avon, told the 30 friends and relatives who attended the inquest he could not be sure she intended to kill herself. After the hearing Jasmine’s dad Neil, 40, a hairdresser,  said: 'Jasmine was a bright and bubbly girl, always full of life and always last to leave the party.

A Harley Street doctor stole a wallet full of cash that had been left on a table in Starbucks, and threatened to have police officers who arrested him on suspicion of the crime fired, a court heard. Abdul Choudhuri, 41, claimed the wallet was his after a Singaporean tourist left it on a nearby table by accident in the Nottingham coffee shop. Dr Choudhuri, who runs cosmetic surgery clinics on London's Harley Street and in Nottingham, then posed as a member of the Crown Prosecution Service to avoid being charged for his crime once arrested a month later. Abdul Choudhuri stole the wallet after a Singaporean tourist left it on a table in Starbucks in Nottingham . Kenny Quek left the wallet which contained a 1,000 dollar Singapore bank note on his table in the coffee shop on South Parade, Nottinghamshire, in October 2010 by mistake. When he returned, staff realised he was the rightful owner of the wallet and phoned police to report Dr Choudhuri who had earlier said it was his. Dr Choudhuri returned to the shop a month later and was recognised by barrista Lisa Wright, who phoned the police after noting the cosmetic surgeon's 'shifty' behaviour. When police arrived at the scene Dr Choudhuri reportedly hid in the toilets, before threatening to have one of the police officers fired. Upon his arrest he told the officer: 'I know Dave Walker (a former Nottinghamshire Police Superintendent) and you are going to lose your job', the court heard. The wallet contained a 1000 dollar Singapore bank note which was discovered in Dr Choudhuri's possession when he was arrested . One of Dr Chouduri's clinics can be found on London's famous Harley Street, a top spot for the city's best medical practices . The Body Perfect clinic which is run by Dr Choudhuri offers surgical and non-surgical cosmetic medical treatments . Prosecutor Jonathan Straw told the a jury . at Nottingham Crown Court: 'Mr Choudhuri is a thoroughly dishonest and . highly manipulative . individual who has gone to extreme lengths in order to avoid . conviction.' The doctor, whose clinics offer cosmetic treatments including liposuction and laser skin surgery, also posed as a member of the CPS to tell a witness the case had been dropped. Following the arrest, Mr Straw said Ms Wright received phone calls from a . withheld number claiming the trial had been cancelled. Mr Straw said the person who made the call claimed to be from the . Nottingham Witness Protection Scheme which is part of the CPS, but in fact was . Dr Choudhuri or someone acting on his behalf. The doctor denies one count of fraud and two counts of perverting the course of justice. PC Richard Shaw searched a wallet found on him which contained a 1,000 dollar Singapore bank note. When the case was adjourned to investigate the source of the calls, it emerged an alibi used given by Dr Choudhuri was also allegedly false. The case continues on Friday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:53 EST, 4 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:22 EST, 6 August 2013 . He was famous for singing about living in a 'yellow submarine'. But in fact, for a period at least, the infamous founder of the Beatles lived in a yellow gypsy caravan. John Lennon's eccentric caravan, which he had painted with a psychedelic design, was home to him and his family on holidays in the 1960s. But after his assassination the caravan was acquired by fellow Beatle Ringo Star and never seen again. Serendipity: Alan Carr, pictured, has been given sole responsibility of restoring the remains of John Lennon's gypsy caravan, for charitable causes . Decorative: The gipsy caravan would have stood out of the crowd with its bright and colourful design . Now, however, the yellow travelling carriage has been discovered - still in the same place it was left. Ringo Star kept the carriage next to his swimming pool at his former home, in Cranleigh, Surrey. When he sold his house, however, he left the caravan where is it was. The house went on to be let out to tenants, complete with the rotting carriage beside the pool, but sadly hidden from the rest of the world. Unlike John Lennon's psychedelic-painted Rolls Royce, which went on to be restored and sits in pride of place in a museum in New York, this vehicle had been left to rust and fade. But all is . not lost, since the job of restoring and selling the caravan has fallen . to Alan Carr, from Ascot, Surrey - a local charitable figure who plans . to raise funds from the find. Signed: John Pockett, who specialises in restoring vintage gipsy wagons, placed his signature in in the middle of the rose design following restoration commissioned by Ringo Starr in the 1980s . Sgt Pepper: The colourful design was commissioned by John Lennon in a style similar to the psychedelic Sgt Pepper style of the Beatles . Clive . Mason, of Carr's Lettings in Virginia Water, Surrey, said: 'The . property had previously been owned by Ringo Starr and the caravan was . not removed when he sold the house. 'My landlord was aware that the . caravan had been owned by the Beatles and had always had in mind to . offer it to a charity to see if they were interested in renovating it . for fundraising purposes. 'As it was in very dilapidated . condition there was quite a lot of work to be done and he had never got . round to doing himself, but he knew that it could be potentially of some . financial value if a suitable craftsman could do the rebuilding work . required. Some of the paint work is in great condition, while other parts will take a lot of work to restore . Restoration: While the gipsy caravan has been restored once before, it is clearly in need of further work to bring it back to its former glory . 'When the house was sold last year, . our landlord asked us to find a suitable home for the caravan and asked . me if I knew of any charities that would be interested.' So Mr Mason got in touch with fundraiser Mr Carr, who received the unexpected call while on an epic John . O'Groats to Lands' End charity walk for prostate cancer. Mr Carr said: 'It was one of those ""could you repeat"" moments. I simply could not believe what I was being told.' Mr Carr has now been made the charitable . guardian of the remaining sections of the caravan and has been . authorised to help the charities of his choice with any money made . through the potential sale. The 'Yellow Caravan' once set off on its own 'Magical Mystery Tour' - heading to the tiny private island of Dorinish in County Mayo, Ireland . Eventually the caravan made its way back to Ascot and stood in the garden of Tittenhurst Park until Lennon's assassination in New York in1980 . He said: 'This caravan is a piece of Rock and Roll history and represents the spirit of its time. 'Ideally I would like to see it take . pride of place in a cultural museum in Liverpool, the Beatles . birthplace, where experts can decide if it should be returned to its . original Sgt Peppers glory, but for charities' sake I will have to . balance any interest very carefully.' The glamorous vehicle was bought by Lennon in 1967 for his then four-year-old son Julian's birthday. The 'Beatle's Yellow Caravan', as it was called at the time, was styled with Sgt Pepper psychedelic artwork, which Lennon also famously adorned his Rolls Royce with. Former glory: John Lennon's gypsy caravan, pictured arriving at his home in Weybridge, Surrey after it was painted, has been found rotting in the former back garden of Ringo Star . John Lennon, pictured with Yoko Ono and children Julian Lennon and Kyoko Cox. Lennon bought the caravan for Julian for his fourth birthday . Originally called a Showman or Burton . caravan, it was repainted at a garage in Chertsey to Lennon's specific . designs and was transported on the 24th of July 1967 to Tittenhurst Park . in Ascot where John lived with first wife Cynthia and son Julian. John Lennon pictured with his son Julian on another of their holidays, this time at Heathrow Airport preparing to leave for Greece . This . caused much interest in the area with one local resident - a Mrs . Kathleen Bolton - quoted as calling the caravan 'an absolute hideosity'. However, the teenage fans who gathered . at the gates of Lennon's estate were much more enthusiastic and Mrs . Booth's threat to report the offending vehicle to the residents . association was met with boos and jeers. The last leg of its journey involved rafting the caravan across Clew Bay onto the island hideaway where Lennon and his family could enjoy it in peace. Eventually the caravan made its way back to Ascot and stood in the garden of Tittenhurst Park until Lennon's assassination in New York in1980. Fellow Beatle Ringo Starr then acquired it as part of the late Beatle's estate and discovered that the whole caravan was in a poor state of repair. So he called in vintage caravan restorer John Pockett and commissioned him to make urgent repairs. This took nearly a year but by September 1983 that caravan had been returned to its full glory and its last known location was next to Ringo's swimming pool. But while Lennon's famous Rolls Royce is now prominently displayed in a museum in America, the mythical 'Yellow Caravan' remained 'lost'. Or so they thought.","John Lennon bought the gypsy caravan for his son Julian's fourth birthday, in 1967 .

Chinese chief engineer Yu Qiyi was tortured to death by Communist Party officials . The chief engineer of a state-owned Chinese company was tortured to death by Communist Party officials who repeatedly dunked his head into a tub of icy water, in an attempt to extract a confession for corruption, it has been claimed. Mr Yu Qiyi, who was in his early 40s, had his head held underwater by six . investigators after being  been held for 38 days in detention in the city of Wenzhou. A coroner's report concluded . that Mr Yu had died after inhaling fluids that caused his lungs to . malfunction - an official way of saying he drowned. The state-run Beijing Times newspaper, published photographs of several bruises on the body of Mr Yu Qiyi, and claimed he had been tortured . during a severe interrogation process know as shuanggui in which . officials are asked to confess wrongdoings. The investigators will now be tried for intentional assault. A . Communist Party member of the Wenzhou Industry Investment Group, Mr . Qiyi was said by his wife, Wu Qian, to have been 'a strong man before . the shuanggui process, but he was thin by the time he died.' Yu's . family says the injuries are proof that he was beaten, starved and . otherwise tortured by investigators in the eastern city of Wenzhou where . he lived. 'He was thin . like a beggar,' said Wu Qian, . describing seeing Yu on April 9 in a local hospital. 'He was lying there . so pitifully. ... Anywhere that we could see, there were injuries on . his body.' Under shuanggui interrogations, suspects are whisked away into a shadowy detention. It operates beyond . the law, with people held for weeks and months at a time with no regard . for the normal, if often ignored, legal protections Chinese citizens are . supposed to be entitled to. Mr Yu Qiyi was picked up on suspicion of corruption in a land deal in the city of eastern Chinese city Wenzhou where he lived and worked . Defenders of the system say party investigators need unchecked power to prevent officials suspected of malfeasance from using their influence to block such inquiries. By keeping them in solitary confinement, the argument goes, officials are unable contact others who might be implicated or police or judges they might have influence over. And it has been used against powerful officials, most recently Bo Xilai, a high-ranking politician brought down in spectacular style last year following his wife's involvement in the murder of a British businessman. The former railways minister, Liu Zhijun, who now faces charges of taking bribes and abusing his power, also was under the party's investigative detention system. Yu was wanted for questioning for possible corruption in a land deal when he was picked up by investigators. Run by the party's Discipline Inspection Commission, the investigations have time limits of up to six months and usually take place in hotels or guesthouses, according to a 2010 book on arbitrary detention in China by legal scholar Flora Sapio. High-ranking Chinese politician Bo Xilai was also subjected to the shuanggui torture process . Detainees are guarded even when they use the toilet, Sapio writes, and are subject to sleep deprivation and beatings. Because the targets and interrogators are party members and are bound by the party's disciplinary code, the process is girded in silence, its details mostly kept out of public view. When the probe is concluded, investigators sometimes turn the suspect along with selected evidence to prosecutors for what is often a perfunctory prosecution with guilt a foregone conclusion. No figures are made public on the number of people put through the party's detention system annually. Shen said the number of corruption cases the party investigates — about 150,000 cases last year — provides some indication, though the detentions are likely to be far higher since each case usually involves multiple suspects. The attention that Yu's case has brought comes at an inconvenient time for the party. There is growing pressure from legal reformers and the public to do away with another form of punishment with flimsy legal underpinnings: a system that allows police to jail people in labor camps for up to four years without a court trial or judicial review. Because recently installed President Xi Jinping came to power pledging to root out widespread corruption, the shuanggui detentions may be used even more frequently, not less — setting back legal reforms. 'The use of shuanggui delivers not justice, but selective and vindictive prosecutions often based on torture, and will do little to straighten out China's rotten officialdom,' Human Rights Watch researcher Maya Wang said. Before he died, Yu, a party member since 1998, had been a rising figure in the Wenzhou Industry Investment Group, a state-owned company that according to its website invests in energy and other industries and manages 4.6 billion yuan ($750 million) in assets. Yu had been appointed by provincial leaders for a temporary assignment at the Cabinet agency in Beijing that oversees China's biggest state-owned companies. He was arriving back from the capital on March 1 but instead of being picked up as usual by his ex-wife, Wu, who was waiting in the car outside, he made a hurried phone call before being whisked away by investigators. It was the last time she heard his voice.","Yu Qiyi held in detention for 38 days on suspicion of corruption in a land deal .

David Shuttleton, 54, used the phrase in one of many hate-filled tweets to education expert and government adviser Jaye Richards-Hill, 49, because of her support for equal marriage. The antiques dealer from Barrhead, Glasgow, also sent messages to First Minister Alex Salmond and his deputy Nicola Sturgeon about the woman, who is an adviser to Education Secretary Mike Russell. Court case: David Shuttleton (pictured), 54, used the phrase 'danger to children' in one of many hate-filled tweets to government adviser Jaye Richards-Hill, 49, because of her support for equal marriage . Miss Richards-Hill, a leading gay rights campaigner in Scotland, sued Mr Shuttleton for defamation of character - and won, with the Court of Session telling him to hand over £40,000 plus costs. But the judgement only came ‘by default’ because Mr Shuttleton failed to lodge defences - and he vowed to MailOnline that he would take the case back to court and get it heard again. He added that he never used the phrase 'a danger to children' towards Miss Richards-Hill, but a tweet on his Twitter account clearly shows he did. The divorced father of two told the Daily Record: ‘It’s an absolute scandal that homosexuals have got such power in our community. It’s an absolutely scandalous abuse of our laws.’ Mr Shuttleton also claimed he was in fact . a victim of trolling by Miss Richards-Hill and had complained to police . on various occasions about her, but they had found no basis to . investigate his claims.

Abuse: This is just a snapshot of many of the tweets exchanged between Mr Shuttleton and Miss Richards-Hill . Miss Richards-Hill declined to comment, but a source close to her told the newspaper that Mr Shuttleton ‘deserved to be exposed’ and that his homophobic comments needed to be ‘challenged’. The ruling follows a week of increased debate about trolling after a number of high-profile attacks. Last Thursday Tony Wang, general manager of Twitter UK, apologised to women who have been attacked by trolls on the social networking site and vowed to do more to protect people from abuse.

Gruesome discovery: Officers searching a garage at 704 Federal Street in Toledo found a box in the rafters that contained infant remains . ‘We found what we believe may be baby Elaina,’ he said. The home and the garage belong to the family of a man who had been dating the girl's mother.Both the mother, Angela Steinfurth, 25, and her now-estranged boyfriend, Steven King II, 23, have been arrested and charged with obstruction of justice. No charges have been filed since the remains were discovered. Miss Steinfurth and her two daughters stayed with King at his family's home June 1, investigators said.

King was charged in July with lying to investigators about the child's disappearance. He told reporters after his arrest that he is innocent. Authorities, including the FBI, have scoured nearby homes, vacant buildings and the Maumee River near downtown Toledo for any sign of Elaina over the past three months. Volunteers also have looked through neighborhoods and parks. Estranged dad: TJ Steinfurth, pictured here with Elaina, arrived at the house of Angela's boyfriend June 2 to pick up the toddler and her sister, but the girl was nowhere to be found . From the beginning, the investigation into Elaina's disappearance has been rife with rumors and speculations. Police have chased down numerous leads, including tips from two psychics who claimed that the girl's body was in a Jerusalem Township field crying, 'Mommy.' In another twist, a woman who claimed to be Angela Steinfurth's cellmate claimed that the 25-year-old mother told her in confidence that King had wrapped Elaina's body in a blanket and tossed it into the river. Officers searched both the home at at 704 Federal Street and the garage in the days after Elaina disappeared, but did not get to the rafters. During a press conference Friday, police explained that they did not bring in cadaver dogs to search the property because it was overflowing with junk, according to First Coast News. They went to back to the home just after 3.15pm Thursday armed with a search warrant and removed the box with the remains, just hours after Mr King appeared in court at a hearing where his trial date was scheduled. Tensions were high on Federal Street, where neighbors and friends have been holding vigils since Elaina's disappearance. Police had to be called in to break up a fight that was sparked by speculations over the contents of the box removed from the garage. Several women were heard yelling at each other, 'An eye for an eye,' The Toledo Blade reported. Jailhouse rumors: A woman claiming to be Miss Steinfurth's cellmate claimed that the 25-year-old had confided in her that her boyfriend threw Elaina's body into a river . Angela Steinfurth's stepfather, Richard Schiewe, said the box was not in the garage the day after the little girl was reported missing. He said he went into the garage with police when they searched the building. ‘That body was not in the rafters,’ he said Friday. ‘Somebody went and got that body and put it in there.’","Elaina Steinfurth, 18 months old, went missing June 1 while staying with family of her mother's boyfriend .

The widow of a New Jersey police officer killed in a violent shoot out has heard his heart beat again four years after it was donated to a Vietnam war vet. Don Zolkiwsky, who says he thinks of his donor every day, has finally met the family who helped give him the gift of life. For Mary DiNardo, it was an emotional experience, as she hugged the war vet and said: 'This is the heart that fell in love with me.' Bond: Mary DiNardo and her children meet Don Zolkiwsky who received her husband's heart . Her husband, Marc DiNardo, died the day before his 38th birthday after being shot in the face and neck and his Swat team tried to arrest a couple of armed robbers. Despite several attempts to resuscitate him, the father-of-three died a few days after the deadly shootout in July 2009. The cop, who had spent ten years on the force, had two daughters aged 4 and 1, and a son aged 3  when he died. 'It was two nights before they finally . took him to surgery to harvest his organs,' Mary DiNardo told CBS News. 'I'm hoping to be able to hear that . heartbeat again.' The cop, who was promoted to detective after the shooting, was remembered as a selfless man adored by his colleagues. Life saver: Don Zolkiwsky has been given a second chance at life after receiving Mac DiNardo's heart . Widow: Mary DiNardo is comforted knowing part of her husband lives on . Loss: New Jersey police turn out for the funeral of their fallen colleague Marc DiNardo in 2009 . 'He had a personality you could never . forget. When he walked into a room, we all loved him,' New Jersey . police officer Michelle Bartholomew told the Star Ledger after the incident. After receiving the donated heart, Mr . Zolkiwsky wrote to Mrs DiNardo to try to express his gratitude and . explain his feelings of survivor's guilt. 'I can't explain it, but there is a deep . sense of comfort and connection with the donor whom I've never met,' he . wrote. 'Saying ""thank you"" in person will lift some of the guilt that I . carry as the survivor.' Contact between donor families and recipients is becoming more common and can sometimes bring comfort, according to USA Today. After surgery both families are told basic details about the others' circumstances and, if either side wants to send a letter, health workers act as a go between. For Mr Zolkiwsky, he wanted to be able to thank the family who helped him. He told CBS he couldn't stop thinking about the man whose death gave him a second chance at life, after his own heart deteriorated because of a virus. I've had dreams consistently about . the episode with the shootout. 'I could almost . sense what it must have been like to be in a room with a gun battle . going on. That had to be horrific,' Mr Zolkiwsky, who was awarded a purple heart in Vietnam, said.

It's a bond, it's a friendship . that I can't describe how the feeling is, but it's an intense one.' For Mrs DiNardo, just knowing her husband's heart is still beating has brought her some comfort.

A congresswoman who was told that her unborn baby had a fatal condition has spoken of her joy at watching her now thriving baby grow. 'She is doing wonderful, she is doing amazing,' Jamie Herrera Beutler told Today, after her baby was born prematurely and without kidneys. Tiny Abigail Rose, who was born in July, only 28 weeks into the pregnancy, may be the only child with Potter Sequence to have survived. Optimistic: Congresswoman Michelle Beutler and husband Daniel say their baby who has Potter Sequence is doing well . 'Thriving': Tiny Abigail, who was born weighing just over 2lb, is making good progress . 'I don’t think there were any physicians . who expected, based on her prenatal diagnosis, to ever reach that stage . where she’s simply a growing preemie, breathing on her own, but . requiring dialysis,' Dr Louis Halamek, of Packard . Children's Hospital, said. Abigail's proud parents, who have only recently been able to hold her for the first time, are also delighted at her progress. 'She’s playing. She will scream when her diaper is dirty. She is like any . other baby. She has a few challenges, but man, she’s determined,' Mrs Beutler said. She and her husband Daniel had been expecting to find out whether they were expecting a boy or girl when they were first told their baby had a serious condition at their routine ultrasound. 'It is the worst moment in your life,' the Washington representative said. 'He was telling us ""your baby has no options"" ... And at that moment, she was . moving. She was moving in me, and he is telling me she’s not going to . live.' Abigail has Potter Sequence, in which impaired kidney function leads . to low amniotic fluid during pregnancy, preventing the lungs from developing properly. She is having dialysis now and will need a kidney transplant later this year. Miracle baby: Jamie and Daniel Beutler can now hold their daughter Abigail, who was born with a rare and usually fatal condition . When her parents were first told there was no hope for their first child, they were faced with an agonizing decision of whether to accept what their doctor told them, or to continue with their pregnancy. 'They gave us no options. It is the worst moment in your life,' Mrs Beutler said. The couple spoke to several doctors before finding a specialist in Baltimore who agreed to try an experimental treatment that involved injecting saline solution into the womb to replace the crucial amniotic fluid that was missing. Though only 2lb 12oz at birth, Abigail . had fully developed lungs and is breathing on her own, suggesting that . the relatively uncommon treatment had worked. They were put in contact with the doctor after another parent slipped them a name and said: 'Here's a doctor who might try.' Mr Beutler said that like most parents, they were determined to never give up, and has advised families facing a similar situation to find a doctor willing to help. He added: 'There's no guaranteed solutions and there's no magical cures ... but don't be satisfied with just one opinion because there's a lot of intelligent doctors with different perspectives and experiences. Miracle baby: The Beutlers with their tiny newborn Abigail when she was just two weeks old . Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (right) is pictured with her husband, Daniel, and House Speaker John Boehner during a mock swearing in. Herrera has announced that her unborn child has Potter Sequence . On a Facebook page announcing the baby's birth, the Beutlers revealed how they refused to give up on their baby. 'Multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that, if she survived to term, she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth,' they wrote. 'We were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible. The options we were offered were termination or “expectant management,” that is, waiting for her to die. Instead, we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle.' Dr Halamek, a neonatologist in California, said he was cautiously optimistic about the baby's future. 'Despite Abigail's prematurity, small size and life-threatening disease, she is doing well,' he said. Mrs Beutler, 34, is a Republican in her second term in Congress, . representing the 3rd district covering the southwest portion of . Washington state. Joyous: Herrera Beutler and her husband Daniel say they have no reason to believe their daughter can't lead a full and healthy life . Expectant mother: Rep. Beutler, 34, had announced on May 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall . Babies with Potter Sequence typically die within a couple days of being born, according to the National Institute of Health. The . condition's primary problem is when the kidneys, which normally produce . amniotic fluid, fail to develop properly as the baby is growing in the . womb. Without amniotic . fluid, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus, which . can lead to abnormal facial and limb development. The condition may also stunt the development of the lungs. The Republican had announced on May 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall. The . couple wrote that they didn't know what the future held, 'but we ask . for your prayers and appreciate the privacy a family needs in such . circumstances.' 'According . to the medical information and advice we've received, I will be able to . continue to balance the responsibilities of an expectant mother with . serving as your representative in Congress,' the message continued.","Jaime Herrera Beutler's first child was diagnosed with Potter Sequence in the womb .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Daniel Bates . PUBLISHED: . 22:02 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:21 EST, 6 September 2013 . A drunk driver confessed on Thursday to killing a 61-year-old Navy veteran as he drove drunk down the wrong side of a highway in a shocking online promotional video. Matthew Cordle says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani on June 22 but stayed silent until now. His confession was released last night on a video to promote a not-for-profit web start up called 'Because I Said I Would' which promotes the use of 'promise cards' where individuals set goals for themselves. Today, the ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone . Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident . Cordle says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr Canzani, of suburban Columbus. The video begins with Cordle's face blurred as he describes how he has struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with friends going 'from bar to bar' the night of the accident. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name and confesses to killing Mr Canzani. 'When I get charged I'll plead guilty and take full responsibility for everything I've done to Vincent and his family,' Cordle says. Later, he says he understands that by releasing the video he's giving prosecutors 'everything they need to put me away for a very long time.' The video was released in connection to a start-up called Because I Said I Would, a non-profit aimed at encouraging individuals to stay true to their personal commitments. An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986. Since leaving the Navy, he flourished as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three great grandchildren. Today, Cheryl Olcott, who was married to Mr Canzani for 10 years, said that she is praying for him - and even forgave him for not coming forward for two months. Mrs Olcott, said: 'I applaud Matt for stepping up to the plate. He's taken full responsibility. He is an honest man who has spoken the truth. It's unfortunate that the whole cycle of events has happened this way. I pray for Matthew Cordle.' Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left) Asked if she would have preferred it if Cordle had admitted his guilt right away, she said: 'You can't change what's happened, that's all I know. I'm not a judge. There's only one judge and that's the big guy upstairs. Matthew is a good man. I commend him for that'. Mrs Oclott, who love in Norwalk, Ohio, said she'd followed the case closely and remembered their time together fondly. 'There were a lot of good times,' she said. She added Mr Canzani was an only child whose parents have died and said that he was estranged from his two grown-up daughters. She said: 'He had no-one. He hasn't spoken with his daughters his whole life. He didn't raise them.' Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien on Thursday said Cordle was a suspect in the deadly crash but hadn't been charged. Problems: The county prosecutor said that Matthew Cordle was considered a suspect in the case but had not been charged. In light of the video, he will presumably be charged with aggravated vehicular homicide . O'Brien said he saw the video on Wednesday and will ask a grand jury to indict Cordle for aggravated vehicular homicide with an alcohol specification, a charge that carries a maximum of eight years in prison upon conviction. O'Brien said Cordle's blood sample from the night of the crash tested positive for alcohol and negative for drugs. In the video, Cordle says that at the time of the accident he consulted with some ‘high-powered attorneys who told me similar cases where the drivers got off.’ ‘They were convinced that they could get my blood test thrown out and all I would have to do for that was lie,’ he said. His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video . Defense attorney George Breitmayer III said the video 'is a strong testament' to Cordle's character. He said Cordle intends to co-operate with prosecutors. Police in June said Canzani, of Gahanna, died at the scene after his Jeep was struck on Interstate 670. Cordle ends the video confession by 'begging' viewers to not drink and drive. 'I can't bring Mr Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,’ he said. The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards. A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother . Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'. The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises. In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run. 'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post. 'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.' Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. After the three young women were . discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to . launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor. Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found . Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives . He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance. He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother. Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.","Matthew Cordle, 22, admitted to killing Vincent Canzani, 61, during a drunken hit-and-run accident in June in Ohio .

'Mastermind': Prosecutors say Croey Frederick, 43, the owner of the book-buying and selling company Doorkeeper Textz, had paid a dozen school district employees $200,000 to steal and resell thousands of textbooks . A dozen employees from four struggling Southern California school districts have been indicted in an alleged scheme to steal and resell thousands of textbooks. Those indicted included two librarians, a campus supervisor and a former warehouse manager from financially troubled school districts including Los Angeles Unified and nearby districts in Inglewood, Lynwood and Bellflower, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement. ‘Taking books out of the hands of public school students is intolerable — especially when school employees sell them for their own personal profit,’ Lacey said. All were recruited into an alleged scheme set up by 43-year-old book buyer and seller Corey Frederick, who operates Doorkeeper Textz in Long Beach. Doorkeeper Textz was one of the Los . Angeles Unified School District's approved used book vendors in 2010, . the Los Angeles Times reported. The 37-count indictment unsealed Thursday . alleges that between 2008 and 2010, Frederick paid the employees . between $600 and $47,000 per person for stolen language arts, economics, . physics, anatomy and physiology books stolen from schools, then resold . them to Amazon and other major book buyers. Bitter irony: Investigators say the books were sold to Amazon and other retailers, and some of them ended up in the same school districts they had been stolen from . The indictment alleges that Frederick paid the employees a total of more than $200,000. Prosecutors had not established a total of books stolen, but said at least 7,000 were taken from LAUSD alone. Some of the books were sold back to the very districts they were stolen from, prosecutors said. LAUSD said in a statement that district officials just learned Thursday that seven of their employees were among those indicted for acts they called ‘reprehensible.’ ‘We are outraged by the alleged behavior of these employees, which is the equivalent of stealing directly from our students,’ the statement said. ‘We are taking immediate action to suspend any accused employee currently working for LAUSD.’ Twelve of the 13 indicted pleaded not guilty. The status of the 13th was unclear. The . suspected scheme came to light after Inglewood Unified School District . police alerted prosecutors to allegations of embezzlement in their . district. Scheme: The Los Angeles Unified School District, which listed Doorkeeper Textz as one of its approved used book vendors, had at least 7,000 textbooks stolen . Prosecutors say the four district at the center of the case have no proper tracking systems, making it impossible to say with certainty how many books had been stolen. Mr Frederick has been charged with a dozen counts of embezzlement and 13 counts of bribery. He is being held on $843,000 bail and could face more than 19 years if convicted.","Book buyer and seller Corey Frederick, 43, is accused of recruiting librarians and other staffers to pilfer textbooks .

Two suspects have been arrested in the shooting death of a one-year-old boy who was allegedly killed by accident when they were aiming for his father. Dequan Breland and Dequan Wright were arrested on Friday, five days after they reportedly shot and killed Antiq Hennis. Antiq was being pushed across a Brooklyn street on Sunday by his father Anthony, who is believed to be a member of the notorious Crips gang. Police believe that the shooting was related to a disagreement between the suspects and Anthony Hennis, 21, though the exact argument in question still has not been revealed. Suspects: Dequan Breland (left) and Dequan Wright (right) were taken into police custody in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on Friday in connection to a shooting in Brooklyn, New York on Sunday . Victim: Antiq Hennis was being pushed across a road in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Brooklyn by his parents at about 7.20pm yesterday when he was shot . According to The New York Post, Breland, 23, and Wright, 19, were discovered in an apartment that belongs to Breland's cousin in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 'They knocked on the door and the occupants refused to open it,' NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said in a press conference on Friday. 'The officers breached the door to gain entry. In the rear bedroom they found Dequan Breland on the floor and Dequan Wright lying on the bed.' One witness has identified Breland as the shooter, and said that Wright was the one to hand him the gun just moments before Breland fired four shots. Connected: A witness saw Wright, 19, hand the gun to Breland on Sunday night . Pulling the trigger: Breland then reportedly fired four shots, one of which hit the 1-year-old boy . Mr Kelly spoke out about the shooting on Sunday, saying that Anthony Hennis- who has an extensive criminal history- was now cooperating with investigators. 'He has not been cooperative with us. He has not answered questions. We're still trying to obviously determine his contacts — and he has an extensive arrest record so we are looking into his relationships,' he said. Cops have issued a $12,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the boy’s killer. Shocking: One-year-old Antiq Hennis was shot in this stroller in an impoverished area of Brooklyn last night . Pay respects: Mourners visit a memorial for Antiq Hennis in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn, New York, where the one-year-old boy was shot and killed in his stroller during a walk with his parents on Sunday . Innocent: Antiq Hennis was in a stroller being walked by his father when he was struck in the head by gunfire - the bullet was said to be meant for his dad . The family lives in Brooklyn's notorious Brownsville neighborhood, which has one of the highest concentrations of public housing anywhere in the U.S. Eye witness Gina Gamboa, 22, told the New York Daily News: '[The father] was screaming ""My baby got shot"". He was going crazy.' 'The baby was breathing, but his eyes were closed. It’s crazy. They just will start shooting. 'The baby’s chest was moving, but his head was tilted to the side. There was blood all over the stroller.’","One-year-old was being pushed across street by his father, 21, who is believed to be a member of the notorious Crips gang .

A morbidly obese woman came close to death when a gastric bypass caused her to lose a massive 27 stone. Beth Birch reached 31 stone by the age of 19 but after the operation her weight plunged to a life-threatening four stone. Ms Birch underwent the gastric bypass surgery after claiming her leg had snapped in nine places under her extreme weight, leaving her confined to a wheelchair. Beth Birch, 25, lost 27 stone after gastric bypass surgery. She dropped from 31 stone to 4st 3lbs. She is pictured (left) three months after the surgery and (right) eighteen months after the operation. She was told that she would die unless she gained weight . She hoped the surgery would help her to achieve her dream body but within weeks of the operation was losing weight dangerously fast. Sixteen months later she was down to a skeletal 4st 3lbs and doctors told her she could die unless she started regaining weight. Ms Birch was rushed to the Spire Murrayfield Hospital in Wirral, Merseyside, where specialists found her gut wall had stopped working so she could not absorb food. She was put on a 15,000 calorie-a-day cocktail of medicines and drinks - plus six meals a day - to build up and defend her gut wall. Her weight slowly climbed up to healthy 11 stone, but doctors warned her that because of her rapid change in weight she would probably never be able to have children. However, Ms Birch became pregnant last year, and gave birth to daughter Violet 12 weeks ago. By the time Ms Birch (pictured in her teens) was 19-years-old she weighed 31 stone. She believes that her weight gain was caused by polycystic ovary syndrome . Ms Birch (pictured before her surgery when she weighed 31 stone) hoped that the operation would help her to achieve her dream body . She now weighs a healthy 12st 4lbs and can eat normally. Ms Birch, 25, of Manchester, said: ‘People said I looked like a corpse - in fact one person said he had seen a corpse look better. ‘I was lying on my mum’s settee and I couldn’t even lift me head up. ‘I was trying to eat but I wasn’t able to swallow and when I could my body just couldn’t absorb it. ‘My body was shutting down and I was so weak. I was wearing clothes for a ten to 11-year-old girl. ‘The doctors said to my parents he didn’t think I would be able to come through it and to prepare for all eventualities.’ Ms Birch (pictured a few months before surgery) says that as as child she ate the same healthy diet as her siblings and that they did not become overweight . She added: ‘I was elated when I found out I was pregnant. There weren’t even words to describe how happy I was. ‘I can’t believe I have been so fat, then so thin and pregnant in just 25 years.’ Ms Birch says that her doctor was shocked by her weight loss. She . said: 'About ten months after the operation I was down to a good weight - 12 stone or . something - and then I got told I didn't have to go back to the doctor . for six months. 'When I went in again my doctor looked at me and he was disgusted with how I was.' Ms Birch (pictured in hospital just before her surgery) was so large that her leg snapped in nine places leaving her confined to a wheelchair. She was told that because of her weight, there was a 60 per cent chance that she would not survive the operation . Ms Birch (pictured just before her surgery) says that she decided to have the operation despite the risks as she feared that if she did not die on the operating table, her weight would kill her . Ms Birch (pictured in hospital before the surgery) said that she was warned that there could be complications after the surgery. Her dramatic weight loss occurred because her stomach stopped absorbing food . She added: 'My stomach stopped absorbing anything. 'By the time they realised what was wrong I had gone down to four and a half stone.' Ms Birch said she had struggled with her size since she was child - even though she ate the same healthy diet as her brothers and sisters. She puts her extreme weight gain down . to polycystic ovary syndrome - a condition she discovered she had as a . teenager, which can cause ovary cysts and prompt weight gain. Ms Birch said: 'I did struggle with my weight all my life - I very, very much struggled since I was six or seven. 'When I was about seven I was wearing size 12 adult clothes. I was quite big. 'I had the same as my brothers and sisters to eat as I was growing up. Ms Birch (pictured ten months after surgery) lost weight dramatically after her surgery and within 16 months she had dropped to just 4st 3lbs. She was put on a 15,000 calorie-a-day diet to keep her alive while her stomach lining recovered . Ms Birch (pictured after her surgery) was told that because of her extreme weight fluctuations she would probably not be able to have children. However, she became pregnant and had a baby girl 12 weeks ago . 'When I was younger they said it was a phase and I would grow out of it, but I never did. Before she had her gastric bypass operation at the Abbey Sefton Hospital in Liverpool in September 2007, medics warned her of complications. She said: ‘It was quite a big decision to make because they told me there was a 63 per cent chance the operation could have killed me because of my weight. ‘I still went ahead with it though because my weight would have killed me otherwise. ‘At least if I died in the operation, I would have died trying to do something about it.’ A gastric bypass is a last resort for people carrying a dangerous amount of weight. It is available on the NHS for people who have a BMI of more than 40, or for those with a BMI of more than 35 who also have a serious weight-related health condition. During the operation the digestive system is re-routed past most of the patient's stomach so that they digest less food and feel full quicker. The patient is left with just a small pouch in place of their stomach. After the surgery, people tend to lose weight very quickly - most people who have had this procedure lose two thirds of their excess body weight. Patients have to stick to a strict diet and exercise plan after the operation. Many people find that they are left with lose folds of skin after they lose weight - this can require further surgery to correct. Gastric bypass surgery comes with many potentially fatal risks, including internal bleeding and blood clots. One in 100 gastric bypass surgery patients die shortly after surgery. The surgery cannot be reversed. Source: NHS Choices .","Beth Birch weighed 31 stone by the time she was 19-years-old .

Michigan police pulled a dog with a rock tied around its leg from a river last week and are looking for the person responsible. A Dearborn Heights police officer rescued the trapped canine Aug 26 after a passerby called 911 after seeing it marooned in the river. The dog made it through the disturbing ordeal relatively unscathed, and mostly muddy. ‘It took the dog, which appears to be a Golden Retriever-Labrador-hound mix, a couple of days to calm down from what I’m sure was a horrifying experience for him,’ a Dearborn Heights Police spokesperson told the Detroit Free-Press. Safe and sound: River is back on dry land after being rescued by police . The dog, now called River, was taken the local animal shelter where it is now being cared for, according to reports. ‘He was a little frightened and initially wasn’t responding to staff very well because I think he was very scared,’ the spokesperson told CBS Detroit, ‘but he has since calmed down and he has been looked after and he is a really nice dog.’ The dog tested positive for heartworm, according to the Free-Press, and the shelter will pay for treatment of the potentially deadly condition while the dog stays in a foster home. The plan is to eventually find River a permanent adopter. ‘It hurts me because I have a golden retriever, and I would never think of doing something like that to the dog,’ local Gregory Gritu told WXYZ. HIgh and dry: River was trapped in the river with a rock tied to his leg, but managed his way through the ordeal without any ijuries . Good boy: Shelter staffers say River is a great dog and they can't imagine why anyone would do such a terrible thing to him . Police are offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever is responsible for this depraved act as River begins to return to normal. Police hope that spreading the word also leads to an arrest. ‘Someone has to know this dog,” the spokesperson told the Free-Press. ‘So-and-so’s dog has been gone for 10 days.

Mr Cooper and cornerback Cary Williams exchanged words, shoves and slaps before being separated by quarterback Michael Vick. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tempers flared: Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cary Williams, left, and Riley Cooper, right, fought during Thursday's practice . The scuffle came only weeks after video of Cooper shouting ‘I will jump that fence and fight every n----- here, bro’ after a Kenny Chesney concert went viral. Footage of the fight shows the two players go at each other immediately after a pass went incomplete in a play during an afternoon practice drill. It's all good: Mr Cooper insisted that everything was fine and it was normal for two teammates to fight during practice . Mr Williams stares at Mr Cooper while being held back by Mr Vick . Both Mr Riley and Mr Williams shove each other before the defender smacks Mr Cooper’s helmet a few times and pulls on the receiver’s facemask before being separated by a coach. Williams walks away, throwing his helmet to the crowd and then goes back after Cooper while shouting ‘I’m not a n------ you mess with,’ according to the Philadelphia Daily News, before being stopped by Mr Vick. A coach intervenes and wide receiver DeSean Jackson forces Mr Williams to walk away. ‘He's just one of those guys, he's a nagging person some times.

Walking it off: Mr Williams walks off the field after the altercation . Though connecting the incident to Cooper’s racist rant over the summer would make sense, both players’ teammates denied to the Daily News that was the case, with Mr Jackson calling it ‘part of what happens out here. It's nothing too serious.’ Cooper also contended the incident was nothing out of the ordinary. They're competitive: Mr Cooper chalked the fight up to both he and Mr Williams being competitors who want the ball and were trying to make a play -- the fight occurred during practice . It's all good: Mr Cooper insisted that everything was fine and it was normal for two teammates to fight during practice . ‘We're all real close, everybody, Cary included.

Police are hunting for any leads that could help solve the mysterious death of a young pregnant mother who was found shot in her car next to her injured daughter. Authorities received a call saying a yellow Jeep Wrangler had crashed off the road in Ripley, Ohio and arrived to find the bullet-riddled body of Brittany Stykes, 22, inside. She had been hit by two bullets, with the fatal shot puncturing her lungs. Her 14-month-old daughter Aubree was strapped in a car seat beside her suffering from a bullet graze to the head. The little girl was rushed to hospital and is now speaking and breathing on her own. Photographs shared by her family show a large scar across her forehead where the bullet struck. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Brittany Stykes, 22, was shot dead as she drove her car, while her daughter Aubree, pictured, suffered a wound to the head. Brittany was pregnant and her unborn child also died . Brittany, a married stay-at-home mother, was four months pregnant and her unborn child also died in the tragedy on August 28. A week on and authorities are scrambling to find any clues that could reveal who shot the five bullets at Brittany's car as she made a routine journey home with her daughter. More than a week after the death, no arrests have been made and the motive in the crime 'is still up in the air,' Chief Deputy John Schadle said at a news conference on Thursday. 'Obviously we're taking this as a very serious matter,' he said, adding that investigators were testing unspecified items found at the scene and trying to reconstruct the crime. Recovering: Aubree's head was grazed by a bullet that shot her mother. She is improving every day, family said . 'We hope this helps fill in some of the pieces of the puzzle.' Preliminary autopsy results show that no gunpowder residue was found on Stykes' body, which suggests that the shots weren't fired at close range. Brown County authorities said the . bullets had been fired through the driver's side of the vehicle and . passed through the passenger side. The bullet that grazed Aubree had passed through her mother. A motorist had called 911 after spotting her yellow Jeep crashed on the highway. He pulled over and checked inside the vehicle, finding the dead mother and her crying toddler. He assumed she had died in the impact of a crash, WCPO reported. Torn apart: Family members say Brittany, right, lived for her daughter Aubree, left, her family and husband . 'There's a Jeep off the road in the . woods. Looks like somebody drove off the road into the woods and they're . passed out at the wheel,' Craig Labell told a 911 dispatcher. 'Looks like a girl, female in her 20s or 30s.' But police found Stykes hunched over the steering wheel. She had been shot with two bullets that had left three wounds on her body, authorities said. David Dodson, Stykes' father and Aubree's grandfather, told The Associated Press on Thursday that he and his family are still baffled about why anyone would want to hurt his daughter and her children. Stykes lived for her family and was loved by everyone who knew her, he said. 'She would call me every morning and it was always, ""Dad, what are we going to do today?""' Dodson said, adding that she visited him every day while her husband worked his factory job in Cincinnati. Scene: Trucks tow Brittany's yellow Jeep, right, which was found crashed off the highway on August 28 . Probe: Authorities closed the road in the days after to search for evidence that could lead to an arrest . 'She loved being a mom, that was her world right there – the babies and being married,' he said. 'She wanted to be with us all the time.' His daughter had just left her mother-in-law's house and was on her way home when she was shot, Dodson said. He said Aubree is getting better every day and has been asking about her mother. But until he knows who killed Brittany and unborn grandchild, Dodson said that he'll be worried about Aubree's safety. 'If there's anyone who knows any information, I beg you, please come out and get a hold of the sheriff's department on this,' he said. 'We need answers.' A $5,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to whoever was responsible. 'We're not going to leave any stone unturned to get justice for Brittany and her family,' Schadle said.

Luxury car maker Rolls-Royce has unveiled a limousine where travelling celebrities will be in good company as its entire roof lining has been turned into a starry night. Designers spent nine months perfecting the lining to make sure it is an exact copy of the sky on the night the first Rolls-Royce Phantom came off the line. Using more than 1,000 fibre optic lights, the replica of the sky has been given the stamp of approval by experts at the South Downs Planetarium in Chichester. Cosmic car: The Rolls-Royce Celestial Phantom celebrates the ten-year anniversary of the limousine model with a replica of the sky in its roof . The luxury British firm is experiencing the most successful period in its long history - selling more than 3,500 cars a year, something which the firm gives credit to the Rolls-Royce Phantom. The Rolls-Royce Phantom became the first car to leave the factory in Goodwood, Chichester, under the BMW regime on New Years Day 2003. To celebrate ten-years of the luxury . model, staff at Rolls-Royce have replicated the exact sky from the . historic night the limousine was completed. The one-off Rolls-Royce Celestial Phantom's exterior colour scheme has been designed to ‘evoke the night sky’ by integrating fine glass particles into the paint to give a sense of depth and light. And inside is a set of leather seats which are presented in a ‘dusk’ hue, which the firm says ‘alludes to the inky quality of a cloudless night sky’. Stars for the stars: It took staff at the luxury car firm nine months to perfect the star constellation, which has been hand woven into the roof lining . Ultimate bling: As if the stars in the roof were not enough, the anniversary Phantom's clock has been decorated with diamonds, reflecting the lights of the 'night sky' above . Cause for celebration: The Phantom was the first car to leave Rolls-Royce's West Sussex factory the under the BMW regime . Time for reflection: The replica of the sky has been given the stamp of approval by experts at a local planetarium, bringing passengers back to 2003 . Under the bonnet of the Phantom is a 6.75-litre V12 engine which develops a whopping 463bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of 5.8 seconds and a top speed of 150mph. The Celestial shows off Rolls-Royce’s craftsmanship with the aluminium body made up of 500 parts and 100-metres of weld. The Celestial makes its global debut at next week’s Frankfurt Motor Show - however, Rolls-Royce is refusing to reveal how much more it would cost over the standard Phantom’s £300,000 price-tag. A spokesperson for the car maker said: ‘The Celestial Phantom celebrates a landmark moment in Rolls-Royce’s history, the very moment Rolls-Royce’s renaissance under BMW came to fruition with the handover of the first Phantom to its eagerly awaiting customer on January 1, 2003 at midnight. ‘In beautifully recreating the night sky at midnight, we showcase the breadth of skills at the heart of the bespoke team.’","Rolls-Royce unveils celebratory Phantom anniversary model .

From 'feebleness of intellect' to 'women trouble' the reasons a patient could be admitted to a lunatic asylum in the late 1800s reveals inequality and a poor understanding of mental health issues. While the startling list of reasons for admission at Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum may give only a glimpse of what caused the patient to be sent there, it reveals a lot about society's attitudes. The sprawling West Virginia institution was closed in 1994, after more than 100 years of lobotomies and cold bath treatments for its patients, many of whom just had the misfortune to have been abandoned by their families. Locked away: West Virginia's Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum was open to the 'feeble minded' A theme quickly emerges in the list, which was published on Usvsth3m.com, showing how women in particular were at the mercy of their husbands and families. 'Marriage of son', 'desertion by husband' and 'domestic trouble' all stand out as examples of inequality masked by a very different attitude to women's rights between 1864 to 1889, when the list was compiled. 'In 1872 ... if [a woman's] husband had a mistress or if she had inherited money ... he could bring her here,' a guide at the former asylum told the Los Angeles Times. 'He could sign her in and leave her until he decided to come back and get her - or until she died, whichever came first.' Women's health issues were also seemingly neglected under a catch all of lunacy. 'Imaginary female trouble', 'suppression of menses' - which could be the case of being pregnant out of wedlock, or caused by an eating disorder or other illness - and hysteria. The weaker sex, as women were defined at the time the asylum first opened, also meant a strong attitude could land them in trouble, with 'nymphomania' and 'seduction and disappointment' reasons for admission. Admitted: A list shows the reasons given for having a patient moved to the asylum from 1864 to 1889 . Construction of the asylum, which is . nearly quarter of a mile long, began in 1858. It was originally intended . to house '240' souls, but at its peak in the 1950s 2,400 patients were . crammed in together. Although . records show many people were admitted for sexual deviance or . promiscuity, others were admitted for 'bad company' or even 'bad . whiskey'. Suspicions of crime or suicide are also alluded to. Among the admissions are entries for gun shot wounds, shooting a child and 'rumor of husband murder'. The effects of the civil war, and even office work, also appeared to have had its toll on West Virginian residents, with possible early cases of post traumatic stress syndrome and nervous breakdowns appearing. Entries for 'The War', 'exposure in army' and 'fell from a horse in the war' appear, alongside 'business nerves' and 'over taxing mental powers'. Patients at the hospital would have been exposed to methods that were considered ground breaking in their day, but cruel by today's standards. Foreboding: The West Virginia asylum, with its long, stark corridors, has been empty since 1994 . Tours: The only people admitted to the hospital now are tourists wanting to hear grisly details about its past from the guides who dress as nurses . A nurse recalled being present as a doctor performed a lobotomy with an ice-pick type instrument, and other patients were subjected to cold bath treatments in an attempt to stop their hysteria. Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum finally closed in 1994, as attitudes and the treatment of patients with mental health issues changed. Today the main building, which had separate wings for African American patients when it was first constructed, still takes admissions - for ghost tours and heritage seekers who want to explore the desolate wards and gruesome medical centers.","Records from West Virginia mental institution reveal society's attitudes .

He said: 'Leaping off cliffs into water when you don’t know what’s in it.

In an interview to promote his new autobiography, Mears said he started his career to enlighten people for safety reasons, rather than encourage the macho and 'militaristic' attitude which is often associated with survival in the wild. His comments come just days after Bear . Grylls removed a steel water slide from his private island off the . Welsh Coast after planning officials launched an investigation into its . safety.

The . investigation - carried out after a complaint from a parent - came . after the school announced plans to spend £220,000 buying iPads for . every pupil to help with homework - and 'engage' with teachers. Earlier . this year Mrs Thain had also been praised by council bosses by saving . the local library from closure by offering to use it for the part of . each day as a 'satellite school' for youngsters who need extra teaching - . and pay for the upkeep. Today her school was in special measures after the sudden surge in bad behaviour after inspectors gave it a Grade 4 rating - the worst it can possibly give out - and branded it 'inadequate' and 'requiring improvement.' Running riot: Ofsted inspectors found a 'core' of students running riot and truancy going unchecked at the school . Bad behavior: Bullying was consistently going ignored, while swearing and race-fuelled fights were common said the inspectors . It led to comparisons to St Trinian’s - a fictional girls’ boarding school, originally created by a cartoonist in the 1940s which later became the subject of hit movies. One parent said: 'We’re absolutely astounded at what happened to Levenshulme because until recently it had been doing so well. It had got good grades in previous Ofsted reports and for all intents and purposes looked as if it was improving all the time. 'But something has gone wrong and now it’s like something out of the St Trinian’s movies. We’ve heard all sorts of reports of small group girls running wild at the school and its impacted on everybody else. 'Some of the youngsters said they didn’t even feel safe going there any more. Noone knows how it has got to this. Maybe the head has simply taken her eye off the ball.' Ofsted called the unannounced inspection on July 3 after a parent complained about the behaviour of pupils. Three inspectors spoke to 100 girls and observed lessons and break times. They also observed 19 lessons, several break times and read 16 responses to a survey. Their report found behaviour had . declined sharply since a previous inspection last October in which . inspectors said the school was 'consistently good' and that students . were 'courteous, polite and generally cheerful towards adults, visitors . and each other.' In the latest report the inspectors said: 'There has been a rapid deterioration in behaviour. A core group of students has disengaged from their education and show no respect for teachers or their fellow students. Out of the movies: Angry parents have compared the school to St Trinian's - which has become the topic of several films, including a 2007 production staring Rupert Everett . 'They cause widespread disruption to learning and an unsafe learning environment resulting in eight permanent exclusions in the academic year to date. 'Responses from parents show that approximately one third of parents disagree that their child feels safe in school and approximately half disagree that the school ensures students are well behaved. 'Behaviour logs from this year show regular reports of unacceptable behaviour including students truanting from lessons, leaving the school site, refusing to go to lessons, smoking, and swearing at teachers. 'Some students have been removed from lessons over 30 times this year and one student more than 80 times - a clear illustration that the behaviour system is not working. 'Many students have no confidence in the ability of the school to combat bullying effectively. Consequently, some bullying goes unreported and is allowed to continue. 'Many students feel unsafe in school due to a wide variety of intolerable behaviours including, fighting, congestion and pushing on the stairs, teachers leaving classes unattended, teachers behaving aggressively towards students; and food and drinks being thrown. 'The majority of students behaved well in front of inspectors. Other students were observed at lunch-time, throwing drinks, congregating in a big group, swearing, talking and filming on mobile phones. 'The big group of students only dispersed once a number of staff had spoken to them and the police officer stood in the middle of them. Inspiration: The fictional St Trinian's School was originally created as a cartoon in the 1940s and inspired the 1980s film The Wildcats of St Trinian's, above . 'Leaders and managers do not effectively prevent bullying and many students spoken to by inspectors feel that staff are unable to protect them and control those whose behaviour is disruptive and dangerous.' The report says most senior leaders at the school were 'unaware' of the scale of the bullying and had 'an over generous' view of the quality of teaching due to inaccurate feedback from staff. It went on: 'Teaching is often not good enough, giving rise to the underachievement of white British girls and students who are disabled or have special educational needs. 'A number of students are unable to explore their learning independently of teachers because they do not have a strong grasp of English. This is compounded by the fact that not all teachers are sufficiently confident in integrating literacy support into their teaching. 'Furthermore, some students who do have a good grasp of English have insufficient understanding of specialist vocabulary used by the teacher, which excludes them from learning.' Mrs Thain, who had been in post for four years, will remain off work pending an investigation by the school governors. Girls on film: The school was also central to film The Belles of St Trinian's, pictured above . In a recent message to parents she said: 'Our mission at Levenshulme High School is to maximise achievement for each individual child. 'We believe in the potential of every young person who attends Levenshulme High School. To do this they will need a high level of skills, a strong work ethic and confidence in themselves. This is at the heart of all we do. 'Our school is characterised by high expectations for both achievement and behaviour and our expectations of the quality of teaching in the classroom are as high as our expectations of our students’ work.' Last May the school decided to spend money on iPads for every pupil this month and all its 80 teachers to help “engage the children much more in their lessons.' The iPad 4 model currently retails for £389 although school managers haggled down the price to £220 per unit - putting the total cost at more than £220,000. Today Patsy Kane, headteacher at the neighbouring Whalley Range High, who has been appointed executive head at Levenshulme, said: 'A thorough review has been carried out of the school’s behaviour and safeguarding policies. 'These have been updated, clarified and strengthened and all staff have been given additional training in safeguarding. Nobody will be in any doubt about the standards of behaviour which are expected from them. They will also know who to speak to if they do have any concerns and can be reassured that these will be dealt with appropriately. 'We are committed to listening to students, having already sought their views, and will be carrying out online surveys on a regular basis to ensure things have improved.' John Edwards, Manchester council’s director of  education and skills, said: 'Swift and decisive measures were taken as soon as the failures the including light, to came to light. 'We are working with the governing body to ensure that strengthened and robust governance is in place to help the school move forwards.'","Amanda Thain, 54, suspended on full pay from Levenshulme High School for Girls in Manchester .

Few bosses are as willing to put their money where their mouth is when it comes to the company's products as Claes Nilsson. The president of Volvo Trucks has so much confidence in the toughness of the Swedish manufacturer's vehicles that he appeared in a video standing on the new FMX model as it dangles 65ft above the sea from a crane. 'Well, I have to admit I had butterflies in my tummy and I certainly did wonder more than once about what I'd let myself in for. I'm no mountain-climber and I don't like heights,' he said.

Vertigo: Mr Nilsson admits he is afraid of heights but agreed to do the short film anyway . 'But I'd promised to do the stunt so I couldn't very well back out.' He had to spend almost two hours standing on the front panel of a Volvo FMX construction truck that had been hoisted high above the water in Gothenburg harbour in Sweden. The stunt was undertaken to show that the truck's front towing hook can handle far greater stresses than those to which it is normally subjected. Incredibly there was not trick filming or special effects, just Mr Nilsson standing atop the suspended truck. The film was shot from a helicopter. Everything had been prepared in advance down to the tiniest detail.

I tried it myself, but just for 15 minutes. 'It was pretty scary I can tell you.' This is not the first time Volvo Trucks has filmed spectacular tests featuring their trucks.

Gardeners have been rubbing their hands for weeks at the prospect of bumper harvests of everything from carrots to courgettes after the long, hot summer. But a hotel in Somerset is about to clean-up with what it is expected to be its biggest ever crop - of loofahs. Contrary to popular belief, the back . scrubbers, which are popular in bathrooms up and down the country, are . not related to sea sponges at all. Scroll down for video demo of the harvest . Cleaning up: Ston Easton gardener Dan Toten compares the finished loofah with two still growing on the vine . Myth: Contrary to popular belief, loofahs are a type of gourd grown in the tropics, not a sea sponge . Unpalatable: While loofahs are edible, they are tough, which is why they make a better bath-time implement . Finished article: Once loofahs have been dried the leave the fibrous husk that make such good scrubbers . They are actually a type of gourd related to the cucumber that are grown in the steamy tropics of South East Asia, where they are just as likely to be found adorning the dinner table as they are hanging above the bath tub. Ston Easton Park Hotel has been growing Britain's only crop for the past five years at its 32-acre home, which is located - naturally - just outside Bath. Plant your loofah seeds in pots in a warm environment in early spring and wait for them to germinate. Once the seeds have sprouted, transfer the plants to the greenhouse. Loofahs, which grow on vines, will largely take care of themselves. As they mature their skins will become tough and rubbery. They will be less tasty to eat, but will make a better bathroom implement. Once they have matured, pick the loofahs, peel off their skins and remove the seeds. Try to squeeze out as much of the flesh as possible. Leave the fibrous husk in the sun to dry. After about a week your loofah will be ready to be moved to the bathroom. Such has been this year's success with weather that has brought the wasps out in their droves, the hotel will be holding a Loofah Festival next month. Head gardener Steve Hargreaves added: 'This year they're bigger than ever. We've had a few whopping big loofah well over 15 inches long. 'They are from the same family as . cucumbers, but they're different. You can eat them when they are young, . but I haven't dared to give it a go yet.' Vegetable gardener Dale Toten added: 'They're actually not that tough to grow, but they are tough to eat. 'We start them in pots in February before planting them in the greenhouse in May. 'They're . kind of like growing tomatoes. Once you've got them out of the pots and . planted up they pretty much look after themselves.' Loofahs are fibrous vegetables with dark green skin that get increasingly tough and rubbery with age. The mature fruits are harvested and . left to dry until all the soft flesh has gone, leaving only a network of . fibres which become the familiar bathroom sight. They are eaten in their native South East Asia and also commonly used in bathing. Drying process: Vegetable gardener Dale Toten inspects the loofah harvest at Ston Easton Park Hotel . Unique: Ston Easton Park Hotel has been growing Britain's only loofah crop for the past five years on its estate . Harvest: This year's heat wave has provided the perfect growing conditions for Ston Easton's loofahs . Guests of the hotel are spoiled with their very own loofahs, which are grown on the estate. Mr Hargreaves said: 'Once we've peeled off the skins and emptied out the seeds we wash them and squeeze out as much flesh as possible. 'They're quite slimy. They feel like they're full of soap. 'Once they have been thoroughly cleaned, we hang them up for a week or two, and then bang - you have yourself a loofah.' Tough: Fibrous dried loofahs (left) make useful bathroom implements, but can be tough to eat (right) Ripe: Loofahs will be harvested in time for a festival due to take place at the hotel next month .","'We've had a few whopping loofah, well over 15 inches long,' says gardener .
