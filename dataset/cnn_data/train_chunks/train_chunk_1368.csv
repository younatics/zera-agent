"Germany launched its first ever aerial blitz on Britain exactly 100 years ago tonight when two Zeppelins were sent on a bombing mission which killed four. On the nights of January 19 and 20, 1915, two of the airships were heading for Humberside but were blown further down the east coast by strong gusts. Heralding a new era of warfare, their first two targets - King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk - were chosen purely by the direction of the wind. Scroll down for video . The Germans launched their first ever blitz on Britain exactly 100 years ago as Zeppelins attacked the east coast . The two Zeppelins were aiming to bomb industrial targets in Humberside but ended up being blown down towards Norfolk, where they attacked King's Lynn (pictured) and Great Yarmouth . Devastation: Four were killed in the bombings which also caused damage in surrounding villages . The bombing raid killed four, injured 16 and caused more than £7,000 worth of damage to the towns and surrounding villages. Military historian Steve Smith said it marked a change in the face of conflict, with the Zeppelin air raids going on to claim 435 British lives in the First World War . The bombings served as a forewarning of what was to come during the Blitz in the Second World War, he said. Speaking of the attacks a century ago, Mr Smith said: 'Both pilots found themselves completely lost. 'The first realised he was over Norfolk and used landmarks such as Happisburgh lighthouse to skilfully navigate his way down the coast to Great Yarmouth, which was a valid strategic target. 'His first bomb fell in a field but a further 10 hit targets in the town. Courtesy of Imperial War Museums . Blitz: Edward Ellis stands outside the remains of his home after the bombs fell on Great Yarmouth, Norfolk . Heralding a new era of warfare, their first two targets - King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth (pictured) - were chosen purely by the direction of the wind . Superintendent Charles Hunt, of King's Lynn Borough Police, examines an incendiary bomb dropped on 63 Cresswell Street in King's Lynn following the bombing raid . 'The other still thought he was over the Humber and dropped bombs on pretty much random targets like the towns of Sheringham and Hunstanton along the north Norfolk coast. 'It was only by chance that he happened upon King's Lynn where he claimed two lives and caused a significant amount of damage. 'He then tried to navigate back over land and ended up above Norwich but fortunately by that point, he had run out of bombs.' The Kaiser had banned the bombing of London because of the potential of harming the Royal family, to whom he was related, but sanctioned attacks on industrial targets. There had been previous attempts at raids on the UK using rickety biplanes, Mr Smith added, but these were largely unsuccessful. The bombing raid killed four, injured 16 and caused more than £7,000 worth of damage to the towns and surrounding villages . As the attacks became more frequent, Britain's defences improved with many Zeppelins shot down, such as this one near London in 1916 . A Zeppelin burns in the night sky as fighter pilots from the Royal Flying Corps bring it down . How the Mail helped those bombed by Zeppelins during the First World War . One such attack resulted in a bomb landing in the sea off the Kent coast and another blew a gardener, who amazingly survived, out of a tree in Dover while was removing Christmas decorations. Previous successful raids on Belgium and Paris meant the British Government knew what was coming. Mr Smith added: 'In many ways the early Zeppelin raids did us a favour. 'We improved black-out procedures and held back planes from the Western Front to defend our own shores. 'Many of the techniques used to defend us during the First World War were later imitated during the Blitz.' A parliamentary inquiry was held into the UK's defences and led to the creation of the nation's first fighter direction system - which proved vital in the Battle of Britain. By the end of the war, an estimated £1.4million worth of damage was caused to the UK - but it was nowhere near the widespread impact the Germans had hoped for. 'People were obviously wary but it didn't cause widespread panic,' Mr Smith said. 'It served more as a warning which galvanised the British public to be vigilant.' In another twist of fate the last raid of the war also happened off Norfolk when Peter Strasser, chief commander of the Germany Imperial Navy Zeppelins, and his crew were shot down on August 5 1918 during a night raid.","First ever Zeppelin attack on Britain was launched 100 years ago tonight .

"Britain's counter-terror laws are 'no longer fit for purpose', leaving spooks and police unable to prevent attacks, a former MI5 chief has warned, . Lord Evans of Weardale said it is now 'much harder' than a decade ago for the authorities to access communications between terrorists and criminals, because they are discussing plots on platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Snapchat. But Deputy PM Nick Clegg today again rejected the idea of retaining data about internet and social media use by 'every single man woman and child in this country for a year'. Lord Evans of Weardale said it is now 'much harder' than a decade ago for the authorities to access communications between terrorists and criminals . Pressure for more powers for police and intelligence agencies has grown in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, in which 17 people were killed. Coalition tensions have been exposed after David Cameron demanded that social media and messaging sites open up their networks to the security services. But Mr Clegg has blocked the idea of what he describes as a 'Snooper's Charter'. In a rare intervention, Lord Evans warned national security depends on greater legal powers. In an article for the Sunday Telegraph, Lord Evans said: 'The ability of the police and security agencies to do this important work of protecting our society and its vulnerable people is under threat from changing technology. 'We expect them today not just to follow up a crime or terrorist attack and identify the perpetrators but rather to do all they can to stop the attack or crime from taking place at all. 'They can only do this if they have the tools to do so and the tools at their disposal are no longer fit for purpose.' Mr Clegg said he agreed with Lord Evans and the police that the state needs to 'retain the ability to intrude on the privacy' of such people. But he said he is 'uncomfortable' with the idea of retaining data about internet and social media use by 'every single man woman and child in this country for a year'. 'It is a blanket approach to the retention of data of people who are innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. 'It is not a very British thing to confer or imply guilt on the whole of the nation by retaining records of every website everyone has visited over the course of a year.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg today again rejected the idea of retaining data about internet and social media use by 'every single man woman and child in this country for a year'. Mr Clegg said the Snoopers' Charter plans were 'unproven, clunky, resource intensive'. He went on: 'Lots of experts looked at it and said this is a waste of resources, a waste of time. Why are we keeping records of every man, woman and child across the country when for starters, we tend to know where to look for the people who want to do us harm?' The Deputy Prime Minister said the aim was to 'find the needle without inferring guilt on the haystack'. 'New powers will need to be put on the statute book in the next parliament, and I will advocate them as much as any chisel-faced securocrat,' he went on. 'I want to keep us safe. It's ludicrous this idea that people who care about our freedom don't care about our safety. 'What I will not do... is saying that every single man, woman and child should have data about what they get up to online kept for a year. On a visit to Washington on Friday David Cameron warned internet firms they must work with security agencies to stop their networks becoming a 'safe haven' for terrorists. The Prime Minister used a press conference in the White House to insist the likes of Facebook and and WhatsApp cannot be used as a secret way for extremists to plot atrocities away from the glare of MI5 and the FBI. Mr Cameron insists the security agencies must be able to intercept communications between extremists and terror suspects who use encrypted messaging services and social media sites to plot atrocities. Mr Cameron insists the security agencies must be able to intercept communications between extremists and terror suspects who use encrypted messaging services and social media sites to plot atrocities . He said: 'I take a very simple approach to this, which is ever since we've been sending letters to each other or making telephone calls to each other or mobile phone calls to each other or, indeed, contacting each other on the internet, it has been possible in both our countries in extremis, in my country by signed warrant by the Home Secretary, to potentially listen to a call between two terrorists, to stop them in their activity. 'We're not asking for back doors. We have - we believe in very clear front doors through legal processes that should help to keep our country safe. 'And my only argument is that as technology develops, as the world moves on, we should try to avoid the safe havens that could otherwise be created for terrorists to talk to each other. 'That's the goal that I think is so important. Because I'm in no doubt as, having been Prime Minister for four-and-a-half years, having seen how our intelligence services work, I know that some of these plots that get prevented, the lives that get saved. 'There is a very real connection between that and the capabilities that our intelligence services, within the law, use to defend our people.' But US President Barack Obama struck a more cautious tone, agreeing only that there should be a 'dialogue' about balancing national security with concerns about the privacy of web users. Mr Obama said: 'It is useful to have civil libertarians and others tapping us on the shoulder in this process and reminding us that there are values at stake as well. 'We shouldn't feel as if because we've just seen such a horrific attack in Paris, that suddenly everything should be going by the wayside. 'Unfortunately this has been a constant background and I think will continue to be for every Prime Minister or President for some time to come. 'We've got to make sure that we don't overreact but that we remain vigilant and are serious about our responsibilities.'","Lord Evans said it is now 'much harder' than a decade ago to track plots .

"Ros Altmann, the Government’s business champion for older workers, said it was ‘astonishing’ that NS&I had failed to predict how big demand would be . Around 100 extra staff have been drafted in to man a call centre selling the Government’s new pensioner bonds after a buying frenzy caused phonelines to jam and the website to crash. More than £1billion of the bonds were sold to 110,000 over-65s in the first two days they were on sale. Only £10billion-worth are available, sparking fears that they would sell out. Customers complained that the National Savings and Investments (NS&I) website, which sells the bonds, crashed after payment details had been entered. Repeated error messages caused one man to reportedly re-enter his details four times, only to discover all the payments had gone through and £40,000 was due to leave his bank account instead of the intended £10,000. And NS&I admitted that it was having to bring in another 100 staff after the chaotic launch saw its dedicated 24-hour phoneline swamped with calls. It had already increased the number of call centre workers from 300 to 600 before the scenes of panic on Thursday, and brought in a further 430 additional office staff to process applications. Yesterday the Government’s business champion for older workers, Ros Altmann, said it was ‘astonishing’ that NS&I had failed to predict how big initial demand would be. Scroll down for video . She said: ‘Savers have had such a raw time for five years, they are desperate, and this is the first really good savings product launched for years. 'It is a shame there have been so many problems. I hope they will now be able to sell it all smoothly.’ Anna Bowes, from savings advice site savingschampion.co.uk, said she had been contacted by people who were ‘worried and upset’ about problems buying the bonds. Pensioners who had moved large sums of money from their savings to current accounts in order to pay by direct debit had also been in touch, concerned about losing interest. But George Osborne said the sale had been ‘hugely successful’ with £1,153million of bonds sold in only two days. In a statement he said: ‘Our economic plan involves supporting savers and I’m delighted to report that it is proving hugely popular. ‘I can confirm that the latest figures show that our 65+ Pensioner Bond has had the biggest opening sales of any retail financial product in Britain’s modern history. Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) had boasted the bonds were the fastest-selling financial product in modern times . ‘£1,150million of these bonds have now been sold in the first two days, to over 110,000 pensioners. 'There’s plenty more available as we’re offering up to £10billion for sale, so we expect them to be on sale for months. 'It just shows what an appetite there is for an economic plan that rewards savers.’ A NS&I spokesman said its website was now ‘operating normally’ and pointed out that customers could also apply by post. People who have inadvertently made more than one payment will automatically be refunded from today and do not need to contact NS&I.","Customers complained National Savings and Investments website crashed .

"Convicted Al Qaeda fundraiser Baghdad Meziane, 49, (pictured) is fighting deportation back to Algeria under the Human Rights Act . A convicted Al-Qaeda terrorist with close links to the Paris massacre cannot be deported from Britain because it would breach his right to a family life, it emerged yesterday. Baghdad Meziane was jailed for 11 years in 2003 for running a terror network recruiting jihadists and fund-raising for Al-Qaeda. But despite a judge saying he was a dangerous man and should serve his full sentence then be deported, he was released from prison five years early and allowed to return to his family home in Leicester. The 50-year-old is an associate of Djamel Beghal, a convicted terrorist whose wife and family live in Leicester and who is said to have mentored two of the Paris attackers while they were in jail together in France. Britain is believed to have spent the past six years trying to deport Meziane, a father of two. The Home Office has repeatedly described him as a ‘danger to the community of the United Kingdom’. The British-Algerian, who was born in the Midlands, successfully claimed that his deportation would breach his human right to a family life and that he might face torture if sent home. He had close links to Beghal, who converted Amedy Coulibaly – the killer of four hostages in a kosher supermarket as well as a police woman in Paris – to radical Islamism while in jail in France. Beghal – known as one of Al-Qaeda’s top recruiters in Europe – also heavily influenced Cherif Kouachi, one of the two brothers who committed the Charlie Hebdo attack on January 7 in which 11 people died. He was initially imprisoned in France over a plot to blow up the US embassy in Paris. Under questioning – he claims he was tortured – he confessed to the plot, leading to the arrest of Meziane and other Algerians living in Leicester – Brahim Benmerzouga and Kamel Daoudi. Meziane had close links to Al Qaeda recruiter and convicted terrorist Djamel Beghal (pictured), who said to have radicalised Kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly and Charlie Hebdo gunman Chérif Kouachi . Daoudi was extradited to Paris and jailed. He was released in 2008 but France was unable to deport him, due again to the Human Rights Act, and he is under house arrest. Meziane and Benmerzouga were jailed in the UK and are believed to have been released into probation hostels in 2009. Benmerzouga was subsequently deported to Algeria but Meziane is so far believed to have fought off attempts to remove him and is understood to be living in the Midlands with his family. There is a growing row over whether the UK’s security agencies have adequate powers to tackle the terrorist threat. Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, told The Sunday Telegraph that the Meziane case highlighted the need to scrap the Human Rights Act. ‘It’s a nonsense that people who are a threat to our society are able to use their human rights to avoid being sent back to their home country when it is clear they have no regard for the human rights of our citizens,’ he said. A Home Office spokesman said it would continue to press for the deportation of terror suspects. Abu Rahin Aziz, 32, a father of two from Luton, fled in March last year after he was charged with affray following an attack in London. Beghal (left) with supermarket killer Coulibaly (right). He also organised crossbow training for Coulibaly's wife Hayat Boumeddiene, now the world’s most wanted woman . He boasted online about skipping bail and joining Islamic State, and has urged other Muslims in the West to ‘attack or emigrate’. Migrants will also be stopped from avoiding removal on the grounds they have fathered children in Britain, if they play no role in their upbringing. Meziane and Benmerzouga were found guilty of 'entering into a funding arrangement for the purposes of terrorism' in April 2003 at Leicester Crown Court. They had raised thousands of pounds through a credit card fraud for an international network of terrorists planning a Jihad, or holy war, against the West, and worked together to make military equipment, false travel documents and recruitment material available to the terrorist organisation. Benmerzouga also admitted one charge of conspiracy to defraud by manufacturing and/or using false bank cards and card details, as well as three charges of possessing false passports. Meziane had denied conspiracy to defraud but was also found guilty by the jury. He earlier pleaded guilty to possessing a false passport. Mr Justice Curtis, sentencing the two men, said: 'You have not directly taken life or seriously injured anyone but the terrorists, in order to carry out their terrible killings and maimings, need money, false papers and military-style materials. Beghal with Charlie Hebdo killer Chérif Kouachi in 2010. Beghal and Meziane lived near to one another in Leicester, and Meziane is said to have given Beghal the false passport which enabled him to visit a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan . 'You both provided terrorists with the vital support and ran a well-organised and secretive cell.' After the pair's release, Benmerzouga was deported, but Meziane is still in the UK. It is not known if he has ever received legal aid to support his battle to remain in Britain. A Home Office spokesman has confirmed that Meziane is still in Britain, but would not comment on an individual case. A source told The Telegraph: 'We are in the process of removing Meziane.' The spokesman told MailOnline: 'Deportation with assurances enables us to remove people from the UK, in line with our existing international obligations, even when there are substantial grounds to believe they face a real risk of treatment contravening their human rights in their home country. 'We have already removed nine individuals under our Deportation With Assurances agreement with Algeria. However, we do not routinely comment on individual cases.'","Baghdad Meziane, 49, was jailed in 2003 for helping to fund terrorism .

"Hurrah, the Seventies are back! This season’s clothes couldn’t have been a bigger throwback for me when I opened one of the fashion magazines this month. From the fringing to the pretty Bohemian dresses and floppy hats, I remember it all the first time round, when I was a successful model who travelled around the world on fashion shoots for adverts and magazines. My favourite items in the Seventies were the sweet, flowing dresses I might have worn when at Glastonbury. I was very much a flower power kind of girl, and still adore wearing bright colours. But now, at 75, can I really do the same trends the second time round?

"The grandparents of Cassidy Stay have spoken out to reveal how she is coping with the loss of her murdered parents and four siblings, and how they have found comfort in mourning with the alleged killer's parents who are their longtime friends. Ronald Haskell Jr stands accused of killing Stephen and Katie Stay, and four of their five young children last July in a rampage while searching for his ex-wife. Oldest daughter Cassidy was the sole survivor of the shooting at the Houston home, when a bullet grazed her scalp and she pretended to be dead. Tom and Joyce Stay, Cassidy's paternal grandparents, had known the alleged killer since he was just a boy, attending the same close-knit Mormon ward in southern California with his parents, Karla and Ronald Haskell Sr. Scroll down for video . Grandparents: Tom and Joyce Stay (pictured) lost their son Stephen, his wife and four of their children last July in a brutal mass murder at the family's home in Houston. In the six months since the tragedy, they have bonded with the parents of the alleged shooter, a family they have known for many years . Sole survivor: Granddaughter Cassidy Stay was the only survivor of the shooting. She pretended to be dead after a bullet grazed her head. Pictured above at her family's funeral . In the wake of the tragic crime, the Stays reached out to their old friends the Haskells, knowing they too must be going through a trying time. 'And, indeed, we found they were sick and brokenhearted about everything. I told them, ""Your son did this, not you,""' Mrs Stay told the Houston Chronicle. 'Our friends are as baffled by this whole thing as we all are.' They also point out that the Haskells themselves were also victims of their son's violent behavior. According to police reports, more than a week before the killings, Haskell Jr choked his mother and duct-taped her to a chair for hours - threatening to kill the entire family for speaking to his estranged ex-wife Melannie Lyon. 'He was also mean to his father, who is in poor health - by purposefully tipping over his wheelchair while he was sitting in it. He did that more than once,' Mrs Stay said. 'Now his father cries all the time. He loved my son, Stephen.' Haskell Jr remains in Harris County Jail on six capital murder charges. A date for his trial is pending while he undergoes mental health evaluations which will determine whether he pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, and if the prosecutors will push for the death sentence. All gone: Sole survivor Caissdy pictured above with her family. The victims were her mother Katie, father, Stephen, and siblings Bryan, 14, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7, and Zach, age four, all pictured . Behind bars: Alleged killer Ronald Haskell Jr remains jailed on six counts of capital murder. A trial date is pending his mental health evaluation . Mrs Stay remembers Haskell Jr as a 'good kid' in his teen years, before he moved with his parents to Alaska for his final years in high school. She can't understand what would have compelled the former homecoming king to commit such a gruesome murder. Investigators believe Haskell Jr traveled cross-country to find his ex-wife Melannie who recently divorced him and took out a protective order after being together for 12 years. Katie Stay was Melannie's sister and helped her move to the Houston area to get away from her husband. Haskell Jr donned a FedEx uniform to break into the Stay home on July 9, 2014 when only Cassidy and her siblings Bryan, 13; Emily, 9; Rebecca, 7; and Zach, 4; were at home. He waited until their parents got home to tie them up to chairs and shoot each in the back of the head. Cassidy only survived when the bullet intended to kill her only grazed her head and she pretended to be dead until Haskell Jr fled. Target: Investigators believe Haskell Jr broke into the Stay's home in Houston trying to find his ex-wife Melannie Lyon (pictured together above), Katie Stay's sister . Shots fired: Haskell Jr barged into the home when only Cassidy and siblings were home. He then waited for the parents to come back to tie them all up and shoot each in the back of the head . Surrender: When he left the home to track down his ex-wife, Cassidy called 911 and police surrounded him before he could kill more. Pictured above surrendering to police, wearing the Fed Ex uniform he used to break into the home . 'She told us that she felt like angels were surrounding her. Like somebody held a hand over her mouth to keep her quiet. I hate to imagine what she heard and saw before she walked out of there,' Mrs Stay said. The brave teen quickly called 911 after he left, which helped police track Haskell Jr down and arrest him before he got to his ex-wife staying with her parents nearby. Six months later, Cassidy is living with relatives and attending school in a suburb of Houston, and trying to live as normal a life as possible, hanging out with friends, attending church dances, football games and practicing her flute. Mourning: Cassidy is now living with relatives outside of Houston. She just got a therapy dog for Christmas. Pictured above with her mother . Her grandparents say she is obviously still traumatized by the shooting, but doing better with the help of a new therapy dog. For Christmas, she received a Rhodesian ridge-back puppy which can sense her mood and help calm her down. Also over the holidays, Cassidy got to see a memorial dedicated to her family near Spring, Texas. As for Mr and Mrs Stay, their faith in God makes them certain that they will see their son and his family soon in heaven. 'We are old. So, it won't be that long for us,' said Mrs Stay.

"Shocking: Nearly a quarter of girls in care become teenage mothers, a report reveals today . Nearly a quarter of girls in care become teenage mothers, a shocking report reveals today. Around 1,000 girls - some 22 per cent of the total - have children when they themselves are teenagers, three times the national average. The Centre for Social Justice, the think tank set up by Iain Duncan Smith, paints a disturbing picture of a struggling care system shamefully betraying many of its vulnerable charges. Freedom of information requests show that more than 4,000 children go missing from care each year - and that 36 per cent of care leavers are not in education, employment or training by the age of 19. The CSJ warns of an inter-generational cycle of disadvantage it says is running through England’s care system. It has found that at least one in ten care leavers aged 16 to 21 who are parents have gone on to have a child of their own taken into care in the last year. 'When you take children into care you have a unique opportunity to break the cycle of disadvantage. Too often this isn’t happening,' said Alex Burghart, the CSJ's policy director. 'Many parts of the care system are in tatters and we desperately need to rescue it to protect our most vulnerable children.' The report calls on the Government to create 'scorecards' to name and shame councils failing children in care. It also says care leavers should be given a step up in life by funding £2,000 apprenticeship bursaries. Local authorities spend £2.5 billion a year supporting children in foster and residential care - a real terms increase of three per cent since the coalition came to power. Worrying:Freedom of information requests show that more than 4,000 children go missing from care each year - and that 36 per cent of care leavers are not in education, employment or training by the age of 19 . The number of children in care has risen to almost 70,000 - its highest level for nearly 20 years, partly as a result of a rise in the number being removed from their parents following the 'Baby P' scandal in 2007. The state spends more each year per child - on average around £36,500 - than it costs to send a child to Eton. But following a major investigation into the care system, the CSJ concludes many local authorities are failing in their duty to support young people or give them any understanding of healthy and positive relationships. The figures on teenage parenting represent just one example of a system struggling to look after those in care, the report says. Those leaving care are now twice as likely not to be in education, employment or training (NEET) at the age of 19 than the rest of the population. Other symptoms of a system at breaking point include new figures showing that thousands of vulnerable children go missing from England’s care system on a regular basis. Local authorities in England reported 252 cases where children have gone missing from care for more than 28 days in the last year. There were 4,452 cases of children missing for more than a day and 707 for more than a week. Only two-thirds of local authorities responded to requests for details under freedom of information law, so the real number will be higher still. The Centre for Social Justice, the think tank set up by Iain Duncan Smith (above), paints a disturbing picture of a struggling care system shamefully betraying many of its vulnerable charges . Mr Burghart added: 'If this many children were going missing from their families it would spark national outrage. 'Children in the care system need proper support and protection. We need to learn the lessons of what can happen to children who are not cared for - as we saw in Rotherham.' Almost one-third of children in care leave school with no GCSEs and just six per cent do well enough to go to university. Almost four in every ten prisoners under the age of 21 has been in care while growing up. A series of scandals involving children being abused while supposedly in the care of the state - notably in north Wales - has heightened concerns about the failings of the system. Teams supporting young people leaving care are often overstretched, the report finds, with an average caseload of a personal adviser in some areas of 49 young people. The CSJ recommends introducing league tables to highlight which local authorities are failing children and young people from care. It suggests overhauling the system and introducing new support networks for care leavers, based on more successful schemes in the US. Researchers also say there is a financial imbalance between care leavers who take up apprenticeships and those who go to university. The CSJ says apprenticies should get the same state-funded bursary of £2,000 as those who study for a degree.","Centre for Social Justice paints worrying picture of struggling care system .

"These seals look to be enjoying a bubble bath as they frolic on the beach. Lying at the water's edge the grey seals allow waves to break over them for around an hour as they take a well-earned rest from hunting for fish. Amidst the foaming water they seem to be lapping up a luxurious soak. These seals look to be enjoying a bubble bath as they frolic on the beach on the Island of Heligoland, 30 miles off the German coast . Lying at the water's edge the grey seals allow waves to break over them as they take a well-earned rest from hunting for fish . The seals live on the Island of Heligoland, 30 miles off the German coast in the North Sea. It is famed for its wildlife and grey seals gather there to mate, give birth and bring up their young. Keen wildlife photographerEimar Weiss, 44, travelled from his home in Hamburg and spent an entire day photographing the seals in the breakwater. One of the seals enjoy the wash; the group were photographed enjoying some down time for around an hour . Heligoland is famed for its wildlife and grey seals gather there to mate, give birth and bring up their young . Mr Weiss, a dental technician, said: 'Enjoying the bubble bath lasted up to one hour. 'Mating, giving birth, feeding their young and hunting for fish is exhausting for the seals. Some grey seals rested on the beach and some in the breakwater - it certainly seemed they were enjoying this. 'It was very windy with wind speeds of around 40mph. 'I focused on the seals in the surf because of the crazy splashes. Foam does not behaves like pure water, it's just fascinating. 'You can't see this effect with your own eyes, but you can freeze it in a photo. Keen wildlife photographer Eimar Weiss, 44, travelled from his home in Hamburg and spent an entire day photographing the seals . This seal might find it difficult to navigate to the next stop-off as it has its face completely covered by foam . 'It's not easy to get such shots, you have to be very patient. Not every wave is strong enough, not every wave produced enough bubbles sometimes the sun disappears behind clouds, the seal turns away from the camera and so on. 'I love that it's looks like a bubble bath and the seals seem to enjoy it. 'I like the foam splashes and the warm colours from the sunlight and the sharpness and details of the pictures.' Mr Weiss says Heligoland is a 'must-visit' location for a keen wildlife photographer such as himself. Not every wave produces bubbles, but thankfully these seals were in luck as they enjoyed a good old soak . He added: 'From mid-November until mid-January the grey seals are giving birth. It's amazing to see the baby seals, they are so cute. 'Most of the photos shows a female grey seal, they are a lot smaller than the males and also more colourful. 'After giving birth, the female has to lactate the baby for one month. In this time, the baby seal is not able to swim because its fur is not yet water resistant. 'The female often stays near her baby on the beach or in the dunes, sometimes she is going in the sea to hunt for her own. 'Gestation period for a grey seal is 11 and a half months and after giving birth they are mating again. 'The mating male protected the female against other males and is always nearby.'","Seals live on the Island of Heligoland, 30 miles off the German coast in the North Sea .

"Ignoring the figures: Labour's Harriet Harman . Households will see a ‘substantial boost to their spending power’ this year, a major report reveals today. Wages are set to surge ahead of prices as workers feel the benefit of the growing economy. The predictions by economists at influential think tank Item Club undermine Labour’s campaign on the cost of living. Yesterday the party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman raised the issue eight times in a TV interview as she argued ordinary people are not feeling better off. She declared that Barack Obama was ‘wrong’ last week to praise Britain’s economic recovery when he said it showed the UK Government ‘must be doing something right’. And she told Andrew Neil on BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘That growth is not being felt by people, and it’s a recovery that’s being accompanied by stagnation in living standards and that’s why we’re saying that people are no better off – the recovery hasn’t reached their front door.’ But her claims appear to be undermined by forecasts of a buoyant economy, growing wages and falling prices. Item Club’s experts say that real disposable incomes, which take inflation into account, are expected to rise by 3.7 per cent this year, while interest rates are set to stay at 0.5 per cent until 2016. This will ease pressure on overstretched borrowers, although it will prolong the agony of low returns for savers. Meanwhile, inflation will average ‘around zero’ in 2015, with the economy growing by 2.9 per cent – considerably better than the 2.4 per cent predicted just three months ago. Later this week, figures to be published by the Office for National Statistics are expected to show that wages are rising nearly four times faster than prices. They should also reveal that average earnings, excluding bonuses, are nearly 2 per cent higher than a year ago. Chancellor George Osborne, (L) pictured with Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander, has hailed the report as ‘further proof’ that the Government’s economic plan is working . This means that pay is now rising substantially faster than inflation, which has crashed to a record low of 0.5 per cent on the back of falling food and fuel prices. The Item Club’s report states that the UK is ‘a clear winner’ of the oil-price slump from $115 a barrel last June to less than $50 in recent days. Its chief economic advisor Peter Spencer says the lower price will provide ‘a shot in the arm’ for British households, ‘who are set to benefit from a substantial boost to their spending power’. He went on: ‘Not every economy will be a winner from oil prices collapsing but the UK certainly is. The predictions by economists at influential think tank Item Club undermine Labour and Ed Miliband's campaign on the cost of living . ‘We have described the previous weakness of commodity prices as a silver lining in the storm clouds gathering over the world economy. But with oil prices now down over 50 per cent since last June, this silver lining has turned to gold.’ Chancellor George Osborne has hailed the report as ‘further proof’ that the Government’s economic plan is working. ‘But the job is not yet done, and so we must keep working through our plan that is securing a better economic future,’ he added. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander urged companies to pass on price cuts to consumers. ‘Falling oil prices act like a giant tax cut to the economy and will further boost our already established recovery,’ he said. ‘But the full benefits will only be felt if every last penny of the oil price fall is passed on to consumers – in full and quickly. ‘Consumers felt the pain when oil prices were high. It’s only fair that they, and the economy, should feel the full benefit when they’re falling.’ In Item Club’s report, Mr Spencer says the falling oil prices ‘come just as the recovery was losing momentum, and will move the game up to a higher level for a year or two. ‘The UK consumer has been lashed by rising fuel and food prices for so long, but is now the major beneficiary as these pull back. ‘So far, the recovery in our incomes has been driven by larger numbers entering work while earnings have been falling. But now, individuals can look forward to a substantial increase in real earnings.’","Households to see ‘substantial boost to their spending power’ this year .

"Out and proud: António Simões said the 'emotional intelligence' of being gay helped him to the top . HSBC's top executive in Britain has said he owes his success to being gay because he has better 'emotional intelligence'. António Simões spoke out as he was named the country's top gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender executive by a panel including shopping guru Mary Portas and Tory peer Lord Black. The 39-year-old's comments came just two months after he said fellow business leaders still in the closet had a 'huge personal responsibility' to reveal their sexuality. Mr Simões told the newspaper Expresso, based in his home nation of Portugal: 'Being gay is a plus for me. It made ​​me a more authentic person, with better empathy, better emotional intelligence. 'If I wasn't gay, I probably would not be CEO of the bank'. Praising the City's tolerance, he joked that being gay was less likely to have held him back than being a '39-year-old, short, bald, Portuguese' man trying to make his way in the City of London. Mr Simões joined HSBC just before the financial crisis from the London office of financial consultancy McKinsey & Co. He was named the bank's deputy chief executive and head of UK banking in 2012. The wide-ranging interview with Expresso examined how quickly the City, renowned for its male-dominated macho culture, is changing its attitude to diversity. It is just eight years since former BP chief executive Lord Browne embarked on a protracted court battle to hide a gay relationship from the public. Changing times: HSBC's headquarters in London's Canary Wharf. Mr Simões said attitudes have shifted . Mr Simões, who married his Spanish husband Tomas in 2007, said he had spoken extensively since then to Lord Browne and he agreed it was easier to come out now than ever before. The pair credited Apple's chief executive Tim Cook, who was hailed in October for declaring: 'I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.' In doing so Mr Cook became the only openly gay chief executive of any of the 500 biggest companies in the U.S. Barely a week after the Apple boss came out, Mr Simões - who holds the number one spot on the Out at Work list of Britain's top 50 executives - made a searing speech aimed at closeted colleagues. Praise: Mr Simões told a Portuguese newspaper the coming-out of Apple's Tim Cook (left) had changed everything, seven years after Lord Browne (right) fought a lengthy court battle to hide his gay relationship . 'We're in London, we're in 2014', he told a summit in November. 'It's not acceptable that we take for granted all the work done by others on issues such as marriage equality. ‘I am the short, bald, Portuguese, gay guy. I have started to use it as a positive element of my personality.'","António Simões, 39, spoke as he was named UK's top LGBT executive .

"Video footage shows the heart stopping moment a 17 year old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark. Sam Smith's Go-Pro vision helmet captured the sudden and brief attack while he was spear fishing on the New South Wales south coast on Friday. The teenager can be seen trying to stab the shark with his spear gun as the 1.5 metre predator aggressively lashes out and bites the boy's hand before swimming out of sight. Channel Seven released the footage on Sunday as one of Sydney's most popular beaches was shut down following a shark sighting at Manly beach. The terrifying moment Sam Smith is bitten on the right hand by a shark while spear fishing was captured on his Go-Pro vision helmet . Sam attempted to stab the predator with his spear gun as the shark came at him . The 17-year-old was unsuccessful as the shark very suddenly sunk his teeth into his hand and swam away . The lucky teenager underwent surgery on his hand after the scary encounter . Sam was airlifted from Mollymook Beach, on the NSW south coast, to Sydney to undergo the surgery . The curious boy went under the water to film the shark when he experienced the horrifying encouter . Fishing off Mollymook Beach with his friend Luke Sisinni, Sam went under the water to film the 1.5metre shark when the frightening incident happened. Paramedics rushed to the scene just before midday on Friday, as hundreds of children competing in the 2015 Stramit NSW Country Surf Life Saving Championships looked on. Mr Smith was fishing when he saw the shark and tried to go down to film it, according to his friend Luke Sisinni, the Milton Ulladulla Times reported. 'He said it spun around and started coming for him, so he stabbed it with his spear to try and scare it off, but it just went ballistic and bit him,' Mr Sisinni said. '[Sam] came up screaming saying ""I got bitten by a shark""'. Two ambulances arrived at the beach and the boy was treated with lacerations to his left hand, including multiple lacerations to his fingers. The boy was taken to Milton Ulladulla hospital where he is in a stable condition, and later flown to Sydney for specialist treatment. Sam was airlifted to a Sydney hospital for emergency surgery on his hand after he was mauled by a shark while spearfishing on the south coast of New South Wales . The spearfisherman was bitten by a shark, thought to be a Bronze Whaler, when he 'went down to film it' Man down: Paramedics and police attend to the injured boy near Ulladulla . The friends were fishing off Mollymook Beach on south coast of New South Wales when the attack took place . Paramedics worked quickly to address the lacerations on the boys hand and fingers . Just two days after Sam's lucky escape, Manly beach was closed after a swimmer raised the alarm after spotting an unspecified type of shark in the water at around 1.30pm. But the warning did not deter many people who proceeded to continue swimming in the sea despite being told by lifeguards . A Surf Life Saving NSW spokeswoman said inflatable rescue boats were used to chase the shark away and the beach would reopen once it was deemed safe again. 'The problem is there were already a lot of swimmers and surfers in the water who won't come out,' she said. 'We suggest that if people continue to stay in the water they're doing so at their own risk.' Beachgoers flocked to Manly despite earlier reports of a shark sighting . Meanwhile, Newcastle beach remains closed for ninth consecutive day from a sighting. The sea off Newcastle was first declared a no-go area when a five-metre great white shark was seen at Merewether Beach on January 10. A helicopter crew spent Sunday scouring the ocean for signs of the fearsome predator, nicknamed Bruce, along with a three-and-a-half metre shark that lunched on a dolphin last week. Neither have been spotted since Friday but Surf Life Saving NSW said no decision on reopening the beaches would be made until Monday. Shark attacks have also closed other NSW beaches in recent days. Lifeguards were also stopping people from going in the water at Port Kembla and Windang beaches near Wollongong on Sunday. The Surf Life Saving NSW spokeswoman said this was due to a dead seal and injured shark that had both been attacked by what was believed to be a much larger shark. Scenic: Mollymook Beach is located near Ulladulla, three hours south of Sydney . This is the scene at Mollymook Beach in Ulladulla this morning, prior to the suspected shark attack . Surf Life Saving NSW have closed Narrawellee Beach, to the north of the headline, as the search for the shark commences . A surf competition - the Stramit NSW Country Life Saving Championships - was today being held at the beach. Surf LIfe Saving NSW tweeted that lifeguards have closed Narrawellee Beach to the north of the headland. A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia police were aware of the situation.","A 17-year-old boy suffering lacerations to his left hand and fingers .

"The European Commission president has compared Britain’s membership of the EU to a doomed love affair – and suggested it might be time to call it a day. Jean-Claude Juncker publicly floated the idea of a British exit for the first time, and warned David Cameron that he will not be ‘grovelling’ for the UK to stay during future negotiations. In Paris this weekend, Mr Juncker said: ‘People shouldn’t stay together if conditions aren’t the same as when things started. It’s easy to fall in love and more difficult to stay together.’ Scroll down for video . European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) publicly floated the idea of a British exit from the EU for the first time . The arch federalist, who is an advocate of ‘ever closer union’ within Europe, said that he would reject any attempt to change the EU treaties in order for Britain to restrict free movement of people within the 28 member states. His comments will come as a blow to the Prime Minister, who has promised to renegotiate Britain’s membership ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017 if his party wins the election. It is likely it will be possible to reach an agreement in some areas, such as lengthening the time migrants have to live and work in this country before claiming benefits. But Mr Juncker dashed calls from Conservatives who wish to put a stop to large-scale migration from eastern Europe, saying it was a ‘red line’ issue. Significant boost: Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) said  that Mr Juncker had made it ‘crystal clear there will be no change to the EU doctrine of free movement and mass immigration’ ‘When one mentioned the end of the free circulation of workers, there can be no debate, dialogue or compromise,’ he said. ‘We can fight against abuses, but the EU won’t change the treaties to satisfy the whim of certain politicians.’ His remarks are a significant boost to Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who last night told The Daily Telegraph that Mr Juncker had made it ‘crystal clear there will be no change to the EU doctrine of free movement and mass immigration’. Mr Cameron is due to meet with other European leaders next month to discuss the growing crisis involving the euro. He is expected to use that encounter to lay out some of the areas he wishes to renegotiate to suit Britain better. Mr Juncker, whose recent appointment as the president of the Commission Mr Cameron had tried to block, has previously warned that he is ‘not frightened’ of national leaders.

'Last week it was reported to me that some cremated remains were missing, that were in our care,' Mr Macleod said. 'We immediately carried out a detailed investigation and found that they had gone out with waste. 'We've identified where they are and we've been searching for them since last Thursday.' Human error was to blame, Mr MacLeod said, and a full independent investigation would be carried out. A Victoria Police spokeswoman has confirmed police and SES crews were searching a section of the Hanson Landfill, at Wollert, on behalf of a private company. 'They are paying all the costs relating to the search,' she said.","Melbourne funeral home threw away cremated remains of a stillborn baby .

"At least four people have died and dozens more injured after freezing rain hit the Northeast on Sunday morning. A pair of multi-car pileups - including one involving dozens of vehicles - in icy conditions on interstates in the Philadelphia area claimed at least three lives as authorities reported hundreds of crashes were reported across eastern Pennsylvania. A crash involving an estimated 30 to 50 vehicles on Interstate 76 early on Sunday killed one person, state police said. The crash blamed on 'flash-freezing' prompted closure of the highway in both directions, although one lane was reopened in the afternoon. Chaos: Ice caused more than 20 vehicles to come together on Interstate 76 west of Philadelphia, killing two people and injuring dozens . Two other people were killed in a crash involving multiple vehicles on Interstate 476, police said. Both interstates are busy arteries serving communities west of the city. Officials said Interstate 95, a north-south highway through the area, was also closed early Sunday but had since reopened. In Connecticut, police cited slippery conditions in a crash that killed an 88-year-old woman who struck a utility pole in New Haven. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesman Eugene Blaum called travel conditions 'very hazardous' due to light rain falling onto cold surfaces, creating a sheet of ice. 'This is the worst type of winter precipitation to combat, because it can freeze instantly and it doesn't need to be the whole pavement for vehicles crossing it to have problems,' Blaum said. PennDOT had nearly 150 trucks out treating roadways before daybreak, when it became clear that conditions would be slippery, Blaum said. Response: Paramedics and firefighters are pictured at the scene of the mass collision which forced the road to close for hours, causing chaos for fellow motorists . Emergency dispatchers reported more than 80 calls for ice-related crashes in Northampton County, 100 in Lehigh County, 100 in Bucks County - some involving emergency vehicles -and more than 75 in Montgomery County. Kaitlyn Maier, of Philadelphia, said she came upon the I-76 accident moments after it happened as she was driving with her boyfriend to her niece's baptism, which she missed. 'Ten minutes before I was asking him, what is this? Rain, or what?' said Maier, who said she was 10 to 15 cars behind the wreck and saw smoke pouring from one vehicle. The line of crashed cars extended around a bend in front of her. Maier said emergency responders directed her and other drivers to turn around on the highway and drive eastbound on the westbound side to the next exit. Within the next several minutes, Maier saw two cars collide and two other accidents that had just happened. They decided to stop at a diner to wait until the roads cleared. 26 vehicles, including lorries, collided on Interstate 84 near Baker City, Oregon . 'I've driven through snow a lot, and this isn't like anything I've ever driven in,' said Maier, who was raised in upstate New York. 'We were stopped for a while on the side of the road. I was going less than 10 mph, but I had no control of my vehicle.' The Delaware River Port Authority closed bridges linking Philadelphia and New Jersey during the morning while workers put down salt, but began reopening lanes by midmorning. The Pennsylvania Turnpike closed between Morgantown and the Delaware River Bridge but reopened at noon with speed limits reduced to 45 mph. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority canceled early bus service in Philadelphia but resumed service late in the morning. Philadelphia International Airport reported some cancellations due to conditions. Freezing rain and snow was expected in interior parts of New England, but the temperature was expected to rise into the 40s and 50s along the coast and change the precipitation to plain rain in time for the evening AFC Championship Game between the Patriots and Indianapolis Colts. Scene: The huge crash in Oregon occurred shortly before 5 a.m. east of Baker City, about 130 miles northwest of Boise, Idaho. Debris was seen scattered over the road in the aftermath . On the West Coast, high winds left tens of thousands of customers without power in the Seattle area, but power companies promised Seahawks fans they'd do their best to restore power before the NFC title game against the Green Bay Packers. In eastern Oregon, highway officials partially reopened Interstate 84 Sunday after a massive crash blamed on black ice Saturday closed more than 160 miles of eastbound lanes. Rain was expected in western Oregon Sunday and Monday, but not as much as fell on Saturday, when 1.8 inches of rain in Portland sent some untreated sewage into the Willamette River. The crash in Oregon occurred shortly before 5 a.m. east of Baker City, about 130 miles northwest of Boise, Idaho. Hove arrived on the scene to find 'a sheet of ice' on the roadway. Troopers are still investigating, but Hove said he believes it was a chain-reaction crash. 'A couple of the trucks came upon the black ice, and they jackknifed and crashed into each other. And it just continued to escalate,' Hove told The Associated Press by phone. Miracle: Kaleb Whitby, 27, posed for this photo in the twisted metal ruins of his Chevy Silverado after a horror pileup on Saturday near Baker City, Oregon . Authorities updated their report hours after the crash, increasing the number of vehicles directly involved from 20 to 26, and saying that the pileup left 50 to 70 vehicles stranded at the scene. There were several separate collisions over a stretch of about three-quarters of a mile in the eastbound lanes, Hove said. He said many of the damaged vehicles were tractor-trailers, and several spilled their loads. Two trucks were transporting hazardous materials. Their cargo did not spill, but crews had to clean up diesel from the trucks' fuel tanks. 'We understand it's frustrating when the freeway is closed like this,' said Tom Srandberg, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation. 'Our primary concern is safety, and (we) want to make sure everything is cleared by our hazmat folks before we let any traffic through the areas.' Interstate 84 links Salt Lake City with Portland, Oregon, and is the primary east-west highway through eastern Oregon. The eastbound lanes were closed for several hours but officials said at least one lane was reopening Saturday night. Westbound lanes were closed temporarily near the crash site. Dozens of spinouts and accidents were reported from northern New Jersey to southern New Hampshire on Sunday and treacherous conditions forced the closure of the New York State Thruway from Newburgh to New York City during the morning. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority warned travelers on New York City's Metro-North commuter railroad to beware of ice on staircases, platforms and parking lots.","Crash west of Philadelphia involved more than 20 cars, authorities say .

"Drive-through bottle shops in the Northern Territory have introduced a bizarre policy to refuse cask wine sales if a customer doesn't have a car in a bid to try and control binge drinking. Beer Wine and Spirits (BWS) is trialling the new policy in three stores in Parap, Palmerston and Darwin Airport, the ABC reports.

"Fears that the general election will result in political paralysis is the biggest threat to business this year, a survey of City bosses has found. The Financial Times survey of some of the biggest names in the City of London even uncovered fears an unclear outcome to the election could even endanger the recovery. Many election pundits have long predicted that the election will result in another hung parliament, with neither the Tories nor Labour with enough MPs to command a majority in the House of Commons. Bosses in the City of London say an unclear election outcome is the biggest threat to business in the UK . Instead, the party with the largest number of seats is likely to be forced to cobble together a coalition deal with at least one other party. Some pundits have predicted that if the outcome is particularly tight, a ‘rainbow coalition’ could be required involving at least three parties. The FT reported that Sir Win Bischoff, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, warned of a ‘year of great anxiety and worry. Dame Alison Carnwath warned about ‘an inconclusive election, the ghastly possibility of a second general election and a possible EU referendum.’ The concerns emerged in an online debate about the risks facing firms in 2015. Risk: City of London powerhouses have branded the election an 'Ed Miliband risk more than a Labour risk' Several bosses pointed to concerns about Labour’s business and taxation policies, while others said hostility to immigration among Tories could affect them. Guy Hands, the chief executive of private equity firm Terra Firma said: ‘I think the biggest risk for the City this year is the political uncertainty that would be created by an inconclusive general election.’ ‘Labour will do too badly to form a government. We could very easily have a second election in October. If Labour do get into power I would be very concerned about punitive attacks on the City. He warned: ‘We could see the sort of tax rises that would have other international financial centres rubbing their hands in glee.’ Manny Roman, chief executive of investment management firm Man Group said: I think it is very straightforward: The UK election is a real risk. The Labour party is seen as very anti-business and investors will fear a repeat of Hollande. He added: ‘This is an Ed Miliband risk more than a Labour risk. Obviously any weak government is also a problem.’","Unclear election is the biggest threat to business, City bosses say .

"It was at the center of a controversial Rolling Stone article about a brutal gang rape. But that didn't stop a wave of spring rush hopefuls from attending the newly-reinstated University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi's open-house event on Thursday, according to reports. During the event, the group's centrally-located house was apparently 'crowded and lively', with hordes of undergraduates hoping to impress the fraternity's members and leaders. One UVA freshman, who attended the open house but wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I can definitely affirm it was crowded and lively. It was the last house I hit and I still had to wait in line.' Controversy: A wave of spring rush hopefuls attended the newly-reinstated University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi's open-house event on Thursday, according to reports. Above, protesters are pictured outside the fraternity after it appeared at the center of a controversial Rolling Stone article about a brutal gang rape . Meanwhile, a female freshman said that as she walked through campus during the spring sorority rush on Thursday, it appeared that Phi Psi's house 'was the busiest frat I saw that night'. In an email to New York magazine on Friday, fraternity president, Stephen Scipione, confirmed: 'We had a good crowd last night'. But he added: 'It’s far too early to judge rush this year.' On Monday, police announced that they had been unable to confirm that an alleged gang rape occurred at Phi Psi's house, as described in the controversial Rolling Stone article. The story detailed the graphic claims of an unnamed UVA junior who said she was gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the fraternity in 2012. Brothers: On Friday, Phi Psi president, Stephen Scipione (left), confirmed: 'We had a good crowd last night'. Right, fraternity member, David Fontenot, 22, said the group 'knew the Rolling Stone story was not true' But in an email to the Associated Press, Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said: 'The statement reads that we did not find any substantive basis to confirm the allegations occurred at Phi Kappa Psi, not that we said the assault did not occur. We are still investigating.' Following Monday's verdict, the school declared it had reinstated the group and its activities after consulting with the police force about the findings of their investigation. Speaking about Thursday's open-house event, Matt, a freshman who did not rush Phi Psi, said he thought it would have been unfair if the house had been 'deserted' due to the allegations. Anonymous: Since the article's publication, the UVA junior (pictured) who accused the fraternity of gang rape has seen her allegations widely discredited . 'I personally didn’t avoid it because of that. There could have been people that would have because of that, but if they could vocalize that, it’d be an unpopular opinion,' he said. He added that his friend, who had rushed the fraternity, had told him the place was 'packed'. After the Rolling Stone article was published in November, the magazine issued a statement noting discrepancies in the story and apologizing to those involved in the fraternity. Despite its apology, campus and fraternity leaders were put under pressure to adopt reforms as protesters gathered outside Phi Psi's house, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life. The building was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!'. Fearing for their safety, most fraternity members fled the house, booking hotel rooms. Meanwhile, police launched an investigation into the alleged assault at the request of the university. 'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said 22-year-old fraternity member David Fontenot, a senior from McLean, Virginia, recalling the aftermath of the article's publication. On Monday, Cpt Pleasants said that although university officials were not presented a written report on the police investigation into Phi Psi, they were updated via a telephone call. 'We just didn't find any reasons to keep sanctions on that particular fraternity right now,' he told the AP in a telephone interview. While the school temporarily suspended fraternities' and sororities' social activities, administrators vowed to take an extensive look at improving safety on campus. Central location: On Monday, Charlottesville Police announced that they had been unable to confirm that an alleged gang rape occurred at Phi Psi's house (pictured). However, an investigation is said to be ongoing . Phi Psi was the first fraternity to agree to new rules, some of which address alcohol distribution at parties. Officials want to make it less likely for drugs to be slipped into drinks. 'We believe that in the midst of this ordeal, there is an opportunity to move forward with important safety improvements,' Mr Scipione, a 21-year-old junior from Richmond, said last week. 'This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in this problem. It's opened all of our eyes to the problem of sexual assault. 'Now it's time to do something about it. As a fraternity, we are going to continue discussing that need in the coming weeks.' Other fraternities had a Friday deadline to sign new agreements with the university that were developed by the school's Inter-Fraternity Council in a bid to keep students at parties safer. Among them: Kegs of beer and pre-made mixes of liquor and punch will be banned; beer must be served in closed cans, and food and water must be made available. The female freshman who walked past Phi Psi's fraternity house on Thursday night said the absence of strong pre-mixed drinks will likely make parties less popular for young female students. Because of this, 'I think there’s going to be more pregaming,' she told New York magazine.","Wave of hopefuls reportedly attended Phi Kappa Psi's open-house event .

The child was discovered in a freezer in the garage hidden 'under some items of frozen foods,' the San Diego County sheriff's department said in a statement. Elaina Rose Welch, 32, was booked on two counts of murder in connection with the deaths.

The man, 32-year-old Julio Monggiotti, was found shot in the chest and wrist. The child's name was not released pending an autopsy planned for next week, the sheriff's department said. Sheriff's deputies received a call Friday from a woman at the Barona Indian Reservation who said her child was dead. Moments later, tribal police received a call from the same address about an attempted suicide. An officer with the Barona Tribal Enforcement arrived at the home and talked to a man. Gunshots were heard when the man went inside. Barona authorities contacted sheriff's deputies for help. When deputies and the SWAT team arrived, the woman came out of the house carrying a shotgun and walked along a road, where she dropped the weapon. A family member told U-T San Diego that Welch and her boyfriend had a rocky relationship and that tribal officers have been called several times to break up domestic disputes . The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Deputies searched the property and initially did not find the child, who was hidden in the garage freezer. Wallace said Welch keeps several guns at her house. 'It’s just so unreal; no one knows what happened,' she added in an interview with U-T San Diego.

"A Texas hunting club has canceled plans to auction off a chance to kill an African elephant, the club's executive director said Saturday. Ben Carter of the Dallas Safari Club told The Associated Press, that the donor of the hunt withdrew his donation. The African elephant is the Earth's largest land animal. The World Wildlife Fund, the world's leading conservation group, regards it as 'vulnerable,' a step below 'endangered' and defined as 'facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.'

The Dallas Safari Club faced international criticism last year for auctioning a permit to shoot an endangered black rhino. That hunt has been postponed until the winner receives permission to import the carcass from Namibia. This year's auction prizes still include a 14-day trophy hunt in Mozambique for an adult male leopard. Animal welfare activists demonstrated across the street from the Dallas hotel where the club's convention was taking place. Angela Antonisse-Oxley of the Dallas-based Black Rhino Project, said trophy hunts aggravate the serious problem of big game poaching in Africa. Animal welfare activists demonstrated across the street from the Dallas hotel where the club's convention was taking place . 'A bullet is not going to save them,' she said. In an earlier statement, Carter said that ""elephants, lions and leopards are not listed as endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and, in fact, are overpopulated in certain areas of Africa."" 'These species are commonly hunted where legal, sustainable and where populations need to be managed,' the statement said. This is not the first time the club has drawn controversy. In 2014, Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 at a January auction held by the Dallas Safari Club for a permit to hunt a black rhinoceros in Namibia -- a species listed as critically endangered, according to CBS News. Knowlton applied for a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last Spring that would allow him to import the body of the endangered animal from Namibia after his hunt. The agency has yet to give him an answer. The Club billed the auction as a fundraising effort to to save the endangered species but the agency is applying extra scrutiny to Knowlton's request because of the rise in poaching CBS reports, and the agency is evaluating whether the hunt will result in enhancement of the species's survival. 'I'm a hunter,' Knowlton said. 'I want to experience a black rhino. I want to be intimately involved with a black rhino.'","Ben Carter of the Dallas Safari Club told The Associated Press, that the donor of the hunt withdrew his donation .

"Move over Rita Ora, put down your microphone Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, because there's a new Briish pop star making big waves in the music industry... and she's only eleven years old. Sophia Grace Brownlee from Essex first found fame in 2011 after posting a video of herself and her cousin Rosie McClelland performing Nicki Minaj's Superbass on Youtube. The clip was spotted by Ellen DeGeneres, who invited them onto her TV show to perform and they proved so popular with audiences that the comedian dedicated a section of her programme to the girls. Sophia Grace, 11, has since gone solo and is now releasing her second single, titled 'Best Friends', which has already been viewed by more than six million people on Youtube. Scroll down for video . Sophia Grace Brownlee, 11, from Essex (right) first found fame aged seven when a video of her performing Nicki Minaj's Superbass with her cousin Rosie McCelland (left) was spotted by Ellen Degeneres . The music career follows a hugely successful few years for the youngsters, also have their own book line and a set of dolls. Sophia told BBC Newsbeat of her rise to fame: 'I used to sing from when I was really young and all my family used to say, 'oh you're really good you should put yourself on Youtube.' Describing her new track, she said: 'It's about girls getting together and having a sleep over and just having nice friends who are loyal.' Sophia and her cousin Rosie were plucked from obscurity when Ellen  saw a video of the pair and invited them over to the States. Sophia Grace was first spotted by Ellen who flew her and her cousin Rosie over to the United States where they performed on her chat show . Not only did they end up performing on her show on several occasions, but Ellen also employed the girls to do red carpet interviews for her. A film deal followed, with the pair shooting Sophia Grace and Rosie's Royal Adventure in Cape Town, South Africa. Sophia Grace in particular has been praised for her singing talents and in 2013 released a single called Girls Just Gotta Have Fun. To date, the video has been viewed more than 62 million times - that's five million more times than Cheryl's Fight For This Love, which was released four years earlier. He new single Best Friends has already made it into the Billboards Charts at No.87 and is expected to rise much higher as the week goes on. There are already discussions taking place her to record an album within the next 12 months.

'There's been a lot of interest from music industry big wigs and everyone is saying that she is moving in the right direction for a big career.' Indeed, when the Best Friends video went out Katy Perry not only tweeted about it, she even said she wanted to be on the remix. In 2012, the girls got to meet Justin Bieber and his on / off girlfriend took a picture of them with the star . If her latest successes are anything to go by she could be set to be one of Britain's biggest exports and part of the new generation of stars that make their name from YouTube, much like vloggers Zoella and Alfie Deyes.

"Britain politics faces being plunged into chaos after the election, as a detailed study of seats across the country shows at least three parties would be needed to form a coalition. Political commentator Iain Dale predicts Labour will win 300 seats and the Tories 279, but both would need at least two other parties to secure a majority of the 650 MPs in the Commons. Today Nick Clegg ruled out ever sitting in a Cabinet with Ukip while Green party leader Natalie Bennett said her party would not join a power-sharing deal with anyone. Scroll down for video . A study of every constituency in the country by political commentator Iain Dale reveals no two parties will be able to get over 325 seats to secure an overall majority . Mr Dale argues that national opinion polls offer no help in predicting what will happen at the election, because they cannot reflect what will happen in seats where four, five or even six parties are standing. Instead he has spent recent weeks looking at every seat in the country, and using polling, local knowledge and 'sniffing the political wind' to predict what will happen in each constituency. Writing in the Independent on Sunday, Mr Dale said: 'The truth is that this is the most unpredictable election in recent memory and for one very simple reason – for the first time in British political history, we're now in five party politics. 'For the first time ever it's conceivable that the joint vote share of the two main parties might be under 60 per cent.' He predicts that the Tories will 'pile up votes in seats where they don't need them', suggesting Labour could get more seats but fewer votes. The study confidently predicts that the Lib Dems 'will lose more than half of their seats', taking them to just 24. 'It could get even worse, although I reckon Nick Clegg will be safe in Sheffield Hallam,' he adds. It means that even with the support of the Lib Dems, neither Labour nor the Tories would be able to form an overall majority. A so-called 'Rainbow Coalition' would then need to be agreed involving three or more parties, which all leaders acknowledge will be incredibly unstable. Mr Clegg today flatly ruled out at the idea of serving in a government with Nigel Farage which also included Ukip MPs. Asked if he could imagine a power-sharing deal with Ukip, he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'No. I just really cannot see how Nigel Farage and I could ever…' It has been suggested that Labour could be forced to rely on SNP support to form a government. But Mr Clegg also cast doubt on the Lib Dems entering power with the Scottish nationalists. 'I find it very difficult to imagine the circumstances in which I would do that,' he added. Mr Clegg also ridiculed Mr Dale's prediction that the Lib Dems would lose half of their seats. 'Iain Dale will have to eat his words, because I really don't think that's going to happen. He's a good man but some of his predictions are getting a bit silly,' he said. The Green party last week overtook both the Lib Dems and Ukip in terms of party membership, and have demanded a place in TV leaders' debates. Ms Bennett insisted the Greens would have a big impact at the election, despite the forecast that the party would not gain any more MPs. But she insisted that the Greens did not intend to be part of a formal coalition with any other parties . She told BBC One: 'We have very clearly said we're not looking towards a coalition, we're looking towards confidence and supply. 'So what that would mean, we would be able to vote vote-by-vote so we could vote against Trident and we would vote against Trident.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today ruled out entering coalition with Ukip while the Green party's Natalie Bennett ruled out a power-sharing deal with anyone . A new poll suggests Labour is on course to lose half its 40 Scottish seats at Westminster in May. The SNP could increase its seats from six to 35, according to an analysis of poll figures by The Sunday Times. The Panelbase poll of 1,007 Scottish adults asked which way they would be likely to vote if there was a UK parliamentary election tomorrow. The results, excluding don't knows, put the SNP on 41 per cent and Labour on 31 per cent, with the Conservatives on 14 per cent, Ukip on 7 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 3 per cent. However, Mr Dale casts doubts on the idea of an SNP landslide of up to 40 seats, claiming they will get just 18 at best. While Ukip and the Greens will take votes from the Tories and Labour, costing them marginal seats in many areas, they will not make huge gains, he says. Mr Dale predicts Ukip winning only five seats and the Greens remaining on just one, the same number they got in 2010.","Political commentator Iain Dale publishing prediction for every seat .

"The Queen paid a sartorial nod to the icy weather that was creeping across Britain with her Sunday worship outfit this morning. Her Majesty conjured up images of the Snow Queen in the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale in her chic cream ensemble, complete with large fur hat and matching cuffs as she arrived at St. Mary Magdalene church for the 11am service. To ward off the chill, the royal also added a blue blanket to her layers during the short drive in her chauffeur-driven Bentley across the Sandringham Estate. Scroll down for video . Her Majesty conjured up images of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale The Snow Queen in her chic cream ensemble, complete with large fur hat and matching cuffs as she arrived at St. Mary Magdalene church for the Sunday Service this morning . The Queen was forced to cancel a visit to Mary the Virgin church in Hillington, Norfolk, because of falling plaster from the ceiling. So instead, she attended St. Mary Magdalene on the Sandringham estate . A last minute change of plans had forced the Queen to change her Sunday worship routine due to a health and safety hazard at the church she was scheduled to attend today, but she still saw the day through in perfect regal style. The royal was supposed to visit St Mary the Virgin church at Hillington, slightly further away on the Sandringham estate, but the service was cancelled after a lump of plaster fell off the ceiling on New Year's Eve. Church officials decided it was too dangerous to admit members of the public because of the risk of more plaster falling and injuring someone. So, instead of journeying three miles to Hillington, the Queen, 88, was chauffeured in a Bentley to St. Mary Magdalene church instead, which is around 400 yards from Sandringham House, for the Sunday morning service. The Duke of Edinburgh braved the cold and walked to the church for the service. He appeared to say something to the police officer who saluted him as he walked past on the way to St Mary Magdalene this morning . The pair seem to have cracked a joke, as they pass each other in high spirits . Her husband Prince Philip, 93, decided to brave the elements by walking to join her at church in the winter sunshine, wearing his trademark long brown coat. Hillington church warden Edward Dawnay, 64, admitted that locals had been disappointed not to be hosting the Queen at their church this weekend. He said: 'We had a bit of plaster fall on the pulpit on New Year's Eve. It was not really a big deal - it was really just a dustpan and brush job to clear up. 'But it was decided that we could not hold our service on the first Sunday of the month or the one this Sunday, in case something else happened. 'The plaster certainly did not fall in the area where the Queen normally sits, but it was agreed that we should not take any risks. 'It is a shame for Hillington because people were looking forward to the Queen visiting. We hope she will be able to come next year instead.' The Queen and Prince Philip worship most Sundays at St Mary Magdalene church during their festive break as well as on Christmas Day when they are joined by other members of the Royal family.But on the third Sunday in January, the 11am service which they attend is traditionally moved to one of four other churches in the area . Mr Dawnay said that scaffolding was due to be erected inside the church this week to allow a repair to be made. Surveyors will also carry out an inspection to make sure that no other parts of the ceiling are in danger of collapse before officials agree to re-open the church. He said it was possible that the plaster collapse had happened because of a tile on the roof becoming dislodged more than two years ago, which may have then let in water. He said: 'The tile was repaired at the time, but a small amount of water may have entered. 'The bit of plaster that fell away was directly below the tile so it may be linked. 'It was only the plaster that fell, not the wood part of the ceiling.' The Queen complemented her wintry look with ruby red lipstick and a pair of elegant pearl earrings .

But on the third Sunday in January, the 11am service which they attend is traditionally moved to one of four other churches in the area. The honour is usually given to a different church every year and on Sunday it was due to be Hillington. A notice explaining the cancellation of the service and expressing 'great disappointment' was posted on the church door.","Queen forced to cancel a visit to Mary the Virgin church in Hillington .

"Upgrades to the House of Commons gym which features a new sauna and spinning studio named after the Speaker have cost taxpayers £1million – more than four times the proposed cost. The Westminster Gym, exclusively used by parliamentary passholders, now boasts a towel room, a new area for exercise bikes and a renovated reception. Taxpayers will foot the bill for improvements at the fitness centre, which counts Jack Straw, Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis among its users. Commons' Speaker, John Bercow, will officially re-open the gym next week and inspect the new spinning studio which has been named after him. Upgrades to the House of Commons gym which features a new sauna  have cost taxpayers £1million . A new spinning studio has been named after House of Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured) The upgrades, which also include improving disabled access and treating damp, were originally meant to cost £250,000. But that figure is expected to rise to £1,081,379, according to figures obtained by the Sunday Times through a freedom of information request. Andy Silvester, campaign director of the Taxpayers' Alliance pressure group, said: 'Every day we hear hot air from politicians about balancing the books, so to see that a sauna and a spinning studio have survived the austerity programme is absolutely remarkable, especially when the rest of the estate is in such bad shape,' Silvester said. 'With the amount of gyms in Westminster, it's baffling that taxpayers are still paying for a gym that they're barred from using.' Taxpayers will foot the bill for improvements which includes a new area for exercise bikes (not pictured) and a renovated reception . At least 700 MPs, peers and other parliamentary pass holders belong to the health club which gets its income and profit from membership fees . He pointed out that voters have already paid £2billion for essential repairs to the Palace of Westminster. At least 700 MPs, peers and other parliamentary pass holders belong to the health club which gets its income and profit from membership fees – the most expensive of which costs £47 a month. The House of Commons has a share of the profits and in the year from 2012 to 2013 it received £21,337. The refurbishment comes just three years after the ventilation system in the basement area of the Commons was refurbished at a cost of £247,500. There was no mention of replacing the sauna in the men's changing room with a new model when reports of the plans first surfaced. A spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'In taking advantage of the opportunity we anticipate cost savings in the longer term, as the area will not be disturbed when the systems in the remaining parts of the building are renewed. MPs spent £518,635 on hotels, airline upgrades and bar bills last year including a £3,174 stay at the five-star Windsor Atlantica in Rio de Janeiro (pictured) 'It is the only facility of its kind on the estate, extensively used by a variety of groups, including members and staff, and it was not possible to replicate the facility elsewhere. 'This meant that work had to be phased and carried out during evenings and weekends.' It has also been revealed that MPs and their staff ran up bills of £227,000 at hotels around the world that were paid for with the procurement cards. Five-star hotels, airline upgrades, bar bills and treatment for bad backs helped to push up the annual total by £80,000 to £518,635 last year. The Commons international development select committee spent £3,174 staying at the five-star Windsor Atlantica in Rio de Janeiro. More than £2,143 was also spent by the same group at the Gefinor Rotana in Beirut and the justice select committee had a bill of £1,653.40 bill at the Old Government House in Guernsey. A Commons spokesman said: 'The procurement cards were used for business purposes, allowing a limited number of employees to pay for relatively low-value items in a secure and efficient way.' 'The cards have strict controls for the authorisation of all transactions.'","Upgrades to the House of Commons gym have cost taxpayers £1million .

"President Barack Obama is seeking an increase in taxes on the wealthiest Americans by raising the capital gains rate and eliminating a tax break on inheritances, then using the revenue to fund new tax credits and other cost-saving measures for the middle class. The president's proposals are to be announced during Tuesday's State of the Union address. They are likely to be cheered by liberal Democrats and considered non-starters with the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video . Tax increase: President Obama plans to call for billions in tax increases on top earners  in order to fund new tax credits and other measures the White House claims will help the middle class . The president’s address is intended to lay out an agenda for his final two years in office and help the Democrats retain the White House in the 2016 election with a legacy of policies that appeal to middle- and lower-income voters, who continued to lose ground as the economy rebounded from the recession. The proposal's centerpiece is an increase in the capital gains rate, to 28 percent, on couples making more than $500,000 per year. The tax rate for capital gains now stands at 20% for the highest-earning Americans. Obama will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed -- a so-called ""trust fund"" loophole the White House says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year. The administration’s proposal would exempt the first $200,000 in capital gains per couple plus $500,000 for a home, along with all personal property except for valuable art and collectibles. The rest would be treated for income-tax purposes as if it had been sold. Going up: The centerpiece of the president's tax proposal is an increase in the capital gains and dividends rate on couples making more than $500,000 per year to 28 percent, the same level as under President Ronald Reagan . The total amount of money raised for the government by these actions would be about $210 billion over 10 years, . According to the White House, 99 percent of the tax burden from the capital-gains proposals would be paid by the top 1 percent of households, and more than 80 percent would be paid by the top 0.1 percent. People with significant amounts of unrealized gains include founders of successful businesses and others who inherited businesses decades ago. The moves -- likely to meet resistance from Republicans in Congress -- are meant to pay for the long slate of new programs the President began laying out two weeks ago designed to bolster the middle class, including offering two free years of community college to qualified students. Obama's aides have been seeking ways to expand a robust economic recovery beyond top earners, who have been buoyed by record closes on Wall Street. Despite reams of positive economic news, most Americans still say economic conditions in the country are only fair. Obama is set to propose Tuesday a $500 tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs; the intention, officials say, is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses -- usually women -- to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working. He'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits, including increasing the top child care credit to $3,000. The total cost for the new provisions: $235 billion, . Obama has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his State of the Union address, including the community college proposal, a plan to expand high-speed Internet and reducing rates of federally backed mortgages. In addition to the tax plan, he said he will push Congress for legislation allowing workers to earn seven days of paid sick leave per year and make community free for millions of students, at a cost of $60 billion over 10 years. The early look is meant to introduce Americans to each scheme individually, said administration aides, who determined the yearly laundry-list of plans -- combined with updates on America's foreign policy -- wasn't digestible during a single prime-time event.","Obama to unveil new tax proposals during Tuesday's State of the Union .

"This is the miraculous moment a driver survived being crushed between two big rigs in a nightmare pileup on an icy freeway. Kaleb Whitby, 27, stares out calmly from the mangled wreckage of his Chevy Silverado after the two semi-trucks smashed into each other on the I-84 in Oregon - with him in the middle. Despite his precarious position wedged between the two metal trailers, and with a steering column tight against his leg, Whitby emerged from the deathtrap almost entirely unscathed. Scroll down for video . Miracle: Kaleb Whitby, 27, posed for this photo in the twisted metal ruins of his Chevy Silverado after a horror pileup on Saturday near Baker City, Oregon . After the escape: The crumpled driver's cab of Whitby's pickup was left behind, above, after he was helped out . Caught in the middle: Whitby was left facing oncoming traffic - including the second truck - and feared dying in the crash . He posed for the photograph, taken by another truck driver invovled in the Saturday morning 50-driver pileup, which left 18-wheelers sprawled across the icy freeway outside Baker City, Oregon. Whitby described the terrifying moments before his unlikely survival to The Oregonian, saying he swerved to avoid a jackknifed truck - only to get crushed by another out of control big rig. He had been driving up an incline behind the vehicle for a while, Whitby said, but backed away because the fog was so thick. The next time he saw it, the big rig was splayed across the lanes of the freeway, leaving him nowhere to go. He tried to swerve round it, but hit the back end and was left sat on the road, side-on to approaching traffic. No wiggle room: The two big rigs, right, ended up practically sandwiched together in the pileup, which did not kill anybody . Smashed up: Whitby was caught between the two trucks pictured above in the icy, foggy and windy crash . Huge: As many as 50 vehicles, mostly trucks, were caught up in the wreckage . Next, he noticed a second big rig barreling towards him, with no way to avoid him. 'I just braced and hoped that everything would be all right', Whitby said. The next thing he knew, the crash was over and he was surrounded by broken glass and mangled metal - but was otherwise unharmed. Whitby, a farmer from Pasco, Washington, managed to cut himself free of his seatbelt, and move the steering column from his leg. He then shouted for help - and was rescued by Sergi Karplyuk, who drove the second truck in the crash. Whitby, now safe, posed for the incredible picture before getting out. After looking himself over, Whitby realized he was hardly injured at all. He told The Oregonian: 'I've got two Band-Aids on my right ring finger. And a little bit of ice on my left eye.' Twelve people were taken to hospital as a result of the pileup, one of whom was in critical condition Sunday. The freeway has since been re-opened. More than 20 cars piled up on I-76 in Philadelphia after freezing rain on Sunday morning . At least four people have died and dozens more injured after freezing rain hit the Northeast on Sunday morning. A pair of multi-car pileups - including one involving dozens of vehicles - in icy conditions on interstates in the Philadelphia area claimed at least three lives as authorities reported hundreds of crashes were reported across eastern Pennsylvania. A crash involving an estimated 30 to 50 vehicles on Interstate 76 early on Sunday killed one person, state police said. The crash blamed on 'flash-freezing' prompted closure of the highway in both directions, although one lane was reopened in the afternoon. Two other people were killed in a crash involving multiple vehicles on Interstate 476, police said. In Connecticut, police cited slippery conditions in a crash that killed an 88-year-old woman who struck a utility pole in New Haven. Splayed: This mail truck and another container vehicle were badly damaged on the Oregon road . Caved cab: Another busted big rig is pictured on the road amidst the devastation caused by the pileup .

"Challenge: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to read a book every two weeks as part of his personal challenge for 2015 . Mark Zuckerberg has made his next book club pick, a release he considers especially timely after the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. The Facebook CEO announced Saturday he would take on Steven Pinker's 'The Better Angels of Our Nature,' a widely discussed and occasionally criticized 2011 book that contends violence has decreased in modern times and the world has become more humane. Zuckerberg posted the news on his Facebook page and on a community page he set up for his club, A Year of Books. 'Recent events might make it seem like violence and terrorism are more common than ever, so it's worth understanding that all violence — even terrorism — is actually decreasing over time. If we understand how we are achieving this, we can continue our path towards peace,' Zuckerberg wrote. 'A few people I trust have told me this is the best book they've ever read.' Among the book's admirers is Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has called it his 'favorite book of the last decade' and 'a long but profound look at the reduction in violence and discrimination over time.' Next: Mark Zuckerberg has made his next book club pick, a release he considers especially timely after the recent terrorist attacks in Paris . Two weeks ago, Zuckerberg declared he would read a new book every other week in 2015, and he invited his millions of Facebook friends to join him and participate in an online discussion. His first choice, Moises Naim's 'The End of Power,' quickly became a best-seller on Amazon.com and elsewhere. But only 162 comments appear for last week's book club chat held on the community page, which has more than 260,000 likes. Within hours of Saturday's announcement, 'Better Angels' jumped from No. 6,521 on Amazon to No. 501. Pinker, 60, is a leading psychologist, linguist and cognitive scientist who teaches at Harvard University and has written several popular books, two of which, 'The Blank Slate' and 'How the Mind Works,' were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. 'The Better Angels' is indeed long, more than 800 pages, so Zuckerberg is already fine-tuning his promise for a book every two weeks. He wrote that he'll need a month to finish 'The Better Angels,' but will recommend a shorter work in two weeks that can be read at the same time. Pinker's book also continues Zuckerberg's apparent preference for nonfiction works, written by men. His Facebook page lists 13 books recently read — 10 nonfiction and all by male authors. My challenge for 2015 is to read a new book every other week -- with an emphasis on learning about different cultures, beliefs, histories and technologies. Thank you to all 50,000 of you in our community who gave me suggestions for different challenges. Many of you proposed reading challenges. Cynthia Greco suggested I read one book a month that another person chooses -- and got 1,900 likes on her suggestion. Rachel Brown, Bill Munns, Marlo Kanipe and others suggested I read the Bible. My friend and colleague Amin Zoufonoun suggested I read and learn everything I can about a new country each week. I'm excited for my reading challenge. I've found reading books very intellectually fulfilling. Books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today. I'm looking forward to shifting more of my media diet towards reading books. If you want to follow along on my challenge and read the same books I do, I've created a page, A Year of Books, where I'll post what I'm reading. Please only participate in the discussions if you've actually read the books and have relevant points to add. The group will be moderated to keep it focused. Our first book of the year will be The End of Power by Moisés Naím. It's a book that explores how the world is shifting to give individual people more power that was traditionally only held by large governments, militaries and other organizations. The trend towards giving people more power is one I believe in deeply, and I'm looking forward to reading this book and exploring this in more detail. I appreciated all of your other suggestions for possible challenges as well. Many of you suggested I give money to help people in need -- and Priscilla and I fully intend to keep doing that through our philanthropic work. We'll have more to discuss there soon. Some of you suggested that I meet a new person every day. That was actually my challenge in 2013. Others suggested I teach a class. I've done that too, and I'd love to do it again and get more involved in education in the coming year. Thanks again for all of your suggestions, and I'm looking forward to a year of books!","Pinker's 'The Better Angels' claims we are currently living in the most peaceful moment in our species' existence .

"The Towie fan who fled ISIS terrorists with her toddler son could be sent back to Syria by Turkish authorities. Tareena Shakil, 25, ran away to Syria last year after telling relatives she was going on holiday to Spain with her 16-month-old son Zaheem. But she escaped back across the Turkish border after, she claims, the militants tried to force her into marrying a one-legged fighter. However, instead of being deported to Britain, Shakil, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, might be sent back to Syria and into the clutches of ISIS. Towie fan Tareena Shakil, who fled to ISIS with her toddler son Zaheem but changed her mind and escaped to Turkey, could be sent back to Syria . Shakil fled back across the Turkish border with her son after ISIS tried to force her into marriage, she claims . A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Tareena doesn't have an automatic right to return to the UK. The Turkish authorities could decide to send her back to Syria. 'She entered Syria illegally and the normal action is to return illegal immigrants to the country they've come from. It's unlikely she would be sent to Syria but not impossible. A lot will depend on what she says in interview. The fact she has her son with her makes it less likely. 'They are on the front line with ISIS and will have little sympathy towards her.' Shakil is being held at a facility on the border town of Gaziantep and her father has flown out to join her, as has her estranged husband Sam. Mohammed, her 42-year-old father, has previously told how his daughter was a one-time Spice Girls fan, a school prefect and Girl Guide and was so fascinated with ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars. Her brother Tareem, 22, said: 'At first no one suspected anything, then she said she was at the border of Syria. She sent us messages saying she'd gone over for a new life, that she had been radicalised. After fleeing her British home in November last year, Shakil entered Syria through the Turkish border. She has since returned to the country after 'begging guards not to shoot her' The residential street where Shakil lived in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, before she fled to join ISIS . 'She said she wanted to live in the way of Allah. She was promised a good life with a good husband. She wanted to live under Sharia law. 'But it wasn't like that. Then she was texting saying she might not make it back. She was messaging, ""Please help me, I made a stupid mistake. Please Dad, will you come here and get me?"" He was planning to go out there, but she made the escape herself.' Her escape saw her dash through a no-man's land near the Turkish-Syrian border, where snipers on the Turkish side did not fire on her. She then scrambled over a barbed wire fence, injuring her feet but somehow keeping young Zaheem unharmed. The Foreign Office source added that Shakil would be questioned over possible terror offences and sent on a course to 'de-radicalise' her if she is sent back to Britain.","Towie fan Tareena Shakil, 25, fled to Syria with her son to join ISIS .

"We've seen Kraft swallow Cadbury and US chemist's Walgreens bid for Boots. Now another British icon has fallen prey to a giant American corporation – after the London Eye was renamed the Coca-Cola London Eye. The tourist attraction, which has become a symbol of the London skyline, now glows red at night rather than blue to mark the landmark's sponsorship deal with the fizzy drinks firm. Scroll down for video . The London Eye shining red following the attraction's new sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola, which has seen the pods having the drink's branding inside . The deal was signed last September and the wheel began turning again over the weekend, following its annual closure for maintenance earlier this month. Visitors were shocked to see that every pod of the Eye is now branded with its own Coca-Cola logo. Staff have been kitted out in red Coca-Cola uniforms – including Coca-Cola beanie hats for security workers – and the ticket office has been plastered with Coca-Cola posters. The move left plenty of people seeing red yesterday, with the Eye's owners accused of selling out, and health campaigners criticising the decision to promote such a sugary drink. One can of Coca-Cola contains nine teaspoons of sugar. The maximum recommended daily intake of sugar is 30 teaspoons for men, 22.5 teaspoons for women and 21 for children. Malcolm Clark, from the Children's Food Campaign, told The Observer: 'It's totally inappropriate for a major family attraction to be sponsored by a sugary drinks company. 'It sends completely the wrong message, not just here in London, but right across the globe. Soft drinks are the largest source of sugar in children and teenagers' diets, associated with weight gain and obesity, diabetes, heart disease and poor dental health.' Volunteers from the Children's Food Campaign were at the London Eye yesterday handing out 500 toothbrushes to families visiting the attraction . The campaigners say that it is inappropriate that Coca-Cola, a sugary drinks firm should be sponsoring the London attraction . Yesterday campaigners handed out 500 toothbrushes at the Eye to symbolise the 500 children who are admitted to hospital because of tooth decay every week. The London Eye was sponsored by British Airways for the eight years after its launch in 2000. The airline was one of the original joint owners until the attraction was bought by Merlin Entertainments in 2005. Yesterday Merlin Entertainments said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets. But Dr John Middleton, vice-president at the Faculty of Public Health, said: 'Coca-Cola is the flagship for sugar marketing and therefore the flagship for rotten teeth and diabetes.They're taking over a high-visibility attraction and a major icon of the London landscape.' He added: 'What next, Buckingham Palace sponsored by Coca-Cola? There needs to be a much bigger public debate about advertising control before commercial corporate interests infiltrate every aspect of the public landscape.'","London Eye has been rebranded after signing partnership with Coca Cola .

"Terrifying footage shows the moment a five-metre shark hit a small fishing boat south of Newcastle. The video was filmed  south of Newcastle at Swansea about 10.30am on Sunday. This comes as a procession of sharks, including the close encounter at Newcastle, has continued to shut down beaches along the NSW coastline. Manly Beach reopened on Sunday afternoon following a shark sighting, while Newcastle beaches remained closed for a record ninth consecutive day. Two men had a close encounter with a five-metre great white shark while fishing near Newcastle . In footage posted to Facebook on Sunday a shark circles the tinny, swims underneath the fishermen and hits the boat with his fin. In the video the two men, Tim Watson and Allan de Sylva, can be heard getting increasingly worried by the shark as it circles their boat. 'It's bigger than the boat!' one man says. 'That's so scary man, I want a spear gun!' The shark then hits the boat, prompting the two men to make a getaway. 'Can we go? Can we please go?' one says. 'Did he just hit it? Let's f***ing get out of here!' Mr Watson, 24, told Fairfax Media the boat rocked 'a solid two to three foot to the edge'. 'If it had hit much harder the boat would have taken in a bit of water.' The sea off Newcastle was first declared a no-go area when the great white, nicknamed Bruce, was seen at Merewether Beach on January 10. The shark circled the men's tiny tinny, swam underneath the fishermen and hit the boat with his fin. A helicopter crew spent Sunday scouring the ocean for signs of the fearsome predator along with a three-and-a-half metre shark that lunched on a dolphin last week. Surf Life Saving NSW said no decision on reopening the beaches would be made until Monday, while beach inspectors previously said they would only reopen beaches if the sharks were not spotted for at least 24 hours. 'You don't get a second chance with these things, (a) bite can be fatal,' Nobbys Beach inspector Paul Bernard told AAP. At Manly, many swimmers refused to be intimidated and remained in the sea on Sunday, according to Surf Life Saving NSW. A member of the public had raised the alarm after spotting an unspecified type of shark while swimming at 1.30pm. 'We've got the inflatable rescue boats out to chase it away,' a spokeswoman for Surf Life Saving NSW told AAP. 'The problem is there were already a lot of swimmers and surfers in the water who won't come out.' Shark attacks have also closed other NSW beaches in recent days. A procession of sharks, including the close encounter at Newcastle, has continued to shut down NSW beaches . Lifeguards were stopping people from going in the water at Port Kembla and Windang beaches near Wollongong on Sunday. A Surf Life Saving NSW spokeswoman said this was due to a dead seal and injured shark that had both been attacked by what was believed to be a much larger shark. And on Friday a 17-year-old boy was bitten on the hand by a 1.5 metre shark at Narrawallee Beach, about 200km south of Sydney. Sam Smith was flown to hospital with lacerations after he tried to film the shark while spear-fishing. Increased marine activity and warm weather are thought to be possible reasons for the sharks' prolonged presence. CSIRO shark expert Barry Bruce, whose name has been used for the great white off Newcastle and for a character in the hit animated film Finding Nemo, said the creatures were common along the NSW coastline. It's only when they stop near a heavily populated area, like Newcastle, that people notice them. The sea off Newcastle was first declared a no-go area when the great white, nicknamed Bruce, was seen at Merewether Beach on January 10 .","Two men had a close encounter with a great white shark  near Newcastle .

"Doctors say 24-year-old Ashley Caughey has only months to live after malignant bone cancer spread unchecked throughout her body. She worries she won't see her daughter Paisley's first birthday, the little girl she refused chemotherapy treatment for in order to give birth to her last year. CNN reports she  had just gotten engaged to her now-husband Jonathan when she faced a gut-wrenching diagnosis - a cancer called osteosarcoma had developed in her leg. Agonizing decision: Ashley Caughey refused chemotherapy to give birth to her baby daughter Paisley, and doctors say she has only months to live . Caughey had suffered aches in her knee since 2012, but it wasn't until the pain sent her to the hospital that the invasive bone cancer was discovered. 'The doctor that I went to repeatedly and repeatedly telling him something wasn't right probably cost me my life,' Ashley says, adding, 'I could have had more time.' She was sent to surgery to remove her knee and femur, and doctors advised her to begin chemotherapy treatment. Caughey refused, as the treatment would have put her 10-week pregnancy at risk. 'I'm not going to kill a healthy baby because I'm sick,' she says. 'There's nothing wrong with her.' She gave birth to a daughter, Paisley, in June, but shortly after the delivery, she received more bad news that the cancer has spread throughout her body and even to the brain. Couple: Ashley and Jonathan Caughey in an undated Facebook photo some time after the couple had gotten engaged and Ashley learned she was pregnant . Treatment: After the birth, Caughey went on radiation treatment, but at that point a scan showed the cancer had spread throughout her body . Wedding: The couple pushed up their wedding date to November, with Caughey's 6-year-old son Braiden walking her down the aisle . 'When they told me that, I think ""Oh my gosh, I am really dying. I'm not going to beat this,""' says Caughey, who  tries to stay hopeful in the face of unrelentingly bad news. After the diagnosis, the couple sped up the wait for their wedding, getting married this past November. Caughey's six-year-old son Braiden walked her down the aisle. She began radiation treatment after the birth, and though doctors say she now has only a few months to live, Caughey is making the short time she has count, and documenting everything on camera. 'I love that my kids are actually going to see me fighting instead of it being like, you know, ""Your mom was this. Your mom was that. Your mom fought as hard as she could,""' Caughey says. 'They're actually going to see my love for them,' she added. 'Paisley is going to know how much I love her.'","Ashley Caughey was 23 when she was told she had bone cancer .

"It has developed something of a cult following among the celebrities who swear by its benefits. Now the British public can decide for themselves whether Lait-Crème Concentré really is the ‘miracle’ moisturiser it is claimed to be. And at £20 for 75ml, they might feel they have every right to hope it is. Boots is now selling Lait-Crème Concentré by French brand Embryolisse, loved by stars including Gwyneth Paltrow, pictured . Previously only available from French pharmacies, specialist stores or websites abroad, Boots is now selling Lait-Crème Concentré by French brand Embryolisse. It is first time the moisturiser – praised by make-up artists and beloved of stars including Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson and Yasmin Le Bon – has been on sale on the UK high street. Simon Cowell is also said to be a fan of the product. One tube of the cream sells every 60 seconds worldwide and large numbers of women – and men – have already snapped up the 75ml bottles at Boots since they hit the shelves last week. Make-up artist Julia Carta, who has worked with Keira Knightley, Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey and is Cowell’s personal make-up specialist on the X-Factor, described it as the ‘best kept secret among models and make-up artists’. It's the first time the moisturiser, used by Scarlett Johansson, left, and Yasmin Le Bon, right, has been on sale on the UK high street . She claims that it gives the skin ‘immediate plump and glow’. She added: ‘I’m sure people will go crazy for Embryolisse, they are going to be queuing round the block for it.’ Make-up artists say they like to use Embryolisse because it can not only be used as a moisturiser, but also applied as a make-up remover, primer or repair mask. Its makers claim it is great on children’s skin too. Boots decided to stock Embryolisse – which translates as baby’s bottom and purports to leave skin feeling as soft as an infant’s – following a conference two years ago where they invited 100 of the world’s top make-up artists and skin care specialists to talk about brands they used that were not readily stocked in their stores. It came up consistently as one of the most revered brands that was not readily available on the high street. In trials, 80 per cent of users with sensitive skin suggested the moisturiser, which is made from a ‘unique’ blend of natural ingredients, fatty acids and vitamins, had helped their skin to stay ‘smooth and silky all day’. Joe Mitchell, of Boots, said: ‘It’s already an international bestseller, and we know customers are searching for it on boots.com, so we’re delighted to bring it to the UK high street as part of our exclusive range of beauty finds from around the world.’","Lait-Crème Concentré by French brand Embryolisse has a cult following .

"An 18-year-old man has been killed and at least 30 injured in Bangladesh following petrol bomb attacks linked to the country's disputed elections. The violence in Bangladesh has escalated since January 5 when protests broke out over the elections which was boycotted by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who said it would be rigged. They were angry that Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, refused to stand aside to make way for a neutral caretaker administration to oversee the election.

The driver of the vehicle jumped free and escaped with minor burns. At least 30 people - including five police officers - have been injured in attacks on vehicles in Dhaka, the country's capital, since yesterday night. Prime Minister Hasina said the culprits 'will not be spared' on a visit to a hospital to see the policemen who had sustained burns today.

It comes in the wake of violent clashes between opposition activists and police during the general election, which saw 18 people killed on polling day and scores of polling stations torched. Human rights groups have expressed concern over the violence and urged those involved to refrain from further attacks. The UN human rights office has also called for a 'prompt, impartial and effective' investigation in to the violence.","18-year-old killed following petrol bomb attack linked to disputed elections .

Initially Mrs Shyba intended to crate train the seven-week-old mix breed but after one night of whining, she couldn't bear to let him sleep alone again. Mrs Shyba says that the nap time routine started on the third day they had Theo. Theo was laying on Beau when the toddler was getting rocked for his afternoon nap and Theo passed out as well. Talk about killing two birds with one stone. 'I was practically howling at the cuteness and nearly woke them both up,' Mrs Shyba wrote on her blog. The next day, Theo waited outside the bedroom for nap time and so began what the mom calls 'the most organic and beautiful relationship I have ever witnessed.' 'Each day, Theo meets us at nap time and waits patiently for beau to fall asleep.

"Two compounds at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea have been barricaded by groups of asylum seekers who are not allowing staff to enter. ABC News reported on Sunday that protesters in the Delta and Oscar compounds of the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre placed boxes in front of gates to keep out security staff and government officials. ‘People in Delta compound fear (the) guards,’ one asylum seeker said. Scroll down for video . An asylum seeker on hunger strike at the Manus Island detention centre is carried away on a stretcher . However, security staff have reportedly rounded up who they consider to be the ring leaders and put them in a high-security isolation unit. Refugee advocates say Transfield riot officers raided early on Sunday a compound seizing leaders of the protest in which hundreds of men are on hunger or water strike at the Australian-run asylum-seeker processing centre. While about 30 other asylum seekers have sewn their lips together. ‘The riot squad attempted to force water down the throat of two unconscious asylum seekers in the compound,’ Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said in a statement. Security staff march into a Manus Island detention centre compound . ‘They also threatened that a special forces unit will come from Port Moresby 'to deal with you' unless the hunger strike was ended by this morning.’ Deputy premier Warren Truss could not confirm those reports on Sunday, but said new Immigration Minister Peter Dutton would be seeking to do that. 'Minister Dutton has made a number of statements about what he believes to be happening at the present time. The flow of information is not always reliable,' Mr Truss told AAP in Brisbane. The security personnel were reportedly rounding up who they considered to be the ring leaders . The refugees said they were being denied food and water and have sent photos of men burrowing beneath a fence to reach crates of bottled water placed just outside the compound. A spokesman for Immigration Minister Dutton said the government had been ‘advised that food and water continue to be available’. ‘However, normal services and supplies in certain areas of the centre have been affected by the disruptive behaviour of some transferees. Normal services are ready to resume in those areas as soon as the situation allows,’ the spokesman said. Refugees said they were being denied food and water at the detention centre on Manus Island . On Sunday, the Refugee Action Coalition also published a letter it said was signed by 80 asylum seekers in Foxtrot compound. ‘Here a disaster is about to happen, please prevent this disaster,’ the letter read. ‘The Australian Government is planning to resettle us in PNG against our will, by forcing us. ‘We are not willing to be resettled in PNG because there is no safety [or] any future for us and our family. ‘Today we consider us to be hostage for the Australian Government so they can deter others not to come to Australia.’ Asylum seekers' bedding lies on the ground where their hunger strike is taking place . The protests, which began on Tuesday, were apparently sparked by plans to transfer some of the 50 men given refugees status to a transit centre near the main town of Manus Island. He said the government wanted to ensure that people in those centres were appropriately cared for. But Mr Truss reiterated that people who arrived by boat without a visa would not be resettled in Australia. Asylum seekers look on as security personnel search one of the compounds . 'You won't be able to get your way into this country through some kind of illegal people smuggling operation or by, for that matter, put up an argument that somehow or other you are being badly treated now and therefore should be granted access to this country,' he said. However, Mr Rintoul said taking leaders hostage or sending in the riot squad would not stop the hundreds of hunger strikers.","Asylum seekers have barricaded two compounds within the Manus Island detention centre .

"The driver of the bin lorry that killed six people in Glasgow had years of professional experience behind the wheel, it was revealed today. Harry Clarke, 58, from the Baillieston area of the city, joined the local authority four years ago and was initially employed to provide transport for children with learning difficulties. He is believed to have remained in that role for a year, which also included driving gritters, before moving to the cleansing department. Before joining the council he had worked for First Bus. Scroll down for video . Six dead: Emergency services walk past a cordoned-off crashed bin lorry as they attend the scene of the crash in George Square on December 22 in Glasgow . Emergency response: Eyewitnesses said the bin lorry driver appeared to fall ill at the wheel of the vehicle before losing control and hitting Christmas shoppers on Queen Street in the city . Meanwhile it was also revealed that Mr Clarke had passed the rigorous medical exam needed to keep his driving licence in 2012. He is still receiving counselling after collapsing at the wheel. Mr Clarke required a Heavy Goods Vehicle driver’s licence for his jobs at both First Bus and the council - which involved regular tough medical examinations, reported the Sunday Mail. His neighbours have described him as a ‘generous’ man who was always willing to help. One woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I’m genuinely shocked to learn he was involved. ‘My experience is of a decent man, well mannered, who was always prepared to help keep the communal areas clean. I know his neighbours will be wishing him a quick recovery.’ Died: Grandfather John 'Jack' Sweeney (left), 68, and primary school teacher Stephenie Tait (right), 29, were among the six victims of the fatal crash . Mr Sweeney's wife Lorraine (left), 69, and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McQuade (right)  also died . No details of any health issues or the explanation for what may have caused Mr Clarke to fall ill have so far emerged. He was treated at the Western Infirmary after the incident on December 22. Despite him having been released two weeks later, another neighbour said there had been no sign of Mr Clarke since the incident. He said: ‘I’ve not seen him. I am shocked to hear he was involved. He’s a good and decent guy, always pleasant and helpful. I hope he gets the support he needs.’ Investigators for Police Scotland are expected to submit their final report on the tragedy to the Crown Office in the coming weeks. A probe of eyewitness accounts and technical data has been pieced together. The families of those killed in the crash have been constantly updated on how the investigation has been progressing. Eyewitnesses said Mr Clarke appeared to fall ill at the wheel of the vehicle before losing control and hitting Christmas shoppers on Queen Street. Tax worker Jacqueline Morton (left), 51, and Gillian Ewing (right), 52, from Edinburgh were killed in the crash . Paying tribute: Hundreds of people attend a vigil near the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow on December 28 . The truck eventually came to a halt when it crashed into the Millennium Hotel. Last week relatives of three victims from the same family paid tribute to the ‘truly overwhelming’ support they received.

"While the fact that going on holiday makes us happier is hardly breaking news, the sacrifices we would make for an extra week in the sun make for much more interesting reading. Research has revealed that reveals that 69 per cent of British employees cite regular holidays as helping them keep focused in the workplace which is vital as we approach arguably some of the most miserable working days of the year this January. In fact, such is the clamour for holiday time, one in three Brits would take a pay cut for more holiday and 61 per cent said they'd even switch jobs. Holidays help people stay focused in their work as they have something to look forward to (File Photo) When it comes to inducing general happiness, being on holiday tops the list for Brits (46 per cent), beating getting a tax refund, finding lost money and being told you look younger. 1. Being on holiday – 46%2 . 2. Getting a tax refund – 17%3 . 3. Finding lost money – 14% . 4. Being told you look younger than you are – 9% . 5. Birthdays – 8% . A healthy 94 per cent of us also associate holidays with their overall happiness, with 89 per cent saying they come back from holidays happier than before they left. Junk food tops the list of things Britons would be happy to sacrifice in order to get an extra week's holiday; 50 per cent admitted to being prepared to cut out the crisps and chocolate for more time in the sun. But catching the eye more is that 28 per cent of people admit they would give up sex if it meant more time away from work. And, worryingly, 16 per cent would forgo having a shower for more time off. Relative to other markets, however, British bosses show one highest levels of support for holidays globally. Almost one in three have admitted they would be prepared to give up sex if it meant more holiday off work . According to the report 69 per cent of British employees feel supported by their boss when taking their holiday allocation, in comparison to only 28 per cent in neighbouring France and a global average of just 55 per cent. 'While habits differ across continents, the emotional impact of holiday does not,' said Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk, who conducted the research.

"Survivors who escaped the gas chambers at Auschwitz have remembered the horror of the infamous Nazi death camp 70 years after liberation by Red Army soldiers. Sam Pivnik has revealed the moment he threw himself at the feet of the Angel of Death, Dr Josef Mengele, and kissed his boots to avoid being exterminated when he couldn't move from his hospital bunk. He was just 14-year-old when he was rounded up from the Jewish ghetto in Bedzin, western Poland, with his family and left alone to survive for five-and-a-half months when they were sent to their deaths. 'Mengele was wearing his white coat and making his rounds, I was shaking with terror,' he said. 'We all knew anyone not able to stand by their beds was for the gas. He came to me and his finger pointed to the left, the gas chamber. Scroll down for video . Sam Pivnik (left) has revealed the moment he threw himself at the feet of the Angel of Death, Dr Josef Mengele (right), and kissed his boots to avoid being exterminated when he couldn't move from his hospital bunk . More than 1.1million people were killed at infamous Nazi death camp Auschwitz before liberation by the Red Army in 1945, pictured is the Death Gate at Auschwitz II Birkenau . 'I burst into tears and threw myself at his feet. I think I even kissed his boots. Mengele hated to be touched by Jews and I could have faced a bullet for that. To this day I don't know why, but he moved away. Later I was told I could stay.' He was liberated, barely alive, in May 1945 after surviving a 14-day death march and escaping from a transport ship that sank. Auschwitz was the site of one of the largest mass murders in history as around 1.1million were killed at the Nazi German camp - including Jews, gypsies, Poles and the disabled. The prisoners  had to stand naked in front of SS soldiers who – often on a whim – decided who was to die in the gas chambers and who would be spared to live for another day. Eva Behar (left) was liberated from Auschwitz in 1945 and Susan Pollock (right) revealed she was 'virtually a corpse' when the soldiers arrived .

An electrified barbed wire fence surrounds the Auschwitz I extermination camp  in Oswiecim, Poland, which is now a museum . A photograph from the collection of Auschwitz concentration camp survivor Alexander Riseman taken on a train, two days before the end of the Second World War . Located in  southern Poland, Auschwitz initially served as a detention center for political prisoners, but it  evolved into a network of camps where Jewish people and other perceived enemies of the Nazi state were exterminated, often in gas chambers, or used as slave labor. Some prisoners were also subjected to barbaric medical experiments led by Mengele, inclduing one when he attempted to created Siamese twins by attaching two sisters' blood vessels and organs together. Holocaust survivor Edith Baneth remembered the moment she arrived at the death camp after a three day journey in a packed train carriage with just one bucket for human waste. 'We still didn't know what Auschwitz meant. Suddenly these doors opened and the screams, ""Raus, raus"" and the dogs barking, just absolute madhouse. That was their policy, to frighten you, to make you so shocked you can't think straight, like animals which are herded. 'You just go and do whatever you are told to do. They put us on trucks, it's so [vivid] I never forget this moment. 'Then I knew where I am. A big, big - a lot of, lot of bodies, absolute big pile like a mountain, a pile of bodies all dead like just bone and skin but on top of that pile was a woman, just naked, thin like a bone, like those dead people but she was alive and stroking with her hands one of those heads of the bodies.'

Susan (Zuzka) Kluger, 80, was taken to the concentration camp in 1944 with her mother, Helen, and her 13-year-old sister, Lilian. She was chosen for hard labour, but her sister and mother died in the gas chambers. 'When you've been to hell and survived, nothing matters other than being happy. I loved my children. I gave them 100 per cent love – everything my mother gave to me, because that is all you have,' said Ms Kluger. Seventy years ago this weekend, Nazi camp commanders facing the Soviet army's rapid advance abandoned their plans to destroy Auschwitz, leaving dozens of barracks standing, and the twisted concrete-and-steel remains of gas chambers that were only half-destroyed by dynamite. They drove 60,000 prisoners on a death march that lasted weeks; almost a quarter died. Soldiers from the Soviet First Ukrainian Front fought their way to the gates of Auschwitz/ Birkenau on 27 January 1945 and found less than 6,000 prisoners still alive in the camp. Nearby, at the Monowitz slave labour camp they discovered 600 more, and at Auschwitz main camp a further 1,000. Survivor Susan Pollack revealed that when she was liberated, she was hospitalised for tuberculosis, typhoid and severe malnutrition. 'On liberation, I was virtually a corpse, unable to walk, and would soon have died,' she said. Around 300 people who endured the nightmare of Auschwitz will gather this month at the site, now a museum, to remember the dead and their own liberation.

"Prime Minister David Cameron sought to 'bust myths' about the jobs market, insisting most people getting a job were now in well-paid, full-time work . Britain is now the 'jobs factory of Europe', David Cameron boasted today as he vowed a Tory government would take employment to world-beating levels. The Prime Minister sought to 'bust myths' about the jobs market, insisting most people getting a job were now in well-paid, full-time work. But he was forced to admit that he will miss his pledge to reduce migration, blaming the booming jobs market for making Britain too attractive to migrants. In a speech in Ipswich today, the Prime Minister set out a goal for 'full employment' in Britain, overtaking all other G7 countries. The UK is currently fourth – at 72 per cent – just behind Canada and Japan. Germany is top at 74 per cent. He said that in the last year 9 in 10 who found work were in full-time jobs. The Prime Minister admitted it had been a 'tough few years' for UK plc, but said the country was 'coming out the other side' - and urged voters to stick with his plan. 'Full employment may be an economic term, but this is what it means in human terms: it means more of our fellow men and women with the security of a regular wage; it means you, your family and your children having a job and getting on in life,' Mr Cameron said. 'We have had a tough few years as a country, but we are coming out the other side. 'We are the jobs factory of Europe; we're creating more jobs here than the rest of Europe put together. That's what our long-term plan means for you - and if you vote Conservative, we can stay on this road to recovery.' The premier outlined five key Conservative commitments for the next Parliament: . Mr Cameron sought to appeal directly to small businesses, with four months before the election. 'The Conservatives are the party of small businesses. We're the party of the roofers and the retailers; the builders and the businesswomen,' Mr Cameron said. 'We're the ones who back people who strike out on their own, take the risks, and create wealth and jobs in our country. 'These are people we admire and want to help. Other parties preach about this sort of stuff; but we're the ones who really deliver,' he said. Britain is currently ranked fourth in the G7 league table for employment, but David Cameron wants to move to overtake Germany, Japan and Canada . Mr Cameron announced a trebling of the Start-Up Loans scheme, which hands out sums of around £5,000 to help young entrepreneurs. At least 75,000 loans will have been made by the 2020, according to the PM, creating at least 100,000 jobs. Speaking alongside former US Treasury secretary Larry Summer at the launch of a report from the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity, shadow chancellor Ed Balls is expected to dismiss the idea that the British economy is 'fixed'. 'The biggest economic challenge for our generation is to deliver sustained rises in living standards for all working people,' he will say. 'While growth has returned in many countries, working people on middle and low incomes are still seeing wages stagnating. 'Here in Britain working people are now GBP1,600 a year worse off since . 2010 and this is a key reason why the Government has failed to balance the books. 'And it is why David Cameron and George Osborne are completely out of touch when they try to tell people in Britain that the economy is fixed. 'In the short term, falling global oil prices may bring some respite for consumers across the world. But that is no substitute for tackling the deep-seated problem of our economy not working for working people.' Last week Mr Cameron was criticised for not making immigration one of his top six priorities – but it formed part of today's pitch on jobs. He  committed to 'controlling immigration and delivering a robust welfare system for EU migrants'. In addition, he  promised to back small businesses by keeping taxes low and cutting red tape; invest in infrastructure; lower the benefit cap to reward work; and create three million more apprenticeships. Mr Cameron, pictured at Ransomes Jacobsen lawn mower factory, admitted it had been a 'tough few years' for UK plc, but said the country was 'coming out the other side' - and urged voters to stick with his plan . Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'David Cameron's empty promises of full employment will mean nothing to so many people struggling with empty wallets as a result of the low-wage economy.' Labour's Ed Balls dismissed the idea that the British economy is 'fixed'. Speaking alongside former US Treasury secretary Larry Summer at the launch of a report from the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity, the shadow chancellor said: 'The biggest economic challenge for our generation is to deliver sustained rises in living standards for all working people,' he will say. 'While growth has returned in many countries, working people on middle and low incomes are still seeing wages stagnating.

"Two drivers travelling along a Victorian highway have narrowly escaped being crushed by seven trees during a wild storm. Posted under YouTube name Ron Cooper, the dash camera footage shows the moment he had to hit the brakes just inches away from where the first tree falls in front of his vehicle. The driver was travelling on the Black Spur highway between the towns of Healesville and Narbethong - north-east of Melbourne, which spans for about 30 kilometres, on December 29 about 2.15pm. Scroll down for video . The dash camera footage shows the moment the driver had to hit the brakes, while travelling along the Black Spur in Victoria's north-east . The incident happened on December 29 about 2.15pm when the first tree fell down, which was about 30 metres tall . The initial tree fall is followed by six others, stopping an oncoming car in its tracks who is also surprised by the sudden road blocks. The uploader told the Herald Sun the gum tree was about 30 metres tall and was glad he made the decision to stop his vehicle rather than to speed up when he noticed the tree falling. 'These trees started falling like a deck of cards,' he said. 'One more second - in fact even part of a second - would have put me either under the tree or into the tree. About six more trees fell down after the initial one, stopping an oncoming car in its tracks . Wind speeds in the area the driver was travelling in got up to more than 80 km/h on December 29, according Bureau of Meteorology . 'I'm always aware of what’s around me and I think it paid off that day.' In the lead up to the video, leaves and branches can been seen falling in the vehicle's way as the driver makes his way along the road at Watts River Bridge. He said he wanted to upload the video to YouTube to teach people about the dangers of driving during wild weather. 'One tree coming down is one thing but when you have like a dozen it's unheard of I think in one small area,' the driver said. 'I just want people worldwide - not just in Australia - to be aware of trees.' On the video, the driver added the video served as 'a great educational video showing the dangers of traveling in the bush during periods of high wind'. Wind speeds in the area the driver was travelling in got up to more than 80 km/h on December 29, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.","The video was shot while the driver was travelling north-east of Melbourne .

"Theresa May has pleaded with Jews not to leave Britain as she vowed to step up efforts to tackle anti-Semitism. The Home Secretary said she never thought she would see the day when Jews in the UK were frightened to stay here. Scotland Yard have promised extra patrols in Jewish areas in the wake of the gun attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris which left four people dead. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May said she never thought she would see the day when Jews in the UK were frightened to stay here . Fanatical gunman Amedy Coulibaly murdered four shoppers before being killed by armed police in a siege in the quiet residential area of Vincennes in Paris. Moshe Sebbag, the rabbi of Paris's biggest synagogue, has predicted that thousands of Jews will flee France in the attacks in a 'big exodus'. There are fears the same thing could happen in the UK. There are more than 260,000 Jewish people living in Britain, or 0.5 per cent of the population, according to the Census in 2011. Last year saw the most anti-Semitic incidents recorded by police since records began 30 years ago, according to the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. On Friday posters advertising a Holocaust memorial event have been daubed with graffiti including the words 'liars' and 'killers'. Speaking at an event to commemorate the Jewish people who died during the terror attacks in France, Mrs May said: 'The dreadful events in Paris are a reminder of the serious terrorist threat that we face. 'The attack on a Jewish supermarket, where four people were killed, is a chilling reminder of anti-Semitism, not just in France but the recent anti-Semitic prejudice that we sadly have seen in this country. 'I know that many Jewish people in this country are feeling vulnerable and fearful and you're saying that you're anxious for your families, for your children and yourselves. 'I never thought I would see the day when members of the Jewish community in the United Kingdom would say they were fearful of remaining here in the United Kingdom. 'And that means we must all redouble our efforts to wipe out anti-Semitism here in the United Kingdom.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Mrs May hold up signs declaring 'Je suis juif' – 'I am Jewish' Police officers and French army soldiers patrol Rue des Rosiers street,  in the heart of Paris's Jewish quarter, in the wake of the terror attacks. Patrols are also being stepped up in Britain . In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, French prime minister Manuel Valls, who said: 'If 100,000 Jews leave, France will no longer be French, the French Republic will be judged a failure.' Mrs May said the same sentiment was also true of the UK. 'Without its Jews, Britain would not be Britain, just as without its Muslims, Britain would not be Britain - without its Sikhs, Hindus, Christians and people of other faiths, Britain would not be Britain.' In solidarity with the French, Mrs May and other antendees of the event held up signs reading: 'Je suis juif' – 'I am Jewish.' She told the event in London: 'In Europe, of course, we have seen large numbers of Jewish people emigrate and others are questioning their future. 'There have been other attacks as well, the like of which we never thought we'd see again in Europe - in Brussels, of course, where four people were shot and killed at a Jewish museum and in Toulouse, where three children and a teacher were murdered at a Jewish school. 'So I want to say this: Jewish people have long been an important and integral part of this country, we cherish the contribution you make, not just in the past but today and every day.' Speaking at the same event, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said that he stood 'shoulder to shoulder with the Jewish community, shoulder to shoulder with fellow British citizens' and described anti-Semitism as 'a cancer'. He added: 'Modern Britain without a thriving Jewish community would not be Britain. The Jewish community is a vital part of what makes Britain tick, whether it's leadership through business and commerce, arts like dance and literature, or something more humble like members of the JLGB, who give so much to the Jewish community and others.' The event included a minute's silence for those who lost their lives attended by representatives of CRIF - Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France, and the French embassy in London. Prayers were led by UK-based French Rabbi Mordechai Fhima. Board Senior Vice President Laura Marks thanked both cabinet minister for their attendance, saying, 'We so desperately appreciate you both coming along. The support makes so much difference to us. Vivian Wineman, President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: 'This has been a clear demonstration of the government's and the country's solidarity with the community at this critical time.' The increased security in Britain comes after the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris last week, after gunman Amedy Coulibaly took more than a dozen peopple hostage . A former chief rabbi declared that security fears among British Jews were at their highest since the end of the Second World War. Lord Jonathan Sacks told Sky News: ‘After what happened in Paris you are beginning to get British Jews asking. “Will I be safe going to synagogue or going to a Jewish shop? Will my children be safe in a Jewish school?” There can be no doubt that there is an anxiety now among British Jews which is pretty much at a high in my lifetime.’ It also emerged that security had been stepped up for police officers, who have been warned they may be targeted by terrorist gunmen after a plot to attack a police HQ in Belgium was foiled last week. Measures included Scotland Yard warning officers to remove their names from public copies of the electoral register so terrorists cannot find out their addresses and to avoid wearing any part of their uniform when travelling to work. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that it had given extra security advice to officers and staff, but denied ordering police officers to patrol in pairs for their own safety. The security services are demanding new powers that would make it easier for them to monitor the communications of terror suspects, a demand supported by Lord Evans, a former head of MI5. He warned that leaps in technology meant Britain’s anti-terror laws were ‘no longer fit for purpose’. ‘It would be bizarre if we were to reach a position where the benefits of new technology were available to terrorists, but forbidden to the security agencies and police,’ he said. The Association of Chief Police Officers has been reviewing its security measures following the attacks in Paris. Mr Rowley, a Met assistant commissioner, said in a statement on Friday: 'The global picture of terrorist activity does give us heightened concern about the risk to the Jewish community in the UK. 'We are seeing continuing anti-Semitic rhetoric from extremists and attacks on this community in France and elsewhere. 'In addition to our existing security measures, we are in dialogue with Jewish Community leaders about further actions that we will be taking, including more patrols in key areas. 'We remain alert to the vulnerabilities of other communities. Where we do have particular concerns, we make these known to those involved.' But David Cameron warned it is impossible to keep people 100 per cent safe from terror attacks in an 'open and free society'. Meanwhile one of Europe's largest Jewish associations has written a letter to EU ministers asking for gun laws to be relaxed to allow Jews to arm themselves to protect against terror attacks. Rabbi Menachem Margolin, the head of the European Jewish Association, made the request in the wake of the Paris attacks in which four Jews were killed inside a deli in the French capital. In the letter, dated January 13, he asks for permission for 'people in the Jewish communities and institutions to own weapons' to protect against 'anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance'.","Home Secretary never thought she would see the day Jews wanted to flee .

"Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood just a short walk from the bridge where the beloved characters played Poohsticks – two houses are on the market to give fans the chance to own a little piece of Pooh corner. Lone Oak Cottage and Lone Oak Hall are hidden away in Ashdown Forest, the 'enchanted' woods' immortalised by AA Milne's classic children's stories about Winnie the Pooh and his animal friends. But fans of Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and Eeyore will have to fork out £2.75million if they want to get their hands on both unique properties, located in their own private-gated hamlet in the woodlands in East Sussex. Even though you're unlikely to stumble across the 'bear of very little brain' in the woods, all the famous landmarks from the best-selling books can be found only a short stroll away. Five bedroom Lone Oak Hall is hidden way in hidden away in Ashdown Forest, the 'enchanted' woods' immortalised by AA Milne's classic children's stories about Winnie the Pooh and his animal friends . Lone Oak Cottage has an asking price of £895,000 - or it could be bought along with Loan Oak Hall as one 2.7 acre plot for £2.75million . The luxury houses can be bought as one 2.7 acre plot, or buyers can purchase them separately - Lone Oak Hall has a price tag of £1.95million while Lone Oak Cottage is £895,000. Five-bedroom Lone Oak Hall is a modern 4,227 sq ft home with four floors boasting a swimming pool, a garden room, drawing room with terrace and an office. It also has a summer house and a studio with a car port underneath. Lone Oak Cottage has a 26-foot reception room, five bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen and dining room, as well as a barn with an office above it and a car port. The cottage backs onto Five Hundred Acre Wood, which became the Hundred Acre Wood in the timeless children’s books.

The luxury houses can be bought as one 2.7 acre plot, or buyers can purchase them separately, pictured is Lone Oak Hall . Both Lone Oak Hall (pictured) and the cottage were designed by award-winning architect Michael Wilford who said it was a unique opportunity . Both homes are just a short walk from the bridge where the  beloved characters played Poohsticks (right), also pictured (left) is a drawing by E. H Shepard . Award-winning architect Michael Wilford, who constructed both homes, said: 'It has a wooden frame and there's wooden floors throughout. It's not your typical little thatched cottage, it's a big family home.' We're surrounded by Winnie the Pooh landmarks. As a kid I loved the Winnie the Pooh books and our kids have grown up with them too. They've got the chance to explore the forest and it is literally an 'enchanted place'. 'We're about a quarter of a mile off the road and our nearest neighbours, and in every other direction there's nothing for miles. 'It's really secluded, although before the Pooh Corner shop in Hartfield started issuing maps of all the locations, we often got a Japanese tourist walking down the drive looking for Pooh Bridge.' The houses have oil fired and wood burning heating and rainwater storage tanks. Amanda Wyatt, from estate agents Savills which is selling the properties, said: 'These two stunning properties, approached by a winding road through the woods, are in a private and tranquil setting surrounded by the enchanting Ashdown Forest. 'The forest is commonly referred to as 'Pooh Country' and places in the Winnie the Pooh books such as the Hundred Acre Wood, the Enchanted Place, Poohsticks Bridge and Pooh Corner are all based on nearby locations, where Christopher Robin used to visit with his bear. 'This is a rare opportunity for a buyer to acquire either or both of these properties in what is such a fantastic and unique setting.'

The real Christopher Robin (left) clutching his Winnie the Pooh teddy bear and author A A Milne (right) who write the famous books . AA Milne bought Cotchford Farm, which is 1.3 miles from these properties, as a country retreat for himself and his family in 1925 and they would stay there for weekends and holidays. His son, Christopher Robin Milne, was the namesake for Pooh's companion in his books and spent his early years exploring the forest by the Lone Oak hamlet. Christopher's experiences and discoveries provided Milne with material for his stories and most of the characters - Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga and Roo - were based on Christopher's stuffed toys. The sale has come to light on Winnie the Pooh Day, which celebrates the birthday of AA Milne on January 18, 1882. His first book, Winnie-the-Pooh, was published in 1926 with illustrations by EH Shepard, followed by House at Pooh Corner two years later. He also wrote poems about the bear in the children's verse books When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927) The stories have been translated into more than 50 different languages, including Latin. Although the Poohsticks game was invented in the books, it has crossed over into the real world and a World Championship Poohsticks race takes place in Oxfordshire every year. AA Milne famously denounced war in his pacifist essay Peace with Honour, but classified documents found in an old trunk revealed the author of Winnie the Pooh was recruited by a secret propaganda unit during the First World War.","Lone Oak Cottage and Lone Oak Hall in Ashdown Forest, East Sussex, are on the market for a total of £2.75m .

"Wedged into metal pipes at subway stations, they go unnoticed by millions of New Yorkers daily. But these hidden surveillance cameras are actually tracking the movements of commuters. The cameras, disguised in pipes near Metrocard machines, turnstiles and token booths, are part of a covert Metropolitan Transportation Authority surveillance network that monitors travelers' activity. They are separate from the dome-shaped surveillance devices that are clearly visible at stations across the city - but can reportedly be monitored real-time 'if deemed necessary' by officials. Covert: This hidden camera (pictured), disguised in a pipe at Herald Square subway station at 34th Street, is part of a covert Metropolitan Transportation Authority surveillance network that monitors travelers'  activity . At Herald Square subway station at 34th Street alone, at least six cameras are hidden inside what appear to be electrical conduits to observe commuters, according to the New York Post. The MTA describes the devices as 'antiquated', claiming they date back to as far as the 1990s. However, some of the cameras appear to be housed in new metal pipes, the newspaper noted. 'They are covert cameras for high-priority areas or high crime. They record, but can be monitored real-time if it’s deemed necessary,' one source explained. And the cameras - positioned in casings that will capture commuters' heads and shoulders - are so well hidden that even agency employees and transit advocates were not aware of their existence. Hidden: The cameras (pictured) are distinct from the dome surveillance devices that are clearly visible at stations across the city - but can reportedly be monitored real-time 'if deemed necessary' by officials . William Henderson, executive director of the MTA’s Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, said: 'I think I may have first heard they were planning to put cameras in less obvious places last year. But I never noticed these.' Meanwhile, experts have deemed the devices 'fascinating'. 'They look like a part of the industrial environment of the MTA,' Robert McCrie, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice’s Department of Security, Fire and Emergency Management, said. 'They are positioned in ways to get people’s heads and shoulders.' However, others have condemned the hidden cameras, citing serious privacy concerns. Norman Siegel, a civil-rights lawyer, said the agency should be more forthright about the cameras, which he said 'sweep up' information on commuters in a 'vacuum-cleaner' manner. Members of the public have also spoken of their uneasiness at the cameras' covert presence. The MTA has refused to disclose which other stations may have the hidden cameras, nor where the camera feed is transmitted. This is for security reasons, the agency told the newspaper. In addition to the hidden surveillance cameras, the MTA reportedly uses other - equally covert - 'enhanced equipment', such as cameras of higher quality, that 'serve in various capacities'. Equipped: At the 34th Street station in Manhattan (pictured) alone, at least six cameras are hidden inside what appear to be electrical conduits to observe commuters. The MTA describes the devices as 'antiquated' In fact, it prefers to use the latter to monitor commuters' activity, spokesman Kevin Ortiz said. In total, there are said to be more than 4,500 cameras throughout the subway system. Many of these cameras have aided police in their efforts to track down suspects and investigate crimes. Last year, it emerged that the MTA is planning to install surveillance cameras in subway cars between 2015 and 2019. The cameras will be fixed to 940 new subway cars to catch criminals. The agency is also said to be considering the installment of cameras in 300  cars that were purchased last year for the C and J lines. A pilot project was tested in 2010. The latest surveillance revelations come just a week after New Yorkers braved sub-zero temperatures and windy conditions to go bare-legged for the annual 'No Pants Subway Ride'. Donning hats, scarves and thick coats on their top halves, participants boarded trains at stations across the city last Sunday - surrounded by bemused travellers. Scantily-clad riders also took part in places including London, Milan, Bucharest, Berlin and Mexico City - all joined in as part of the 'celebration of silliness'. The event started off as a prank by comedy group Improv Everywhere in 2002, bemusing a few embarrassed commuters,. However, it has since grown into a global phenomenon.","Cameras are hidden in pipes near Metrocard machines and turnstiles .

"This is the extraordinary moment a seal snuggles up with a golden Labrador on a beach in France. In the footage shot by Elise Frebourg it shows the seal - christened 'You' by locals - shuffling over to the Labrador lying on the sand.

Last month, the attention-seeking seal was filmed climbing over surfers and their boards in Lacanau, France. The footage, captured by Bertrand Chaussade using a camera mounted on his surf board, shows the seal repeatedly approaching him and swimming over his board. 'He played with us for the whole morning. He would climb on my board, ask for strokes and push me over. It was like playing with a little dog, it was a very playful and loving animal. It was a beautiful encounter and a magical moment' Mr Chaussade later wrote online.","Footage shot by Elise Frebourg shows seal shuffling over to the Labrador .

"A disabled army veteran was shocked to open a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs which declared him dead. James Fales, who served 11 years and now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, was killed off inside the department's computer system, which triggered the ill-timed letter of condolence. His wife, Dorothea, was named on the from of the message, sent to their home in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Declared dead: James Fales (right) was killed off in the eyes of the VA's computer systems by an error - and a letter of condolence was sent to his wife, Dorothea (left) Condolences: The letter, pictured above in a local TV broadcast, gave instructions for dealing with Fales's supposed death - then asked for any uncashed checks back . It offered consolation and instructions related to his supposed death - and also told her to hand back his benefit payments. The letter, which ended with an address to send U.S. Treasury checks to rather than cashing them, also explained costs to do with his funeral. Service: Fales, pictured as a soldier, had 11 year's service . Speaking to Fox News about the mix-up, Fales said: 'At first, it was kind of a shock; then it became humorous, to a point.' However, he added that the mix-up has had real-world consequences, as it has interfered with payments he usually receives from the department. He added that the error highlighted a problem in the government's bureaucracy, as while once branch of the VA thought he was dead, another was still calling him about medical appointments. As well as PTSD, Fales is also being treated for an ankle injury, local station KFSM reported. The Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, which treats Fales, issued an apology after the mix-up. A spokesman said: 'We do apologize and regret that this error has occurred, and want to reassure our Veterans that we will work diligently to assist them in any way we are able to in order to resolve the issue.'","James Fales, of Fayetteville, Arkansas, was declared dead by error .

"Living in the North could increase a person’s risk of developing dementia, research suggests. Researchers said this could be because of lower levels of vitamin D among those who live in more northerly climes, as they enjoy less sunshine than in the South. Vitamin D is produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight and low levels have previously been shown to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh said that it was likely that more than one environmental factor would have an influence – and that if they were found then rates of dementia could be halved. Researchers said living in the North raises the risk of dementia because of lower levels of vitamin D due to a lack of sunshine . They found a clear geographical divide in rates of dementia. Among Swedish twins, those living in the north were two to three times more likely to develop the disease compared with those in the south once other factors such as age and gender were eliminated. The same pattern was discovered when the research team looked at Scots born in 1921. There was no greater risk of developing dementia linked to where people lived as children. But by the time they reached middle age, there was a higher rate of the disease among those who lived further north. Tom Russ, of Edinburgh University, said lack of vitamin D could be one reason for the link. He said: ‘The north-south divide does make you think about latitude and it may be it is something to do with sunlight exposure and vitamin D – that is a possibility and it has certainly been linked to healthy brain function and dementia. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh found a clear geographical divide in rates of dementia . ‘Statistics have revealed that middle-aged Scots living in the Grampian area – around Aberdeen – are more likely to develop the disease compared to those who live on the border with England. ‘The next step is to pin down what these factors could be. Given that two to threefold variation, it is not going to be one factor – but if you could identify what these factors are and optimise them in the whole population, you could potentially halve dementia rates.’ Mr Russ stressed the study based on data for Swedish twins allowed the researchers to eliminate any genetic factors which might explain the north-south divide. He said: ‘In the Scottish study, everybody was born in 1921, so they will have experienced different things all at the same time – for example, they will all have been the same age when the NHS was introduced. ‘By middle age, there was a big variation across Scotland and it was a similar pattern: higher in the north and lower in the south.’ There are currently about 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, and the number is predicted to reach more than one million by 2025, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. Research published last year found that older people with low levels of vitamin D were more than twice as likely to develop dementia. The body makes most of its vitamin D from sunlight on the skin, but older people can be less efficient at doing this. Although the vitamin is found in oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream. Other studies have also suggested that those with a vitamin D deficiency are more likely to experience cognitive problems. Lindsay Kinnaird, research manager at Alzheimer Scotland, said: ‘If we are able to identify environmental risk factors, then we have the opportunity to make adaptations to lifestyle that can minimise their impact.’","Researchers said this could be because of lower levels of vitamin D .

"If trekking the Great Wall of China or taking in the breathtaking views of the Grand Canyon make an appearance on you bucket list, you are not alone. A new survey suggests that far from being couch potatoes as we're often portrayed, the British are really rather an adventurous bunch. At least in theory... Figures from the CWM FX London Boat Show reveal that 40 per cent of Brits dream of making a pilgrimage to The Great Wall of China, which stretches for an incredible 5,500 miles across north of the country, while just over a third of people claim that visiting the Grand Canyon in Arizona tops their list of dream destinations. The Great Wall of China is top of the bucket list for around 40 per cent of adventurous Brits . It may not actually be a canyon, but the Grand Canyon in Arizona is stunning . A quarter of Britons say that trekking the Inca trail is top of the dream destinations . And we're not afraid to strap on our walking boots either. Trekking the famous Inca Trail in Peru to reach the 15th-century ruins at Machu Picchu comes in at number three on the list, with a quarter of people claiming it is their most aspirational adventure. This is closely followed by 21 per cent of Brits who say they dream of walking the length of the mighty River Nile. And it appears that we're a fearless lot, as well. Around 17 per cent of those polled said they dream of diving with great white sharks, and a further 15 per cent are willing to risk life and limb (and maybe the odd finger tip) to climb to the summit of Mount Everest. You looking at me? Forget dolphins, 17 per cent of Brits say they want to dive with great white sharks . Skydiving over the Great Barrier Reef in Australia makes number seven on the list . 1.Walking along the Great Wall of China - 40% . 2. Hiking into the Grand Canyon - 31% . 3. Trekking the Inca trail - 25% . 4. Walking the Nile - 21% . 5. Diving with great white sharks - 17% . 6. Hiking the great Himalaya trail, Nepal - 17% . 7.

"Australia is the sixth most expensive place in the world to live in, new research has revealed. It came behind Switzerland, Norway, Venezuela, Iceland and Denmark in the Cost of Living Around the World report done by movehub - a resource for people moving abroad. The survey took into account cost of groceries, transportation, restaurants and utilities. Scroll down for video . Australia is the sixth most expensive place in the world to live in, according to new research . Switzerland has been named as the costliest place to live in the world by movehub - resource for those who wish to move abroad . Movehub explains the cost of groceries took into account the price for meat, bread, rice, eggs, fruits, vegetables and alcohol. While, transportation costs included one-way tickets, monthly passes, taxi fares, petrol prices and other costs related to running a car based on the use of Volkswagen Golf. Meal prices at expensive, mid-range and inexpensive restaurants were taken into account along with prices of coffee products, alcohol and water. Electricity, heating, water the internet were the utilities assessed. All nations were compared to the cost of living in New York. For example, if a country has a consumer price index of 70 on movehub's infographic then on average its cost of living is 30 per cent cheaper than that of New York's. Australia also beat out the United Kingdom (pictured), which came in at the 10th place . The Land Down Under also beat out France, which was ranked even below the U.K., in 15th place . Therefore, the average cost of living for an Australian is almost one per cent cheaper than for someone living in the Big Apple. It may come as a surprise to some that Venezuela came in at number three on the list, but the South American national owes much of its expensive cost of living to the fluctuating economy that means wages are low while prices of goods continue to rise. Venezuela's tightening financial situation has fanned market anxiety about a default, especially as oil slumps to near six-year lows. President Nicholas Maduro has vowed to pay bondholders and most economists doubt a default is coming in the near-term, but investors are getting skittish as the economic crisis worsens. India comes out as having the lowest cost of living, with poor wages matched by poor living conditions . Venezuela depends on oil for 96 per cent of its export revenue. Australia even beat out the United Kingdom, which ranked the 10th costliest place to live, France and the United States - which did not even break into the top 15. There were not many surprises where it comes to the countries with the lowest cost of living. India topped the pile in this regard, followed in by Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia and Algeria. South America's sole entry in the top 15 cheapest places to live was Colombia, typically another country dependent on the strengths of the oil industry.","Australia came in behind Switzerland, Norway, Venezuela, Iceland and Denmark .

"He started his career as an acerbic blogger, known for his heated feuds and his controversial penchant for 'outing' gay celebrities. Then in 2010, everything changed for Perez Hilton when he fronted an anti-bullying campaign and decided to change his ways - promising to be a nicer and better person. But as the Florida born star fails to raise support in the Celebrity Big Brother house, FEMAIL questions whether Perez has now gone full circle. Scroll down for video . Perez Hilton entered the Big Brother house 11 days ago but already he has been labelled the 'Most Hated Man In Britain'. So, just four years after publicly pledging to become a more positive person, has the blogger dropped his nice guy image? Perez was given a warning by Big Brother after telling fellow housemate Ken Morley that he should be afraid of what will happen when he leaves the house . Because in the eleven days since entering the house, Perez has already earned himself the title of 'Most hated man in Britain.' And when Chloe Goodman left the house on Friday it was to audible cheers of, 'Get Perez Out.' Since the start of the show, the blogger has made a number of enemies both among his CBB co-stars and in the outside world. His recent goading of Alexander O'Neal left his housemates fuming and his bizarre nearly-naked humping of the  garden furniture caused fans to brand him 'offensive.' He was also given a verbal warning by Big Brother after threatening fellow contestant Ken Morley - who had been making remarks about the women in the house - by telling him: 'I feel sorry Ken. If I were you, when I leave this house, I would be afraid.' But should we really be so surprised by Perez's behaviour? After all, this was a man who built his career on being offensive. When he started his website in 2004 - after failing to become an actor following his time at New York University - his modus operandi was to slate celebrities. He would regularly post unflattering paparazzi photographs with derogatory remarks and rude images drawn over the top. Perez broke down in tears over on-going fights in the Big Brother house . Perez's bizarre behaviour in the house has been branded offensive by some of the shows viewers . One of Perez's most controversial activities was to 'out' celebrities who he believed to be gay. He was widely criticised for such behaviour, with gay rights activists claiming it could be detrimental to the the gay community and those he was outing. Perez  - whose real name is Mario - defended his actions to Midweek Politics at the time, saying: 'I know there is some controversy about outing people, but I also believe the only way we're gonna have change is with visibility. 'And if I have to drag some people screaming out of the closet, then I will. 'I think that lots of celebrities have an archaic fear that being gay will hurt their career but look at Rosie (O'Donnell), Look at Ellen.' Perez was good friends with Lady Gaga until 2011, when the pair fell out for unknown reasons. Their feud is still ongoing and two years ago she accused him of stalking her . Perez Hilton's alter ego was inspired by Paris Hilton, who he was pictured with alongside Lil Kim in New York in 2006 . Stars like Lance Bass from N'Sync and the actor Neil Patrick Harris - who were targeted by Perez - would later come out as gay. Perez's site wasn't without its legal troubles either. In 2007, he was sued after posting illegal clips of Britney Spears' unfinished songs. Then June 2010, he posted a Twitter link to what was thought to be an up-skirt photograph of a knicker-less Miley Cyrus. Miley was just 17 at the time and therefore an underage woman in the eyes of American law, leading to questions being asked about whether child pornography charges should be brought against Perez. Perez claimed at the time that Miley was in fact wearing underwear but also removed the offending photograph from his feed. Perez courted controversy when he tweeted what was thought to have been an up-skirt picture of an underage Miley Cyrus, he also outed N'Sync singer Lance Bass . Perez is barely recognisable from his former self after slimming down thanks to diet and exercise . He also caused controversy in 2009 after lambasting a dying Michael Jackson following reports the star had suffered from a heart attack. Perez claimed that Michael was faking his illness and that it was just a publicity stunt - urging fans of the late star to ask for refunds on Jackson concert tickets. But the singer passed away later that day and Perez went on to remove the post from his site. Then in late 2010, the blogger posted a video declaring that things were going to change. Perez released a seven-minute long YouTube clip where he claimed that his site was going to become more positive, even if it meant losing revenue. Perez is still friends with Katy Perry, who attended his birthday party in 2010 . He said that his work with the It Gets Better campaign - which urged celebrities to support gay teenagers who were being driven to suicide by bulling - had inspired the change. Perez said in the video statement: 'In the last week a lot of people have called me a hypocrite (for working with the charity). 'A lot of people have said that I am a hypocrite and one of the biggest bullies out there. And there is truth to that. 'I have on my website said things that have been hurtful to people. (But) I don't see myself as a bully. 'I've been doing my website for six years now and in the past I would justify everything as comedy and humour and (because) these are celebrities. 'But, I don't want to have to justify what I do anymore.' Big Brother fans have taken to Twitter to speak about their hatred of Perez, with some labelling him the most hated man in Britain. Perez continued: 'I am growing and I want to be a Dad... and I don't think it's right to make fun of kids anymore. 'I did in the past and I regret it.' Perez stayed true to his word - his website stopped using offensive language to describe  celebrities and the articles became much more positive. He also overhauled his personal life. Perez - who was born to Cuban parents - went on an extensive diet and exercise regime slimming down by a dramatic 70 pounds. Then in 2013, he fulfilled his dream to become a father after he fathered a son - also called Mario - with a surrogate mother. Since changing his site, Perez has won many celebrity friends but he still has many detractors. Perhaps the most famous of those is Lady Gaga, who was good friends with the blogger until 2011, when they fell out for an unknown reason. Two years after they first fell out, Gaga was forced to cancel her 2013 tour due to a hip injury. She alleged that Perez had sent her a picture of her in a wheelchair with KARMA written across it and a picture of Madonna holding a gun. Perez in his official Celebrity Big Brother photos before entering the house earlier this year . Gaga later accused Perez of stalking her after he was spotted out side her New York apartment by a fan, but he denied the claims. He said he was only there to look at a new home and did not know that Gaga lived in the building. After lying relatively low for the last  year, much of the anger towards Perez from both celebrities and the certain parts of the US public had started to die down. But since entering the Big Brother house, he has attracted fresh attention, with his behaviour causing viewers to demand that he is kicked off the show and . As he continues to alienate his housemates, it seems he has very much fallen of his nice guy bandwagon.","Perez started his career writing offensive stories about celebrities .

"In the last couple of weeks, two relationships with enormous age gaps have caught the nation's attention. The first was Stephen Fry's engagement to Elliott Spencer, who is 30 years younger than him - the happy couple are now married after signing the civil register in Dereham, Norfolk. The second was the news that Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page was dating a woman 46 years his junior. But why do age gaps continue to shock? Older men dating women in their twenties has been happening for centuries. Scroll down for video . Stephen Fry, 57, and his partner, stand-up comedian Elliott Spencer, 27. The pair, who have a 30 year age difference, got married yesterday afternoon in Norfolk. They are one of several Hollywood romances that features an age gap spanning generations and the difference in maturity has sparked enormous interest from the British public. But why do age gap romances continue to be such a source of fascination, given that they have been happening for centuries? But each time an older man steps out with a young woman, or more recently the reverse, the nation makes a collective gasp. Demi Moore married Ashton Kutcher, who was 15 years her junior, and the couple stayed together for several years, but the public were never quite able to get to grips with the romance. Caroline Flack's fling with Harry Styles caused such disgust that for a time it almost looked like it would derail her career. And Madonna's love of toyboys in recent years has almost overshadowed her musical career. In Hollywood alone, there have been numerous romances between women and men of different generations in the last yen years alone. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, 71, and his 25-year-old actress girlfriend Scarlett Sabet. The pair, who have a 46 year age gap, celebrated his birthday at Nando's this week . So why do some men and women go for someone much older or younger instead or a person their own age? Sex therapist Louise Van De Velde, who wrote the book Decent Proposal, says it's a cliche, but age is nothing but a number. She explained to FEMAIL: 'In case you haven't noticed, we feel the same as we get older as we did when we were young, on the inside at least - it's only when we look in the mirror we see the signs of ageing. 'Psychologically, having a trophy wife on your arm gives the same effect as flash cars and watches - admiration and significance, it's almost as if having this young partner quantifies how successful they are.' But although she understands the reasons for wanting a younger woman or man on your arm, Louise warns that there are several cons to an age gap relationship. She said: 'This difference in age creates many problems as interests do change with age, as do energy levels. 'It is well known that men and women reach their sexual peak at a different ages (men early 20s women late 30s early 40s), so while a young toy boy may well be able to satisfy  an older woman an older man may leave his younger wife feeling unfulfilled. 'This is not something to be overlooked - sex is key to all successful relationships as it clears blocks and maintains connection. 'However, if the partners can embrace the differences, then maturity can be a good balance for the immaturity and the youthful enthusiasm can keep the older partner young.' Friends of Stephen Fry say that his relationship with Elliott Spencer has made him happier than he has been in years . According to new research by dating website EliteSingles, the stereotype of the older man seeking an increasingly younger partner does in fact ring true. Men aged 60-69 set, on average, a desired partner age of up to 11 years younger than themselves, while the oldest they would accept is someone just 1 year older. But younger men buck the trend, with those aged up to 30 preferring to date someone older than younger. Between the ages of 20-29, many men indicate a preference for a partner 3-6 years older than themselves. The website's psychologist Sam Owen believes that men aged 20-29 now looking for older women pver a younger model is largely down to the change in gender roles in modern society, with far more equality between the sexes nowadays. He said: 'Young men nowadays probably recognise that older women are adept at diligently juggling so many responsibilities like a career, children, housekeeping, fitness, finances and socialising. 'This makes them intriguing, attractive and a more secure option.' Would you date a much older (or younger) man? Femail looks at the Hollywood starlets who did: .

"Christian nurse Victoria Wasteney, 37, claims she was sacked after praying for a Muslim colleague . A Christian health worker has accused the NHS of making her look like a 'religious nutcase' after she was branded a bully for praying for a Muslim colleague. Victoria Wasteney, 37, was disciplined for alleged bullying and harassment after Enya Nawaz, 25, told managers that the senior occupational health therapist had tried to convert her to Christianity. Tomorrow Miss Wasteney will launch an employment tribunal against the NHS trust she works for, claiming her employers discriminated against her because of her religion. Miss Wasteney told the Daily Mail: 'I'm not anti-Muslim and I'm always very mindful to be sensitive to other people's beliefs. 'We discussed our beliefs but I certainly didn't tell her that my way was the only way. I don't even believe it's possible to force someone to convert. 'But the way it was all handled left me looking like a religious nutcase and I would like an acknowledgement that there is a negative attitude towards Christianity in some areas of the public sector.' Miss Wasteney, who describes herself as a born-again Christian, was working at the John Howard Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital in Homerton, East London. She said she was always careful about discussing her religion at work because her managers had warned her it could 'get you in trouble'. After Miss Nawaz joined the hospital as a newly qualified occupational therapist in 2012, the two women discussed Islam and Christianity, as well as work done by Miss Wasteney's church to campaign against human trafficking. Miss Wasteney said her colleague had 'definitely initiated' the conversations, before she invited Miss Nawaz to attend church events linked to the anti-trafficking work. She said Miss Nawaz had then come to her in tears because she was upset about health problems. Miss Wasteney said: 'I put my hand on her knee to comfort her and asked if that was okay, and said 'Would you like me to pray for you?' 'She said yes, so I asked for God to bring peace and healing. She left the office afterwards and said she was okay.' Miss Wasteney also gave Miss Nawaz a book, I Dared to Call Him Father, about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity, but denied it was an attempt to make Miss Nawaz convert. Miss Wasteney was suspended from work for nine months by East London NHS Foundation Trust after Enya Nawaz accused her of trying to convert her to Christianity (file picture) Miss Wasteney gave Miss Nawaz the book I Dared To Call Him Father, about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity . She said she was shocked to learn her junior had made a formal complaint, but said Miss Nawaz had previously told her she had come under pressure from colleagues to do so. The East London NHS Foundation Trust investigated Miss Nawaz's eight-page complaint in June 2013. Miss Wasteney was suspended on full pay for nine months while the investigation was carried out. A disciplinary hearing dismissed some of the allegations but upheld three complaints related to the book, the invitation to church events and Miss Wasteney's offer to pray for Miss Nawaz. It ruled that the episodes amounted to misconduct. Miss Wasteney was given a written warning, although she was not sacked and continues to work in another area of the trust. Miss Wasteney praised the NHS trust for working to encourage equality and diversity but said respect for other faiths should not be used to stifle discussions about Christianity. She said: 'I hope by bringing this employment tribunal it will help the NHS trust to acknowledge that there is negativity towards Christians and Christianity in the culture of the workplace.' Andrea Minichiello Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre which is supporting Miss Wasteney, said: 'The NHS is increasingly dominated by a suffocating liberal agenda that chooses to bend over backwards to accommodate certain beliefs but punishes the Christian.' East London NHS Foundation Trust said it would be inappropriate to comment on Miss Wasteney's case ahead of the tribunal. A magistrate who said a child should not be adopted by a same-sex couple has been disciplined by the Lord Chancellor for discrimination, it emerged yesterday. Richard Page told colleagues behind closed doors that his Christian faith meant he believed that the child should be raised by a married mother and father, not by two men. The 68-year-old was reported to the judges' watchdog for alleged prejudice and has been reprimanded for serious misconduct. He has also been ordered to undergo equality training before he can sit as a magistrate again. The married father of three, who has been a magistrate in Kent for 15 years, said: 'My Christian faith informs me that children flourish best in a loving home with a married mum and dad. 'This is not a matter of prejudice or bigotry but is based on knowledge and evidence that I have applied when seeking the best interests for a lifetime of a vulnerable child.' But Mr Page was told his beliefs discriminated against same-sex couples and breached the Equality Act. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling and Lord Chief Justice Sir John Thomas issued Mr Page with a reprimand because he had been influenced by his religious beliefs and not by the evidence in the case.","Christian nurse Victoria Wasteney, 37, prayed with her ill Muslim co-worker .

"Victoria is set to introduce 'no jab, no play' legislation to ban unvaccinated children from attending childcare centres. The policy was successfully introduced in New South Wales in 2014 and Victoria's participation signals a progression in the nationwide effort to crack down on parents that reject vaccination. The state government have begun preparations and the legislation could potentially be finalised by as soon as early 2016, according to Health Minister Jill Hennessy. Scroll down for video . Victoria will introduce 'no jab, no play' laws to ban unvaccinated children from enrolling at childcare centres . The legislation was introduced in New South Wales in 2014 and are expected to be in place in Victoria by as early as 2016 . The government is passionate about these laws, with Ms Hennessy taking the tough stance in the hope parents understand that failing to vaccinate a child is 'unsafe' for both the child and any children they come in contact with, according to The Australian. According to the laws, preschools and day care centres have the right to prohibit children from attending if they have not been vaccinated. Parents who are conscientious objectors can only enrol their child if they have permission from a medical practitioner, who has given the parents counselling and made the parents aware of the inherent risk of failing to vaccinate their child. Children who are proven to be unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons are also exempt from the 'no jab, no play' laws. It has also been announced that whooping cough vaccines will be made free to all Victorian expectant parents once again, the state government says. Children who are  unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons are exempt from the 'no jab, no play' laws . Disease rates have jumped by more than 50 per cent in the last year with children under one the most affected by the increased rates. Premier Daniel Andrews met with new parents at Melbourne's Royal Women's Hospital on Sunday to announce the program which will provide free vaccines for women in their third trimester and parents of babies up to six months old. 'Parents will get the free whooping cough shots to protect them from giving to their children, unknowingly, what can be a deadly virus,' he told reporters. 'This will save lives.' A tender process will be carried out to source the vaccine, which is currently in a worldwide shortage. Health Minister Jill Hennessy said more than 80,000 Victorians would be vaccinated under the program. It has also been announced that whooping cough vaccines will be made free to all Victorian expectant parents once again . The program had previously been in place but was removed by the Liberal government in 2012. It will cost the government $8.4 million over four years and will be paid for through the scrapping of the Building Code and Construction Code Compliance Unit. Earlier this week, pro-vaccination campaigners took to social media to express their outrage over an anti-immunisation advocate's plans to come to Australian shores. Sherri Tenpenny, who has written books such as Saying No to Vaccines and Flu and Flu Vaccines: What's Coming Through That Needle?, will be touring in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sydney in February and March. The seminars are called Raising Healthy Children Naturally, and Birth, Baby and Beyond. Sherri Tenpenny, who has written books such as Saying No to Vaccines and Flu and Flu Vaccines: What's Coming Through That Needle?, will be touring Australia in February and March . People will also get the chance to sit down and have dinner with the high-profile anti-vaccination campaigner, with tickets ranging from $125 to $200. On her website, Dr Tenpenny writes she believes 'vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual' and is against 'a system that forces parents to inject their children, against their better judgment'. Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site, which read: 'I didn't deny my children vaccines... I spared them' and 'Fact: 1 in 50 = Autism Overall, Fact: 1 in 25,000 = Unvaccinated, Prove Me Wrong'. But Dr Tenpenny's visit have people so outraged they have vowed to write to local politicians to stop her from spreading her message, with Stop the AVN - a group who are for vaccines - leading the charge. The seminars are called Raising Healthy Children Naturally and Birth, Baby and Beyond, and will be held in Queensland, NSW, South Australia and Victoria . Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site . Stop the AVN's Dave Hawkes told Daily Mail Australia the group's concern was Dr Tenpenny 'peddled misinformation'. 'She's giving information that's not supported by evidence and marketing it to people with alternative views and possibly leaving them in danger by not vaccinating their young children,' he said. Dr Hawkes - who has a PhD in HIV research - said it was also concerning that people who were joining Dr Tenpenny, like Isaac Goldman, were spruiking homeopathic vaccines, which are 'essentially water'. 'The evidence shows they don't work… and leaves their kids susceptible,' Dr Hawkes said. 'Recently a seven-month-old child who was not vaccinated died from whooping cough.' One of Stop the AVN's supporters wrote on social media she was going to write to federal politicians asking for their intervention. 'I'm writing to the Hons Sussan Ley and Fiona Nash (health minister and assistant health minister). Vaccines are recommended by every state body in Australia. They are incentivised by our federal govt,' one woman said on Facebook. People have taken to social media to express their outrage, with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign . Some have even taken to the Facebook pages of venues slamming them for holding the events . While others have expressed their disgust on the social media pages of the venues holding the seminars. 'I am beyond disgusted that you are hosting an anti vaccination seminar in March... Children die each year in this country as a result of this misinformation, is the small amount of money you are going to get... worth it?' a Facebook user wrote on Melbourne's Bayview Eden page. Another wrote: 'Cannot believe you are hosting an anti vaccine seminar in March, disgusting. Never staying here, ever.' This comes after the Federal Court ruled against Homeopathy Plus, finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective, and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines, News Corp reported. National Centre of Immunisaiton Research and Surveillance director Peter McIntyre told Daily Mail Australia Dr Tenpenny was tapping into people's 'fear factor'. 'When we've got no disease to see, it's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it's something we still don't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated. You can understand why people would believe that,' he said. 'But there are hundreds of studies that disprove that.' Professor McIntyre added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases. He said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with 'sterile water'. 'It's just laughable really,' Professor McIntyre said.","Victoria plan to introduce the new legislation as soon as early 2016 .

"Smiling for the camera and enjoying time with her family, Edna Slann was a lively and happy grandmother. But a ten-week stay at one of Soondressen and Maleenee Cooppen’s nursing homes left the 89-year-old malnourished, badly bruised, scarred, and with an infection that will soon kill her. The widow – who has been given just weeks to live – is emaciated at little more than 5st, bed-ridden, and heavily medicated with morphine to numb the pain. Edna Slann is one of three residents left with unexplained injuries after moving into the care homes being investigated by police. The 89-year-old required stitches to her head and suffered horrific bruising . She is one of three patients whose unexplained injuries at Grantley Court Nursing Home in Sutton, south-west London, are now are under investigation by police. Her family believe her rapid decline was caused by the poor care she received at the home and branded the Care Quality Commission’s handling of the case a ‘disgrace’. Her daughter Linda Cackett, 54, told the Daily Mail: ‘To think of her suffering and in pain for those weeks is horrendous. We feel so guilty. 'Had she not gone to Grantley Court she would still be getting up today and taking part in activities. She could have gone on for years.’ Mrs Slann, who has dementia and was wheelchair bound due to arthritis, was moved from a residential home to Grantley Court in July when her health worsened. It is owned by Mauritian businessman Cooppen, 51, and his 42-year-old wife, who enjoyed lavish family parties in their homeland. Shocking: The widow has contracted a deadly infection after a bedsore went untreated while she was living at the home. Right, she is healthy before entering its care . According to Mrs Slann’s family, she was neglected from the outset and her health deteriorated rapidly, causing her to lose more than half a stone in just two months. Her daughter said Grantley Court staff did not keep records properly so she has had no explanation for how her mother came to need 12 stitches on her head and suffer severe facial bruising. Outraged: Mrs Slann's daughter Linda Cackett says she would not have arranged for her mother to stay in Grantley Court had she been aware of concerns . And she says her mother now has not long left to live because of an infected bedsore on her foot that was not treated properly. When she was eventually taken to hospital, doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg below the knee – an operation she was unlikely to survive. Mrs Cackett, a book keeper from Epsom in Surrey, said: ‘The home was run on a shoestring. 'I’m surprised any residents survived.’ Mrs Slann was placed there in July by Surrey County Council, who allegedly told the family it was the only bed they could find. The £595-a-week cost of her stay was met by Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). In September, NHS officials moved her to a different home where staff found the bedsore on her foot and sent her to hospital. When they called Grantley Court staff to confront them, they were allegedly told it was ‘not that bad’. Mrs Slann, a grandmother-of-one, worked as a cleaner until she was 70. A Surrey council spokesman said when Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court the home had passed its most recent inspection. A Surrey Downs CCG spokesman said she had been relocated as soon as concerns were raised.","Edna Slann was left with horrific bruising to her face and needed stitches .

"A mother accused of drowning and strangling her three young children two years ago has starved herself to death in prison before she could be tried for their murders. Sonia Blanchette, 35, allegedly killed her daughters Anaïs, two, and Laurélie, five, as well as her son Loïc, who was four years old, in a bath tub in her apartment after losing custody of them. They were found dead in Blanchette's apartment in Drummondville, near Montreal, Quebec, in December 2012. Coroners said Anaïs and Loïc drowned, while Laurélie, the eldest, died from strangulation and drowning. Murder trial: Sonia Blanchette, center, decided to kill herself rather than face a trial for allegedly drowning her three young children in the bath tub . Imminent: Blanchette was due to receive a trial date for the three murder charges the day after she died . Decision: The suspect was almost force fed by hospital bosses - but a legal challenge from her lawyer meant they let her die . 'Murdered by their mother': Blanchette's children (left to right) Laurélie, five, Anaïs, two and Loïc, four, were found dead in her Quebec apartment in December 2012 . She had lost custody of them to their father earlier in the year, and was only allowed to see them at weekends. Blanchette was charged with first degree murder and has been awaiting trial for more than two years - but according to lawyers she decided to starve herself to death rather than face a jury. According to the Globe and Mail, she decided to stop eating on the second anniversary of her children's death. Prison officials shipped her to a psychiatric facility, and had reportedly planned to keep her alive by force-feeding her through a tube - until her lawyer stopped them. Attorney Jean-Pierre Ménard said he intervened so Blanchette would be allowed to kill herself. Under Quebec law, anybody deemed mentally competent is allowed to refuse treatment of any kind. Grief: The children's father, Patrick Desautels (right) said he wishes Blanchette had stayed alive longer to think about her actions . He said: 'Over time she decided life didn’t have any more interest to her. She reflected for a long time on her condition, her prospects, and decided to put an end to her days.' 'Her biggest hope was to rejoin her children.' She died Thursday, the day before a date was to be set for her trial, where she stood accused of first-degree murder. Blanchette weighed just 80lbs when she died, according to the Montreal Gazette, Staff at the Sacré-Coeur Hospital in Montreal had reportedly sedated her so she would suffer less. The children's father, Patrick Desautels, said that he wishes Blanchette had stayed alive longer to face up to her actions - but admitted her death saved him the agony of a trial. He told Radio Canada: 'I don’t have to go through the trial. It wasn’t going to bring me anything. 'I would have liked her to have spent more time in prison having to think about what she had done. But she decided otherwise.'","Sonia Blanchette, 35, allegedly killed Anaïs, two, Laurélie, five, and Loïc, four .

South Hills High School teacher Melody Lippert, 38, met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente  in November of last year, CBS reports.

"Lena Dunham has issued a pre-emptive apology for suggesting the storm over Bill Cosby's rape allegations is as significant as the slaughter of millions of Jews. The actress and TV writer posted a message to her fans promoting an interview appearance - but also tried to defuse any potential rows over suggesting the alleged rapes carried out by the comedian are comparable to the Holocaust. Dunham, who is courting the limelight to draw attention to the new series of her hit HBO TV series Girls, made the comments while speaking to Time Out New York. Scroll down for video . Apology: Dunham said she shouldn't have compared the outrage of Bill Cosby's alleged rapes to the Holocaust, which killed some 11million people . Cover girl: Dunham, who has the new season of her show Girls to promote, made the questionable comments in an interview with Time Out New York . The questionable comments came in a segment which discussed Dunham's admiration for actor and director Judd Apatow, who has been a staunch critic of Cosby, who has had more than two dozen rape allegations levelled at him. Responding to the suggestion Apatow is 'obsessed' with the allegations, Dunham said no level of interest is too high for the Cosby situation, which of similar importance to Nazi crimes against humanity. She said: 'It’s sort of like saying someone’s obsessed with the Holocaust... This is a huge issue, and it speaks to the way that we abuse power and the way that celebrity allows for injustice.' Comparison: Dunham invoked the Holocaust to illustrate her point that no level of attention is too extreme for the Cosby situation. Pictured are female victims the Auschwitz death camp . She later retracted the sentiment in an Instagram post, which nonetheless mainly encouraged fans to read the piece.

"A gang of murderers may have lured their victim to his death in a Bronx apartment building by using Facebook. Ricardo Romero, 16, believed he was on his way to what he thought was a meeting with a 17-year-old girl identified on Facebook as 'Chiquita Andy' Friday night when he was attacked in the Creston Ave. building in Fordham Heights. He was stabbed in the left of his chest, hit in the head with a bottle, and had his wallet stolen as well as his cell phone. Ricardo Romero, 16, believed he was on his way to what he thought was a meeting with a 17-year-old girl identified on Facebook as 'Chiquita Andy' Friday night when he was jumped in the Creston Ave. building in Fordham Heights . He collapsed on E. 182nd St. where a witness flagged down police who called Romero an ambulance. Unfortunately it was too late, and he died at St. Barnabas Hospital less than 30 minutes later. His sister Viridiana Romero said: 'I was crying. I couldn't believe it.' The New York Daily News reports that the attack was captured by a surveillance camera. One building resident, Christian Juarez, has already been apprehended and charged with murder, robbery, and weapon possession. Held without bail, he has identified a man named 'Skip' as the one who stabbed Romero. 'I was going through the victim’s pockets, then Skip pulled out a knife from his back pocket and stabbed him two to three times in the torso,' Juarez is quoted in court papers. Romero collapsed outside the building on E. 182nd St. where a witness flagged down police who called Romero an ambulance . Juarez's girlfriend, Andy, said Skip was responsible for the violence. 'Christian had nothing to do with it,' she told the court Saturday. 'I told him to run. I ran.' Police have yet to confirm the identity of the woman they believe lured Ricardo in. She has been questioned but not charged. Juarez's mother denied her son was a criminal. 'Everything they're saying is a lie,' she said. 'He did not do anything.' One building resident, Christian Juarez, has already been apprehended and charged with murder, robbery, and weapon possession . Another man who was active in the robbery, 27-year-old Christopher Garcia, was held on $50,000 bail. Garcia told police he joined the group when Juarez told him about the planned robbery.

"A father and son have been arrested and charged with animal cruelty after they viciously beat their neighbor's German shepherd to death.

"David Cameron has criticised the Pope, insisting it is wrong to suggest that those who mock Islam and other religions could 'expect a punch'. In a highly-unusual move, the Prime Minister put himself at odds with the Pontiff, insisting someone who is offended does not have the right to 'wreak vengeance'. The Pope caused anger last week when he suggested people 'cannot insult the faith of others', adding that he would punch someone if they offended his mother, as he debated freedom of speech in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack. Scroll down for videos . The hand of God: Speaking on board the Papl flight, Pope Francis Pope Francis said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not 'provoke' Pope Francis said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not 'provoke' The Pontiff said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not purposely anger religious people. Speaking on board the papal plane on his way to the Philippines, he also insisted that it was an 'aberration' to kill in the name of God and that religion can never be used to justify violence. By way of example, Pope Francis referred to Alberto Gasparri, who organises papal trips and was standing by his side aboard the papal plane. 'If my good friend Dr Gasparri says a curse word against my mother, he can expect a punch,' Francis said, throwing a pretend punch his way. 'It's normal. You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others. You cannot make fun of the faith of others.' Following the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, many people have defended the satirical magazine for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. But the Pope said there was a limit to free speech when it concerned offending someone's religious beliefs. He said: 'There are so many people who speak badly about religions or other religions, who make fun of them, who make a game out of the religions of others. 'They are provocateurs. And what happens to them is what would happen to Dr Gasparri if he says a curse word against my mother. There is a limit.' However, Mr Cameron insisted that in an open society, freedom of speech as paramount. In his interview with on US TV's Face the Nation, recorded during his visit to Washington last week, Mr Cameron said: 'I think in a free society, there is a right to cause offence about someone's religion. 'I'm a Christian; if someone says something offensive about Jesus, I might find that offensive, but in a free society I don't have a right to wreak vengeance on them. 'We have to accept that newspapers, magazines, can publish things that are offensive to some, as long as it's within the law. That is what we should defend.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also argued that there is not right to not be offended. Speaking in the wake of the Paris attacks, Mr Clegg told LBC radio: 'There can be no excuse, no reason, no explanation - they have killed cartoonists who have done nothing more than draw drawings which they so happen to find offensive. ""At the end of the day, in a free society people have to be free to offend each other. 'You cannot have freedom unless people are free to offend each other. We have no right not to be offended. That fundamental principle of being free to offend people…is exactly what was under threat by these murderous barbarians.'","Pope said there are limits to free speech and people shouldn't 'provoke'

The pair were driving to Alice Springs so Karlee-May could catch a flight back to Queensland and return to school after the holidays. Northern Territory police raised the alarm on January 9 when they had not been heard from after two days. But drawing from her Girl Guides training, Ms Reiss and Karlee-May survived the 10-kilometre hike from their stranded vehicle by sipping water off gum leaves and finding an aerosol can on the side of the road to light their fires at night. The mother was a Girl Guide and used that experience to survive, drinking water off gum leaves . The mother told NT News she and her daughter got little shut-eye on the first night as they were 'petrified by the dark'. 'But as soon as daylight came through [after the first night] I said to Karlee ""Right, go and get that deodorant"", and she replied with ""Mum you’re never going to light a fire"",' Ms Reiss said. 'I said ""mate, I’m a Girl Guide from way back"" - and I sprayed the can and lit it.' But Ms Reiss advised people against lighting a fire in this fashion as 'they could blow their heads off'. Adding to their terror, the pair said a wild bull started tracking them for about three kilometres of their trek. 'By this stage we had a huge bull that was following us, zig-zagging back and forth across the road and occasionally letting out a loud ""moo"",' Ms Reiss said. As for keeping their energy up, they came pretty close to eating bugs if they had not been found on the third day of their trek. 'There is sugar on gum leaves so we got some energy from that, but if worse came to worse we would have been eating the grasshoppers.'

"Decorated: Nick Irving was nicknamed 'The Reaper' by his fellow soldiers for his skill as a sniper . A sniper has told how he was given the nickname 'The Reaper' by his comrades in the military - after killing 33 men in less than four months. Former Army Ranger Nick ‘Irv’ Irving using his trusty SR-25 rifle he nicknamed ‘Dirty Diana’ to blast insurgents to death during the Iraq War. He was so possessive over ‘his girl’ as he called the gun, that he hated it when other men touched her and would spend four hours a night painting her. Before every battle he would get pumped up to the sounds of men zipping their gear up with Velcro, which he likened to music being played to a high school football team. Irving was trained to become a sniper by his superiors who told him that it was the biggest thrill of your life and that 'once you kill a man, you can’t replace that feeling.' He has told of his career in a book published just weeks after the release of ‘American Sniper’, the film about the life of Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in American history. The movie, which stars Bradley Cooper as Kyle, tells how Kyle shot dead 255 enemies before being killed by a fellow Army veteran suffering from PTSD. In Irving’s memoir, extracts of which were published in the New York Post, he tells how he became the first black sniper in the Army’s Third Ranger Battalion, which had previously fought in the ‘Black Hawk Down’ incident in Somalia. He was the son of two enlisted soldiers in Fort Meade, Maryland, but didn’t want to be in the Army until he got curious about weapons as a teenager. He built himself a blowgun and eventually signed up, serving tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. During his training his platoon sergeant told him: ‘After you kill a man, there’s no other feeling like it. Mark my words. Skilled shooter: Irving killed 33 insurgents in lass than four months during the Iraq War. He now runs a training site in San Antonio, Texas . His weapon: The Army Ranger nicknamed his SR-25 rifle 'Dirty Diana'. A view of the same model of gun above . ‘You won’t want to do any hunting again. The excitement of that will be gone. You won’t find any joy in it. Once you kill a man, you can’t replace that feeling.’ Memories: Irving released his memoir (book cover above) about his sniper days just a few weeks after the debut of film American Sniper, which follows the life of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history . Irving’s first kill came outside of Ramallah when he was on the .50 caliber machine gun in a convoy of Stryker armored vehicles. A car drove past them, stopped and drove towards them at speed. Irving’s supervisor said: ‘Take him out’. Irving writes that he fired seven rounds and said: ‘I saw something explode inside the car. It wasn’t an IED, it was the man inside it. He turned into mist and chunks.’ His comrades shouted ‘Yeah!’ and ‘Get Some’. Irving was stunned that it could be that easy but writes that he was haunted what he had done that later that night the man he shot ‘returned to me’ in a nightmare. He writes: ‘I had a dream where I was in a room with a ceiling fan spinning above me. ‘The blades of the fan were the man’s four limbs plus his head and chest. He was staring at me with that same dead-eyed stare, but as the fan spun faster and faster, he started screaming at me open-mouthed. ‘Eventually the fan got spinning so fast that his limbs were whipped off and he sprayed the room with blood and guts, covering me as well with gelatinous goo.’ According to Irving, the tiniest thing can scupper a sniper’s shot including having the wrong ladder. He had a telescoping ladder and recounts how on one occasion he had to put it near vertical to get him high enough to see the target from the top. After shooting the man dead - he turned out to be a suicide bomber - his supervisor told him: . The first: Irving became the first black sniper of the Army's Third Ranger Battalion. The battalion previously fought in the Battle of Mogadishu, also known as Black Hawk Down . ‘The hollow point expanded and pushed everything up and out of his chest. ‘His heart was hanging there on the outside of his body cavity, still pumping a couple of times, spraying the tree and leaves.’ Irving is his most poetic when talking about what it’s like to actually pull the trigger. He writes: ‘I squeezed the trigger and experienced that slow-motion effect. ‘The smell of the gas burning out of the suppressor mixed with the sweet smell of the gun oil I use. My eye still focused on the crosshairs in the center of the scope, I watched as the man collapsed, almost as if he were a balloon being popped.’ And speaking about his love of Velcro, he said: ‘I don’t know what the military did before it was invented. Hearing 35 or so guys strapping stuff on with that simple hook and loop mechanism, the sound of tape being unrolled as guys secure things to keep as silent as possible, was like the music we’d play in the locker room (in high school) before a game to get pumped up. That collective sound signaled that we all had each other’s back.’ Nightmares: Irving says he now sleeps with a pistol under his pillow or on the nightstand next to his wife Jessica . Irving, who now runs a training site in San Antonio and blogs on special forces website sofrep.com, said that he was not the same after the war and once stole a bottle of gatorade from a supermarket without realizing. He also still sleeps with a pistol under his pillow or on a nightstand next to his wife, Jessica. Irving’s life mirrors that of Kyle who before his death in 2013 notched up his record number of kills during the Iraq war. He became so feared by insurgents they put a $80,000 bounty on his head and nicknamed him al-Shaitan Ramad, or ‘the Devil of Ramadi’. In one battle alone he shot dead 40 enemy soldiers although his greatest achievement was his longest kill - from a staggering 1.2 miles away. Kyle told of his incredible career in his memoir called ‘American Sniper’ which became a bestseller and became the basis for the film of his life, which premiered posthumously.","Nick 'Irv' Irving was the first black sniper in the Army's Third Ranger Battallion .

"This is the £3.7 million central London mews house thought to be where a 17-year-old 'sex slave' alleges she had sex with Prince Andrew. The three-storey home is reportedly owned by G­hislaine Maxwell, a friend of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and is believed to be one of the three locations where Virginia Roberts, now 30, claims she was forced to have sex with the royal. Roberts, now a married mother-of-three, claimed in US civil court documents that she had sex with the Duke of York three times while she was a minor under US law. This is the £3.7 million central London mews house owned by Ghislaine Maxwell (right) which is thought to be where a 17-year-old 'sex slave' alleges she had sex with Prince Andrew . She claims she was introduced to the Prince at Maxwell's home in central London in 2001, and claims that she had sex with him there after they returned from a party at private members' club Tamp. Roberts is said to have been 'procured' for him by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire American financier, who she accuses of using her as a 'sex slave'. Maxwell, 53, was also accused in the legal papers, filed in Florida, of acting as a 'madame' and supplying young girls for Epstein and her friends. One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Maxwell looks on. Virginia Roberts (right) claims she was introduced to the Prince at Maxwell's home in central London in 2001 . The Duke, 54, vehemently denies the allegations against him. Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, has also denied the claims. It is believed that the house, bought by Maxwell in 1997, is now being rented out. Neighbours told the Sunday Mirror they were unaware of anything untoward occurring there, but one said she had seen Andrew and two of his protection officers in the street several years ago. 'I’ve no idea where he was going. They were walking quickly,' she said. A spokesman for Maxwell did not comment on the house. Roberts, a US citizen, waived her anonymity in an interview with The Mail On Sunday in 2011, in which she claimed she had been sexually exploited by Epstein - a former friend of the Duke. Jeffrey Epstein (left) was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution. Roberts claims the billionaire American financier used her as a 'sex slave' In the court papers filed last month, she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein where an orgy took place. Roberts wants to join an existing lawsuit, launched by two other alleged Epstein victims, against federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's case. In a strongly-worded statement Buckingham Palace has said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. 'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' Others named in the lawsuit have also denied the claims. Epstein was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution but lawyers for the women claim a secret plea deal he struck with prosecutors granting him, and any potential co-conspirators, immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights. The Duke's royal engagement is due to take place on January 21, when he is set to appear at the World Economic Forum at Davos, in Switzerland. It is thought he will speak publicly about the claims, denying the allegations levelled against him.

"Prince Andrew has enlisted the help of one of Britain's top defence barristers after being accused of sleeping with an under-age 'sex slave', the Mail has learned. The Duke of York faces extraordinary claims – which he strongly denies – that he had sex with a 17-year-old American girl who was being paid by his friend, the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This week, he will attend the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, his first public appearance since the allegations by Virginia Roberts in a US lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Damning allegations: Andrew was photographed with his hand around the waist of Virginia Roberts in 2001 . The Duke of York has enlisted the help of QC William Clegg (pictured), nicknamed the 'grandfather of the bar' It is thought he may use a televised address at the summit to address the claims directly – although aides insist he simply wants to 'get on with it' after the scandal. But the fifth in line to the throne has quietly consulted the eminent QC William Clegg, nicknamed the 'grandfather of the bar'. Mr Clegg is understood to be reading papers handed to him by the duke's team on Friday, January 8. It is not known what he has been asked to do or who is paying the bill, if any. But it raises the possibility that Andrew is preparing for some sort of legal fightback. American Alan Dershowitz, one of Epstein's lawyers who Miss Roberts claims also had sex with her, is counter-suing and has issued a detailed rebuttal. He has suggested the duke do the same. Andrew will travel to Davos, in Switzerland, on Thursday before making a defiant public address at the annual drinks reception he holds at the conference. The 54-year-old has refused to cancel his plans and, unusually, will reportedly face a TV camera. Normally his drinks event receives little media attention, but this year officials have been forced to plan how to manage large numbers of journalists. The palace last night refused to comment on the suggestion that Andrew would issue an outright denial of the claims. His decision to attend has drawn criticism from some, including former Home Office minister Norman Baker. The Liberal Democrat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It may have been more prudent . . . for him not to have gone. He may have taken that decision himself. When MPs go abroad, or ministers, or indeed the Queen, we know exactly what role they are undertaking. We don't know with Andrew.' Prince Andrew was spotted leaving his chalet with his daughter Eugenie after holidaying in Verbier . Prince Andrew, left, has been dragged into the controversy surrounding Epstein. The two are pictured together in Central Park, in New York . The Duke of York is meeting his own travel and accommodation costs for the visit to Davos, although his police bodyguards are funded by the taxpayer. This is unlikely to appease critics of his jet-set lifestyle since the duke, dubbed 'Air Miles Andy', still racks up more air travel than any other royal, four years after he stood down from his role as UK trade ambassador over his links to Epstein and other controversial figures. Luxury: Chalet Eugenia in Klosters . The World Economic Forum's meeting in Davos is an incredibly exclusive – and expensive – event, with the average cost of attending reportedly about £26,400. Guests are advised where to land their private jets and given contact details for the forum's official helicopter carrier. Heads of state mingle with bankers, chief executives and academics. Buckingham Palace said Prince Andrew was meeting the costs himself. However, the duke has no income of his own. During the 2012 conference, he lodged in the nearby resort of Klosters, a favourite ski destination of the royals for many years. He stayed in Chalet Eugenia, which rents for as much as £39,000 a week. He said some of the duke's friends were 'not [what] someone representing Britain ought to be having'. Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader, said it was a time for 'discretion rather than distraction', while Katy Clark, Willie Bain and Ann McKechin, Labour MPs on the Commons business committee, are said to have suggested that he stay away. Republic, which campaigns for an alternative to the monarchy, said last night: 'Regardless of the truth of the allegations, his association with Epstein and others has made his position untenable.' But Lord Digby Jones, former head of the CBI and Labour minister, said he should go, adding: 'This guy has done nothing until someone proves he has. To my knowledge no one has charged him with anything.' Mr Clegg, whose website says he is a specialist in 'white collar fraud', represented Vincent Tabak, who was jailed for life for killing Joanna Yeates in Bristol in December 2010. He also acted for Lord Edward Somerset, the Duke of Beaufort's son, who admitted beating his wife. Andrew emphatically denies any sexual relations with Miss Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's 'sex slave' from 1999 to 2002 and was 'forced to have sexual relations with this prince' in London, New York and a Caribbean island. Buckingham Palace has issued two denials on behalf of the duke, calling the claims 'categorically untrue'. He has yet to comment personally and has spent much of this month keeping a low profile at Royal Lodge, his home in Windsor. He is understood to be working on his speech, which will be largely aimed at promoting UK business. 'He may, briefly, address some of the issues we have seen aired in recent weeks, but claims that it will be a major televised rebuttal of what has been alleged are very overblown,' a source said. The Mail understands Andrew will stay on after the reception to attend scheduled sessions on Friday as part of a 'business as usual strategy'. 'He has work to do and wants to get on with it,' the source said. 'That's not to say he hasn't been chastened by what has happened. He has openly acknowledged his enormous error of judgment over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.' Mr Clegg declined to comment.

"There's a saying that a penny saved is a penny earned. That was certainly true for one Texas man who saved all of his pennies over a staggering 65 years and had a collection of 81,600 pennies worth $816. Ira Keys, 81, had been saving his pennies for nearly seven decades and finally decided to cash them in at a bank in Slaton, Texas. Thrifty: Ira Keys, 81, had saved his pennies for nearly seven decades and finally decided to cash them in . Heavy: His collection weighed in at around 500 pounds and nearly 'broke the springs' on his pick-up truck . Count: Bank staff carefully counted every single penny and said it was unlike anything they'd seen before . Keys said his penny-saving obsession begun after his father encouraged him to save his money when he was a young man and some were saved when he was just 17-years-old. He told KCBD-TV: '[My dad] says, 'Whatever you do son, save your money.' Keys said: 'Back when I started in '52, I didn't have a lot of money, so I saved pennies and I just kept saving them.' His collection weighed a whopping 500 pounds and Keys joked that he nearly 'broke the springs on his pickup truck' while he hauled them into the bank. Bank staff at Prosperity Bank took more than an hour to count the pennies which were piled high in coffee containers. Kari Lewis, a personal banker at Prosperity Bank, told KCBD that Keys' collection of pennies was unlike anything she has ever seen before. 'You see them on the ground and you're kind of like, 'Oh, I'm not picking that up,' but for him to collect it for years and years was pretty amazing,' she said. Keys admits that he still has a ton of pennies left at home which he kept and did not cash in and he already has a plan for what he's going to do with them .

'I'm going to build a room divider and have pennies all in it,' he said, 'the shiny ones.' But the 81-year-old is still holding on to his father's valuable lesson about saving. He says he will keep his piggy bank full. 'It's just a habit I've got into, and habits are hard to break sometimes,' Keys said, 'but I don't think I'll have this many when I cash them in again.' He also believes that his father would have been annoyed that he'd cashed in his stash.

Asya then used life-sized models in order to craft her stunning, exaggerated forms from plain sheets of white paper.

Speaking to Pixable, Asya revealed that she chose to use paper as her medium as she believes as a material it is extremely versatile. She said: 'I see great potential in paper. It is a way to translate ideas and largely... for me, it is also a metaphor of life and art.' The Russian-born artist chose not to use colour in her work as she believed it would be too much of a distraction . Asya continued to say that although paper has huge potential it does cause certain problems when it comes to photographing the models. 'There were technical difficulties in the process of shooting models because they were not able to sit down. 'Crumpled paper cannot be restored and the shoot took about five hours.' The artist added that she also had concerns about misrepresenting a country that she shared such a passion for. She said: 'Another difficulty was that I did not know how to react to Mongolians if they were to see my own rendition of their cultural costumes. What if I hurt somebody?

"A woman is alleging two New York cops plied her with alcohol and one attempted to grope her despite the fact that she was an alleged rape victim. The woman, from Seattle, Washington, described how NYPD officers Lukasz Skorzewski and Lt. Adam Lamboy flew across the country and bought her endless rounds of drinks to sleep with her. She alleges the drunken night out ended with Skorzewski taking her back to the Embassy Suites hotel in Bellevue, where he tried to tear off her clothes and grope her. Allegations: The unnamed woman, from Seattle, Washington, is alleging two NYPD officers Lukasz Skorzewski and Lt. Adam Lamboy flew across the country and plied her with rounds of drinks . Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, left, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media . Both policemen have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media. But the allegations from an interview with The New York Daily News reveal a shocking level of misconduct. She  began the fateful day by having lunch with Skorzewski, a married father of two, at a Seattle restaurant called the Skillet Diner where he spent time asking questions about her rape case. She was then taken to the Pier 58 tourist area to meet Lamboy. She told The New York Daily News: 'Looking back, it was totally naive of me to join them. But I was like, 'This is really cool.' I really looked up to them.' 'Luke was actually the one who said, 'I don't know if you're going to be able to come because we're going to be drinking. 'But when I dropped him off, the lieutenant was the one who said, 'Oh, no, you should stay, come on,' she recalled. 'I was going through this all alone. My family didn't know,' she said. 'It felt good that they were being so nice.' Pub: The accuser claimed Skorzewski had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol . They then went to Paddy Coyne's Irish Pub, but Skorzewski was so drunk that servers refused to give him any more alcohol. Later, they headed to Cha Cha Lounge in Capitol Hill and then moved on to Unicorn, with the cops flashing their badges to cut the line. She said that she attempted to leave at around midnight, but they begged her to stay. They even pleaded with her to call in sick to her job as a Starbucks barista the next morning. She was drunk and unable to drive, so she went with them after they assured her that she would be safe if she stayed with them at their hotel. They  took her back to their hotel room at the Embassy Suites hotel in nearby Bellevue, Washington. Once there, Skorzewski loaned her some clothes and slept on the couch, she said. But when they woke up with hangovers, Skorzewski climbed in bed with her as they watched TV and  asked to put his arm around her. She claims he said: 'I really want to kiss you right now.' He also wanted to 'feel her up.' She describes how he tried to work his way into her pants to tear them off but she pushed his hand away. The next day, both policemen visited her at Starbucks and promised to stay in touch. She said Skorzewski called her almost daily from New York for a month but the calls soon stopped, and she was 'crushed.' She quizzed him about why he had become distant in an e-mail but he became angry suggesting that she had screwed up his personal life. She later saw Skorzewski in New York in October 2013 for a 'call' to the man who allegedly attacked her at a Union Square apartment in January of that year. But the man was never charged. Skorzewski soon stopped returning her calls altogether, so she  sent a letter to a family friend in the NYPD which led to a call from the Internal Affairs Bureau. She told Internal affairs what happened and gave them evidence, including photos from the boozy night out, text messages and phone records which showed two-hour long calls with Skorzewski.

"They are probably not the names of shows you would expect to see at the top of a complaints list. But Tom & Jerry, Blue Peter, Tweenies and Rastamouse are among the most complained about children’s shows that have ever been reported to the media watchdog. Figures released to MailOnline following Freedom of Information requests to Ofcom reveal an unlikely list of shows for young viewers which caused controversy over the past decade. Impressing a female cat: Tom & Jerry came top with 82 complaints relating to two episodes which were accused of glamorising the use of cigarettes and cigars in the cat and mouse cartoon . Cartoon complaints: In one episode Tom's tennis opponent was seen smoking a big cigar. The episodes Texas Tom and Tennis Chumps had aired on digital channel Boomerang in 2006 . Dr Ranjit Singh: The second-most complained about show was Get Well Soon on CBeebies, which attracted 65 complaints from viewers who claimed it breached 'generally accepted standards' Others in the top ten of these programmes were CBeebies show Get Well Soon, ITV1’s Bratz and My Parents Are Aliens and the BBC’s Children’s Party at the Palace. The figures measure the most complained about episodes that Ofcom has recorded in its history. Tom & Jerry came top with 82 complaints relating to two episodes which were accused of glamorising the use of cigarettes and cigars in the cat and mouse cartoon. But rather than being directly about the programme, most of the complaints were about Ofcom’s decision to actually investigate the cartoons. This included claims it had been over the top and it smacked of the ‘nanny state’. The row had been sparked by an original complaint that the portrayal had been inappropriate for children. The episodes Texas Tom and Tennis Chumps had aired on digital channel Boomerang in 2006. The scenes had shown Tom trying to impress a female cat by rolling up a cigarette. More than 200 complaints: In third place was the infamous case of the BBC airing an impersonation of paedophile Jimmy Savile on CBeebies in January 2013 - which led the broadcaster to issue an apology . Too much? Fourth on Ofcom’s list of most controversial children’s shows was Blue Peter, relating to scenes showing the execution of a goat, which was being slaughtered in Oman during a religious festival in 2007 . US show: Bratz (file picture) on ITV1 was fifth on the list with 13 complaints after it had contained the word ‘spaz’ in one of its episodes in 2006 which viewers branded 'deeply offensive' and 'derogatory' In the other episode Tom’s tennis opponent was seen smoking a big cigar. Ofcom, at the time, claimed the complaint had been resolved. The second-most complained about show was Get Well Soon on CBeebies, which attracted 65 complaints from viewers who claimed it breached ‘generally accepted standards’. This was relating to a discussion in November 2012 held by Dr Ranjit Singh on the MMR jab - with some viewers who disagreed with it complaining that the statements were misleading and harmful. However, Ofcom assessed the complaints and decided not to investigate. The BBC said at the time that it was ‘entirely appropriate to include MMR in the series to help demystify the actual process and combat any fears that young children may have about needles or injections’. In third place was the infamous case of the BBC airing an impersonation of paedophile Jimmy Savile on CBeebies in January 2013 - which led the broadcaster to issue an apology. Ofcom received 21 complaints - while the BBC had more than 200 - after showing a 2001 episode of the Tweenies featuring a character sporting a blond wig and a gold necklace, who did a convincing impression of the disgraced star’s Yorkshire accent. Fourth on Ofcom’s list of most controversial children’s shows was Blue Peter. But it was not due to the revelations about competition fakery in 2007 - and rather scenes showing the execution of a goat, which was being slaughtered in Oman during a religious festival in the same year. These sparked 14 complaints to the regulator, which said it had been ‘resolved‘. The show filmed the animal’s agonised death throes as part of coverage of a village preparing for its Eid ul-Fitr. US kids’ show Bratz on ITV1 was fifth on the list with 13 complaints after it had contained the word ‘spaz’ in one of its episodes in 2006 which viewers branded ‘deeply offensive‘ and ‘derogatory‘ and had been used as an insult. The TV watchdog once again said the matter had been resolved. Children's BBC show: Rastamouse, about a Rastafarian mouse, came under fire in 2011 for the way it ‘stereotyped black people’ and because of the ‘patois’ language used on the show . ITV show My Parents Are Aliens (file picture) had two entries in the top ten - for causing religious offence and concerns over bad language, and for sparking concerns about derogatory language about mental health . Children’s BBC show Rastamouse was in sixth, although it had the same number of complaints. Rastamouse, about a Rastafarian mouse, came under fire in 2011 for the way it ‘stereotyped black people’ and because of the ‘patois’ language used on the show. It attracted 13 complaints when the show first aired, but this led to 200 further complaints over the following months. ITV show My Parents Are Aliens had two entries in the top ten - at number seven for causing religious offence and concerns over bad language in 2006 and in ninth place for an episode in 2004 which sparked concerns about derogatory language about mental health among other concerns. These received ten complaints and nine complaints respectively. BBC1’s Children’s Party at the Palace, held in honour of the Queen’s 80th birthday in June 2006, had seen complaints after fake news flash confused people. The broadcaster had claimed a major incident had taken place during the live TV show from Buckingham Palace. This was revealed to be the pretend loss of the Queen’s handbag, which was meant to be part of the show. There were also complaints about Jonathan Ross’s presenting on the show. It attracted nine complaints and was eighth on the list.The BBC's then-head of television news Peter Horrocks later apologised for 'for anyone who was momentarily misled'. Sophie Raworth and Huw Edwards: BBC1’s Children’s Party at the Palace, held in honour of the Queen’s 80th birthday in June 2006, had sparked complaints after fake news flash confused people . Also in the top ten: Complaints were made about swearing on daytime MTV show My Super Sweet 16 in 2006 . Complaints about swearing on a daytime MTV show called My Super Sweet 16 from 2006 completed the top ten. Islam week on Newsround in January 2005 contributed to complaints about CBBC, which put it just outside the top ten, with eight complaints. In 14th place was Fireman Sam which sparked complaints after the show’s hero extinguished an electrical fire with water, which it was claimed sent out an ‘incorrect safety message’ to young children watching. Overall there have been more than 1,100 complaints about children’s programmes since Ofcom was formed in late December 2003. But the real figures for many of the show could be much higher. The figures do not include the complaints made directly to the broadcasters, which in the case of well-known channels such as BBC1, BBC2 and ITV, could see complaints in total being significantly more than Ofcom’s results. An Ofcom spokesman told MailOnline: ‘All UK broadcasters must adhere to the Broadcasting Code which sets standards for the content of TV programmes. We assess all complaints and programmes against the code. ‘The protection of under 18s from inappropriate material is a fundamental concern for Ofcom. There are clear broadcasting rules designed to protect children, which we actively enforce. ‘We recently issued new guidance on the TV watershed, warning broadcasters to be more careful about programmes they show before 9pm that could be unsuitable for children. ‘We constantly monitor audience attitudes and our research shows that the vast majority of adults believe the current level of TV regulation is about right.’","Programmes feature in Ofcom top ten list of complaints since 2004 .
Others include Bratz, My Super Sweet 16 and My Parents are Aliens .
Tom & Jerry is top with 82 complaints over episodes with smoking .
But most complaints were about Ofcom's decision to investigate .
Other complaints relate to Jimmy Savile impersonation on Tweenies .
Goat slaughtered in Oman on Blue Peter also attracted complaints ."
"Thousands of Eurostar passengers are stranded again for a second day after a power outage was claimed to have brought the Channel Tunnel to a halt. Travellers were hoping to take journeys they abandoned yesterday after the route was shut  by a lorry fire, causing chaos and triggering compensation bills running into the millions. But just as services were back up and running, 11 more Eurostar trains with room for up to 8,000 people were cancelled. Eurostar appeared to blame operator Eurotunnel - which issued a heated denial. Cancelled: Another 11 Eurostar trains have been cancelled after the firm claimed there was a problem with the overhead power supply inside the Channel Tunnel which led to it being shut for two hours . Dispute: Eurostar appeared to blame Eurotunnel, which operates the route - but Eurotunnel denied it had experienced any power problems when called by MailOnline. 'No, we haven't,' said a spokesman . Trains were already only running through one of the twin tunnels today, while firefighters inspected possible damage to the other from yesterday's lorry fire. That meant trains were having to run close together in batches in one direction before the line was cleared for a batch running in the opposite direction. Eurostar said the only available tunnel had to be closed for two hours this morning after 'Eurotunnel experienced new power supply problems'. But a Eurotunnel spokesman told MailOnline: 'No, we haven't. We've been running single-line services throughout the day as we said we would. '[For Eurostar] there were issues with having to manage the timetable. As far as our business is concerned we said we would run single-line services throughout the day. We have done that and we continue to do that. 'The media are trying to create another event, another disruption, to services in the Channel Tunnel.' Eurostar, however, stuck to its version of events - saying it believed the  problem involved overhead power lines inside the tunnel itself. Queues: More than 100 stranded Eurostar passengers queued from 6am at London's St Pancras station today as they tried to rebook onto a train today. Many services were full as priority was given to previous bookings . Waiting around: Thousands of passengers were again left stranded in the St Pancras terminal today . Eurotunnel operates the tunnel itself and runs Le Shuttle, a car and freight service, through it. It is true that the firm's timetable has not been disrupted today, because it was not running to a published timetable in the first place. Instead passengers were told to turn up at their pre-booked time, to be put on the first available train. At one point there was a five-hour wait, according to Eurotunnel's website, up from a predicted 90 minutes this morning. By 5pm Eurotunnel passengers still faced a three-and-a-half hour wait for a train in Folkestone and a five-and-a-half hour wait in Calais. Six Eurostar trains from London, two from Paris and three from Brussels were cancelled today. The cancelled departures from London St Pancras were the 2.04pm, 3.31pm, 5.04pm, 6.04pm, 6.31pm and 8.04pm. The firm admitted some stranded passengers could face a second night away from home - with official advice being to avoid London's St Pancras station altogether and book for another day. A spokesman said: 'Eurotunnel experienced new power supply problems this morning which meant that both tunnels were again closed for two hours. 'This closure was a separate incident, unrelated to the problems experienced yesterday.' French couple Etienne and Charlie Soren - whose train was cancelled yesterday - rebooked onto the today's 5.04pm  only to find it, too, had been wiped from the schedule. 'We made five phone calls yesterday to get places, but now we are told we have to start the process again because our train has been cancelled,' said Mr Soren, 35. 'I have never experienced anything like this. It is a disaster. Spending one more night here was okay, it was the weekend, luckily we could afford another night. 'Now we have come from the hotel with all of our luggage and baby things expecting to get on a train and they just say there is absolutely no way we are getting on another train. 'Now we have to spend money on a hotel. Flights would cost us hundreds of euros and we would have to wait until Eurostar decides to refund us. They should pay for our bills. 'I do not believe that they can't just put more trains on into the night. They say the service stops at 8pm - that is ridiculous. How are all these people ever going to get home?' Calm after the storm: The scene at 8.30am beyond the check-in terminals as those stranded headed home . Eurostar strongly advised passengers to come in person only if they were booked on a specific seat, with all trains delayed by up to an hour as one of the twin tunnels remained shut. More than 100 people defied advice to queue up at London's St Pancras station from 6am to exchange yesterday's tickets, only to be told the next train was full. But later the terminal at St Pancras was quiet as others appeared to have heeded advice not to turn up without a new booking. Staff insisted more services would be running tomorrow, with engineering works planned to take place overnight to make more sections of the tunnel functioning again. 'Eurostar plans to run a full service and passengers are advised to check-in as normal. 'As Eurotunnel will not be completely operational Eurostar services may be subject to delays of up to about 30 minutes.,' a spokesman said. But the company is facing a compensation bill running into the millions for the widespread disruption over the past two days. Aside from the cost of refunding tickets and laying on an extra service at 8am today, it was offering passengers £250 - £50 for meals, £50 for taxis and £150 for a London hotel. One passenger, photographer and musician Laurent Fritz, said: 'I arrived at St Pancras at 6:20am. There were around 150 people waiting to exchange tickets, but the service opened at 7am. Chaos: Thousands of Eurostar passengers faced queues yesterday for refunds and compensation . Which Eurostar trains are cancelled today? London to Brussels 14:04 train 9136 . London to Paris 15:31 train 9036 . London to Brussels 17:04 train 9148 . London to Brussels 18:04 train 9152 . London to Paris 18:31 train 9048 . London to Brussels 20:04 train 9162 . Brussels to London 15:56 train 9145 . Paris to London 16:43 train 9045 . Brussels to London 17:56 train 9153 . Paris to London 18:43 train 9053 . Brussels to London 18:56 train 9157 . Will other trains run? Yes. Eurostar trains were leaving up to an hour late while Eurotunnel passengers faced waits of up to five hours, which later reduced. Eurostar bookings for today . Anyone who was already booked on a train for today (Sunday) will not lose their seat, unless it's on one of the cancelled services. Turn up as normal half an hour before departure. Eurostar bookings from yesterday, or bookings cancelled today . Passengers need to refund their ticket or exchange it for another one. Passengers should call 03432 186 186 and are 'strongly advised' against going to the station in person. How to claim compensation . Those stranded can claim £50 per night for taxis, £50 for meals and £150 for a London hotel. Receipts can be presented to Eurostar in person or in the post to claim the money back. Eurotunnel bookings . Customers were offered a transfer to a ferry yesterday. If still stranded they should turn up today to exchange their ticket. 'At 7.30am they told us that the first train from St Pancras to Paris was full, so they added a new train with 800 seats for all passengers that couldn't leave London yesterday. 'They were saying the train would leave at 9.05am.' Services resumed on Eurotunnel at 2.45am UK time from Britain and 4.30am French time from France. Empty trains were sent through the tunnel to ensure it was clear and customers were being offered transfers to ferries until the service restarted. Previous delays on the car and lorry shuttle have forced Kent Police to implement Operation Stack, lining up thousands of vehicles along the M20 motorway as they wait for a departure. A spokesman said: 'It's always in place ready to go but we are not expecting to have to do it today.' One witness claimed passengers were given gas masks yesterday after two of the north tunnel's carbon dioxide alarms sounded at the French end just before noon. A 'smouldering load' was found on board a truck which was being carried in one of the vehicle shuttles, and although the fire was not serious the tunnel is still being checked for damage. Huge queues built up at St Pancras as services were cancelled and similar scenes were reported in Paris, with many holidaymakers forced to look for alternative transport or hotels. A Eurostar spokesman said: 'As Eurotunnel has advised us that its north tunnel will remain closed all day, Eurostar services will be subject to delays of between 30 and 60 minutes. 'All passengers who are booked to travel today (Sunday 18 January) should check-in as normal half an hour before departure. 'Services are already very busy and availability is limited. If you were on a cancelled train and need to travel urgently, please call our contact centre on 03432 186 186  and we will try to re-book you on a service departing after 12.00 (GMT). 'We would strongly advise passengers whose journeys were impacted by the problems in Eurotunnel not to come to our stations unless they have rebooked through our contact centre. 'We are sorry for the inconvenience that passengers have experienced.'","Trains resumed after all were cancelled yesterday stranding thousands .

"There's no bigger beauty buzzword these days than ‘detox’. From deep-cleansing masks to purging baths, hundreds of treatments promise to cleanse our bodies after over-indulgence. Some experts warn that much of the beauty detox market is little more than marketing hype. ‘The term detox is a medical term that has been hijacked by marketing departments,’ says nutritionist Henrietta Norton. Scroll down for video . 'Detox' is the buzzword of the moment, but what does it really mean? And, do the products that claim to having detoxing products really work? ‘Traditional medical opinion views the term detox as a way to withdraw a potentially lethal toxin from the body such as in those who have abused alcohol or drugs.’ Here, Charlotte Kemp tests the most popular detox beauty products and asks skin, hair and nutrition experts for their verdicts on which might work — and which to ditch. FOOT FANTASTIC? Bodytox Detox Foot Patches, £3.99 for a two pack . Bodytox Detox Foot Patches, £3.99 for a two pack, nirvanahealthfood.com . The Claims: Adhesive patches you stick on your feet to stimulate the pressure points on the soles to release the body’s unwanted toxins. Charlotte says: According to reflexology, stimulating the meridian points on the feet can help to encourage a smooth flow of energy to the major organs of the body. But can what is little more than a plaster achieve what a trained reflexologist can? I applied the patches as directed — one to each foot — and they were moist in the morning. But was this toxins or sweat? Expert view: ‘Putting a detox patch on your skin may make the covered area sweat more,’ says scientist Harriet Ball of Sense About Science (senseaboutscience.org). ‘While very, very small levels of chemicals may be excreted in the sweat, it won’t have any discernable effect on the amount of chemicals in your body.’ DIGESTION TEA . Pukka Detox Tea With Lemon, £1.89 for 20 sachets . Pukka Detox Tea With Lemon, £1.89 for 20 sachets, pukkaherbs.com . The Claims: A blend of organic aniseed, fennel & cardamom — natural ingredients said to ease digestion. Charlotte says: I certainly felt virtuous sipping this herbal brew instead of my morning caffeine fix. It’s an acquired taste — I felt a little nauseous after the first cup — but it grows on you (think aniseed balls dropped in hot water) and it has to be better than my numerous cups coffee and tea all day. Expert view: ‘The spices in this have been traditionally used to support the digestive system and the adrenal glands — our internal stress management system,’ says nutritionist Henrietta Norton of Wild Nutrition. ‘The digestive system has a central role in the effective elimination of waste presented to the gut from the liver.’ PURGING BATH . Ina Crystals White Gold Detoxifying Crystal Salts, £47 for 1000g . Ina Crystals White Gold Detoxifying Crystal Salts, £47 for 1000g . The Claims: These bath salts contain minerals small enough to penetrate skin cells and be absorbed to help the skin expel internal toxins accumulated through alcohol and a hectic lifestyle. Charlotte says: For optimum results, the blurb recommends tipping the entire lot into the bath, which feels rather decadent at £47 a pot, and brushing the skin with the bath mitt included. Can this counter-act a month of drinking? Not sure. My skin felt wonderfully soft but surely you could get similar results by adding a couple of scoops of Epsom Salts at a fraction of the price? Expert view: Dr Sam Bunting (drsambunting.com) isn’t convinced the ingredients will detox the body in a medical sense. ‘We do not eliminate toxins like alcohol through the skin — we do it through the liver and it’s a very efficient organ at doing so,’ she says. It will soften the skin, though. PERFECT PORES . Ren Invisible Pores Detox Mask, £18 for 50ml . Ren Invisible Pores Detox Mask, £18 for 50ml, renskincare.com . The Claims: A deep cleansing face mask, formulated with French clay to draw out impurities and reduce pore size by removing excess sebum (an oily secretion produced naturally to lubricate skin) and removing dead skin cells. Charlotte says: My skin felt smoother afterwards and feels less bumpy, but I still have some yucky blackheads . Expert view: The clay will help absorb excess oil, says Dr Bunting. ‘This will reduce the appearance of pores temporarily. But it won’t pull toxins out of the skin. Those with sensitive skin need to be careful as this can be quite drying,’ SUPER SHAMPOO . Toni & Guy Cleanse, £6.49 for 250ml . Toni & Guy Cleanse, £6.49 for 250ml, hairmeetswardrobe.co.uk . The Claims: A deep clean shampoo for overstyled hair — recommended for occasional use to remove dirt, product build up and residue . Charlotte says: This is applied like a normal shampoo and my hair certainly felt less sticky afterwards. Expert view: Trichologist Glenn Lyons, clinical director at Philip Kingsley, is not convinced. ‘Every shampoo will cleanse and clean the hair. In my opinion, the word detox is a fashionable term and a marketing ploy. This product does no more than a cheap shampoo from a supermarket. It is more important to choose a product developed to suit your hair type. That will make a bigger difference as will washing the hair more frequently.’ NAIL THE TREND . Shine buffer set, £49 for full nail-care kit . Shine buffer set, £49 for full nail-care kit, p-shine.co.uk . The claims: Described as a detox for the nails, this is based on a Japanese manicure technique to enhance the natural pinky colour of nails by buffing without chemical-laden polishes. Charlotte says: After buffing with emery paper, you apply powder and then wax made of natural ingredients to soften the cuticles and leave nails a soft pink colour. Expert view: ‘We have a tendency to abuse our nails with all sorts of extensions, acrylic, semi permanent gel or toxic nail polish,’ says nail guru Sonia Hully of Nailberry (nailberry.co.uk). ‘The P-Shine manicure will help smooth, invigorate and improve the natural lustre of nails leaving them glowing and shiny,’ she says. AMAZING OIL . Neal’s Yard Detox Toning Oil, £15 for 100ml . Neal’s Yard Detox Toning Oil, £15 for 100ml nealsyardremedies.com . The claims: This body oil contains the essential oils used for lymphatic drainage by aromatherapists and with regular use can help to eliminate toxins from the body . Charlotte says: To get best results, it’s recommended to use this after body brushing and a warm bath or shower which is all quite a faff. As directed, I tried to massage as vigorously as I could, concentrating on all the flabby bits like thighs and tummy. Expert view: ‘I think the vigorous massage is likely to be the most helpful element here — that could encourage lymphatic drainage,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘The aromatherapy aspect will improve the sensorial aspect of the ritual — but it won’t help with toxin elimination.’ COLON CLEANSE . Organic Pharmacy Colon Cleanse and Gut Repair Capsules, £29.95 for 60 capsules, theorganicpharmacy.com . The claims: Natural ingredients such as burdock root, leaves from the alfalfa plant, apple pectin and licorice help detoxify and rejuvenate the body at a cellular level. Claims clients have reported weight loss, better digestion and glowing skin . Charlotte says: Popping three of these every night is quite an ordeal. I can report that I was more ‘regular’ within a day or two but my skin isn’t glowing yet. Expert view: Nutritionist Henrietta Norton confirms that the ingredients ‘primarily offer fibre’. She adds: ‘There is no scientific evidence that these ingredients will improve skin, energy, mental clarity or weight but a well functioning gastro-intestinal tract can support good health.’","The beauty buzzword of the moment is 'detox' but is it any more than a marketing hype?

"Max the overweight Jack Russell has managed to lose a fifth of his body weight - after joining a pet fitness club. The six-year-old, who once weighed a staggering two stone and had a reputation for sticking his nose in sweets jars, also managed to lose 10cm off his waist. His owner Emma Harrison said her mother Sylvia, 80, had enjoyed taking Max for walks since he was a puppy, but after she developed painful arthritis, she increasingly struggled to control her dog's weight. Scroll down for video . Max, pictured with owner Emma Harrison, managed to lose a fifth of his body weight after joining a pet fit club . The six-year-old Jack Russell once weighed a staggering two stone after Ms Harrison's 80-year-old mother struggled to take him for regular walks . Now, thanks to a slimming club for pets run by animal charity PDSA, Max has shed the extra weight. Ms Harrison, 30, from Hull, said: 'He's been known to put his head in a sweets jar and eat them - wrappers included - so we've had to be really careful to keep food away from him!' When they realised Max was piling on the pounds, her family stepped in to help give him the number of walks he needed to stay fit. And Max was also put on a strictly controlled six-month diet and banned from having extra treats and biscuits to help him slim down. Ms Harrison added: 'We 're absolutely thrilled at how well Max has done. 'He's a Jack Russell so needs a lot more exercise than most breeds but my mum's age meant she just couldn't give him enough on her own. 'Now we work together as a family to make sure he gets at least six long walks a week. Max also lost 10cm off his waist after being put on a strict diet and banned from extra treats and biscuits . Max's owner said he had a reputation for sticking his head in sweets jars and eating them, wrappers included . 'My mum has a lot of grandchildren, so we are all pitching in to do our bit. You can notice a big difference in Max since he lost the weight. 'He's got loads more energy and has a spring in his step, he just seems a lot happier in himself. 'The pet fit club has given us the inspiration to help him lose even more weight.' Max's achievement meant he was named runner-up in the PDSA Pet Slimmer of the Year competition. PDSA nurse Helen Darnell, who helped oversee Max's diet, said: 'Max looks absolutely amazing since shedding the pounds in pet fit club. 'Emma and Sylvia stuck to the plan completely and it's wonderful to see him so full of life again. 'He has just a little way to go to reach his ideal weight now.' PDSA vet Elaine Pendlebury, who helped to judge the contest said it was important owners kept their pets fit and healthy. She said: 'Max's achievement is an amazing success story - proving that it's never too late to make a positive difference to a pet's health and lifestyle. 'All of our pet fit club slimmers will have an improved quality of life as a result of their weight loss, and will probably have an increased life expectancy too.' Max, pictured before losing the extra weight is measured by a vet nurse, was runner-up in the animal charity's Pet Slimmer of the Year competition . A weigh-in at the vet shows the Jack Russell, before his diet, weighed a 14.1kg or 31 pounds .

"She has previously spoken of how important historical accuracy is to the new BBC adaptation of her book Wolf Hall set during the Tudor era. And now in a bid to make sure the new six-part series is a true reflection of the period, Dame Hilary Mantel has insisted the characters featured have clean, straight, white teeth. Inspired by the fictional biography written by Dame Hilary, the story is centred more on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell in King Henry’s court. Scroll down for video . Damian Lewis as King Henry VIII, left, and Claire Foy, right as Anne Boleyn in the new BBC series Wolf Hall, adapted from the book by Hilary Mantel. The author has insisted that the characters have clean, straight, white teeth . Author Hilary Mantel, who says it is accurate to portray the characters with white teeth as at that stage, they ate so little sugar . Cromwell had been the right-hand man of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, special adviser to the King, but soon Sir Thomas took his place to become the most powerful of Henry's ministers. Homeland star Damien Lewis plays King Henry VIII in the series, with Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn. Some critics have pointed out that during that era, it would be unlikely that people had perfect teeth and clean clothes. But author Dame Hilary has hit back saying courtiers would have had white teeth, as sugar was not yet widely available. According to the Sunday Telegraph, she told cast members: 'You do not have bad teeth, and you are not dirty. The ladies of the Tudor court show off their straight, white smiles, which author Hilary Mantel believes is a historically accurate portrayal . She also explained to the newspaper: 'There are two ways in historical drama: either glamourise them impossibly, or rough them up in some picturesque way so they all have bad teeth. Which, actually, at that stage in history people didn't have, because they ate so little sugar. 'Because in that way the viewer or the reader starts to patronise the people, and think we're more advanced than they were, and condescend into the past.' She also added that members of his court would not have been covered in filth as they would have been conscious of their bathing habits. The outspoken author had also previously laid down the law, warning the BBC not to turn a televised version of her books into ‘nonsense’. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in June, she said: ‘As soon as you decide this is too complicated for the viewer, or history is an inconvenient shape and can’t we just tidy it up a bit, then you fall into a cascade of errors which ends in nonsense.’ Actor Damian Lewis, who plays Henry VIII in the drama series, says there was no need for him to fatten up for the role as at the time, the Tudor king only had a 32 inch waist . Referring to TV series The Tudors – which was broadcast on the BBC in 2007 – she accused its creators of dumbing-down, saying: ‘At some point, someone had decided that it was too complex for Henry VIII to have two sisters, so they rolled them into one. ‘Then they had to find a fictitious king for her to marry, so I think they invented a king from Portugal unknown to history. It’s so shaming, and it stems from not trusting the intelligence of the viewer. ‘I think the problem was that there would be too many Marys in the story. But what do I do? Every second man in Henry VIII’s England is called Thomas.’ Meanwhile Damian Lewis, who plays Henry VIII in the drama series revealed there wasn't actually any need for him to fatten up for the role, as the Tudor king only put on weight later in his life. The new BBC drama, based on Ms Mantel's book is centred more on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell, played by Mark Rylance, pictured, in King Henry’s court . In an interview with the Radio Times, the Homeland star said: '‘The truth is, though it might be an odd thing to mention, Henry had a 32 inch waist - and he remained that way for quite some time. ‘He was the top sportsman in his court!’ The title of both the series and book comes from the name of the Seymour family seat at Wolf Hall or Wulfhall in Wiltshire, though none of the action occurs there. The novel was previously adapted into a successful stage production by the Royal Shakespeare Company earlier this year and the six-part series starts on BBC Two on Wednesday.","Hilary Mantel has insisted characters in Wolf Hall have straight white teeth .
Said it would be historically inaccurate for them to have blackened teeth .
Explained that they wouldn't have bad dentistry as they didn't eat sugar .

"It started out as an idea by a group of young radicals and evolved into a national icon over the years becoming the beating heart of youths across the country. As the triple j contemplates middle age, Sounds like Teen Spirit, airing on the ABC, looks back on how one small alternative radio station became the finger on the pulse for Australia's youth culture. Bursting onto the air as Double J in 1975 and controversially rebranding as it went national as triple j in the 1990's, it has played a vital role in unearthing new talent and staging major music events while changing the face of Australian music forever. Scroll down for video . A youthful Michael Hutchence playing with INXS at the 2JJJ Youth Refuge Concert at Wanda Beach in 1982 . Comedy duo Adam Spencer (left) and Will Anderson (right) hosted breakfast on triple j for six years . Missy Higgins won Unearthed, a competition for unsigned artists, in 2001 which kick-started her career . Midnight Oil performing at Darling Harbour - Peter Garrett (pictured) said no commercial radio station would play the music that triple j airs . Helen Razor and Mikey Robins hosted a breakfast show in the 1990s on triple j . Adam Spencer knows all too well the importance of triple j within the cultural landscape when he won a stand-up comedy competition run by triple j radio called Raw Comedy in 1996 and started the graveyard shift at the station. 'I was surprised as anyone when I was halfway through my PHD in mathematics in Sydney uni that I found myself doing the midnight radio shifts on triple j,' he said. 'It was obviously not part of a bigger career plan.' Spencer described working the odd hours as hilarious fun. 'You can do really weird and out there talk-back,' he said. 'There was a beautiful eclectic bizarre mix of people at 3 in the morning listening to triple j - I used to absolutely love it and it was a great way to learn the radio skills.' Moving to the more civilised breakfast shift in 1999, Spencer formed a formidable duo with fellow comedian Wil Anderson for six years. 'We just don't talk over the top of each other - you can tell from body language,' he explained . 'A lot of it is non-verbal communication is going on that the listeners don't know about. 'You are just looking at each other and one of you will give a sign of ""don't worry I've got this covered"" or one will be look at the other as if to say ""over to you - I've got nothing"".' While Anderson joked that his time at the station was reminiscent of the 60's - 'if you remember your time there - then you weren't really there.' Roy (right) and HG are former hosts on triple j: 'the kiddies liked adults being silly and we were very silly' Hilltop Hoods performing at the One Night Stand in Gippsland, 2009, made it big with triple j's ongoing support . Sammy Collins (left)  and Arnold Frolows (right) modelling Double Jay merchandise with the original logo . Spencer thinks the recipe to the station's success was that the listeners outgrow the alternative youthful sound. 'It's that listeners generally get old and move on and think it's just ridiculous music they can't listen to anymore and think the station has turned uncool - which is great because it means it's just constantly appealing to new listeners,' he said. He said the international acts who appeared on the station were blown away by the unique concept. 'They could not get the head around the concept - it was so original they would say ""we've just promoted our show around the whole country in one 10 minute slot, that's awesome"",' he said. 'Bands in the UK kind of understand it but it is so much cooler than Radio 1 - the idea that it's independent music and most of it local and national bands.' A lot of artists and bands from overseas also greatly benefited from airplay in Australia on triple j. 'There was a period of time where the Dandy Warhols sold more albums in Australia than the United States because - there were just perfect for triple j,' he said . 'One of the reasons a lot of the big bands come to Australia and tour is because they are working off the networks they have built through triple j.' PJ Harvey performing at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney in 2004 . Jono (right) and Dano (left) hosted a Saturday night show before moving to Sunday afternoons and eventually the weekday breakfast shift . But of course there are endless local acts that are forever indebted to the station's unique style. 'Bands like the Hilltop Hoods play to stadiums now filled with 20,000 people - it wouldn't have happened without triple j,' Spencer said. Singer Missy Higgins won triple j's, Unearthed, a competition for unsigned artists, in 2001 which kick-started her career. 'They gave birth to me in a way which is a really weird thing to say,' Missy laughed. Acts were invited to send in cassette tapes with the aim to get the invaluable air time for their original material as part of Unearthed. 'As many as 800 cassettes would arrive the afternoon of the cut off-date - you would literally get an armful of CD's take them home and listen to them,' Spencer said. 'Now 15 years on, that's an independent digital network - the Unearthed community is unbelievable. 'Bands who are heard on Unearthed get picked as support acts for other bands.'

Myf Warhurst hosted various different shows on triple j between 2000 and 2007 . Spencer said people forget that the station is a true pioneer in supporting up and coming artists. 'I think people take it for granted because it has been around for a while - if you look at the cultural footprint of it - it's quite amazing what it does,' he said . 'You've only got to stop and listen to what other radio stations play for a few minutes to realise how important it is that we've got a station like triple j to play the music that it does.' He says another appeal is that the station doesn't sit alongside the top-rating FM commercial stations. 'It's consistently rated at five per cent in those markets - that's a million people Australia wide but you wouldn't want triple j rating 12 per cent,' he said. 'You would lose something if the station started playing the sort of stuff that would get that many people.' However, as irony would have it triple j's Hottest 100, that hit the airwaves every Australia Day weekend, is the biggest music poll in the world. Spencer has no doubt that triple j will be alive and well in another 40 years. 'It will out last us all.'

Police found him deceased behind the front desk of the hotel when they arrived on the scene. Bowens was arrested in the city on Saturday night, reports CBS. Knopfel's death was one of six homicides in St. Louis during a 12-hour span - an unusually high number for a city which has a population of about 320,000 people and recorded 159 homicides in 2014. Police Chief Sam Dotson and Mayor Francis Slay have linked the violence to crime increases in the area documented since the fatal Ferguson police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown more than five months ago in north St. Louis County. 'To see this much violence going on in our city within such a short period of time, it is absolutely outrageous,' Slay said. 'It's out of hand. It disgusts me.'

"Lebanon's Miss Universe contestant has come under fire over a group selfie in which she appears with Miss Israel, leading to several calls for her to be stripped off her title. Saly Greige, 25, has been forced to apologise for the selfie, taken by Miss Israel, Doron Matalon, as they prepare to take part in the upcoming pageant in Miami. Lebanon and Israel remain at war, and Miss Greige, from Al-Koura, north Lebanon, claims she had done her best to avoid Miss Matalon, and had been caught by surprise when the photograph was taken. Scroll down for video . Controversial: The group selfie was taken by Miss Israel, Doron Matalon, left, forcing Miss Lebanon, Saly Greige, second from left, to publicly apologise . Under fire: Since the selfie emerged, there have been several calls for stripping Miss Greige of her Miss Lebanon title for 'consorting with the enemy'. Crowned: Saly Greige waving after being crowned Miss Lebanon 2014, in October last year . The offending photo, taken in Miami where the Miss Universe pageant is staged, appeared on Miss Matalon's Instagram account on January 11. Miss Greige, who has a Masters Degree in Civil Engineering, can be seen smiling awkwardly in the photograph alongside Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia. Lebanese media picked up the story, running Greige's allegations that Matalon had 'photobombed' the selfie, and local social media users both defended and attacked their beauty queen for the picture. After several calls for her to be stripped of her Miss Lebanon 2014 title, Miss Greige took to her Facebook page to declare that Israel's Doron Matalon had 'photobombed' her. In response to Miss Greige's apology, Miss Matalon said it made her sad that Miss Greige could 'put the hostility out of the game' Miss Greige, posing with Miss Japan Keiko Tsuji and Miss Finland Krista Haapalainen, apologised for the selfie, claiming Miss Israel has taken the group selfie when she was unprepared . Beauties: Saly Greige, pictured second from right, with Sabrina Beneett, Miss Malaysia 2014, Ana Zubashvili, Miss Georgia 2014, Aiday Issayeva, Miss Kazakhstan 2014, Lara Debbane, Miss Egypt 2014, Keiko Tsuji, Miss Japan 2014, and Elvira Devinamira, Miss Indonesia 2014 . 'Since the first day of my arrival to participate to Miss Universe, I was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with Miss Israel (that tried several times to have a photo with me),' Greige wrote in English on her page. 'I was having a photo with Miss Japan, Miss Slovenia and myself, suddenly Miss Israel jumped in, took a selfie, and put it on her social media.' Matalon responded to the controversy herself on Sunday, saying it made her 'sad'. 'It doesn't surprise me, but it still makes me sad. Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game,' she wrote in English and Hebrew. Israel occupied parts of Lebanon for 22 years until 2000, but the two countries are still technically at war and their armies occasionally skirmish along the UN-designated withdrawal line. Israel fought a bloody war against Lebanon's Hezbollah in 2006, which killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and some 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.","Miss Lebanon Saly Greige forced to apologise for selfie with Miss Israel .

"A seventh person has been arrested over the murder of Australian businessman Robert Ellis in Bali. However, police believe another suspect is still on the run three months after the alleged slaughter. Adolf Malo Rangga, 34, was detained by police on Saturday evening having evaded arrest since October 2014. It’s reported Rangga was located by authorities on Indonesia’s Sumba Island whilst drinking with family members. The accused tried to escape through the kitchen, before finally cooperating when cornered by police, according to the Daily Telegraph. British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddock with his throat cut in October 2014 . Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids . If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty . Police allege eight people were involved in the death of Mr Ellis, whose body was dumped his throat was slashed on October 19. The alleged culprits include his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids. Another two suspects were arrested in November following a two-hour chase that ended in a violent confrontation. The men, both aged 24, resisted arrest by firing poisonous arrows and using machetes. They were finally apprehended after both were shot in the leg. It's eight suspects involvement in Mr Ellis' brutal death range from organising to executing the gruesome crime. If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty. Adrianus Ngongo (pictured) is the main suspect in the murder of Robert Kelvin Ellis, who was killed when his Balinese wife Noor Ellis allegedly ordered a hit on him . Mr Ellis’ death was ‘no doubt an execution-style murder’ according to a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar. He was found with his wrists and feet tied, wrapped in plastic and dumped in a ditch in the rice field near Sedang Village. Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who heads the district's forensic team, said Mr Ellis' throat had been slashed three times. Detective Wisnu Wardana gave more detail, explaining 'there was a deep wound to the neck that had almost completely cut the head.’ Police allege Mr Ellis’ Indonesian wife  confessed to ordering his murder because he cheated on her 'often'. 'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp. 'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her. We allege that she paid the executioners to kill her husband.' Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife . In early January police reportedly handed a brief of evidence to prosecutors in early January which claimed the victim’s wife paid hit-men 150 million rupiah, or $14,200 AUD, according to The Daily Telegraph. Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis had a UK passport and had lived in Australia before moving to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife. He has two children, Jon and Peter Ellis, who study at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia from his relationship with Noor Ellis. He also has two children from a former relationship. At the time of their father’s death, the four children and Mr Ellis’ brother John released a joint statement. ‘Bob was a loving and devoted father, grandfather, brother, son and husband. His loss leaves a hole in the lives of everyone he touched.’ ‘His work in business created jobs for thousands of Indonesians. He was a good and honourable man. 'His integrity, generosity and spirit is evidenced by the way the business community both expat and Indonesian have rallied to support us and show their respects.’","Seventh suspect arrest over the murder of Australian Robert Ellis .

"A man set a Pittsburgh-area house ablaze, killing six people, including four children, in order to get revenge on one of the residents, officials said. Ryan Williams, 24, was charged Friday with six counts of criminal homicide, arson and burglary for the October 18 house fire in McKeesport. The blaze killed 55-year-old Ronald Egenlauf Sr, 27-year-old Hope Jordan and her four children, aged 2 through 7. Arson: Ryan Williams, 24, set a Pittsburgh-area house ablaze, killing six people, including four children, in order to get revenge on the only survivor, Keith Egenlauf, 23, according to police . Williams allegedly told friends that he had stolen money and food from the house before setting a roll of toilet paper on fire and tossing it on the couch . According to detectives, Williams started the fire in order to exact revenge on Jordan's husband, Keith Egenlauf, 23, the only one to survive the blaze. A criminal complaint states that Williams was out to 'get Keith' because he believe Egenlauf had spoken with police after the paid had burglarized a home in 2013, according to police. After the fire, Williams told a friend that he had gone to the home where Egenlauf was living and found the back door open, according to the document. Williams walked up to the second floor of the house, took money out of a wallet and took food from the fridge before setting a toilet paper roll on fire and tossing it on the couch. On the night of the fire, he phoned the same friend and said 'I just did some crazy stuff. I’m on my porch waiting for fire trucks,' as sirens were heard in the background, the complaint states. Another witness told detectives that Williams woke him early the day after the fire and told him he had 'just lit Keith's house on fire, and if anybody asks, I was here all night.' Arrested: One witness told investigators Williams had phoned on the night of the fire saying he did some 'crazy stuff,' and woke up another the day after the home burned down saying he did it . Children: Hope Jordan's children, ages 2 through 7, were found dead in an upstairs bedroom, though Williams claimed he didn't know anyone but Keith Egenlauf was home . Deceased: Keith Egenlauf (right) barely escaped the flames after trying unsuccessfully to save his wheelchair-bound father while his wife, Hope Jordan (left), ran to the children. One witness described how Williams cried after hearing on the news that the children had died, claiming he thought it was only Keith Egenlauf living in the house at the time. On Friday, Williams told WPXI that he did not know the children were inside the house when he set the fire. Egenlauf told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review he raced back into the house, trying to save his partially paralyzed father, Ronald. 'He could see I was in pain,' Egenlauf said, describing blistering heat around him as he tried to pull his father out of his wheelchair. 'I was screaming. I tried my best. He told me, ""Get out.""' Though she had made it out of the house too, Jordan entered again and went upstairs for the children, Dominic Jordan, 7, Autumn Jordan, 6, Serenity Jakub, 3, and Victoria Jakub, 2. Egenlauf said it was the first time in weeks the four were together with their mother. Two of the children were in foster care and visiting Jordan, who was charged in 2013 with child endangerment for leaving them in filthy conditions with her boyfriend at the time, Andrew McGee. 'They called me ""Dad,""' said Egenlauf, who would have celebrated his first wedding anniversary with Jordan in December. 'I treated them like my own. In my heart, they belonged to me.' Egenlauf was taken to the hospital in critical condition on the night of the fire, suffering burns over 55 percent of his body he is still healing from, WTAE reports, . Dawn McPherson, 37, Jordan's sister, said Williams deserves no mercy if convicted. 'I hope he can't sleep at night,' McPherson said. 'I hope he's haunted for the rest of his life. I hope God gives him everything he deserves.'","Ryan Williams, 24, was charged with homicide and arson for an October house fire .

"David Cameron today admits he is 'paid handsomely' as Prime Minister amid a row over whether he publish his tax returns before the election. The Prime Minister insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea of releasing details of his earnings so voters can see if politicians paid the right tax. But Chancellor George Osborne, who first floated the idea in the Cabinet, admitted at the weekend that there are 'no plans' for it to go ahead. David Cameron insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea of publishing his tax returns but Chancellor George Osborne says there are 'no plans' to do so . Mr Cameron and other members of the coalition have faced intense pressure to say whether they benefited from a decision in the 2012 Budget to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. Two years ago Downing Street said senior Tories were willing to publish their tax returns, but stressed the election was a long way off. Now, with four months until polling day, the plan has been thrown into doubt. Mr Osborne told theSunday Times: 'There are genuine issues around taxpayer confidentiality and how it would work in practice. 'You see it as a feature of some American campaigns but I think there would be quite a lot of practical difficulties. There are no plans at this point. The income I receive is publicly declared.' Speaking at an event in Ipswich today, Mr Cameron, who earns £142,500 a year said: 'On the issue of my tax returns, nothing has changed. I am very relaxed about publishing these things. 'There's no secret about my status. I am paid very handsomely as your Prime Minister and that's my main source of income, and I have a house I used to live in before I moved into Downing Street and I rent that out and I get income from that. 'I don't have other sources of income. There will be no surprises in terms of my tax affairs. 'But I am very relaxed as I've always said - nothing has changed about that issue.' He declares income from renting out his former family home in Notting Hill where he lived with wife Samantha and their children before moving into Downing Street. The register of MPs' interests does not include the amount he receives, but as a family it is almost certain to be more than £7,500, pushing Mr Cameron into the threshold for paying the top rate of tax. Mr Cameron earns £142,500 as Prime Minister and rents out the Notting Hill home where he lived with wife Samantha and their children before moving into Downing Street . Mr Osborne earns £134,565 as Chancellor and also declares shares in his family's wallpaper firm, Osborne And Little Ltd, which is said to be worth £4million. When the idea of publishing tax returns was first floated, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he would be happy to do so 'if that's the way things are going', and Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, said he had 'no objection in principle'. In April 2013 government ministers in France began releasing details of their financial records in the wake of a tax fraud scandal involving a close ally of President Francois Hollande. Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers' Alliance, told the paper: 'Politicians must keep their word if they are to be trusted, so having said they would publish their returns, those in the highest offices should do just that.' Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: 'My view is that they should stick to what they said they would do.'","PM and Chancellor were 'relaxed' about making tax affairs public in 2012 .

"Comedian Bill Cosby took to the stage on Saturday night despite drawing a 100-strong crowd of protesters who chanted 'Rape is not a joke!' and 'No means no!' outside the theater. Remaining defiant amid a storm of sexual assault allegations against him, the 77-year-old entertainer carried out two performances at the Buell Theater in Denver, Colorado. During his first show, he was welcomed to the stage with a standing ovation and hoots of 'We love you Bill!'. He did not make any reference to the allegations throughout the two-hour performance. Meanwhile, dozens of demonstrators, led by lawyer Gloria Allred - who is representing at least seven of the women to have accused Cosby of assault - waved signs and chanted outside the venue.

Protest:  The 77-year-old entertainer carried out two performances at the theater. Meanwhile, dozens of demonstrators, led by lawyer Gloria Allred waved signs (pictured) and chanted loudly next to the venue . Angry: Among the signs were the slogans: 'Colorado believes the women', 'What if it was your daughter?', 'If you support Cosby you support rape' (left) and 'Believe victims, rapists lie'. Ms Allred is pictured center . Among the signs were the slogans: 'Colorado believes the women', 'What if it was your daughter?', 'If you support Cosby you support rape' and 'Believe victims, rapists lie'. Earlier in the day, a woman had held a news conference, alongside Ms Allred, at a nearby hotel to accuse Cosby of sexually assaulting her in 1986. During the conference, a teary-eyed Beth Ferrier, 55, claimed that the entertainer put drugs in her coffee when she went to see one of his shows in Denver. 'I cannot tell you how horrific of a feeling that is,' she said, adding that the next thing she remembered was waking up hours later in the back of her car 'practically naked'. Ms Ferrier has said previously she was assaulted by Cosby. She went public in June 2005, alleging that as a model visiting New York in the early 1980s, she met Cosby and they had a brief affair. Cosby is facing sexual assault accusations from at least 15 women, with some of the claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his attorney and has never been charged.

He has denied the claims and has never been charged . Speaking outside the Buell Theater on Saturday night, longtime Cosby fan Robert Belveal, 48, of Denver, told the Associated Press the protesters outside did nothing to deter him from attending. 'I believe that if you're not convicted of a crime, then why should you be judged?' he said. 'All it takes is for one person to say something, then you have all these other people wanting to get their 15 minutes of fame.' On Friday, Cosby performed at a packed show in Pueblo. About 25 chanting protesters gathered outside the venue. But inside, the crowd warmly welcomed the comedian to the stage. Making his first appearance in Pueblo since a 1996 show at the Colorado State Fair, Cosby was embraced by a mostly middle-aged and older crowd.

Controversy: Cosby performs inside the theater (left) while a protester holds up a sign outside it (right) On Thursday, the star released a statement saying that he felt ready to perform in Colorado. 'I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful,' he said. 'I'm ready!' Cosby finished his statement with references to his 'Fat Albert' character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special - 'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.' Cosby's persistence comes after protesters interrupted a handful of his recent shows. Hecklers stood up and chanted repeatedly 'we believe the women' at Cosby's third and final performance of a Canadian tour on January 9. The protesters then marched out of the theater as Cosby asked his audience not to react. The day before, a man at Cosby's performance in London, Ontario, called the comedian a rapist. The shows in Canada were the comedian's first since November when a string of performances were canceled over the accusations. More recently, a model who claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges.

Chloe Goins' attorney said that his client is the first woman accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct whose case may fall within the statute of limitations. On Friday, Cosby's attorney, Martin  Singer, said  the star was in New York the night Goins claims she was accosted. It comes as NBC's top entertainment executive has said the door is firmly shut to Cosby's return to the network. Thirty years ago, Cosby was the sitcom king with NBC's 'The Cosby Show'. But on Friday, the network's Entertainment Chairman, Bob Greenblatt, said: 'That's safe to say' when asked if NBC would ever again do a project with the comedian.

"Two women shot dead by firing squads in Indonesia this weekend. They were among six drug smugglers executed after the president brushed aside last-minute diplomatic efforts to secure them clemency. Tran Bich Hanh, 37, of Vietnam, and 26-year-old Indonesian Rani Andriani were both shot to death shortly after midnight on Saturday after exhausting all their possibilities for appeal and clemency. The final wish of Tran, who had begged to be allowed to be executed in her home country, was to face the firing squad uncuffed. It was granted. Scroll down for video . Executed: Tran Bich Hanh, 37, of Vietnam, was shot dead by an Indonesian firing squad on Saturday . Put before the firing squad: Rani Andriani, a 26-year-old Indonesian woman, was also executed on Saturday . Ultimate price: An ambulance carries the bodies of drug smugglers executed by firing squads in Indonesia . Four men from Brazil, Malawi, the Netherlands and Nigeria, were also shot dead in pairs at the same time on Saturday on the Nusakambangan island penal colony. Andriani was also executed there, but Tran was executed in Boyolali, according to Attorney General Office's spokesman Tony Spontana. President Joko Widodo rejected the condemned convicts' requests for clemency last month. He also refused a last-minute appeal by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and the Dutch government to spare their countrymen - Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, 53, and Ang Kiem Soe, 52, who was born in Papua but whose nationality is Dutch. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said late on Saturday he had temporarily recalled the country's ambassador to Indonesia and summoned Indonesia's representative in The Hague to protest Ang's execution. He said the 'cruel and inhumane punishment' was carried out despite King Willem-Alexander and Prime Minister Mark Rutte personally contacting Mr Widodo. 'My heart goes out to their [the victims'] families, for whom this marks a dramatic end to years of uncertainty,' Koenders said. 'The Netherlands remains opposed to the death penalty.' A spokesman for President Roussef said she was 'distressed and outraged' after Indonesia ignored her last-ditch pleas. 'Using the death penalty, which is increasingly rejected by the international community, seriously affects relations between our countries,' the spokesman said. The Brazilian ambassador to Jakarta was being recalled for consultations, the spokesman added. Death row inmate: The final wish of Tran was to face the firing squad uncuffed. It was granted . Put to death: Papua-born Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, 52, left, and Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, 53, right, were executed by firing squads in Indonesia after last-ditch diplomatic efforts for clemency failed . Amnesty International said the executions, the first under the new president who took office in November, were 'a retrograde step' for human rights. But Indonesia's attorney general, Muhammad Prasetyo, has said there is no excuse for drug dealers and 'hopefully, this will have a deterrent effect.' Mr Prasetyo said the new government had a firm commitment to fight against drugs. President Widodo, who has personally taken a particularly hard line towards drug use, has said he would not grant clemency to 64 drug convicts on death row. 'What we do is merely aimed at protecting our nation from the danger of drugs,' Prasetyo said on Thursday. He said figures from the National Anti-Narcotic Agency showed 40 to 50 people die each day from drugs in Indonesia. He said that drug trafficking rings have spread to many places, including remote villages where most victims are youngsters of productive age. Indonesia has become the largest drug market in Southeast Asia with 45 per cent of the region's drugs in circulation. A second batch of executions would be held later this year and also target drug smugglers, he warned. The coffin of Dutch citizen Ang Kiem Soei is seen inside an ambulance as it arrive as it arrives at Wijayapura port from Nusakambangan island prison complex  after the executions of five foreign nationals . Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago of 250million people, has extremely strict drug laws and often executes smugglers. More than 138 people are on death row, mostly for drug crimes. About a third of them are foreigners. Rupert Abbott, Amnesty International's research director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, called for Indonesia to rethink its position on the death penalty. Indonesia resumed executions in 2013 after a five-year gap. No mercy: President Widodo has said he would not grant clemency to 64 drug convicts on death row . 'Indonesia's new government took office on the back of promises to improve respect for human rights, but carrying out these executions would be a regressive move,' he said. 'Rather than putting to death more people, the government should immediately impose a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its eventual abolition' Amnesty noted that drug-related offences do not meet the threshold of the 'most serious crimes' for which the death penalty can be imposed under international law. While no executions were carried out in Indonesia in 2014, the government has announced that 20 are scheduled for this year, the campaign group said. Mr Abbott said: 'It would be a huge set back if the government goes ahead with its plans to execute as many as 20 people during the year. Tackling rising crime rates is a legitimate goal of President Widodo's administration, but the death penalty is not the answer and does not work as a deterrent to crime. 'The plans for a new spate of executions come at a time when the government is actively seeking to protect Indonesian nationals who face the death penalty overseas. 'If the death penalty is wrong elsewhere, it is surely wrong in Indonesia too.' Brazilian Moreira was arrested in 2003, after police at Jakarta airport found 13.4 kilograms (29.5 pounds) of cocaine hidden in his hang glider. A second Brazilian national, Rodrigo Muxfeldt Gularte, remains on death row in Indonesia, also convicted of drug trafficking. Ang was arrested near Jakarta in 2003, after police found equipment which they estimated had been producing 15,000 ecstasy pills a day for three years. Police confiscated 8,000 pills and thousands of dollars. Tran was arrested at Adi Sumarmo International Airport after she was caught trying to carry 1.1kg of methamphetamine into Indonesia. She claimed she was duped into carrying the suitcase by a drugs gang, but she was nonetheless sentenced to death. Adriani was condemned to death after she was found guilty of being involved in a gang trying to smuggle 3.5kg of heroin. Her sister, Meirika Franola, was granted clemency by a previous president. The others who were executed were Namaona Denis, 48, from Malawi; and Daniel Enemuo, 38, from Nigeria.","Executions carried out despite diplomatic calls for clemency .

"David Cameron and George Osborne are set to break a promise to publish their tax returns before the election. The Prime Minister had insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea, insisting it was 'legitimate' for voters to ask if politicians paid the right tax. Mr Osborne, who first floated the idea in the Cabinet, has now admitted there are 'no plans' for it to go ahead. David Cameron had insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea of publishing his tax returns but Chancellor George Osborne now says there are 'no plans' to do so. Mr Cameron and other members of the coalition have faced intense pressure to say whether they benefited from a decision in the 2012 Budget to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. Two years ago Downing Street said senior Tories were willing to publish their tax returns, but stressed the election was a long way off. Now, with four months until polling day, the plan has been shelved. But last night Mr Osborne told the Sunday Times: 'There are genuine issues around taxpayer confidentiality and how it would work in practice. 'You see it as a feature of some American campaigns but I think there would be quite a lot of practical difficulties. There are no plans at this point. The income I receive is publicly declared.' In 2012 Mr Cameron, who earns £142,500 a year, was said to be 'very happy' for the information to be released but the move would be unprecedented for a sitting prime minister. In April 2013 government ministers in France began releasing details of their financial records in the wake of a tax fraud scandal involving a close ally of President Francois Hollande. Two years ago Downing Street said senior Tories were willing to publish their tax returns, but stressed the election was a long way off . Aides to Mr Cameron insisted again that he remained 'relaxed' about the idea but were unable to give any information on progress made in putting his tax records into the public domain. They insisted the idea had not been shelved, but there were still two years until the general election in May 2015. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said in 2012 they would not be opposed to publishing tax details. Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers' Alliance, told the paper: 'Politicians must keep their word if they are to be trusted, so having said they would publish their returns, those in the highest offices should do just that.' Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: 'My view is that they should stick to what they said they would do.'","The PM has said he was 'relaxed' about the idea of publishing tax returns .

"Two teenage sweethearts suspected in a crime spree of stolen vehicles and pilfered checks across the South have been taken into custody in Florida, Kentucky authorities said Sunday. Grayson County Sheriff officials say in a statement that 18-year-old Dalton Hayes and his 13-year-old girlfriend, Cheyenne Phillips, were arrested without incident about 12,10am Sunday in Panama City Beach. The two had eluded police in multiple states while raising concern about their increasingly brazen behavior. Scroll down for video . Caught: Dalton Hayes, 18, and his girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, 13, were caught sleeping in the parking lot of a strip mall in a stolen truck early Sunday . Hayes was led away in cuffs, while Phillips was taken into custody by the Florida Department of Children and Families . Captured: Hayes and Phillips were arrested by police in Panama City Beach, Florida, after two weeks on the run from their homes in Kentucky . Phillips, being only in eighth grade, was taken into custody by the Florida Department of Children and Families until she can be returned to her family in Kentucky. Authorities say US Marshal's Service and local law enforcement in Panama City Beach discovered Hayes and Phillips asleep in a 2001 Toyota Tundra that was stolen in Henry County, Georgia. The vehicle was surrounded by law enforcement and both Hayes and Phillips were taken into custody. Authorities plan to extradite Hayes and Phillips back to Kentucky where they are both expected to face felony charges. End of the line: Dalton Hayes, 18, is in a Florida jail after he was arrested Sunday . Hayes and Phillips began their run from the law and their families earlier this month when they vanished from their small hometown in western Kentucky. Authorities believe their travels took them to South Carolina and Georgia. Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin, had urged her son and his companion to surrender and 'face the consequences.' Martin said the couple had been dating for about three months. She said the girl portrayed herself as being 19, and the family, including Hayes, believed her. Cheyenne 'would go in and write checks, and she would come out with cigarettes and stuff, so I didn't have any reason not to believe she wasn't 19,' Martin said. 'Because normally you can't buy cigarettes when you're 13 years old. By the time her son realized she was a mere 13, 'he was already done in love with her,' Martin said. When he hit the road, Hayes was running away from trouble back home. He faces burglary and theft charges in his home county, stemming from an arrest late last year, according to Grayson County court records. He was planning to be at the local judicial center on Jan. 5 to find out if a grand jury had indicted him on the charges, his mother said. His case did not come up, but by that time the teens were gone. On the run: The teens are believed to have committed burglaries, car thefts and other crimes across six states in the South during their two-week crime spree that began in their native Kentucky. They are pictured here entering a WalMart in South Carolina . Spree: The couple has made it from Kentucky down to Florida - a distance of at least 600 miles . Norman Chaffins, sheriff in Grayson County, Kentucky, where the pair disappeared 14 days ago, said the couple's behavior had become 'increasingly brazen and dangerous.' Twice, the teens were able to evade law officers in Kentucky, the sheriff said. They crashed the first truck they stole and hid in the woods. Then they later stole another truck nearby, Chaffins said. At one point, the two were spotted at a Wal-Mart in South Carolina, where the teens are thought to have passed two stolen checks, said Manning, South Carolina, Police Chief Blair Shaffer. They were seen in a vehicle that apparently was stolen from Kentucky, he said. Hayes' mother claimed that Cheyenne told her son that she was 19. She is in fact an eighth grader and just 13 years old . The pair are accused of stealing this pickup truck in Grayson County, Kentucky and driving it to South Carolina. The vehicle had at least one gun in the glove box when it was taken . Rebels: Hayes' mother said her son also believed that 13-year-old Cheyenne was 19 . Authorities believe they then headed to Georgia and stole a pickup truck from the driveway of a man's home in Henry County, about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta. The homeowner awoke Wednesday to find his vehicle was gone, along with two handguns he kept inside, Henry County police Lt. Joey Smith said. Hours later, another truck the couple are suspected of having stolen in another state was found nearby. It had been crashed through a fence and abandoned behind a vacant building on neighboring property, Smith said. Martin said her son texted her a few days after their disappearance to say the couple were in Mississippi. They were spotted soon after that in Kentucky, she said. Hayes, who is an adult, is being extradited back to his home county in Kentucky to face multiple felony charges. He is also likely to face charges in Georgia and possibly South Carolina .","Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, were arrested while sleeping in a stolen truck about midnight on Sunday in Panama City Beach, Florida .

"Rejects material matters: Uri Geller not spend a penny of his wealth as he never carries cash or credit cards . His ability to bend spoons has seen him create a multi-million pound fortune. But Uri Geller does not spend a penny of his wealth as he never carries cash or credit cards and does not know if he has a bank account or a pension. The 68-year-old said he made a decision to shun all material matters and focus on his spirituality after fame and fortune drove him to illness many years ago. Geller said: ‘I do not own a wallet. I do not carry any money or cards. My wife pays for my purchases in shops and my brother-inlaw deals with everything else. I don’t buy anything myself, on principle. ‘In the early 1970s, I was totally obsessed with fame and fortune and I couldn’t handle my success. I became bulimic. Then John Lennon directed me to Japan to find spirituality, and that changed my life. I detached myself totally from material stuff. ‘From that time, I’ve found systems and methods to make sure I don’t handle or deal with money myself. I don’t even know if I have a bank account — I’d have to ask my brother-in-law. ‘Probably my brother-in-law and my wife keep a Visa or an American Express. I don’t really know. I don’t interfere in the monetary system they operate. I leave it absolutely to them.’ Geller became famous in 1969 when he began performing in his native Israel.

"It may have started life as a joke, but the world's first crisp sandwich café has proved such a success   that it will now stay open beyond its initial month-long lifespan. Businessman Andrew McMenamin had planned to keep his Simply Crispy pop-up in Belfast going for just four weeks.

'We're at the end of the first week now and it's been incredible,' Mr McMenamin told MailOnline. 'Absolutely crazy.' The cafe sold out of sandwiches within two hours of its opening on Monday, but it is not a shortage of crisps that has left diners disappointed, but rather the bread they come in - notably the famous Belfast bap, a large crusty roll which provided people in the city with cheap food during the Famine of the 1800s. 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door.'

'The plan is to keep going until the end of March, ' he said. 'We will keep doing it until we sense that people have had enough - and they will tell us via TripAdvisor or Twitter. 'We've had queues around the block. The majority of people get what we are about and they do not take it seriously.

"It's a heart stopping moment that Rex Wallman, 51, has carried with him since he was nine years old. Rex and his brother David, 11, had set out from their family sugar cane farm at Eimeo, then a village and now a suburb of the Queensland coastal city of Mackay, on the morning of March 21, 1972. They were only ten minutes behind their sister, 14-year-old Marilyn Joy Wallman  who had ridden on her bicycle at 7.42am  a short distance down a country lane to the Rural Youth Hall at the junction of Wallmans and Eimeo Road, Mackay to catch the 8am school bus. Scroll down for video . Spinning wheels: Ten minutes after 14-year-old Marilyn Wallman (pictured) took off on her bicycle for the school bus in Mackay, Queensland, her brothers came across her bicycle with its wheel still spinning on a track between  cane fields from which her brother Rex heard her muffled screams . Kidnapped: Marilyn Wallman's bicycle (pictured) on the track between cane fields where her brothers found it, her school hat and her bag with its contents strewn across the grass. They never saw their sister again . The two brothers followed the same route as their sister. Around one kilometre from home and just 300m before the youth hall, they and found Marilyn's bicycle. Her school bag was on the ground, its contents scattered in the grass. Her school hat lay a few metres away, in the six foot (183cm) high sugar cane which lined both sides of the track. The bicycle was on its side, its front wheel still spinning. David ran home to alert their mother, Daphne, while Rex  waited by the bicycle. Scouring the bush: In March 1972 local volunteers (pictured) searched fields and bush in a 160km radius of the Mackay suburb of Eimeo  for Marilyn Wallman, 14,  who was kidnapped on the way to school and murdered . Never gave up: John Wallman (left, with searchers in a cane field) never gave up looking for his only daughter after she was abducted, he and wife Daphne travelling as far as Western Australia when they received news of alleged sightings of  missing 14-year-old Marilyn . Body dumped: Police believe 14-year-old Marilyn Wallman was kidnapped in March 1972 at Eimeo in Mackay, murdered and her body dumped 40km inland at McGregors Creek where part of her skull was found in 1974 . Later, Rex would tell his parents he thought he heard Marilyn's voice from within the sugar cane, saying that her legs hurt, and muffled screams. He would never see or hear his sister again. When Mrs Wallman turned up with David, the three of them searched the area, Rex Wallman seeing a small creek bed clearly with marks 'where two people had walked through very recently', but the footprints soon became trampled over by searchers. In the ensuing days and weeks, hundreds of police and local volunteers walked shoulder to shoulder through the canefields and bush searching for Marilyn. The missing girl's father, John Wallman, accompanied his neighbours and police as they scoured more than 160 kilometres of roads, creeks and gullies in the district. Lost innocence: As hundreds of locals gathered  (pictured) to search, the news of Marilyn Wallman's probable abduction and murder changed attitudes and fearful parents began driving their children to school . Dams and properties were searched and hundreds of people interviewed. Police followed up a sighting of three cars seen on the same morning at the spot where Marilyn went missing, and interviewed two of the cars' owners. They failed to identify the third vehicle, which may have been a grey or blue Vauxhall which matched the car owned by Arthur Stanley Brown, whose name has been associated with several child murders. Police concluded she had been abducted and murdered and questioned several suspects, including convicted sex offenders, but no charges were laid. Abducted and murdered: Since his sister Marilyn (pictured) was murdered in 1972, Rex Wallman said he won't give up finding her killer 'till I die' The case sent shock waves around Australia and it changed the laid back attitude of Mackay's population, with many parents thereafter driving their children to school. As David Wallman said later, 'When we were kids we could go anywhere on our farm and the neighbours. We’d go off on our pushbikes, drive a tractor, go to the neighbours, mucked around with kids on our bikes. 'We’d have a time to be home by, and off we’d go, bare feet, we roamed the countryside and everyone felt safe. I don’t even think Mum and Dad had a lock on the door. 'Nobody would lock a door and I don’t think anyone had anything stolen. You’d walk straight into someone’s house and the doors’d open and there’d be no-one home.' Mrs Wallman later noted that both her sons were deeply affected afterwards, particularly Rex who was grilled by police about what he heard in the cane, asking him, 'Are you sure you’re not telling lies?'. Daphne and John Wallman continued to search for their daughter, going as far as Western Australia after people contacted them with possible sightings of Marilyn. Two years after Marilyn Wallman vanished, a railway worker found a partial skull in grass near McGregor Creek, about 40km from where her brother had found her bicycle. Queensland police conducted forensic tests on the skull with the help of the FBI and the New Zealand Institute of Environmental Science, but they proved inconclusive. Last year, they put the skull into a laboratory for DNA testing and made a breakthrough, matching it to DNA Taken from Marilyn Wallman's relatives. Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Mike Condon, who will announce the breakthrough today said the remains had been returned to Marilyn’s family 'who are obviously quite relieved and have never given up their drive to find out who is responsible for the murder'. Rex Wallman will speak about his sister at the media conference and has stated that he won't give up on finding his sister's killer 'until I die'. The Queensland Government is offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to Marilyn's killer. Anyone with information should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .","Marilyn Wallman, 14, vanished in 1972 on her way to school in Mackay .

"The  gun enthusiast who nearly killed his small town's police chief last week is a free man since cops couldn't find enough evidence to charge him and keep him behind bars. Sentinel, Oklahoma Police Chief Louis Ross was shot four times that morning while raiding a house in connection to a bomb threat at a school, and only survived thanks to a bullet-proof vest he borrowed at the last minute. Since he hasn't been officially charged, police have refused to officially name the man who shot Chief Ross, but the town's mayor has identified him as resident Dallas Horton. Before it was taken down, a Facebook page appearing to belong to Horton was littered with racially-charged posts making his shooting of African-American Ross even more sensitive. Scroll down for video . Shots fired: Sentinel, Oklahoma Police Chief Louis Ross (left) was shot four times in a raid of local resident Dallas Horton's (right) home on Thursday. He survived, thanks to a bullet-proof vest he borrowed . Police say a man claiming to be Horton called 911 early Thursday, saying there was a bomb set to detonate at the Community Action Center, where the Sentinel Public Schools has their head start program. However, an analysis of the call later revealed that the call did not originate from Horton's home. Chief Ross and two Washita County Sheriff's deputies didn't know about the call's origins when they went to Horton's home to investigate the threat around 6am. The humble white house on South 4th Street that Horton shares with wife Esther Marie boasts signs that say 'certified zombie killer' and 'warning zombies inside enter at your own risk'. Who made the call? Ross and two deputies with the Washita County Sheriff's Office were investigating a bomb threat against a local school. Earlier that morning a man claiming to be Horton called 911 to say a bomb had been planted at a local community center. Above, Horton's home . Beware: Signs hung up outside of Horton's home read 'certified zombie killer' and 'warning: zombies inside enter at your own risk' Since Chief Ross's bullet-proof vest was currently getting repaired, he had to borrow a spare from a sheriff's deputy before entering Horton's home. Thankful: The police chief's wife Mary Ross (pictured) said her husband's bullet-proof vest was out for repair when he got the call to investigate Horton. She says she's eternally grateful to the deputy who lent his vest to her husband and saved his life . It was a good thing he did too, since Horton shot him three times in the chest and once in the arm upon entering. Chief Ross's wife Mary says she's eternally grateful to the deputy who gave his vest to her husband, and saved his life. 'He allowed my husband to come home tonight,' Mrs Ross told KOCO. 'Had he not had that vest, my husband would not be here tonight.' Chief Ross was rushed to Hobart Hospital where he was treated for his minor injuries and released. Mrs Ross says her husband has bruises where the vest shielded the bullets. Horton and his wife were arrested in the aftermath, and he later told investigators that he didn't know  police  were breaking into his home, which Chief Ross finds skeptical. 'Don't know what he heard or didn't hear, screaming from five officers of the law announcing our presence, requesting to see hands,' Ross told KWTV. A family friend of the Hortons defended Dallas, to News on 6. 'He thought he was protecting his home and his wife. He didn't know what was going on until the door was busted down. And you have a right to protect your family and that's what he was doing.' Despite finding seven firearms and a explosive device in Horton's home, police say they didn't have enough evidence to charge him and he was released from jail later that day. Sentinel's Mayor Sam Dlugonski has known  Horton his whole life and described him to the Oklahoman as a 'gun enthusiast' and 'survivalist', adding that he seemed 'on edge'.  Horton's neighbor David Delk gave much the same description, saying he had a general mistrust of government, was unfriendly to neighbors and wore mostly black clothing. Social media: A Facebook profiled believed to belong to Horton showed several racially-charged posts around the time of the bomb threat . It has since been taken down . Hobbies: Locals who know Horton, including the mayor of Sentinel, have described him as a gun enthusiast and survivalist . Before the page was taken down, Horton's Facebook confirmed these interests in firearms with several images of himself holding up rifles. Around the time of the reported bomb threat, Horton was up posting about fear that Sharia law would spread to America. In another post he compared the U.S. to Nazi Germany and in another he criticized the White House sent officials to Michael Brown's funeral (who he called a thug) and none to Paris after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, according to Gawker. And the racially-charged posts didn't end there. According to Raw Story,  he also reposted an image of a blood-spattered truck which read: 'JUST DROVE THROUGH FERGUSON. DIDN'T SEE ANY PROBLEMS. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation continues to look into the incident. Meanwhile, Chief Ross will be travelling to Oklahoma City to meet with an orthopedic surgeon about his recovery, and feels lucky to be alive.","Sentinel, Oklahoma Police Chief Louis Ross survived the attack thanks to a bullet-proof vest he borrowed from a sheriff's deputy .

"Martin Janson takes a picture with his mother Jennifer and father Cees before leaving for Canada last year . After finishing school, saving up the money he earned working three jobs and heading overseas to Canada to spend a year working at the Whistler ski resort, Martin Janson was having the time of his life. His mum Jennifer describes her youngest child as 'happy and so vibrant' and 'an absolute treasure of a person' who never caused any trouble. But last year when Jennifer and husband Cees answered the door of their home in Hawkesbury, NSW, on September 3 they were left in shock when they were notified that their 19-year-old son had died from a drug overdose, a lethal combination of cocaine and sleeping pills. She has also spoken of how the family were affected by the drugs death of Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter, who overdosed on pills at a music festival last November. 'As parents we had no concept, we had no idea he was doing this', Mrs Janson told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's lots of parents out there that will say ""why didn't you know, surely you can tell"".' But she insisted the news left her, Martin's father Cees and his siblings Annekah and Russel completely floored. 'My daughter in particular is just devastated because she had no idea. 'She said to ""if I'd known mum, I would have said something"", Mrs Janson revealed. Janson was working at a ski field in Whistler, Canada - a spot popular among Australian tourists . Martin told his parents he had been promoted to 'ski concierge' for his efforts at the resort . 'So happy and vibrant': Martin, second from left in the back, had his whole life ahead of him . Martin had been working at the resort he was staying at and on Monday nights, as it was the quietest night of the week, many of the staff would go out and party. 'The last Skype conversation we have with him was on the 31st of August, it was a Sunday. 'We were sitting outside, it was a beautiful day here just before Spring,' Mrs Janson recalled through tears. 'He was just so happy and vibrant.' It was during this conversation Martin told his parents he was getting promoted to be a 'ski concierge', a 'coveted position' usually reserved for those who had been there much longer than three months. The 19-year-old also mentioned he was planning to take a trip to Mexico during the summer in Canada. Martin Janson left for his dream gap year to Canada last May . Martin (pictured left and right with father Cees), was taking drugs unbeknownst to his parents . 'I hope Georgina and Martin are up in heaven together': Ms Janson says the death of Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter (pictured) had a profound impact on the family . 'I was so upset, I said ""don't go to Mexico it's so dangerous there and there's so many drugs"",' Martin's mother said. Facebook messages discovered after Martin's death painted a vastly different picture of the youngest Janson sibling, one who did take drugs despite telling his parents he didn't. Mr and Mrs Janson sat their son down before he attended a music festival in the Hunter Valley month before his death and warned him of the dangers of taking drugs. He swore he would stay away from them. 'As a parent it's such an eye-opener, how do you change that conversation with your child?' Mrs Janson asked. The pathology results that came from the coroner said the combination of cocaine and a sleeping pill a friend gave him to help him sleep was a lethal mix. When the news broke that another 19-year-old, Georgina Bartter, had died of a drug overdose at a music festival, Mrs Janson said it was a second devastating blow for the family. Jennifer Janson wants to educate other parents and teenagers about drugs, describing her son Martin as 'an absolutel treasure of a person' 'It was so devastating, it was like we were going through the whole process of Martin dying again. 'For us it was like we've got to stop this, it can't happen again. 'I hope Georgina and Martin are up in heaven together.' Mrs Janson now hopes to get involved in drug education and is passionate about 'opening up the conversation' so no other parents have to experience what her family went through. The Janson family will travel to Canada for the first anniversary of Martin's death this September, and visit his grave every week. Mrs Janson said finding out the day after that her son had died almost made it twice as difficult. 'Martin had died twice, he died on the second of September and then on the third of September when we were notified. 'He was an absolute treasure of a person, he bought so much life and love to our home and all our friends. 'His impact was everybody was massive, young and old, he was just that sort of person that people gravitate to.","Martin Janson died in September from a drug overdose .

"A Qatari man who was declared an 'enemy combatant' by the Bush administration following the September 11, 2001 attacks  has been released from prison and returned home to Qatar. Ali al-Marri was arrested in December 2001 while attending graduate school in central Illinois. He was held without charge for nearly six years in a U.S. Navy brig in South Carolina where lawyers said he endured lengthy interrogations, isolation, and threats to harm his family. This March 10, 2009, file image of a courtroom drawing from U.S. District Court shows alleged al-Qaeda sleeper agent Ali al-Marri as he made an initial appearance with his attorney Andy Savage in Charleston, S.C. Al-Marri's nephew, Saleh Garallah Kahlah al-Marri, said Sunday that his uncle returned home and was greeted by representatives from the Qatari interior and foreign ministries. Marri, who was in his mid-40s, was detained as a material . witness to the September 11 attacks. Former President George W. Bush declared him an 'enemy combatant.' He entered the United States legally on Sept. 10, 2001 but was suspected of being an al Qaeda agent sent by the militant group to disrupt the U.S. financial system by hacking into bank computers. He admitted to training in al-Qaeda camps and staying in al-Qaeda safe houses in Pakistan between 1998 and 2001. He also admitted to having contact with accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, who allegedly helped the hijackers. At his trial, he expressed sorrow for helping al-Qaeda and said he never intended to hurt anyone. No evidence showed he had a specific mission in the U.S. But U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm determined that al-Marri's decision not to change course after the 9/11 attacks showed he intended to remain with the terrorist organization. Al-Marri could have faced up to 15 years in prison. Mihm sentenced him to only eight years and four months behind bars because of what the judge called his 'unacceptable' treatment in the Navy brig. Former President George W. Bush declared Marri an 'enemy combatant' He was charged with credit card fraud and lying to the FBI and held for 18 months before the U.S. government dropped the charges in 2003. The Supreme Court agreed in December 2008 to consider his challenge of his status as an 'enemy combatant' and he was handed over to civilian authorities to stand trial in Illinois. In 2009, Al-Marri pleaded guilty to one count of providing . material support and resources to a foreign terrorist . organization. Despite this, his lawyer, Andy Savage, confirmed that he has now been released from federal prison . in Colorado in the last few days and is at home in Doha, Qatar. Al-Marri's nephew, Saleh Garallah Kahlah al-Marri, said Sunday that his uncle  was greeted by representatives from the Qatari interior and foreign ministries. 'He is in high spirits,' Saleh al-Marri said. His nephew thanked Qatari officials for their help in getting al-Marri back home, saying they made 'tremendous efforts' to do so. However, he added that Al-Marri would not be making comments to the media because 'we want to give him an opportunity to reintegrate into society.' The U.S. Bureau of Prisons had no immediate comment. His lawyer said the speed of his client's departure came as a surprise.","Ali al-Marri was arrested by the FBI in December 2001 .

"Do you always go for the wrong men,  but have the most perfect pet? Then this relationship advice may be for you. A leading love expert has suggested there are parallels between picking the perfect partner and the way you choose your dog. Author and relationship coach Dr Annie Kaszina Ph.D - who is the first to admit she has her own chequered relationship history - discovered that by applying these principles she could finally make the right choices. Do you always go for the wrong men but have the most perfect pet? Love expert Dr Annie Kaszina (pictured) says there are parallels between picking the perfect partner and the way you choose your dog. When Annie met Orlandino it was love at first sight: the big brown eyes, the irresistible looks, the knack he had of making her laugh. But sadly, he wasn't a keeper. Beneath that charming exterior lay some unsavoury habits and a difficult and a very demanding personality. Orlandino was the dog from hell. What Annie learned from that encounter set her on the path to becoming a women's relationship coach. She learned her lesson, chose her second dog - and her current lovely partner - with a lot more care, and has since taught hundreds of women simple ways to spot the right man for them, using her pet as the template. Now Annie shares ten of her tips with Femail readers, inspired by her new book, entitled Do You Choose Your Dog More Carefully Than Your Husband?, which comes out on Valentine's Day. 1. Temperament is king . Mean, moody, and magnificent may sound exciting… So, too, may the idea of taking on a challenge, or 'taming' someone 'wild'. Unfortunately, they lead to hard work relationships; and hard work relationships lead to emotional exhaustion and breakdown. Better to look for someone sunny and sweet-natured. Think about the way a date projects himself on first meeting and beyond. Why would pessimism or negativity be an aphrodisiac? Snarliness towards waiters, children, and anyone outside the charmed circle of you and your date is a bad sign of things to come - same goes for dogs! Good manners are paramount . 2. Check the pedigree . Obviously, this is simpler with dogs than it is with people, and can't be settled on a first date. But then Rome wasn't built in a day, and nor should relationships be. You can listen to the way they talk about parents, family members, and friends. If they come across as Billy-no-mates, there is cause for concern. 3. Beware yappiness . Unless you're okay with saddling yourself with Mr I'm Great, Mr Alpha Male, Mr In Love With The Sound of His Own Voice, or Mr Life and Soul of the Party, be careful of over-talkers. Incessant talking on a first date may be a sign of nerves, but also a lack of interest in the other person and a lack of social skills. They need to take an interest in you too (This holds just as true for Strong, Silent Types). Asking non-intrusive questions is not rocket science. You want someone not just to have fun with, but someone who's fun to be around . 4. Good manners . This goes without saying. But it's not limited to table manners. Snarliness towards waiters, children, and anyone outside the charmed circle of you and your date is a bad sign of things to come. Selective good manners actually suggest that those manners are not deeply ingrained and may soon melt away. 5. Over-exuberance . Pushy does not mean keen. It means pushy. First date pushiness is the sign of someone who doesn't respect boundaries and will end up pushing you into emotional corners. 6. Good behaviour . Many a woman who has overlooked a little first date leering - at other women - has lived to rue the day. You have standards for how you would dress and behave on a first date. Your date should, too. If your date's behaviour violates your standards in any way that's a clear sign that you could be in for a rough ride. 7. Docility . You want your date to be sensitive and responsive to your wishes. Choosing your meal for you, unasked, or making decisions for you without consulting you is a clear sign of wanting to be top dog. Do you want to be reduced to playing Bottom Dog? 8. Playfulness . You want someone not just to have fun with, but someone who's fun to be around. That doesn't necessarily mean someone who acts like a kid - what long-term kids are actually looking for is second mummies. You want someone who you feel comfortable enough around to be silly with. 9. Beware rogue breeders . If you've been single for a while, friends may take it upon themselves to set you up with 'lovely dates'. Just because they find that date 'lovely' in the context in which they know them doesn't mean you will. You wouldn't buy a house just on the say-so of Mrs Bloggs three doors down. You always have to do your own due diligence. 10. Leave the paperwork at home . Women are terrible at playing 'Fantasy Future' - they go on a first date and, provided the man isn't an obvious freak or psychopathic monster, they get busy imagining their future life with that person. A first date is not designed to be a marriage contract., it's simply the start of getting to know another person. If you find yourself fantasising about that happy future, take a cold shower, or speak to a grounded friend.","Do you always go for the wrong men but have the most perfect pet?

"Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo attack, who has been buried in an unmarked grave in a suburb north west of Paris . The second Islamic terrorist behind the Charlie Hebdo attack has been buried in an unmarked grave as fresh questions emerged over why French authorities stopped monitoring him. Cherif Kouachi was interred just before midnight in a cemetery in Gennevilliers, a suburb in north west Paris, a day after his older brother Said was discreetly buried in the northeastern city of Reims. The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine, which killed 12 people. Cherif's family, including his widow, kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a 'pilgrimage site' for Islamists. The mayor of Gennevilliers, where the younger Kouachi brother lived had not wanted the funeral to go ahead, but said he had no legal means to block it. His burial comes after new details emerged over why authorities stopped monitoring him and his brother despite finding texts on his laptop, which had been seized in 2010 and the fact that one of them had travelled to Yemen in 2011. In one passage found on the laptop, entitled 'Operation Sacrifice', he eerily wrote about how he would carry out a terrorist attack. According to the New York Times he wrote: 'A mujahideen forces his way into the enemy's base or else a zone where there is a group and fires at point-blank range without having prepared an escape plan. 'The goal is to kill as many of the enemy as possible. The author will very likely die himself.' The paper also reported that both brothers had been watched by the intelligence services for three years but surveillance was dropped as they appeared 'non-threatening'. It was also been revealed that police tapped the phone of Djamel Begha, a jihadist prisoner who befriended both Cherif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who took hostages at a kosher supermarket. The taps revealed that they were planning to break Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem, who was convicted of bombing a Paris railway station in 1995, free from prison. Transcripts revealed the men frequently talking about 'books', code for weapons, and needing to find a 'new library', code for arms dealer. Cherif's burial comes after his brother Said was buried in his hometown of Reims yesterday. Its Mayor, Arnaud Robinet, said he'd 'categorically refuse' a request by Kouachi's family to bury him in the city where he lived until his death. Cherif and his brother Said, pictured,  killed 12 people when they attacked the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris . The burial of Cherif Kouachi comes a day after his brother Said, left, was buried in Reims. There are no plans as yet for the burial of fellow Paris attacker Amedy Coulibaly . He added: 'I don't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics. I don't want a place that promotes hate. 'He was buried last night, in the most discrete, anonymous way possible.' But speaking on BFMTV, Mr Robinet said he was forced to allow the burial by the government, which enforced a French law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence. There are no current plans to bury Amedy Coulibaly, who killed five people - including four hostages at a kosher market in Paris - before he was killed by police on January 9. Meanwhile anger erupted in a string of majority Muslim countries after Charlie Hebdo responded to the massacre by running another cartoon showing the Prophet Mohammed under the headline 'All is forgiven'. Protesters demonstrate in Niger against the new Charlie Hebdo cover, which shows a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed . The worst unrest has been in Niger, where at least five people were killed and some eight churches were torched yesterday. Around 1,000 youths wielding iron bars, clubs and axes rampaged through the capital, hurling rocks at police who responded with tear gas. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius condemned 'the use of violence' in Niger while President Francois Hollande said France was committed to 'freedom of expression', calling it 'non-negotiable'. In a speech, Hollande urged his compatriots not to change their habits, because 'to do so would be to yield to terrorism'.","Cherif Kouachi has been buried in an unmarked grave in a Paris suburb .

"Few gave the marriage between the socialite daughter of a disgraced Tory Minister and a Sikh ‘warrior’ much chance of success. But confirmation that the union between Alexandra Aitken and Inderjot Singh is indeed over has been overshadowed by claims from her controversial father that it was never a real marriage at all. Alexandra, 34, was best known as a party-loving socialite before becoming a Sikh and marrying an Indian law graduate she spotted at a temple. Socialite Alexandra Aitken's marriage to her Sikh ‘warrior’ husband Inderjot Singh appears to be over . The unlikely couple wed near the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in 2010 and three years later their relationship was reported to be on the rocks. Now former MP Jonathan Aitken has spoken about his daughter’s ‘marriage’ and stirred up controversy which is unlikely to go down well in his daughter’s adopted home. Speaking last week, Mr Aitken said: ‘They were not married and they are now detached. ‘It was more a colourful, folklore ceremony than a proper ceremony. I think both sides know the marriage is over, if it ever was a marriage. Their position is they are not married.’ Mr Aitken, 72, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, said his daughter remains in India, enjoying life as a follower of the Sikh religion. He added: ‘She has a devout, happy life near Amritsar living as a Sikh and is supported by her parents.’ Alexandra's father, former MP Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, said: ‘They were not married and they are now detached' Alexandra was known for being a party-loving socialite before becoming a Sikh and marrying an Indian law graduate she spotted at a temple . After years being photographed outside nightclubs and doing modelling work, Alexandra’s sudden conversion and love story shocked many close to her. The couple’s marriage was attended by more than 300 people at dawn – the holiest time of day in the Sikh religion. Extra blessings are said to come to couples who get married just before sunrise. Under Indian law the ceremony – called Anand Karaj – is legal under legislation passed by an act of parliament. Perhaps Mr Aitken’s doubts stem from his absence from the ceremony in October 2010. The bride’s twin sister Victoria was there but she was sworn to secrecy and her parents weren’t told until later. Alexandra had moved to Amritsar in northern India after apparently having a dream about a Sikh who would change her life. She noticed her future husband at the Golden Temple and spent a week beside him without exchanging a single word. She later said she knew she was ‘blindly in love’ and returned to the city a few weeks later to be introduced to him. Alexandra rapidly adopted Sikh traditions, refusing to cut her hair or even wax her eyebrows, using only a wooden comb and carrying a ceremonial knife. Recalling the moment she first saw her future husband, she said: ‘I was sitting on the roof of the Golden Temple at about 3am, and the most beautiful man I’d ever seen in my whole life walked in. ‘He seemed 100 per cent man, gentle and intuitive and poetic and sensitive, but also extraordinarily strong and manly. ‘And you don’t see many of these around. So I was like: “Oh wow!”’ Speaking about how her father took news of the marriage, she said in an interview: ‘When I said, “Daddy, I might be wearing a turban next time you see me”, it was a bit of a shock. ‘But my father loves my husband - it’s impossible not to. He’s happy for us.’ The unlikely couple wed near the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in 2010 and three years later their relationship was reported to be on the rocks.","Alexandra, 34, was best known as a party-loving socialite before becoming a Sikh and marrying an Indian law graduate .

The footage was captured during Twain's sentencing on Thursday. He was given a five-year fixed term and a 10-year indeterminate sentence for a string of aggravated assault charges and attempted murder. His neuro-psychologist Mark Corgiat found Twain has suffered from both PTSD and frontal-lobe damage to his brain due to a past car accident.

The probe will lead to urgent questions over why patients had to endure months of appalling treatment before officials intervened. A damning report by the health watchdog – which could have alerted residents’ families – was not published for eight months. There will also be fresh calls for a public hearing into the tragedy of an 85-year-old man who died 48 hours after the emergency evacuations. His death has been shrouded in secrecy, with officials refusing to name him despite the disturbing events leading up to it. Last night, the Care Quality Commission watchdog was branded a ‘disgrace’ for not closing the homes sooner. Families said they had long had concerns about poor care at Merok Park in Banstead, Surrey, and Grantley Court in Sutton, south London. But less than a year ago, both passed inspections by the commission. In the case of Grantley Court, inspectors did raise concerns over training and vetting of staff. Picture of health: Mrs Slann before she moved to the care home . But this was hidden from families for eight months as the CQC forgot to publish it online. Last night, Mrs Slann’s daughter Linda Cackett, 54, said she would never have let her mother stay at Grantley Court had she realised the CQC had already found faults with it. She added: ‘The whole thing is disgraceful. The CQC and local authorities should have been more vigilant. ‘How many other elderly people across the country must be suffering in substandard nursing homes?’ Grantley Court and Merok Park are both owned by Mauritian businessman Soondressen Cooppen, 51, and his wife Maleenee, 42. The couple, who own a £2million house on a gated estate in Cheam, are believed to have raked in £650,000 a year from each home. Families said the homes were run ‘on a shoestring’, with poor training and a lack of equipment. Grantley Court was criticised by CQC inspectors in January but this report was not published until September due to ‘administrative error’. During those eight months, Mrs Slann and other vulnerable residents were placed at the home without their loved-ones realising there were issues. It was Sutton Council which eventually gave the order to rescue the residents. Merok Park was given a clean bill of health in January last year, although families say it had been a ‘hovel’ for years. In September, staff at Surrey County Council asked the CQC to inspect it after raising concerns. But it took more than a month after this inspection for its evacuation to be ordered. On December 9, residents were left shivering in their pyjamas as the home was suddenly closed on one of the coldest nights of the year. Just 48 hours later, a man of 85 died. But the Surrey Coroner chose not to hold an inquest and his name is being kept secret. Have you, or any of your relatives, been affected by the scandals at Merok Park and Grantley Court care homes? If so, please email news@dailymail.co.uk. Winifred Lake, 91, who died a fortnight after being evacuated from Grantley Court, will also not have her death investigated. But it is understood police are probing injuries suffered by Mrs Slann and two male Grantley Court residents in their 80s and 90s. A Met spokesman said there had been no arrests and investigations continue. The Home Office is also looking at whether Merok Park staff were working here illegally. Last month health minister Norman Lamb vowed to prosecute owners of homes that provided ‘shocking’ standards of care. The Cooppens were unavailable for comment. Merok Park (above) was evacuated last year after Surrey County Council urged an investigation into standards there . A resident is stretchered out of the care home after being evacuated in the bitter cold last year . Bruised, malnourished and given five weeks to life: Granny after two months in care home . Smiling for the camera and enjoying time with her family, Edna Slann was a lively and happy grandmother. But a ten-week stay at one of Soondressen and Maleenee Cooppen’s nursing homes left the 89-year-old malnourished, badly bruised, scarred, and with an infection that will soon kill her. The widow – who has been given just weeks to live – is emaciated at little more than 5st, bed-ridden, and heavily medicated with morphine to numb the pain. Shocking: The widow has contracted a deadly infection after a bedsore went untreated while she was living at the home. Right, she is healthy before entering its care . She is one of three patients whose unexplained injuries at Grantley Court Nursing Home in Sutton, south-west London, are now are under investigation by police. Her family believe her rapid decline was caused by the poor care she received at the home and branded the Care Quality Commission’s handling of the case a ‘disgrace’. Her daughter Linda Cackett, 54, told the Daily Mail: ‘To think of her suffering and in pain for those weeks is horrendous. We feel so guilty. 'Had she not gone to Grantley Court she would still be getting up today and taking part in activities. She could have gone on for years.’ Outraged: Mrs Slann's daughter Linda Cackett says she would not have arranged for her mother to stay in Grantley Court had she been aware of concerns . Mrs Slann, who has dementia and was wheelchair bound due to arthritis, was moved from a residential home to Grantley Court in July when her health worsened. It is owned by Mauritian businessman Cooppen, 51, and his 42-year-old wife, who enjoyed lavish family parties in their homeland. According to Mrs Slann’s family, she was neglected from the outset and her health deteriorated rapidly, causing her to lose more than half a stone in just two months. Her daughter said Grantley Court staff did not keep records properly so she has had no explanation for how her mother came to need 12 stitches on her head and suffer severe facial bruising. And she says her mother now has not long left to live because of an infected bedsore on her foot that was not treated properly. When she was eventually taken to hospital, doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg below the knee – an operation she was unlikely to survive. Mrs Cackett, a book keeper from Epsom in Surrey, said: ‘The home was run on a shoestring. I’m surprised any residents survived.’ Mrs Slann was placed there in July by Surrey County Council, who allegedly told the family it was the only bed they could find. The £595-a-week cost of her stay was met by Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). In September, NHS officials moved her to a different home where staff found the bedsore on her foot and sent her to hospital.When they called Grantley Court staff to confront them, they were allegedly told it was ‘not that bad’. Mrs Slann, a grandmother-of-one, worked as a cleaner until she was 70. A Surrey council spokesman said when Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court the home had passed its most recent inspection. A Surrey Downs CCG spokesman said she had been relocated as soon as concerns were raised.","Two care homes owned by the same firm are being investigated by police .

"A leading economist is being questioned by police over claims he assaulted a prostitute after the pair smoked crack together. Professor Douglas McWilliams, executive chairman of influential City think-tank the Centre for Economic and Business Research, allegedly attacked Beverly Shearon at her flat in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Ms Shearon, 47, reportedly called police after she was left with a black eye and an injury to her hand, claiming McWilliams had 'flipped out' when a neighbour arrived at the one-bedroom flat. Douglas McWilliams (left) is being questioned by police over claims he assaulted Beverly Shearon (right) after the pair smoked crack together . Accused: Douglas McWilliams outside his London home today. He was reportedly questioned under caution . She claims the pair had smoked crack cocaine together, and she had performed a sex act on the married 63-year-old when he visited her unannounced on New Year's Eve. He reportedly left before police arrived, but was later questioned under caution by officers. 'He turned up at about 4pm and wanted a smoke. I was weak and let him,' Ms Shearon, who added that she was trying to quit her drugs habit, told The Sun's Michael Hamilton. Ms Shearon, who calls McWilliams 'Posh Rob', said his mood changed suddenly when a neighbour called in to wish her a Happy New Year. She alleged McWilliams, who she said had been a regular visitor to her home in the past year, had then attacked her in front of the well-wisher, before leaving the flat. She said she called police to her home, who took photographs of her injuries. Ms Shearon said McWilliams changed his behaviour when a neighbour arrived at her home in St Albans (above) to wish her a Happy New Year . Police arrived at the one-bedroom property and are said to have taken photographs of her injuries . 'Police are investigating an ABH assault which is alleged to have occurred at an address in St Albans at around 5pm on Wednesday, December 31st,' a Hertfordshire Police spokesman told MailOnline. 'A woman reported she had been assaulted, she suffered an injury to her hand and bruising to her face. 'A 63-year-old man from London has been interviewed under caution and investigations are on-going at this time. No drug offences are being investigated.' McWilliams has not commented on the claims. A CEBR spokesman told MailOnline the claims involving McWilliams were 'not a matter' for the think-tank. A representative of McWilliams told The Sun he had been unable to contact the economist since Friday evening. 'I am aware he has denied this lady's allegation,' he said. Former Professor of Commerce at Gresham College McWilliams is described on the CEBR website as 'one of the most widely quoted economists'. He set up the think-tank in 1992 having previously served as Chief Economic Adviser to the Confederation of British Industry and Chief Economist for IBM UK. The think-tank's website states: 'CEBR’s clients are mainly public, private, government, professional bodies and third sector organisations. Most are UK based although several have a global reach. We advise 25 of the FTSE 100 companies.' On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about his predictions regarding the British economy, writing: 'Prostitution and illegal drugs help UK overtake France in global wealth league.' It adds: 'We advise a number of UK government departments and independent government bodies. Recent projects include the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Arts Council England.' McWilliams has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, and in April estimated that voters would be £165 a year better off  by the time of May's General Election, giving Chancellor George Osborne 'rather more scope' for cutting taxes in the spring budget. He said: 'The Government – and especially George Osborne – have credibility in the City and partly because both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls do not.' In December the CEBR claimed Britain's economy would be larger than Germany's by 2030, and suggested that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world’s fifth largest economy. The growth in Britain’s national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries. On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about the predictions, writing: 'Prostitution and illegal drugs help UK overtake France in global wealth league.'

"It is a long time since all brides were expected to wear white. But the government is insisting that they must at least wear something, after ministers ruled out lifting the ban on nude weddings. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today rejected the idea of allowing naturist weddings, saying he had ‘absolutely no intention’ of allowing naked couples to tie the knot. Among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is British Naturism, the organisation that represent naturists and campaigns to combat prejudice against outdoor nudism . It was suggested last week that couples may be allowed to get married naked in naturist weddings under a rethink of marriage law. Ministers launched a consultation on staging ‘non-relgious’ marriages, which was seen as a move to give humanist ceremonies legal status. But among those expressing a view was British Naturism, which campaigns on behalf of thousands of members ‘against the ever-changing environment that constantly throws up new threats to our freedom’. In response Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation joked: ‘Some of these ideas are just silly. I hope there will be guidance for the best man at a nude wedding on where to keep the ring.’ The wedding law review is expected to look at sweeping reforms which could allow weddings in the open air, in people’s homes and gardens or with the couple and guests in the nude. But Mr Grayling today insisted that wedding parties had to keep their clothes on. He insisted that he had not ordered a review into naked weddings, despite coming under pressure from British Naturism. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today insisted that wedding parties had to keep their clothes on. He told BBC One’s Sunday Politics: ‘There’s a difference between somebody expressing an interest and it actually happening. 'At the moment we are looking at the issue of humanist marriage, but it’s something that’s being reviewed by the marriage law commission.’ He added: 'No nude marriage right now as far as I’m concerned.’ Presenter Andrew Neil joked: ‘I’m sure they’ll be appalled. Mind you, the weather’s quite cold out there at the moment.’ The paper last week by the Ministry of Justice confirmed that among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is British Naturism. It said naturists could qualify to conduct weddings if the rules were changed. At the moment wedding law allows couples to have a traditional wedding in church, under rules set by the Church of England and other churches with the right to conduct the ceremonies, or a civil wedding in a register office or ‘approved premises’. Approved premises, which include stately homes, hotels and sports ground entertainment suites, have proved highly popular since they were introduced in the 1990s. Only Jews and Quakers are allowed to marry in their own homes, under laws from 1753 which released them from the requirement to be married by the Church of England. Tony Blair’s government tried to introduce a law to allow people to get married anywhere they liked in 2000, but dropped the idea in the face of the complications involved. The 2013 Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act said ministers would review whether ‘non-religious belief organisations’, like humanists, should also be able to conduct weddings. The consultation response from the Ministry of Justice last week said that humanists were anxious to hold weddings in the open air or at places couples find ‘meaningful’, which could mean a preferred holiday beach, the place where they met, a place where a parent’s ashes were scattered, or even a football pitch. But it said that there was a risk that criminal gangs running sham or forced marriages would move in, and that ‘inappropriate’ organisations could win the right to run marriages. ‘There was a risk that any group, including those with a cult following, could potentially qualify if they could show their purpose as the advancement of beliefs and the ethics associated with those beliefs, or could successfully have it determined that they were being discriminated against if excluded from conducting legal ceremonies,’ the paper said. It added: ‘The groups identified as a risk included political organisations, Jedi Knights, Hell’s Angels, radicalised groups and criminal gangs involved in forced marriage.’ One critic of reform, it said, feared that pressure groups would try to conduct marriages to raise funds for their cause. The Ministry of Justice paper said that the Government law reform advisers, the Law Commission, will be asked to ‘begin as soon as possible a broader review of the law concerning marriage ceremonies. ‘An independent review should be able to examine all the issues arising from the consultation alongside all other relevant matters. The Government will start to work with the Commission in January to consider the scope of such a review.’","Chris Grayling says he has 'no intention' of backing naked weddings .

"An asylum seeker is pictured with his lips sewn together in this handout picture provided by the refugee action coalition, taken inside the Manus Island detention centre on January 13 . Two-thirds of asylum seekers at Manus Island are on hunger strike and up to 14 people have sewn their lips together to protest against a plan to move them to Papua New Guinea. Asylum seekers began hunger strikes last week at the Australian-run asylum-seeker processing centre, demanding the immigration department halt a scheduled January 22 transfer of 50 male detainees to temporary, insecure housing in Lorengau, the Manus capital. Up to 700 people have been refusing to eat and in some cases drink in the protests that have been escalating over the past week, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Asylum seekers have also written to Manus Island service providers asking that their organs be donated should they die in detention. 'As you see, hunger strike spreads all over the center and everyday more and more of us become unconsciousness and faint. This means we are entering a critical phase in our medical status,' the letter reads. 'All asylum seekers on Manus Island in hunger strike ask you to hand over our medical records to organ donation organisation in case of our fatalities inside the cage. 'This way at least a part of us may one day feel sweet taste of FREEDOM.' Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has said the situation was volatile and urged those involved to refrain from self harm. Refugee advocates said riot officers raided one compound in the early hours of Sunday, seizing ring leaders and placing them in isolation to stop the protest. Scroll down for video .

Asylum seekers have also written to Manus Island service providers asking that their organs be donated should they die in detention . But a PNG government spokesman told AAP there was 'no such incident' and that the raid did not happen. Labor believes the federal government should tell Australians what is going on at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea amid conflicting claims about the protest. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said in a statement that men had to burrow under a perimeter fence to reach bottled water left outside the compound. But a spokesperson for Mr Dutton said food and water continued to be available to the protesters, and most men at the centre received meals on Sunday. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss could not confirm details on Sunday but said Mr Dutton would be seeking to do that.

Up to 700 people have been refusing to eat and in some cases drink in the protests that have been escalating over the past week . 'The flow of information is not always reliable,' Mr Truss told reporters in Brisbane. He reiterated the government message that people who arrived by boat without a visa would not be resettled in Australia. 'You won't be able to get your way into this country through some kind of illegal people smuggling operation or by, for that matter, put up an argument that somehow or other you are being badly treated now and therefore should be granted access to this country,' Mr Truss said. Opposition leader Bill Shorten says Australians are sick and tired of the culture of secrecy surrounding the asylum seeker processing centre there. 'Australians will normally give support to their government on tough matters - if people are told the truth,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday.

"A little girl who had been suffering from a rare form of cancer gave her best friend, and fellow sufferer, some surprise news to cheer her up. 'Juni! You're going to Disneeeylaaaand!' Violet, 4, said excitedly in a video to her chum who is just 3. Both girls were having cancer treatment for retinoblastoma which affects the eye after meeting  at Seattle Children's Hospital. The girls became friends the moment they met as they went through treatment together. Scroll down for video... You will go to Disney! Violet, now 4, announced to her friend on YouTube that she was heading to Disney! 'You're going to Disneyland!' she squealed . Happy news: Juniper cheered when she saw the video. 'That's my friend Violet!', she said as she watched . Best friends: Juniper and Violet are best friends who are both battling the same rare form of cancer . The girls bonded over their love of Disney characters. Violet always wanted to meet Mickey Mouse and Juniper is a huge Minnie Mouse fan. The idea for Juni's trip came after Violet was sent to Disney thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation in December 2013. The charity allowed her to break the news to Juni by appearing in a heartwarming video which has now been posted on YouTube. Dressed in a shimmering Cinderella costume she wore on her own Make-A-Wish trip, Violet dances around her her bedroom. 'You're going to twirl like a princess,' she said as she twirled around. 'And do your princes pose. And wave like a princess,' she continued. Violet told her friend about everything she could expect to see, including 'Mickey and Minnie nose-kisses.' Dreams come true: Violet went to Disneyland first, and when she heard her friend Juniper was going, she wanted to send her off with a farewell video -- while wearing a Cinderella costume . Expectations: Violet told her friend about everything she could expect to see, including 'Mickey and Minnie nose-kisses' Nose-to-nose: Violet's wish came true in December 2013, thanks to Make-A-Wish Foundation . 'Juni, I'm so happy your wish is coming true,' Violet said into the camera. 'I love you.' Danielle Ouellette, Juniper's mother, says her daughter cheered when she saw the video. 'She was super excited to see Violet and she knows what Disneyland is, so she got really excited,' she said. She told ABC News that having Violet and her family around during their 6 months of chemotherapy was a huge help. She said they called the duo 'the flower girls,' because Juniper and Violet are both named for flowers. When Juniper saw Violet's video, she kept repeating 'That's my violet! That's my friend!' Ms. Ouellette said. She said Juniper's trip to Disneyland helped her heal after the emotional and physical toll of her cancer treatment. Mutual support: The girls were cancer treatment buddies battling retinoblastoma, a rare form of cancer that starts in the eye . Lucky: Violet's wish came true in December 2013, thanks to Make-A-Wish Foundation and she also visited Disney . 'During her cancer treatment, Juniper shut down,' she told CNN. The cancer treatment destroyed her right eye, and she grew embarrassed after being fitted with a prosthetic. But Juniper regained her confidence during her trip. 'The video has captured our hearts here at Make-A-Wish and we are excited to see that Violet and Juni were so enthusiastic about meeting Minnie and Mickey Mouse,' said Make-A-Wish spokesperson Josh deBerge. 'The two tiny voices of a 3-year-old and a 4-year-old paint the perfect, simple picture of what we do at Make-A-Wish every day: give hope and strength to kids battling life-threatening medical conditions, helping them feel better and sometimes, even get better.' The organization has 61 chapters nationwide and grants 14,000 wishes a year, with Disney engaging in one of every two wishes the nonprofit grants. Violet and Juniper are both in remission but because they only live an hours drive away from one another, they continue to have magical play dates together. Moral support: Juniper's mom, Danielle Ouellette, said  having Violet and her family around during their six-months of chemotherapy was a huge help .","Violet and Juniper have been battling cancer together since November 2013 .

"A woman who wet herself on a scary ride was horrified to discover a photo of her unfortunate accident is being used to promote the Amusement Park. The woman lost control of her bladder on a ‘terrifying’ horror maze, ‘CornEvil’ which is strictly restricted to people 16 years and over at Spookers Haunted Attraction Scream Park in New Zealand . A photo of a woman leaving the attraction with an embarrassing wet patch has been used on the amusement park’s Facebook page, accompanied with the slogan ‘P*** your pants scary!’ The post has attracted more than 1000 likes and the woman involved says she has been completely humiliated, even though her face is not shown in the photo. Scroll down for video . Spookers Haunted Attraction Scream Park made this image their 'cover photo' on Facebook. Even though the woman's face is not included in the image, she claims to have been humiliated when friends and family identified her by her clothing . The woman wet herself in 'CornEvil', a newly updated horror maze in Auckland, which is so terrifying that it is restricted to people 16 years and over . The woman, who did not wish to reveal her identity, complained to the media about her embarrassing moment being showcased so publically, explaining that family and friends have mocked her after recognising her by her clothing. She demanded that the photo be taken by Spookers, according to the New Zealand Herald. The newly updated maze is only open after dark and uses actors who chase the ‘victims’ with chainsaws – making it seem slightly understandable how the woman could have lost control of her bladder. In fact, Spookers management claims on average five people wet themselves every evening. However, a friend who was there on the night insists that the woman involved wet herself as she couldn’t stop laughing, not out of terror. The woman contacted New Zealand media about the incident. This left the Spookers staff perplexed, wondering why the woman still hadn't at any point made her concerns known to the company . The 'Scream Park' is only opened at night and uses 'terror actors' who they describe as 'dressed up, made up, and desperate to scare you . An aerial view of the terrifying maze at Spookers Haunted Attraction Scream Park . Yet when reached for comment, the Scream Park explained that they were puzzled why they had not been approached by the woman making the complaints. Furthermore, at the time of the interview they had been unable to locate her. Spookers managing director Julie Watson was perplexed as to why the woman involved spoke to the media and never contacted the amusement park directly. 'We've heard nothing from the woman, nothing from her friends, nothing from her family. 'We've had that photo up on our page for about a week and half now.’ Ms Watson insists that, if contacted, they would have happily taken the photo down. '(If she had contacted us) we'd take it down straight away, that's not a problem at all. ‘If she had been so upset about it, then why haven't they contacted us?’ Spookers explain that in the maze, the actors 'come out crawling, moaning, groaning, screaming or exploding with chainsaws running' She also pointed out that visitors have ample warning that photos will be taken and the company reserve the right to publish the images as they wish. ""We do have a sign saying we take photos for promotional reasons but if people call us we remove the photos from Facebook immediately."" She explained to Daily Mail Australia that Spookers had not been able to locate the woman. 'You can't tell who it is and we don't even know because she hasn't contacted us. ‘The photo doesn’t appear in full (revealing the woman’s identity) anywhere on the Internet.’ The managing director insists that people wet themselves so frequently at the ‘scream park’ that they have often used the slogan ‘p*** your pants scary’ in promotional campaigns and on bumper stickers. The woman insists that she wet her pants from laughing too much - not out of terror . She also recalled that most people are amused when they wet themselves, with a tendance to ‘walk out and make a scene about it’. There were mixed reactions from the public online, as Social Media users took to Facebook to share their opinion. Some people were outraged that Spookers had chosen to make the image public. ‘I think its very bad taste and i wouldnt come to spookers in the future. You obviously get a kick out of peoples embarrasment and humiliation (sic),’ wrote one person. ‘Spookers - we are your future customers, think twice how you treat your customers.’ The amusement park insist they would have taken the image down if the woman had contacted them directly . However the majority of people took a lighter view of the situation, with many people taking the opportunity to play around with puns. ‘Its all just a bit of fun, nothing wrong with taking the p*** every once in a while,’ someone wrote. The debacle came to a conclusion when the woman finally made contact with Spookers Scream Park, resulting in an apology and the decision that the infamous image could stay. ‘Spookers has just been contacted by the lovely person in the cover photograph,’ the company confirmed on Facebook. ‘We have talked through the way the photo has been handled, and together we have come to an arrangement that includes an agreement that the photo can continued to be used. ‘We really appreciate her generous gesture to Spookers in allowing this, and have apologised for the embarrassment that she has felt.’ The 'Scream Park' is open in two locations in New Zealand and is now looking for a site in Australia.

"Islamic State terrorist Mohamed Elomar has taken to social media to claim his former mentor Sheik Feiz Mohammed and Islamic cleric Sheik Abu Ayman are working as spies. Following the Hyde Park riot in 2012, Sheik Feiz described the behaviour of the former Sydney boxer and other extremists as 'unacceptable'. It is understood that the tweets were made by an account linked to Elomar on Twitter but Sheik Ayman has refused to comment, The Daily Telegraph reports. In his latest online tirade, the tweet claims the pair are working with the ASIO and called Sheik Ayman a 'murtad' which means a person who was born to a Muslim family who later rejects Islam.

Rahman's family has made a desperate plea after the 23-year-old's father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities in a bid to bring their son back home, The Daily Telegraph reports. Mr Rahman has been told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they are monitoring his son's every movement overseas. His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to join the death cult in Syria. 'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph. 'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.' Chilling photographs emerged on social media of Melbourne man Rahman posing with a silver rifle AK47 .

"It encourages unknown musicians to unleash their hidden talents on members of the public. No, this isn’t the premise for Simon Cowell’s latest TV talent contest. Instead, it is a concept pioneered by a British artist that sees brightly-coloured pianos dotted around cities across the world and inviting people to play them. British artist Luke Jarram created the 'Play Me, I'm Yours' project that sees brightly-coloured pianos dotted around cities across the world and inviting people to play them . The idea, which has become something of a global phenomenon since it launched in 2008, was created by Luke Jarram. He came up with the ‘Play Me, I’m Yours’ project believing it would inspire spontaneous communication between strangers. Mr Jarram first placed 15 pianos across Birmingham after the project was commissioned by Fierce Earth. The project becoming an instant success. Ayham al-Ahmed, a resident of Damascus' Yarmuk Palestinian refugee camp, plays the piano in the middle of the street near destroyed buildings . An audience watch a performance in London.

It was estimated that over 140 000 people played the pianos or listened to others play. Since then, more than 1,300 pianos with a simple instruction - ""Play Me, I’m Yours"" - have already been installed in 45 cities across the globe, reaching about six million people worldwide. Street pianos, often renovated by other artists or local communities, have appeared in city squares, parks, bus shelters, train stations, markets, bridges, ferries, and other public places.

More than 1,300 pianos with a simple instruction - ""Play Me, I’m Yours"" - have already been installed in 45 cities across the globe, including Sydney, Australia . The idea, which has become a global phenomenon since it launched in 2008, was created by British artist Luke Jarram . ‘The idea for Play Me, I’m Yours came from visiting my local launderette,’ said Mr Jarram. ‘I saw the same people there each weekend and yet no one talked to one another. ‘I suddenly realised that within a city, there must be hundreds of these invisible communities, regularly spending time with one another in silence. ‘Placing a piano into the space was my solution to this problem, acting as a catalyst for conversation and changing the dynamics of a space.’ A woman dances on the piano in Cambridge.

"Popular pooch: Labradors are the UK's favourite dog . From bulldogs to border collies and great Danes to greyhounds, Britain is indisputably a nation of dog lovers. But now data has emerged which shows that the type of pooches we chose to take home as pets could be entirely down to postcode. An analysis of ten years’ worth of microchip data has revealed for the first time Britain’s favourite dog breed by area – with some startling results. By far, the most popular dog breed across England, Wales and Scotland is the Labrador retriever, with more than 509,000 tagged by pet registration companies Petlog and Animalcare in the past decade. In second place came the Jack Russell terrier with more than 376,000 animals tagged, while the Staffordshire bull terrier was third, with 356,000, according to the BBC. The Labrador retriever tops the list in almost every county, but there are pockets of areas in which Britons favour another – such as Sunderland, in the North East, where Staffordshire bull terriers are most popular, or Llandrindod Wells in Wales where Border Collies reign supreme. The data, which included five million dogs but excluded the numerous types of crossbreeds, also revealed that Liverpool was the most popular postcode for fashionable shih tzus, while greyhounds are the dog of choice in Halifax, West Yorkshire. And the Jack Russell terrier is top breed for those living in the West of the UK, with more Jack Russells than any other dog being tagged in Northern Ireland, Plymouth, Truro, Bristol, Gloucester and South Wales. Perhaps unsurprisingly, physical space also dictates the breed, with Londoners choosing smaller dogs such as dachshunds while in the Shetlands, the most popular breeds are the large Border Collies. Scroll down for video . Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko explained why Labrador retrievers, Jack Russell terriers and Staffordshire bull terriers are such popular breeds and said that they are ‘wonderfully loyal, easily-trained breeds, suitable for single owners, couples or families’. She also told the BBC: ‘Labradors are very popular working dogs and are equally as happy spending a day out in the field or in the woods as they are curled up on the sofa with their family.’ The other breeds tagged most frequently by Petlog and Animalcare include the cocker spaniel, German shepherd, golden retriever, border terrier, Rottweiler, cavalier King Charles and Chihuahua. According to the Pet Food Manufacturer’s Association, which carries out an annual pet population survey, about 25 per cent of all households own a dog - which equates to more than 8.5 million across the British Isles. Prof Lance Workman, of the University of South Wales, who has researched the psychology of dog ownership trends, told the BBC that when choosing a dog ‘sometimes the heart rules over the head’. Referring to the recent London trend for dachshunds, he said: ‘They are certainly livelier than they look and can be a bit boisterous and aggressive, so they may not be the best dogs for small flats. By far, the most popular dog breed across England, Wales and Scotland is the Labrador retriever, with more than 509,000 tagged by pet registration companies Petlog and Animalcare in the past decade . ‘People need to not only look at the size of the dog but the breeds and their temperaments.’ The data from the study was taken from the past ten years – the the average lifespan of a dog - from Petlog and Animalcare, two of the UK’s three biggest microchipping firms, covering about 60 per cent of all dogs in the country. The BBC said crossbreeds were excluded as these are the most popular dog in all postcodes and have numerous permutations. It added that some dogs may have been incorrectly chipped while owners of breeds classed as dangerous dogs are less likely to get their dog chipped. From 2016, chipping data may become a more accurate reflection of dog popularity, as it becomes the legal responsibility of all owners in England to chip their pet.","New data shows type of dog we choose could be down to our postcodes .

"Already known as the ‘happy slam’ in tennis, the Australian Open is now planning to be the biggest one as well, and some Disney magic this year will also make it an occasion for all the family. Tennis Australia plans to expand the tournament site in Melbourne to Federation Square. The multi-million dollar expansion would dwarf that of rival grand slams at Wimbledon, and the French and US Opens. But this is just the beginning. The Herald Sun reported that Tennis Australia is also seeking the green light from Melbourne City Council to create an entertainment precinct that would run from Federation Square along the banks of the Yarra past Birrarung Marr Park to Batman Avenue. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression shows an overhead view of the revamped tournament site in Melbourne . This redeveloped site will have a bridge leading into the new precinct at Melbourne Park . Part of the envisaged new bridge that will connect Melbourne’s CBD with its famous sporting precinct . The Rod Laver Arena will still remain the centrepiece of the multi-million dollar expansion . And fairy tales will not be restricted to the court this year either as Disney is making its debut at the event. To attract families over the tournament’s final week of play when the secondary stadium at Melbourne Park - the 10,500 seating Hisense Arena – is empty, it will be transformed into a mini-Disneyland theme park and movies like the blockbuster Frozen, Big Hero 6 and The Lion King will be shown. One of the tournament’s major drawcards 20-year-old Eugenie Bouchard of Canada is also very popular with teenage fans, and it’s hoped that the combination of both will keep children and teenagers happy over the course of the event. On day one of the Australian Open young fans were already getting into the swing of things . Costumes of all shapes and sizes will be on view in Melbourne over the next two weeks . The new entertainment zone would be temporary and removed at the end of the tournament each year before being set up again the following season. Plans for a new pedestrian footbridge to connect Melbourne’s CBD with its famous sporting precinct as part of a $348 million upgrade will help facilitate this. ‘Once the bridge is open it will create a clear and legible pedestrian route straight to the heart of the city from Melbourne Park which can incorporate entertainment facilities here,’ a spokesman for Major Projects Victoria said. ‘The new bridge creates an opportunity for entertainment facilities to be put in this area. It creates a great chance to capitalise on this opportunity.’ Eugenie Bouchard, 20, of Canada will be a big hit with the event's teenage fans who will also get to experience Disneyland this year too . Australian tennis fans were out in force on the first day of the tournament in Melbourne . The zone would free to the public and feature a variety of entertainment such as live music, gourmet dining, children’s play areas, and bars. Tennis Australia has already approached the local council and is hopeful the project will be approved in time for the 2016 tournament. TA’s commercial director Richard Heaselgrave told the Herald Sun that talks with Melbourne City Council would resume as soon as this year’s tournament finishes. 'The vision is to take the entertainment we already have and put rocket fuel into it,' he said. Former Australian Open champion Boris Becker holds the trophies of the men's singles and women's singles with ball kids ahead of the first day's play . 'We have the ability to double our site and that’s our plan. We are an entertainment festival and we want to make it more accessible to more people.' Mr Heaselgrave said tournament chiefs also wanted to expand the tennis festival from two to three weeks and believed their objectives 'aligned' with those of Lord Mayor Robert Doyle. 'It’s free, it’s entertainment, it involves the population of Melbourne and incoming tourists - you can tick all of those boxes,’’ he said. 'The vision is entertainment, some tennis, some food and wine, some kids entertainment, some music. Viva Espana: A Spanish tennis fan holds up a Spanish flag in front of the Rod Laver Arena . Mr Heaselgrave said the Open was about more than just tennis. He said that although it was still a great grand slam event, it could do much more as an entertainment vehicle. He said the entertainment zone 'would certainly not be devoid of tennis with plans ranging from many partner-inspired tennis activations to an idea for a special practice court on the banks of the Yarra.' The sun beams down on the Margaret Court Arena as Australia's Jarmila Gajdosova and Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania play in their first round match on Monday . Heaselgrave said increased entertainment was integral to the Open’s future. Melbourne Park is regarded as the most modern and functional of the four grand slam events. It has three major courts equipped with retractable roofs after the completion of the $366 million first phase redevelopment. The event is aiming to break attendance and commercial records this year with a target of 700,000 spectators over the next two weeks if the weather remains good.","Tennis Australia plans to expand the tournament site in Melbourne to Federation Square .

"The mother of murdered schoolboy Breck Bednar warned police about his killer but they did not act despite him being on two crime databases . The mother of murdered schoolboy Breck Bednar has spoken of her fury after it emerged his sadistic killer was on two national crime databases but the police did not act. Breck's mother Lorin LaFave was told on Thursday that her son's killer Lewis Daynes, 19, was on both the Police National Computer and the Police National Database (PND) following a sexual assault and rape allegation. But despite that Surrey Police did not take action when Ms LaFave, 47, told them of her concerns about Daynes. Two months after she warned the police he was grooming Breck, 14, Daynes lured her son to his flat in Essex and stabbed him to death. Daynes killed the boy in what was described in court as a 'sexual and sadistic' attack before calling 999 to claim he had stabbed him following an 'altercation'. Ms LaFave, 47, told the Sunday People: 'It's unforgiveable. It was there in black and white that another boy of Breck's age had accused Daynes of grooming him and then sexually assaulting him. 'All it needed was for the police to run his name through the system and they would have noticed the pattern. 'But no one picked up on it and now my son is dead. I felt like dying when I found out. I still feel like dying now.' Until now, Breck's family thought Daynes' alleged crimes had been missed by Surrey Police because they were recorded in Essex, but the new information suggests this was not true. That is because the allegations, which the Crown Prosecution Service decided against pressing charges over, were logged on to the systems which can be accessed by any police force. Breck (left), 14, was killed in a 'sadistic and sexual' attack by Lewis Daynes (right), 19, at his flat in Essex . Lorin LaFave, Breck's mother, has been told that Daynes was on both the Police National Computer and the Police National Database when she warned police about him . Daynes' name was added to the PND just weeks before tragic Breck and some of his friends met the killer online. Ms LaFave said: 'We thought the previous allegations were missed because Daynes never went to trial over them – just one of those tragic things that couldn't be helped. 'But I got a call from Essex Police on Thursday that confirmed the accusations were recorded – not once, but twice. 'They went on the Police National Computer in September 2011 after the allegations were first made, then ­added to the Police National Database in March 2013. I was completely shocked. It makes Breck's death all the more difficult to deal with, knowing that something could have been done to stop it.' Home Office guidance on the PND says that it is 'crucial' that police forces use the system consistently. Tragic: Daynes lured Breck (pictured) to his flat in Grays, Essex, before stabbing him to death . But it was not in Breck's case and two months after his mother's worried 30-minute call to the police, her son was brutally murdered at Daynes' flat in Grays' Essex. Yesterday it emerged that the 999 handler who took the call from Ms LaFave had resigned. The call handler has stood down and another staff member has been served with a misconduct notice by the police watchdog, which is investigating how the force responded to claims the boy was being groomed in the months leading up to his murder. A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'A review of our call-handling centre has been carried out and changes have been implemented to improve the way information is handled and shared. 'There is an independent investigation led by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and we cannot comment further at this time.'","Killer of 14-year-old Breck Bednar was on two national crime databases .

"It has been released to mark one of the most important moments in British history. But a commemorative coin depicting King John issuing Magna Carta 800 years ago has been criticised for a glaring historical inaccuracy. Experts say that depicting the king holding the parchment charter in one hand and a quill in the other is a ‘schoolboy error’. 'Schoolboy error': The Royal Mint's £2 coin shows King John holding a quill and the Magna Carta on the 'tails' side, but a historian says it should show him using a royal seal . Historian Dr Marc Morris used Playmobil figures show how the Magna Carta would have been signed with a royal seal - not a quill . Historian Dr Marc Morris said Magna Carta was not signed by King John, who instead would have used a wax seal to endorse and authenticate documents. The official display mount for the £2 coin issued by the Royal Mint also shows the monarch signing the document with a quill. But Dr Morris said: ‘To depict King John holding a quill is simply a schoolboy error. ‘Medieval kings did not authenticate documents by signing them, they did it by sealing them – or rather by getting one of their officials to do it for them. All the pen in John’s hand symbolises is ignorance of this basic fact.’ Expert opinion: Dr Morris said all the coin symbolises is 'ignorance' of facts . Dr Morris, 41, the author of books including King John: Treachery, Tyranny and the Road to Magna Carta, posted a picture on Twitter showing the scene recreated with toy Playmobil figures. The presenter of Channel 4’s 2003 show Castle joked: ‘A far more accurate depiction of what went on at Runnymede than that produced by the Royal Mint.’ King John agreed Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history. Meaning ‘The Great Charter’, it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law, and had the right to fair trial. Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived. The Royal Mint defended the coin, saying it was intended to be ‘symbolic’ and not a ‘literal account of what actually occurred’. A spokesman added: ‘The design is in fact inspired by King John’s royal seal.’ Last night the coin remained on sale for £10 on the Royal Mint website, with a footnote saying: ‘The image used on this coin packaging is a well-known visual representation of historical events from the time, and not factual depiction. The Royal Mint understand that the Magna Carta was in fact witnessed and sealed by King John and not physically signed.’ The coin was designed by John Bergdahl, who also created the official coins to celebrate Prince George’s christening and a silver £20 coin to mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War. The 800th anniversary coin, designed by artist John Bergdahl, is on sale for £10 with a medieval-inspired display mount .","Historian says Royal Mint made 'schoolboy error' on £2 Magna Carta coin .

"Tony Blair is to face calls in Parliament to open up his finances to public scrutiny after earning millions from foreign states. MPs are to demand an end to the earnings and business interests of former prime ministers remaining secret. It follows growing questions about Mr Blair's work for controversial foreign governments and businesses including Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. MPs are to demand an end to the earnings and business interests of former prime ministers like Tony Blair remaining secret . Mr Blair has denied being motivated by money and has dismissed reports he has amassed £100million since leaving office as 'greatly exaggerated'. But because he is not an MP or a Lord his finances are not published or open to scrutiny. A parliamentary motion will be tabled tomorrow by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who accused Mr Blair of bringing the country into 'disrepute'. In particular he argues it is wrong for a former British Prime Minister to be paid to advise another sovereign state. Mr Bridgen says ex-PMs should be bound for life by the seven principles of public life, known as the Nolan principles, which include accountability and openness. He told MailOnline: 'I am proposing a change of the rules governing the conduct and accountability of former Prime Ministers and brinigng them under the Nolan prociples of public life. 'If Tony Blair had 10 per cent of the integrity that he claimed to have when in offie he would be spearheading this campaign and I wouldn't have to do any of this. 'I believe he has bought the office of Prime Minister into disrepute and is bringing the constitution and our country into disrepute. 'He is the only former Prime Minister to work for another sovereign government. I don't think that anyone who has held the highest office in our country and knows our secrets should work for another country.' A parliamentary motion will be tabled tomorrow by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who accused Mr Blair of bringing the country into 'disrepute' Mr Blair has faced criticism for agreeing a deal to advise the developers of a gas pipeline backed by the government of Azerbaijan, which has been accused of human rights abuses. His clients have also included the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. As a former Prime Minister, Mr Blair can claim up to £115,000 a year for his public duties. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'It's up to parliamentarians to decide what they want to discuss.' Mr Blair returned to Parliament last week to be grilled over his role in the controversial 'comfort letter's given to IRA suspects telling them they were not wanted in connections with the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Mr Blair, who is the UN’s Middle East peace envoy, gave evidence to MPs about the ‘on the runs’ programme after evading an appearance for more than nine months. During a heated two-hour session, Mr Blair was told the ‘unsavoury’ scheme, drawn up following pressure from Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, had left victims feeling ‘hurt and betrayed’. But the former PM said the letters were ‘absolutely critical’ to the peace process and an ‘essential component’ in getting Sinn Fein to accept an overhauled police service in Northern Ireland. In July last year Mr Blair broke his silence about his wealth, to play it down. Responding to a question about his lucrative earnings, Mr Blair, who was marking the 20th anniversary of becoming Labour leader, joked that his wife Cherie kept demanding to know where his reported money is. And he insisted that he is still motivated by the same ‘values’ as he was when he became Labour leader in 1997. ‘Today my work is global,’ he told an audience of admirers from the Blairite group Progress. ‘But what gets me up in the morning is the same.’ He added: ‘I haven’t changed, despite people wanting to say that I have changed. The same thing that motivated me when I stood here as Labour 20 years ago motivates me today – it’s not about making money, it’s about making a difference.’ Speaking about reports of his fortune, Mr Blair added: ‘In respect to my new life, first of all, I have to say that reports of my wealth are greatly exaggerated. Just for the record, I read I’m supposed to be worth £100million – Cherie’s kind of asking where it is. I’m not worth that, half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that … I could go on.’","Parliamentary motion demanding ex-Prime Ministers come clean on cash .

"They might have been forgotten forever. But against all odds, 31 undeveloped rolls of film shot by one single soldier during the Second World War have finally been brought to light. Along with them: two incredibly moving segments of letters written by the photographer - one a message from hospital, another musing about the meaning of it all. The rare materials were discovered at an auction in Ohio late last year by freelance photographer and old film fanatic Levi Bettweiser. Now, after months of work in his makeshift dark room (kitchen), he has developed the entire catalog of 70-year-old pictures. And the results are breath-taking. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Discovered: 31 undeveloped rolls of film shot by one single soldier during the Second World War have finally been brought to light . Breathtaking: The images capture soldiers leaving church, waiting for trains, milling around a dock, or panning shots of snowy hills . Captured a moment: More quiet moments capture the soldiers' down time, with officers chatting on a dirt track next to a Coca Cola van . Bettweiser told PetaPixel: 'What I'm noticing is that most of the images are wide landscape scene shots. The photographer seemed to be really interested in capturing moments that had kind of a large significance to multiple people.' Nothing is known about the photographer except that he was American and had been posted to France before being sent home due to injury - facts gleaned from his letter written on American Red Cross paper. Each roll was labeled with a location - Boston Harbor, Lucky Strike Beach, LaHavre Harbor. The images capture soldiers leaving church, waiting for trains, milling around a dock. One shot shows women cheering from the railings of a harbor as soldiers on a ship pull in, with the sign 'Welcome home!' Another features militia trampling through thick snow at what appears to be a prison. More quiet moments capture the soldiers' down time, with officers chatting on a dirt track next to a Coca Cola van. Also discovered: Two incredibly moving segments of letters written by the photographer - one a message from hospital (right), another musing about the meaning of everything (left). The two pages were rolled around two rolls of film bundled in a water-soaked bag . The rare materials were discovered at an auction in Ohio late last year by freelance photographer and old film fanatic Levi Bettweiser . Around the world: Each roll was labeled with a location across the globe - Boston Harbor, Lucky Strike Beach, LaHavre Harbor . Just another face in the crowd: Nothing is known about the photographer except that he was American and had been posted to France . The anonymous soldier was also sent home due to injury - a fact gleaned from his letter written on American Red Cross paper . Belief: Soldiers can be seen listening to a speech aboard a boat and a chef stands out in the crowd in his white uniform looking away . Global significance: Many of the shots are panning landscapes showing all soldiers together, resonating with the global experience . Amid global turmoil, the anonymous photographer paused to snapshot his colleagues making their way up a deserted road, with mountains behind them and a sole Christmas tree in the snow. The letters are equally moving. The first, typed on a typewriter, muses about self-confidence, religion, and belief. It read: 'Your greatest problem is yourself. You are also your greatest treasure. 'If you can get yourself determined upon --- find out what you are and what you are for ----- and if you can discover and develope (sic) the elements of value in your nature, your life will take on the beauty of orderliness and your need of the savings bank will be less and less, for you will be your own riches. Marching on: It seemed the photographer always had his lens to hand to capture every little segment of their journey into Europe . France: Signs suggest he was in France when he took this picture near their 'latrine' (French for the toilets commonly used in barracks) Another world: The breathtaking images which have lain undiscovered for 70 years show the eye-opening of a young American man . Typical European square: He had an eye for landscape shots, capturing stately French buildings that dwarf people into insignificance . On the road again: Grainy, black and white, and dark, the solitary shots of blackened roads with lone cars offer a bleak insight . Difficult to develop: With many of the rolls water-damaged, it was hard for photographer Levi Bettweiser to develop all of them perfectly .

'When I pull the film out of my film developing tank, I'm the very first person who has ever seen that picture,' he said. 'They've never been enjoyed, they've never been remembered. And so it almost increases the weight of the importance of that photo because it's never had those moments. 'Even if the photographer's not around any more to remember them, we want to reveal the images to the world because the moments in time that were captured on these rolls of film were important to someone at some point.' Painstaking: Levi Bettweiser, of the Rescued Film Project, spent months labeling each roll and working out how best to treat them .

"This is the astonishing moment that a motorcyclist knocked over a pedestrian live on TV last night. The passer-by was knocked over outside London St Pancras International train station just after 6.30pm  while ITV News reporter Ria Chatterjee was talking about delays on the Eurostar. Dramatic footage showed her reporting from the roadside as the pedestrian was hit as he tried to cross the street with a suitcase, prompting shocked passers-by to rush to his aid behind her back. Hit in the background: The passer-by was knocked over outside London St Pancras International train station . Chatterjee, 32, of Twickenham, south-west London, said on Twitter minutes after the crash: 'The pedestrian and motorcyclist who collided during my live broadcast at St Pancras Stn are both fine.' And ITV vision mixer Nick Merritt, 31, tweeted: 'Great. Love directing live TV where pedestrians get hit by mopeds in the back of shot. Quite a shock to see. No injuries though - very lucky.' Meanwhile ITV News head of press Laura Brander tweeted: 'Thankfully both motorcyclist and pedestrian are both fine, according to our reporter.' The journalist was reporting on the Eurostar problems this weekend, after delays and cancellations struck for a second successive day and passengers complained of long waits to rebook seats.

"ISIS is using British female extremists to incite other UK women to carry out terror attacks, according to researchers, as fears are raised that pupils are still at risk of being radicalised in schools. Experts at King's College London say they have identified a group of around 30 British women in northern Syria, who are encouraging others to launch terrorist attacks in the UK. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) has studied the social media accounts of female jihadis, and has found that instead of supporting their male counterparts, many are actively helping to recruit female would-be extremists, often encouraging them to carry out atrocities in the UK. ISIS is using British female extremists to incite UK terror attacks, according to researchers, as fears are raised that pupils are still at risk of being radicalised in schools, and authorities continue to hunt Hayat Boumeddiene (left), the wife of kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly (right) Details of the study comes as Britain and the rest of Europe remain on high alert following the shootings in Paris earlier this month. Authorities are still hunting Hayat Boumeddiene, the wife of kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly, who is thought to have fled to Syria to join up with Islamic State fighters. She is suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks, but had left France before the Kouachi brothers – Cherif, 32, and Said, 34, opened fire on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, arriving in Istanbul on January 2. Boumeddienee, who is suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks, is pictured (right) at passport control following her arrival in Istanbul on January 2 . Around 50 British women and girls are thought to have joined ISIS, with the majority based in the jihadist's stronghold Raqqa and aged between 16 and 24. Among them are 16-year-old twins Salma and Zahra Halane who fled their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to follow their brother to Syria - where it is believed they have married IS fighters. Former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, is known to have been in Raqqa helping to organise religious patrols. Former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, is known to have been in Raqqa helping to organise religious patrols . It has previously been thought that women have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS ranks as wives, but ICSR's findings suggest they are playing a more active role. ICSR research fellow Melanie Smith, who heads the first known database of female foreign fighters, told The Observer: 'British women tend to incite [attacks], they say to people that can’t move to the Islamic State: ""Why not carry out something at home?"" 'That’s a common message: if you can’t leave your family behind or afford to move to Syria then carry out something.' Ms Smith added that women have often been recruited in the past to carry out suicide attacks. School inspectors are also expected to warn that children are still at risk from Islamic extremism, despite a crack down in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal. Four separate investigations were conducted last year into allegations in Birmingham, which were originally sparked by the 'Trojan Horse' letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - that referred to an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city. In June, Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham's schools and declared five failing, placing them into special measures. These schools were Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust (PVET) - as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. In an update published in September, Ofsted said that these schools had not improved, with  chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw saying that 'very little action' had been taken to address the serious concerns raised about each school's performance, amid slow progress in appointing new governors and senior leaders. Sir Michael is expected to warn a meeting of the education select committee later this month that he is still 'very concerned' about a continued risk of extremism in schools, Whitehall sources told The Sunday Times. Twins Salma (left) and Zahra Halane (right), both 16, fled their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to follow their brother to Syria - where it is believed they have married IS fighters . Nearly half of the 4,000 referrals to the Government's Channel programme, which aims to target children and adults who are vulnerable to radicalisation before they become terrorists, have reportedly been under 18. Some have these have been as a result of teachers cracking down on pupils feared to be at risk of fleeing the UK to fight in Syria. One headteacher said four children at her north London school had been reported to the Prevent programme, of which Channel is a part, including a 16-year-old girl who wanted to fundraise for ISIS, and a 15-year-old boy who had made a 'throwaway' comment about fighting in Syria.

"Australian cricketer David Warner has defended his heated spat with Indian batsman Rohit Sharma saying he 'politely' asked him to 'speak English' - despite admitting he was wrong about the incident that got tempers flaring. The mid-pitch argument was sparked when Warner confronted Sharma about an overthrow after the last ball of the 23rd over on Sunday during the one-day international at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Warner, who has found himself at the centre of more than one sledging controversy this summer, supposedly mouthed-off at the Indian batsman over what he perceived to be poor sportsmanship for running off an overthrow that he believed came from a deflection. 'When I went over to say something to him, he sort of said something in their language and I said, 'Speak English', because, if you're going to say something, understand that theoretically I cannot speak Hindi,' Warner told Sky Sports Radio, according to News Corp. Scroll down for video . The heated spat started when Warner confronted Sharma about an overthrow after the last ball of the 23rd over on Sunday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with India's score at 3-112 . 'I did the polite thing and asked him to speak English, therefore he did and I can't repeat what he said.' India's belief that it wasn't a deflection was supported by a replay, but Warner says he won't apologise despite making the wrong call. 'I was in the wrong... I shouldn't have engaged him,' he said. 'If people get on the wrong side of me, I'm not going to back down. 'We play hard aggressive cricket but we know what comes with it, sometimes you are going to get fined. 'We've just got to keep trying not to cross that line, because we're all about playing cricket the right way.' There's a so-called unwritten rule in cricket that batsmen don't run overthrows if the ball deflects off their body or bat. While Sharma hesitated at first, he followed through with the run. Warner immediately looked on in disbelief as he walked over from his fielding position. As he walked past Sharma he said something and the Indian batsman's response prompted Warner to double back. Warner was caught on camera repeatedly mouthing: 'What? Speak English'. Umpires Khumar Dharmasena and John Ward were forced to intervene and Australian captain George Bailey had to move Warner away from the Indian batsman. Warner was fined 50 per cent of his match fee over the incident. It kicked off when India ran a single off an overthrow the Australian side believed came after Warner's return possibly deflected off Sharma . While Sharma (right) hesitated at first, he followed through with the run and Warner (left) immediately looked on in disbelief . As Warner walked past Sharma he was caught on camera mouthing: 'What? Speak English' The clash comes off the back of a four-match Test series between Australia and India that was filled with tension and bad blood. 'I think Rohit was fine with it, I didn't even bother to ask what really happened,' India skipper MS Dhoni said of the heated confrontation. 'It was between two grown men and I hope it was sorted out in the middle.' The two teams have faced racially-fuelled trouble in the past with Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh being banned for three Tests back in 2008 for calling Australia's Andrew Symonds a 'monkey'. New Zealand cricket great Martin Crowe weighed in on the stoush labelling Warner the most juvenile cricketer he has seen. Crowe says he fears that the left-hander could be at the centre of a fight during the World Cup if things boil over and is advocating a soccer-like yellow and red card system to deal with what he terms 'thuggish behaviour' as fines don't work. 'Warner can play, but he is the most juvenile cricketer I have seen on a cricket field,' Crowe wrote on cricket website espncricinfo.com. 'I don't care how good he is: if he continues to show all those watching that he doesn't care, he must be removed, either by Cricket Australia or definitely by the world governing body. 'The more he gets away with it, the more others will follow his pitiful actions. Already we see one or two of his teammates enjoying being close to his hideous energy.' Umpires Khumar Dharmasena and John Ward were forced to intervene and Australian captain George Bailey had to move Warner away from the Indian batsman . Warner has found himself at the centre of more than one sledging controversy this summer . The umpires were forced to step in and separate Warner and Sharma during the heated clash . Sharma, who was 58 at the time, went on to make 137. But India's Suresh Raina, who made 52, looked delighted when he took the catch that dismissed Warner for 24 during the Australian innings. Australia's James Faulkner ended up guiding his side to a four-wicket win over India. Australia were cruising when they needed 50 runs off the final 10 overs with seven wickets in hand, but the tourists fought back boldly to reduce that equation to 14 runs off 11 balls. Faulkner responded with two boundaries, enhancing his status as Australia's closer as they passed their victory target of 268  with an over to spare. Aaron Finch scored 96 and his 101-run partnership with Steve Smith piloted Australia to a point where they needed 52 runs from 63 deliveries. Finch reined in his natural aggression, reaching 64 off 96 balls before walloping his first six of the night. Warner was later dismissed for 24 during the Australian innings by India's Suresh Raina . India's Suresh Raina, who made 52, looked delighted when he took the catch that dismissed Warner for 24 during the Australian innings . India's total of 8-267, built on the back of Rohit Sharma's masterful 138, was proven to be sub-par on a pristine batting pitch . Both he and Smith focused instead on swift running between the wickets and the easy ones and twos on offer. Smith fell for 47 in the 40th over and Finch trudged off the following over as Australia slumped from 2-216 to 6-248. India's total of 8-267, built on the back of Rohit Sharma's masterful 138, was proven to be sub-par on a pristine batting pitch.

Wearing a smart long leather jacket, Stephanie, 49, was presented with a bunch of flowers by the a cast of clowns, who all seemed incredibly happy to see her again. The Princess is a huge supporter of the circus and appeared delighted to greet the colourful performers, who were decked out in their best costumes. Scroll down for video . What a gang: Wearing a long black coat Princess Stephanie of Monaco spent her third day at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo . Sealed with a kiss: Princess Stephanie was greeted by the ring master who gently kissed her hand . The Princess looked radiant on the evening, wearing her long dark hair down around her shoulders, while a lacy top peeked out from underneath her coat. For the second night in a row, Princess Stephanie was treated to a kiss on the hand from ringmaster Petit Gougou during the show. She attended the event with her youngest daughter Camille, who recently celebrated her 16th birthday. Controversy surrounded Camille's birth in 1998 as Stephanie neglected to name a father on her birth certificate. As such, Camille is not included in the line to the Monegasque throne, unlike her brother Louis Robert and her sister Pauline Grace. It was rumoured at the time that her father was Jean-Raymond Gottlieb who was Princess Stephanie's former body guard, but nothing has ever been confirmed. Natural beauty: Princess Stephanie looked radiant on her night out at the circus wearing a bright red lipstick . Like mother, like daughter: Princess Stephanie attended the event yesterday evening with her look-a-like daughter Camille, pictured in the red patterned jacket . Clowning around: As Stephanie posed for a photograph one of the performers tried to chat with her . Just the day before her trip with Camille, the Princess had also attended the circus for a rare night out with her brother Prince Albert of Monaco. Beaming broadly as a spiky haired Italian clown named Fumagali approached, Prince Albert was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed the evening. The festival is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974. But while Albert and Stephanie appeared to be enjoy the show, the newest additions to Monaco's royal family were nowhere to be seen. New mother Princess Charlene was absent, having chosen to remain at home with month-old twins, Jacques Honoré Rainier and Gabriella Thérèse Marie. All smiles: Prince Albert and Princess Stephanie enjoy the antics of Italian clown Fumagalli . What a gentleman! Ringmaster Petit Gougou plants a kiss on Stephanie's outstretched hand . Their absence didn't prevent Prince Albert from enjoying himself, although the event did briefly take a sombre turn at the beginning of the night. Part way through the opening ceremony, a minute's silence was held in memory of stunt rider Kevin Ferrari, a.k.a Flic Flac Moto X, 24, who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on Wednesday. Despite his death, the show continued after the minute's silence with elephants, acrobats and clowns all on the billing. Royal approval: The clown, real name Giovanni Huesca, raised smiles all round . Round of applause: Albert, who was taking a night off from daddy duties, claps at the end of the performance . Welcome: New father Albert also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively . Looking good: Despite having two tiny babies to care for, Albert looked surprisingly fresh . Royal wave: Albert waves to the Monte Carlo crowd from the comfort of the royal box . Tribute: Ahead of the performance, there was a minute's silence for a performer who died earlier this week . The prince  certainly appeared to enjoy rest of the show though, gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared and threw himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse. At the time Stephanie, who is patron of the International Circus Festival, was making her second visit to the Big Top in a week, having already met clowns and elephant trainers on Tuesday. During that visit, the 49-year-old, who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000, was seen patting one of the circus' pachyderms, looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk. The royal, who also helps to oversee the Circus Festival and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography, first attended the event when she was just nine. Her father Prince Ranier was the brains behind the first festival, which now as then, specialises in traditional circus acts  from clowns to acrobats.

"Filmmaker Michael Moore has slammed snipers as 'cowards' who 'shoot you in the back' on the same weekend Oscar-tipped movie American Sniper hit cinemas. Clint Eastwood's biopic of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, starring Bradley Cooper, has become a box office hit since its release last week. Taking to Twitter in rage, Fahrenheit 9/11 director Moore seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Scroll down for video . Anger: Michael Moore took to Twitter with his views on snipers the day after American Sniper came out . American Sniper: The biopic of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, starring Bradley Cooper, has become a box office hit since its release last week. Kyle was credited with the most confirmed kills in American military history: 160 . Kyle was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills, which is the most in American military history. He claimed to have shot down 255. The firm, which is based on Kyle’s autobiography of the same reveals not only how he became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him. Raised in rural Texas, Kyle started out as a cowboy and his initial application to join the SEALs was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms. However, in the late nineties, the unit relaxed its entrance policy and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq, where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not  been trained as sniper. With an obvious talent, he was sent to the SEAL sniper school, where he was taught warfare’s loneliest and most controversial job. Anti-guns: Moore (pictured) won an Oscar in 2002 for his documentary Bowling For Columbine, exploring gun violence in America and the main reasons for the Columbine High School massacre . True story: The movie is based on Kyle's autobiography, written before he was shot dead in February 2013 . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper . In 2004, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, and it was during the battle for that city where he made his mark. However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Kyle gained his nickname as ‘The Legend’ from his fellow SEALs. One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole. A sniper is a highly trained military marksman, whose job is to engage targets from concealed postitions or from long distances. They usually operate alone or in small groups and use highly specialised weapons to take out their targets. It is believed the first use of snipers came during the American Revoluntionary War when colonists hid in trees and used early rifles to shoot British officers. The first unit of marksmen was established by the British army during the Napoleonic wars and the team were nicknamed the Green Jackets due to their distinctive green uniform. Snipers were widely used in the trenches during the First World War, with Germany equipping their fighters with scoped rifles, which could easily pick out targets. In the Second World War, British and French snipers were credited with halting the German advance. The longest recorded sniper kill was carried out by Corporal Criag Harrison of the British army's Household Cavalry when he two killed two Taliban machine gunners from more than a mile and a half away in Afghanistan in November 2009. He was using the British-built L115A3 Long Range Rifle, the Army's most powerful sniper weapon. Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry. In February 2013 he was shot dead by a soldier he was trying to help who was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress. The movie of Kyle's life is hotly tipped for glory at the Oscars, after being nominated for six awards including Best Actor for Cooper and Best Picture. It has also been tipped for best adapted screenplay, sound mixing, film editing and sound editing. Moore won an Oscar in 2002 for his documentary Bowling For Columbine, exploring gun violence in America and the main reasons for the Columbine High School massacre. He is outspoken in his views against firearms and has previously described America's national symbol as the gun, not the bald eagle. Last year Moore wrote on his Facebook page that that while other countries have more violent histories than the U.S., more guns per capita and consume the same violent movies and video games as the U.S., none have anywhere near the rates of mass killings that America does. He explained: 'The bloodshed is just the latest in what is fast becoming a regular occurrence in the United States, and one that is sure to happen again, says Moore. 'We won't pass the necessary laws, but more importantly we won't consider why this happens here all the time,' he writes. 'When the NRA says, ""Guns don't kill people - people kill people,"" they've got it half-right. Except I would amend it to this: ""Guns don't kill people - Americans kill people."" Enjoy the rest of your day, and rest assured this will all happen again very soon.'","Documentary maker Michael Moore said snipers 'shoot you in the back'

"The son of one of America's most notorious mobsters has penned a tell-all book detailing his father's sordid dealings what it was like to grow up Gotti. In his autobiography Shadow of My Father, John Gotti's namesake son, John A 'Junior' Gotti, writes of his visits to his father in prison, reveals how the Dapper Don used so-called dental furloughs to relax outside of prison and describes how mobsters 'get made.' Gotti said he decided to write the memoir in spite of his mother's protests because he heard notorious mob rat John Alite was penning his own tall-all about the Gambino crime family. Scroll down for video . Telling his story: Dapper Don John Gotti's namesake son has written a tell all memoir about his life in the infamous Gambino crime family . Shadow of My Father details the sordid life of an infamous crime boss and what it was like to live in his famous shadow . 'Our privacy has been invaded more than most families’ due to the selfishness of my father and I,' Gotti told the New York Daily News. 'But I can’t keep sitting back and letting this happen.' In sensational 2009 court testimony, Gambino member John Alite linked his former best friend Gotti Jr. to a series of gangland slayings, boasted that he slept with reality television graduate Victoria Gotti and claimed two police officers were in on the mob hit. Gotti Jr. was charged with racketeering, but never convicted. New York's Gambino family has been the subject of a steady stream of government indictments and prosecutions since the Dapper Don was sentenced to life in prison in 1992. He died behind bars in 2002. Gotti Jr.'s own recent prison stint ended in Demember 2009. He claims to have left the crime world behind in 1999, but recalls with great detail what the life afforded his father--like breaks from prison to visit his family and relax in freedom. On a so-called 'dental furlough,' Gotti says his father was escorted by armed guards from Green Haven correctional facility to a Manhattan dental office. 'My father would go up to the dentist’s office, open his mouth, and then go out the back of the building where one of the fellows would drive him away,' Gotti writes. The guards, paid off with hundreds of dollars, would wait patiently as Gotti went home, changed out of his prison jumpsuit and spent quality time with Gotti Jr. and the rest of the family. 'When it was time to return to the prison, my father’s man would drive him back to the dentist’s building, and he would emerge from the front entrance back into the custody of the marshals,' Gotti writes. Gotti recalls a time when, at just four years old, he visited his father in jail where he told him he wanted to be a police officer for Halloween. Gotti recalls his father saying: . 'If I ever hear you let my son or any of my kids, or you for that matter, talk to that cop, or any other cop, I’ll kill you.' Despite growing up with a father in and out of prison and seeing other dark sides of crime life, Gotti Jr. would go on to follow in his dad's footsteps and join the notorious Gambinos. In his book, he describes how he first entered into the organization, a process called getting 'made.' John Gotti was one of the most notorious modern day mob bosses. His son, who followed in his father's footsteps until leaving the crime life in 1999, wrote a tell-all out Monday in order to protect the family name as Gambino turncoat John Alite pens his own memoirs . Gotti Jr recalls in his book going to visit his father in prison in the 1970s. He also describes his father's so-called 'dental furloughs' in which the infamous mobster paid off armed guards in order to spend a day with his family outside prison . 'There were roughly a dozen men sitting around a table…open seats for the new inductees,' he writes. 'A pin pricked my “trigger” finger. A drop of blood was put on a picture of a saint, which was then burned in my hand. I moved the flaming picture from hand to hand, until it was totally consumed by the fire.' Gotti Jr. has been tried four times since 2005 for racketeering. Each trial ended in a hung jury. He said he left organized crime in 1999. The self-published ebook, out Monday, was not Gotti's first attempt at a memoir. He told the Daily News that he had over 300 pages of a previous iteration of the tome but destroyed it all to satisfy his worried mother. Like father like son? Like his father (left), Gotti Jr. was a member of the infamous Gambino crime family and has had repeated run-ins with the law. Now, however, the 50-year-old says he's retired from the lawless life . Gotti Sr. gained a reputation as the 'Teflon Don' after his repeated acquittals and his namesake son had similar good fortune until he was put away following a plea deal. He was released in 2009. His father died in prison in 2002 . Gotti Jr and his attorney leave after jurors declared a mistrial during the 3rd day of jury deliberations on Gotti's 2nd retrial on racketeering and kidnapping charges. Gotti Jr. was the Gambino family's acting boss from 1992 to 1999 . Gotti Jr. has been tried four times since 2005 for racketeering. Each trial ended in a hung jury. He said he left organized crime in 1999. His father died in prison in 2002 . 'In 2010, I shredded it. I had completed 375 pages and I shredded 375 pages. I only had 70 pages more to go. So I apologized to everyone involved, but my family harmony is more important to me.' When he learned of Alite's tell-all, Gotti changed his mind and went to his mother to ask permission to write the book. 'If you never talk to me again, then I’m gonna have to live with it,' he said to his mother. 'That’s your choice, that’s your prerogative, but you’re asking me to sit here and let them emasculate me and my father. No, Ma. I have the right to write our own history.'

"They have finally been caught. And now, the teenage sweethearts dubbed 'Bonnie and Clyde' following their two-week alleged crime spree, have to face mom and dad. Dalton Hayes, 18, and his girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, 13, went missing on January 3 and authorities believe their travels took them to South Carolina and Georgia. Detained on Sunday in Florida, they have been charged with burglary, trespassing and criminal mischief. But first the Kentucky-based teens had to face a talking to. Scroll down for video . Captured: Hayes and Phillips were arrested by police in Panama City Beach, Florida, after two weeks on the run from their homes in Kentucky . Caught: Dalton Hayes, 18, and his girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, 13, were caught sleeping in the parking lot of a strip mall in a stolen truck early Sunday . Hayes was led away in cuffs, while Phillips was taken into custody by the Florida Department of Children and Families . Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin, told NBC News she spoke with her son by phone and he told her he was ready to 'face the consequences.' 'Not knowing where they were has been extremely difficult for all of us,' she said, adding that when she heard authorities had caught them, 'I was happy that they were found and no harm was done.' Grayson County Sheriff officials say in a statement that 18-year-old Dalton Hayes and his 13-year-old girlfriend, Cheyenne Phillips, were arrested without incident about 12.10am Sunday in Panama City Beach. The two had eluded police in multiple states while raising concern about their increasingly brazen behavior. Phillips, being only in eighth grade, was taken into custody by the Florida Department of Children and Families until she can be returned to her family in Kentucky. Authorities say US Marshal's Service and local law enforcement in Panama City Beach discovered Hayes and Phillips asleep in a 2001 Toyota Tundra that was stolen in Henry County, Georgia. The vehicle was surrounded by law enforcement and both Hayes and Phillips were taken into custody. Authorities plan to extradite Hayes and Phillips back to Kentucky where they are both expected to face felony charges. End of the line: Dalton Hayes, 18, is in a Florida jail after he was arrested Sunday . Hayes and Phillips began their run from the law and their families earlier this month when they vanished from their small hometown in western Kentucky. Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin, had urged her son and his companion to surrender and 'face the consequences.' Martin said the couple had been dating for about three months. She said the girl portrayed herself as being 19, and the family, including Hayes, believed her. Cheyenne 'would go in and write checks, and she would come out with cigarettes and stuff, so I didn't have any reason not to believe she wasn't 19,' Martin said. 'Because normally you can't buy cigarettes when you're 13 years old. By the time her son realized she was a mere 13, 'he was already done in love with her,' Martin said. When he hit the road, Hayes was running away from trouble back home. He faces burglary and theft charges in his home county, stemming from an arrest late last year, according to Grayson County court records. He was planning to be at the local judicial center on Jan. 5 to find out if a grand jury had indicted him on the charges, his mother said. His case did not come up, but by that time the teens were gone. On the run: The teens are believed to have committed burglaries, car thefts and other crimes across six states in the South during their two-week crime spree that began in their native Kentucky. They are pictured here entering a WalMart in South Carolina . Spree: The couple has made it from Kentucky down to Florida - a distance of at least 600 miles . Norman Chaffins, sheriff in Grayson County, Kentucky, where the pair disappeared 14 days ago, said the couple's behavior had become 'increasingly brazen and dangerous.' Twice, the teens were able to evade law officers in Kentucky, the sheriff said. They crashed the first truck they stole and hid in the woods. Then they later stole another truck nearby, Chaffins said. At one point, the two were spotted at a Wal-Mart in South Carolina, where the teens are thought to have passed two stolen checks, said Manning, South Carolina, Police Chief Blair Shaffer. They were seen in a vehicle that apparently was stolen from Kentucky, he said. Hayes' mother claimed that Cheyenne told her son that she was 19. She is in fact an eighth grader and just 13 years old . The pair are accused of stealing this pickup truck in Grayson County, Kentucky and driving it to South Carolina. The vehicle had at least one gun in the glove box when it was taken . Rebels: Hayes' mother said her son also believed that 13-year-old Cheyenne was 19 . Authorities believe they then headed to Georgia and stole a pickup truck from the driveway of a man's home in Henry County, about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta. The homeowner awoke Wednesday to find his vehicle was gone, along with two handguns he kept inside, Henry County police Lt. Joey Smith said. Hours later, another truck the couple are suspected of having stolen in another state was found nearby. It had been crashed through a fence and abandoned behind a vacant building on neighboring property, Smith said. Martin said her son texted her a few days after their disappearance to say the couple were in Mississippi. They were spotted soon after that in Kentucky, she said. Hayes, who is an adult, is being extradited back to his home county in Kentucky to face multiple felony charges. He is also likely to face charges in Georgia and possibly South Carolina .","Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, were arrested while sleeping in a stolen truck about midnight on Sunday in Panama City Beach, Florida .

"A man who flipped off his dirtbike into some long grass soon stopped laughing when he realised what he’d landed on. After his friend discovered him casually lying on his back with his hands behind his helmet, he was informed he was right on top of a deadly brown snake. ‘Don’t move, don’t move,’ his mate says when he spots the snake’s head poking out from beneath him. YouTube user Gary John uploaded the video of the terrifying moment, that was captured at Hervey Range near Townsville in north-eastern Queensland, online. The dirtbiker was lying in some long grass after falling off his bike when he found out he'd landed on a brown snake . 'Are you serious?,’ the crashed biker asks, his voice getting noticeably higher. As his friend walks towards him and tries to stamp on a stick, he cries out ‘don’t do that’ and swearing ensues. 'It will bite me on the arse,’ he warns. Trying not to rile the dangerous snake, his friend gets closer and asks 'you ready' and pulls him up from the ground. Instantly the man leaps to his feet and as far away from where he landed as possible. The common brown snake is considered the world's second most venomous land snake and is native to Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia. He had flipped off his orange bike but didn't think he was in any danger . The deadly brown snake's head can just be seen in the video . The video, filmed in north-eastern Queensland, captured the terrifying moment he realised what he was on top of .

"You've heard of guide dogs for the blind, but what about guide dogs for those living with the nightmares of war. This advert, which has been awarded the Dutch 'Gouden Loeki' for best commercial, highlights the work a dog can do to help those with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD). Speaking during the production of the clip, Peter Van Der Heijden of the Royal Dutch Guide Dog Foundation, said: 'This is a very special day on which we are filming this TV commercial in order to create awareness of our veteran dogs. A soldier is comforted on the battle field by a colleague after witnessing a little girl being killed . The Dutch advert is to promote veteran dogs being used to help those with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . 'A veteran dog helps people with post traumatic stress disorder handle the problems they have in everyday life, for instance veterans reliving a traumatic experience, or having a nightmare can be woken and calmed by the dogs.' Creative director Niels Westra added: 'We are actually making this commercial to show that  the Royal Dutch Guide Dog Foundation (KNGF) does more than providing guide dogs for the blind. 'The commercial takes place in a country such as Afghanistan with a Dutch soldier serving in a war situation and suffering shock at what he is seeing.' The advert was actually shot in the Netherlands, with a warzone digitally added for realism . A guide dog can help those who suffer recurring nightmares from their time spent in a war . In the advert, the soldier lies stricken on the floor after a battle, and looking to his left he spots the lifeless body of a little girl, leading him to break down. A colleague then comforts him, and as he starts to lick the soldier's cheek, the scene cuts to the man's bedroom, where it is in fact the dog that is calming him. The dog is clever enough to switch the light on to relieve the nightmare. The dog licks the soldier's cheek to awaken him from his turbulent nightmare from his experience of war .

"The UK authorities ‘failed to act’ to save children from sex abuse on the British territory of St Helena and took 12 years to order an independent inquiry, according to new claims. The Government was told child abuse on the South Atlantic island was being routinely ‘ignored’ as long ago as 2002 and that men who abused youngsters were in some cases let off with a fine of £50. But the Foreign Office disregarded warnings that the island simply ‘couldn’t cope’ with the scale of the problem. The UK Foreign Office disregarded warnings that child abuse was being routinely ‘ignored’ on St Helena and that men who abused youngsters were in some cases let off with a fine of £50 . The explosive claims come from Ivy Ellick, a retired head of public health and social services on the island. She claims she told the British government that the South Atlantic Island did not have the resources to protect children there. But nothing was done and in the years between her warning and the start of the inquiry last year at least another 20 children were sexually abused on the island of 4,500 people. Mrs Ellick, who was awarded an OBE in 2004 for her 46-year career in the St Helenian government claims, numerous abusers evaded justice because of the slowness of the authorities. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said: ‘They [the Foreign Office] were aware that we didn’t have the resources to cope with it because we’ve been pointing it out ever since. I said they were unfair to expect us to do it without the resources. ‘We did have some convictions of child abuse but some of them didn’t reach conviction because we didn’t have the resources to do proper investigations. The police weren’t equipped enough, they didn’t have all the tools that were necessary. ‘People were actually brought to court but once they were before the judge the case got thrown out on technical points. It happened on a couple of occasions when I was in the health and social services department.’ It wasn’t until 2014 that the British government launched an inquiry, headed by Sasha Wass, the QC who prosecuted Rolf Harris, after whistleblowers detailed abuse and an alleged cover-up by the island’s government and the Foreign Office. Last night, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: ‘We take all measures of child abuse very seriously. Where we could act, we believe we have. ‘In recent years, we have sent police to provide training, investigate cases and look at the effectiveness of policing on St Helena. ‘In 2013 the FCO sent a child safeguarding NGO to St Helena to investigate child protection and there have also been visits from other child safeguarding experts. The FCO has also dedicated extra resource to child safeguarding. ‘However, we know from the current allegations that there is more to do to make sure that children on St Helena are given the right level of protection.’","UK 'failed to stop St Helena sex abuse' says former head of health .

"A small-town police chief from Ohio, who drew a following with his blunt, frequently humorous Facebook commentary has resigned days after being suspended. Brimfield Township trustees accepted David Oliver's resignation at a meeting on Friday. He didn't attend. Some residents demanded to know more about the complaint and resulting gender discrimination investigation that led to Oliver's suspension, but township officials refused to discuss details and cited attorney-client privilege. The Brimfield Police Department, near Kent, in northeast Ohio, serves about 10,000 people, but its Facebook page became one of the most-liked local law enforcement pages in the country thanks to Oliver's conversational posts and increasing popularity. Cop-out: Brimfield police Chief David Oliver  became a social media celebrity because of his posts on the department Facebook page, has now resigned after being suspended without pay for two weeks . Popular policing: Oliver's department’s 177,000 Facebook 'likes' place the tiny department’s popularity ahead of every U.S. police agency except New York City. The Facebook page has now been removed . The likes on the page have grown from a few thousand to more than 177,000 in less than three years. Oliver announced his departure Friday morning in a lengthy post on his individual Facebook page, in which he said that untrue allegations had circulated and that his management style was used against him. He didn't specify the accusations against him but said that he 'never once hugged an employee for 'dirty' reasons' and that most employees never complained of being 'bullied' under his admittedly forceful leadership style. 'What you all are seeing now are some disgruntled people who are taking shots at me and have been since the (Facebook) page got bigger,' he wrote. 'Two are current employees, some I have fired in the past and some just hate me because of my personality. Whatever the reason, they are out in force, like vultures, enjoying the scene.' Oliver, who joined the police department in 1994 and became chief in 2004, also said that his work has taken a toll on him and that he suffers increasingly unpredictable panic attacks. Outspoken: Oliver, who has led Brimfield’s department for more than 20 years, has made international news for his daily Facebook rants to his followers . Keeping schtum: The normally outspoken Oliver said Tuesday that he is prevented from revealing the reasons behind the suspension . In a sign of his popularity, the post drew about 1,000 comments within two hours, nearly all of them messages of support, well-wishes or gratitude. Oliver became a local celebrity with catchphrases such as 'No mopes,' a reference to his preferred term for criminals and other ne'er-do-wells. He also found his share of critics, who said he was using work time inappropriately or shouldn't have been discussing criminal suspects via social media. Township officials at the meeting praised Oliver's work and emphasized he made a decision to do what was best for him. They said he could have returned to work after a two-week suspension and would have gone through diversity and anti-discrimination training that they now plan to require for all township employees. 'We didn't get rid of him,' trustee Charles Sprague said. Another trustee, Mike Kostensky, said Oliver told him he's done with law enforcement. The trustees named Capt. Chris Adkins as interim chief. Police squad: Oliver said he may eventually will talk about the circumstances surrounding the suspension, and he hinted that it largely was brought about by his “hands-on” management style . In postings interspersed with community messages and rants, the former  chief took criminals to task and other ne'er-do-wells - his preferred term was 'mopes', appropriated from police TV shows and an old colleague who used it - for the stupid, the lazy and the outright unlawful. Even an ill-considered parking choice could spur a Facebook flogging. 'If you use a handicapped space and you jump out of the vehicle, all healthy-like, as if someone is dangling free cheeseburgers on a stick, expect people to stare at you and get angry,' Oliver wrote in 2012. 'You are milking the system and it aggravates those of us who play by the rules. Ignoring us does not make you invisible. We see you, loser.' His postings were among the most-liked local law enforcement pages in the country, trailing only New York, Boston and Philadelphia police, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police Center for Social Media. Not bad for a guy who initially hoped maybe 500 locals would pay attention when he noticed other businesses' pages and decided to start his own five years ago. His Facebook messages extended that open-door policy online for conversations about road closures, charity events, lost pets and whatever else crosses his mind. Some were serious, such as salutes to slain officers and updates during school threat investigations. Others were light-like, like the attempt to find an escaped swine's owner with an unusual APB - an 'All-Pig Bulletin' - or his promise to 'ticket' child bicyclists with coupons for free ice cream if they wear helmets. And, of course, there's crime. One posting berated a man accused of physically assaulting a woman and two children. In another, Oliver suggested that hiding near an occupied police K-9 vehicle wasn't a shoplifting suspect's smartest move. Resident Mark Mosley, a daily reader, said he liked such 'humorous arrest stories' best. 'It's one of those things, like you can't fix stupid,' Mosley said. His officers and others said the online character of the chief, a big, beefy guy, matched real life.","David Oliver, 46, was known for using the Brimfield Police Department's Facebook page to scold criminals .

"A Melbourne-based artist is paying homage to his love of food one stitch at a time. Phil Ferguson, who is originally from Perth in Western Australia, started crocheting types of food and posting them on Instagram to connect with other artists in the Victorian capital when he moved there in March last year.

A Melbourne-based artist named Phil Ferguson has created 24 crocheted hats since he started in August . The 22-year-old said he started posting the photos on Instagram because he wanted to meet new people in Melbourne . Ferguson said his first attempt was a burger, which was inspired by his place of work, fast food joint Tuck Shop Take Away in Caulfield North - south-east of Melbourne. 'From that point onward I thought about how to do food hats,' the 22-year-old - who studied art at Perth's Curtin University - said. '[Food] has been the most accessible thing people can relate to and it will stay that way until I'm bored.'

"Nick Clegg today dismissed Prime Minister's Questions as a farce and called for it to be scrapped altogether. The Lib Dem leader is so fed up with sitting silently next to David Cameron that he wants the Wednesday lunchtime session cancelled forever. It is the strongest attack yet on the political institution by the Deputy Prime Minister, who says he feels 'ridiculous' being attacked by Labour and Tories with chance to fight back. Nick Clegg is so fed up with sitting silently next to David Cameron that he wants the Wednesday lunchtime session scrapped . Mr Clegg has previously called for PMQs to be moved to a prime time slot so they can be shown on live TV to a large audience, instead of being aired at midday on Wednesday. He has also suggested  allowing voters to send in questions to be answered by the Prime Minister. But after almost five years of being forced to sit through David Cameron and Ed Miliband tearing chunks out of each other, he has had enough. Interviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Clegg said: 'How much (more) awkward can you get?' Mr Clegg added: 'To have to sit to listen to your two main rivals tear strips off each other and you're not allowed to say anything. 'Of course it's awkward, it's ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous, the whole thing should be scrapped. It's an absolute farce, Prime Minister's Questions.' Mr Clegg said he has faced criticism throughout his time on the frontbench next to Mr Cameron. At first he was seen as being too close to the Tories, then for looking glum and after missing the Autumn Statement last month was accused of snubbing Parliament. He admitted that he plans to attend some sessions before the election in May, but not all. Farce: Mr Clegg said he would not attend all of the final clashes between David Cameron and Ed Miliband ahead of the election in May . Asked whether he would be sitting next to Mr Cameron at PMQs right up until Parliament dissolves for the general election, Mr Clegg said: 'I sometimes will, I sometimes won't. 'Do I think that use of my time, sitting there biting my tongue as I listen to them say increasingly daft and shrill things to each other, do I think it's a great use of my time? 'No. Do I wish I didn't have to do it? Probably, quite a lot of the time. 'At the beginning, apparently, I was criticised for being too comfortable, then I looked a bit sombre, then I looked too sad. And now if I show any expression it’s interpreted one way or the other…' Mr Clegg became particularly animated during last week's PMQs, when Mr Cameron mocked the Lib Dems for being beaten by the Greens. The Prime Minister said: 'We had a set of European elections last year, and Ukip and the Greens both beat the Liberal Democrats, I am afraid to say.' It came as Mr Miliband accused the Tory leader of running scared from TV debates by insisting the greens took part. Mr Clegg was seen shouting: 'Excuses, excuses.'","Lib Dem leader wants an end to the 'farce' of Prime Minister's Questions .

"Shots rang out Saturday night outside the Delaware home of Vice President Joe Biden. Multiple rounds were fired from a vehicle speeding past the New Castle County residence around 8:25pm, according to the Secret Service. 'This occurred on a public road outside the established security perimeter. The shots were heard by Secret Service personnel posted at the residence and a vehicle was observed by an agent leaving the scene at a high rate of speed,' Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback told CNN. The Vice President and his physician wife were expected to be in Delaware over the weekend, but were not home during the incident, officials said. Scroll down for videos . A security official stands at the end of the driveway leading to Vice President Joe Biden's home Sunday . Multiple gunshots were fired from a vehicle near Biden's Delaware home Saturday night . Shots fired: Mulitple shots were fired from a speeding vehicle outside Joe and Jill Biden's private home in Delaware Saturday night . According to CBS News, the couple was 'out for the evening.' The Secret Service informed them of the shooting and promised a thorough search of the grounds. The shots were fired several hundred yards from the home. The road lies outside a perimeter secured by Secret Service. According to the New York Times, New Castle County police and Secret Service agents were unable to catch the shooter as he or she sped away. During the subsequent investigation, a car reportedly sped past agents and was pulled over. The driver's hands tested negative for gunpowder residue. 'The Secret Service is working closely with the New Castle County Police on investigating this incident,' Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service, told the Times. Biden's neighborhood includes stately stone-and-brick homes along a curving two-lane road that winds through rolling hills. Nestled in a heavily wooded area, the vice president's home is not visible from the main road. A small cottage, occupied by the Secret Service, sits on the property near a gate in front of the driveway that is blocked off by Secret Service vehicles and personnel. Police said there was a report of shots fired in the nearby area of Hoopes Reservoir, just northwest of the Biden home. The reservoir is a source of fresh water for Wilmington. Biden's office said the vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, were briefed Saturday night, as was President Barack Obama. Biden's office referred all other questions to the Secret Service. The shots were fired on a road a few hundred yards from the Biden home (pictured). Secret Service agents said the incident occurred outside a secured area . On Sunday afternoon, half a dozen sport utility vehicles were parked near the entrance of the Bidens' property, providing a heavy security presence in the area. Shortly before 2 p.m., a motorcade of several more SUVs arrived at the house. It was unclear whether the vice president was in any of the vehicles. Biden planned to speak Monday in Wilmington at the Organization of Minority Women's 31st Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast. The Bidens spend many weekends at their Delaware home, and, while he served in the Senate, Biden frequently made a daily commute from Delaware to Washington by train.","The Bidens were not inside the Greenville home during the Saturday evening incident .

'If our hearts could explode from love they would': A week after they were born 12 weeks early, Ashley and Tyson Gardner are learning how to care for their fragile premie quadruplets . 'If our hearts could explode from love they would have already,' Ashley wrote on the Facebook dedicated to their journey. 'Everyday I don't think it's possible to love them any more than I already do and then the next day I find that I do!!!' Though faced with some bumps in the road, especially for the lightest baby Indie, but the couple are looking to their faith to stay strong. 'God has a plan for us, and he's trusted us with four babies,' Tyson Gardner said. 'We have faith in him, and we have faith in each other.' The Gardners spent eight years battling infertility and gave birth with the help of in vitro fertilization. Proud father Tyson posted that the new mom and four daughters 'were doing incredible' after the birth which was a one-in-70-million chance. 'God has a plan for us, and he's trusted us with four babies,' Tyson Gardner said.

Ashley and Tyson Gardner, of Pleasant Grove, said they've gotten congratulations from people around the world after the four babies were delivered via cesarean section . Quads! Ashley Gardner, who spent eight years battling infertility, has received an incredible late Christmas present after delivering four healthy baby girls . Miracles: She gave birth 12 weeks early to two sets of identical girl twins named Esme, Evangeline, Indie and Scarlett . Mr Gardner, from Pleasant Grove, Utah, also thanked the doctors and nurses who delivered the babies. The couple have been sharing messages on a Facebook page charting the pregnancy, saying they are 'overjoyed' and that all four girls appear to have inherited their father's dark hair. The Gardners also shared that they will be featured on a TV series on the TLC network about the pregnancy, birth of their 'quad squad' and adventures over the coming months. The Gardners documented the pregnancy on YouTube, Facebook and a family website. Mr Gardner wrote: 'We can't wait to have you all along on this journey!' Photos of the couple looking shocked after receiving the news about their multiple babies gained wide attention online, and a Facebook page they set up for the babies has nearly 350,000 likes. 'People identify with our story. There are hundreds, thousands of people that struggle with infertility,' Tyson Gardner said. 'Our story's a story of hope.' 'It was scary at first, and then, you know, the second you see the babies' faces and hear them cry, it just is, it's all worth it,' Ashely Gardner said, according to the Deseret News. Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing  contractions early. The couple became an internet sensation after they made a video earlier this year showing their startled but ecstatic reaction to the news that they had four babies on the way. The couple have been sharing messages on a Facebook page charting the pregnancy, saying they are 'overjoyed' and that all four girls appear to have inherited their father's dark hair . Proud new father Tyson Gardner posted this picture of his wife Ashley with the message: 'Moms saying Hello to Esme! Incredible day! God is real people!!' Mrs Gardner with her husband (left) and their medical team alongside one of their daughters who was born on Sunday and weighs around 2lbs . Ashley Gardner (left), pictured after giving birth by Cesarean section on Sunday, is now mom to four baby girls, Indie, Esme, Scarlett and Evangeline. Her proud husband Tyson with Dr Minton (right) Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. The couple wrote in a Facebook post: 'We were so blessed to be able to do IVF the month of June! They put 2 eggs back and both split! That's right, we are having quadruplets! The odds of both eggs splitting are literally 1 in 1 million.' Since then, the couple have posted regular updates on the progress of the pregnancy, including themed snaps of Ashley in costume for Halloween and Christmas. The quadruplets' survival was called a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop  contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant. The couple flew to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October. Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. The couple posted a picture shortly before the birth with the message: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks' Festive: The couple, pictured above at Christmas just days before Ashely's contractions started, kept their huge Facebook following updated with topical pictures . Mr Gardner said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. Surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems. In October, the Gardners posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, ''This has been a good day!'' 'Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!!' The couple, who say the babies are doing 'great' and receiving 'fabulous care', have promised more updates when possible. How many?! The image above shows the moment Ashley discovered that her fertility treatment had gone rather better than she had expected . Unlikely: Ashley says that the chances of her conceiving the four girls - and them surviving to be born - is around 70million-to-one .","Ashley and Tyson Gardner welcomed their four daughters on December 29 .

"Nowadays, we’re all glad to be grey. Or so we’re told. Apparently it’s never been so fashionable to be wrinkly. Look at the novelist Joan Didion in the new ultra-cool photo shoot for high-end French fashion brand Celine, wearing a tight black pullover, giant sunglasses and what looks like a brass cowbell around her neck. She’s 80. Or the latest campaign from Dolce & Gabbana. No skinny scantily-clad 20-somethings here, but instead three old women in widow’s black — very chic, naturally — clasping D&G’s latest must-have handbags. I’m guessing they’re all well past their 70th birthday. Novelist Joan Didion, 80, (pictured) stars in this season's Celine campaign, Joan is just one example of older models being used in high fashion advertising . Then there’s singer Joni Mitchell, 71, all over the new Yves Saint Laurent advertisements, lost in music as she plucks at her guitar. And Daphne Selfe, the 86-year-old British model and another D&G veteran, whose career seemingly goes from strength to strength. Meanwhile, finger-on-the-pulse fashion store Selfridges has this year scrapped its annual Bright Young Things showcase — in which it introduces the work of trend-setting young designers — and instead launched Bright Old Things, a platform for stylish 50 to 80-somethings and a celebration, so the shop says, of the ‘retirement renaissance’. Whatever that means. Old ladies, it seems, are having a moment. As though the style-gurus have suddenly decreed that being young is a bit, well, passé. The Dolce and Gabbana Spring/Summer 2015 campaign (pictured) also stars three stylish older women . But why, I wonder? Have the fashionistas at last woken up to the beauty of the ageing female face? Are we, the over-70s, the new Cara Delevingnes? Well, forgive me for being cynical. But I don’t think so. Deep down the fashion industry doesn’t for a moment believe that older women can be style icons, and never has. This is not about grey power, but about the power to shock. For the way in which these older women are photographed by the fashion industry — all sagging skin and lifeless hair and stark lighting with its deep, dark shadows — does them no favours. The images are striking and headline-grabbing, but they are not designed to lure my generation into the shops. I am 74 and have spent more than 50 years in and around the fashion industry — and believe me, there has never been a time when youth was not worshipped as the most desirable quality in a woman. Every woman, whatever her age, was always assumed to want it. Why on earth would you aspire to look old? Joni Mitchell, pictured in 2013, is all over the new Yves Saint Laurent campaign for 2015 . And they do look very old, these women. Only Joan Didion could carry off the austere look she’s been given, make-up free and with her grey hair combed flat. I admire her intellect enormously, but I don’t want to look like her in the Celine advert, and it doesn’t make me want to buy the sunglasses. But these advertisements are not directed at me and my generation. They are far too exclusive for that, with their sheen of urban sophistication and layers of irony. Look at us, they say: aren’t we radical? Putting wrinkly old ladies in young women’s clothes. These ads are still designed to sell frocks to the young. At best they are a bit of fun; at worst, they poke fun. At a pinch they might be art. But truly they are not busting any myths about the fashion industry. Oddly enough I find the Marks & Spencer campaigns much more ground-breaking. In the M&S advertisements, older women feature alongside younger ones, and all of them look stylish, elegant and chic. Older women want to be fashionable — but they also want to be taken seriously, and to be offered clothes in which they will look their best. All of this seems very familiar to me. I made my name as a model during the ‘youthquake’, when the elegant grown-up fashions of the Fifties were forgotten in the rush to celebrate all things young. Neat suits and white gloves gave way to mini-dresses and hot pants. These were not looks anyone over 25 could successfully attempt. No wonder models were on the whole judged past their sell-by-date at 30. I once appeared in a fashion campaign at the geriatric age of 47. When Ralph Lauren’s PRs rang to ask if I would appear in a group shoot, I assumed they’d made a mistake and felt obliged to warn them I was ‘no spring chicken’. To my huge surprise, they still wanted me, and in the end I did a shoot on my own. Yet my appearance in the campaign — wearing well-cut jodhpurs and plain shirt — was still considered daring, Vogue magazine took the time to comment on the ‘originality’ of my inclusion. Like the older women in the current ads, I was a faddish anomaly. But by making news in the right magazine, I served my purpose. Sandra Howard (pictured) is 74 and was featured in a Ralph Lauren campaign at 47. She says her appearance in the campaign was considered daring even then, whereas now the designers are picking far older women . The real proof that fashion hasn’t fundamentally changed is on the shop floor. Old age may have been designated ‘chic’ this season, but it remains very difficult to find smart, stylish clothes that are suitable for a woman of my age. And why do designers still think all 70-year-olds — except those in daft adverts — should be wearing beige? It’s a killer of a colour that makes almost everybody look washed out. There is, however, one sector of the business that has started to get it right. Julia Roberts, 47, (pictured) is the new face of Givenchy cosmetics. Sandra says that the make-up industry is are the real champions of the fashionable pensioner . At 47, actress Julia Roberts has been hired as new face of Givenchy cosmetics. Indeed, the real champions of the fashionable pensioner are the make-up companies. At last they have begun to appreciate who their real customers are, and how much disposable cash they have. A third of the British population is aged over 50, while most major household spending decisions are taken by women aged between 40 and 60. More women over the age of 50 are working than ever before. Twenty years ago, the radiant Isabella Rossellini was famously dropped by make-up company Lancôme for being ‘too old’ days after her 40th birthday. Sandra Howard saus she found Marks and Spencer's 2011 adverts featuring veteran models like Twiggy (centre) alongside younger models far more groundbreaking than those solely showing older women . But that ridiculous ageism is long gone in the cosmetics industry. Look at the L’Oreal advertisements starring Dame Helen Mirren, 69. Who wouldn’t want to look like her — whatever their age? Or for that matter, like Charlotte Rampling, 68, who smouldered in last year’s campaign for Nars cosmetics? These women are allowed to look beautiful rather than bizarre. And as they know so well, real style is ageless. There aren’t many good things about growing old, but one is that you start to care much less what other people think about you. Which is a good thing in my book. Otherwise we’d all be posing in sunglasses and polo necks and impractical dresses which would look much better on our daughters. Or our grand-daughters, come to that.","Joan Didion for Celine, Joni Mitchell for Yves Saint Laurent and Daphne Self, a D&G veteran, are all examples of older models of the moment .
But is this really a nod to the older generation or is it just a shock tactic?
Sandra Howard says these ads are not directed at her and her generation but just a new way of selling clothes to the young ."
"Ed Miliband has been accused of 'hypocrisy' for ignoring Labour's Welsh NHS crisis while trying to reap electoral profit from England's Health Service problems. More than 100 patients have signed an open letter to the Labour leader claiming he has 'turned a blind eye' to more serious failings in Wales. They also demanded a full inquiry into the Welsh NHS's troubles – a call echoed by one of Britain's most respected surgeons. Ed Miliband has been criticised for ignoring Labour's Welsh NHS crisis while trying to gain electoral profit from England's Health Service problems . Former Royal College of Surgeons president Professor Sir Norman Williams said there were enough worrying 'smoke signals' to justify holding an independent inquiry into potential problems in the Welsh NHS. He pointed to previous concerns raised by Labour MP Ann Clwyd, the British Medical Association, NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh and the Royal College of Surgeons. Sir Norman suggested the review should be like the one carried out by Sir Bruce in 2013 into English hospitals with high mortality rates. He said: 'I feel there may be issues in Wales that are similar to issues found in England some time ago. Rather than sweep it under the carpet or deny it, the sensible thing would be to consider investigating it properly. 'When we had similar problems in England, Sir Bruce Keogh was asked to look at those hospitals where there appeared to be a higher mortality rate. 'It seems to me that that is the responsible way to handle it. The problem is that it's a political football at the moment.' Mr Miliband has repeatedly vehemently criticised the Tories' handling of the Health Service in England in recent months. But he has refused to deny claims that he said he wanted to 'weaponise' the NHS to help win the General Election in May. Now 131 patients in Wales have backed a letter organised by the Welsh Conservatives that condemns the 'scandalous postcode lottery' in waiting times, ambulance delays and A&E standards. They tell Mr Miliband in the letter: 'You regularly claim that the English NHS is in a state of 'crisis'. However, you have consistently refused to comment on the situation in Wales, where you lead the party that runs the health service. 'As the leader of the Labour Party, we are asking you to take responsibility for this state of affairs, to back a public inquiry into the condition of the Welsh NHS, and to commit to work with Welsh Ministers to increase the budget and restore equality of care standards across the UK. 'It is simply hypocrisy to call it a crisis in England and then turn a blind eye to the more serious situation in Wales.' A new poll shows the NHS will be the top issue for voters at the election, and Mr Miliband has sought to capitalise on the problems in England's Health Service. The Labour leader tweeted this month: 'The Tories' NHS crisis means more patients than ever on record are waiting over 4 hours in A&E. Only Labour will protect our NHS.' But new statistics show that only 81 per cent of patients visiting Welsh emergency units in December were treated within four hours, the lowest rate since records began in 2009. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said it was a disgrace for Mr Miliband to speak of a crisis in England when he refused to call Labour to order in Wales . In England 90.2 per cent of people were seen within this time limit against a target of 95 per cent, although the numbers are not directly comparable because of differences in how they are recorded. Last month, 2,420 patients at major A&E units in Wales had to wait more than 12 hours before being treated, and over the past year there were 15,895 such waits. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said it was a disgrace for Mr Miliband to speak of a crisis in England when he refused to call Labour to order in Wales. 'Ed Miliband is making a grave mistake in seeking to 'weaponise' the NHS as an election issue, and Welsh patients in particular will be furious at his double standards,' he added. 'Every time he speaks about health, people are reminded of the devastation that the Labour Party has unleashed on the Welsh NHS after years of savage budget cuts.' A Labour spokesman said: 'David Cameron attacks Wales to run away from his own record in England, where A&Es are in crisis and patients are waiting longer for operations and cancer treatment. 'The independent Nuffield Trust found that no one part of the UK has a health service that is consistently ahead or behind. The Welsh NHS improved dramatically in the past 15 years. When the Tories were last in charge in Wales, patients waited two years for operations – that's why people don't trust them with the NHS.' Tina Donnelly, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, yesterday criticised the rival parties for using the Health Service as a 'political football'. She told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme that Wales needs more than 2,500 extra nurses, including 1,000 in acute care to tackle the A&E crisis.","More than 100 patients sign letter saying Miliband has ignored Wales NHS .

"Victims and witnesses to crimes are to be warned they face a grilling over their private life after celebrities like Nigella Lawson compared their court experience to a 'witch-hunt'. Under new plans by the country's top prosecutor, alleged victims and witnesses will be told if their sexual history is to be brought up and their reputation likely to be dragged through the mud when they take the stand. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), has published proposed guidance for prosecutors on the 'radical' new approach to prevent trial witnesses being ambushed by defence barristers in cross examination. Scroll down for video . Nigella Lawson famously described her experience as a witness in the trial of her ex-husband Charles Saatchi's personal assistants as 'mortifying' and said it was like having 'a layer of skin removed' The move comes after a number of high profile cases have raised questions about the treatment of prosecution witnesses. Nigella Lawson famously described her experience as a witness in the trial of her ex-husband Charles Saatchi's personal assistants as 'mortifying' and said it was like having 'a layer of skin removed'. The television chef was forced into a dramatic courtroom confession of drug-taking during the fraud trial of her two aides, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, who were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from her and Mr Saatchi while in their service. When asked about her marriage to the art dealer and taking cocaine she told Isleworth Crown Court there was a 'witch hunt' against her and that she was on trial with no counsel and 'no rights'. She said: 'I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.' Following the sensational trial which ended in her former aides being acquitted in December 2013, her brother Dominic Lawson likened her treatment to the burning of heretics in the Spanish Inquisition and warned that the 'vicious' treatment of prosecution witnesses is a threat to British justice because it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence. But there are also concerns that under the new proposals, key witnesses could back out of giving evidence leading to prosecutions collapsing if they are forewarned pre-trial that defence barristers want to quiz them about embarrassing details of their personal life. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has published proposed guidance for prosecutors on the new approach to prevent trial witnesses being ambushed by defence barristers in cross examination . A number of other high-profile trials which saw prosecution witnesses subjected to intimate questions have caused outrage, including the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler who were quizzed about porn magazines and bondage by a lawyer representing her killer Levi Bellfield during his trial. Violinist Frances Andrade committed suicide in 2013 after giving evidence against a teacher who sexually abused her as a child. Under the new plans, prosecutors will be able to tell witnesses and alleged victims the general nature of the defence case and point out material such as social services or medical records disclosed to the defence about them which could undermine the prosecution's case. They should also be informed when permission has been granted to question them on aspects of 'bad character' or 'sexual history'. But the guidelines, which will be put out for consultation for eight weeks, are expected to trigger debate among members of the criminal bar about the risk of 'coaching' witnesses and alleged victims - a practice that is forbidden. Miss Saunders said: 'It's about testing their evidence but it's not about putting them on trial - they should remember that. 'There's no reason why witnesses should be ambushed.' She said: 'It struck me more and more actually that on our side of the fence we chose to be in the criminal justice system, we know what to expect. 'They (alleged victims and witnesses) did not choose to be in the criminal justice system. They are all here for some dramatic event that happened to them. They have very little idea as to what will happen to them.' She added: 'It doesn't really help confidence in the criminal justice system when victims and witnesses will say 'I wouldn't want to go through that again'.' Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove, whose husband Garry was killed in August 2007 after he confronted a group of yobs outside his house, said: 'Most victims and witnesses don't know what to expect from a courtroom until it is too late. 'They are thrown into a highly intimidating situation through no fault of their own and then left with little or no explanation to help them through it. 'I've always been clear that there should be better CPS policy on pre-trial assistance and more information on what support is available.' Attorney General Jeremy Wright said: 'Anyone who has gone through the ordeal of a court trial, especially victims who are called to give evidence as a witness, knows how daunting the process can be. 'This guidance will help witnesses understand what they can expect when they are in court and also explain the process for what happens next.'","Victims and witnesses to be warned they face grilling over their private life .

"ACTION PLAN . Wisteria will benefit greatly from being pruned in late summer — and certainly again this month. In August, you should have removed all the long, wispy summer growths, cutting each back to a stump with seven leaves along the length. It helps even more if you now shorten those stumps further, to about three buds. While summer pruning stimulates flower production, this month's cuts will enhance bloom quality. If you didn't prune your wisteria last summer, don't despair. You should still enjoy plenty of spring blossom and the plant's health will not be compromised. But pruning makes these rampant climbers far easier to manage and also helps develop a handsome gnarled appearance. Twice-yearly pruning also encourages the plant to develop more spurs — the short growths that carry most of the blossom. Hellebore Leaf Spot (pictured) is a fungal disease affecting leaves and flower stems . READER'S QUESTION . We planted a Christmas rose last year and enjoyed the flowers for months. But now the leaves have large black spots and there aren't many flowers. Is there a cure? Mrs M. Lucas, Norfolk. Black marks on leaves and flower stems are caused by fungal disease Hellebore Leaf Spot. Prevent its spread by removing all affected leaves and stems as soon as any spots appear. Treatment with a fungicide such as myclobutanil is worth a try — though it is not specifically recommended by suppliers. CHECK WINTER CONTAINERS . Make sure outdoor containers are draining properly and the drainage holes are not plugged up by soil . Ensure outdoor containers are draining as they should. Modern potting composts tend to compact as they decompose in the winter and that reduces their ability to let water drain away. Ants can also can block drainage holes by carrying soil particles into the bottom of the containers over time. This sets like clay, creating a plug. If drainage holes are blocked plants suffer root damage and can die. So, if you are able, lift each container to make sure there are no obstructions. Large tubs are difficult to inspect but you do need to make sure they drain properly. You can stand large containers on little 'feet' to raise them a centimetre or so above the ground. This helps to prevent the holes clogging. You can buy manufactured 'feet' for big pots, but I find pieces of broken tile work almost as well and cost nothing. CARE FOR YOUR AMARYLLIS . Now is the time to take care of your Amaryllis (pictured) water the pot regularly and feed weekly . If you were given an amaryllis for Christmas, it will need some attention now. These bulbs, more correctly called Hippeastrum, are among Britain's most popular winter houseplants. But most people dump them when their huge blooms have died. That's a shame because they're easy to bring into flower year after year. To do this, water the pot regularly while the flowers are alive and feed once a week as soon as leaves appear with a houseplant fertiliser such as Baby Bio Original. Allow the handsome, straplike leaves to develop and keep the plants in a conservatory, frost-free greenhouse or near a window. They can spend summer outside, in full sun. Continue to feed while the leaves still grow. In July, stop watering, let the leaves wither and dry before cutting off. Water again from September and bring the plant back indoors before the first frost. The silk tassel bush, Garrya elliptica (pictured), originates from the U.S . PLANT OF THE WEEK . The silk tassel bush, Garrya elliptica, which originates from the western coastal regions of the U.S., is one of the great joys of winter. Its evergreen leaves are quietly pretty with gently wavy edges. These make a perfect foil for the pale green catkins, which are wonderfully long and hang plumb-line straight. Long catkins appear only on male plants — the females have more stumpy fruits. And it's worth selecting a named clone such as James Roof or the more wavy-leaved Evie. Garrya is hardy in much of Britain, but will suffer in excessively cold regions. It can be wall-trained, for extra protection, and needs to grow in a sunny position to produce good catkins.","Pruning in the summer stimulates flower production but cuts at this time of year will enhance bloom quality .

"Worried police officers are now allowed to remove their names from their uniforms, in a change brought in after an increasing number of cops reported receiving death threats from criminals. NSW officers pushed for the change to obscure their identities after they and their families reportedly received verbal abuse via telephone and on social media. One male cop was allegedly warned he would be decapitated when  a western Sydney man - who claimed to be a member of terrorist group Islamic State -  called Rosehill Local Area Command. Police Association of NSW president Scott Weber told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We’ve had officers targeted on Facebook, Twitter and trolled and attacked with threats against their families and this is why the commissioner has agreed to it.’ Scroll down for video . NSW Police officers are now allowed to have their names removed from their uniforms after some reported being threatened after being identified on social media (stock photo shown) The move to replace name badges with registered ID number badges in NSW comes after Queensland Police already approved the change last year in response to officers being threatened by bikie gangs. In Queensland, officers can also now choose to only display their rank and registered number instead of their name. A police union source told Daily Mail Australia that criminals were remembering distinctive names and the move – backed by Queensland’s premier Campbell Newman 18 months ago - offers officers more protection. ‘People are very happy with it,’ he said. Mr Weber said in NSW ‘all officers can apply’ to have their name badge swapped for a number. He denied that the move was about hiding their identities. ID registered numbers are already in use in place of names in Queensland Police after officers were given the choice . Police in Queensland, seen here patrolling in the Brisbane CBD ahead of the G20 Leader's Summit on November 10, 2014, were also threatened on social media . ‘It’s about making sure they are protected due to social media. We’ve had them be targeted and trolled and it’s not about hiding names it’s about protecting families in a heightened terrorism environment. ‘In the age of social media it’s paramount for officers to have some kind of protection,’ Mr Weber said. Prompting the change were calls from officers who were worried about being identified at ‘protests or large scale events’. ‘This is what the officers have wanted for a number of times across NSW and that is what they’ve deemed they need. When asked if a member of the community has the right to ask an officer their name, Mr Weber said: ‘There are still officers who will give their name and we have really good customer service in dealing with the community. 'But the officer can just give a registered number if they feel intimated.’ One state that isn’t giving up its name badges is Victoria. A Police Association of Victoria spokesperson said ‘We’ve had name badges for years and I don’t think there’s any move to change it.’ He said he hadn’t received any complaints from officers to move to ID numbers.","NSW officers pushed for the change to obscure their identities .

"The Labour party is at loggerheads with the White House after Barack Obama heaped praise on his 'great friend' David Cameron in an extraordinary pre-election endorsement. Harriet Harman today declared that the US President was 'wrong' to praise the Tory economic strategy for ensuring Britain 'stands out' on the world stage. Privately senior Labour figures are dismayed at the backing from the US, especially after Ed Miliband hired a senior Obama aide to advise his election campaign. Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama today handed David Cameron an extraordinary pre-election endorsement, hailing the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend' Images of Mr Cameron with the US President, who is more popular in the UK than in America, have delighted Tory strategists. The personal support from a Democrat President for a Conservative has caused dismay for Labour, who hoped a visit to Washington last year had bolstered his image as a potential statesman. Mr Miliband is also under pressure for paying a huge salary to David Axelrod, a former Obama election campaign guru. Many in the Labour party had hoped the appointment would help to secure support from the White House. 'I'm not quite sure why we're paying Axelrod £300,000,' one Labour frontbencher told the Sunday Times. 'We should ask for our money back.' Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted the US President was 'wrong' to suggest the British economy was on the right track . The Obama endorsement of Mr Cameron came after it emerged the US President refers to the Prime Minister privately as his 'bro'. At a press conference on Friday, the President 'Let me put this speculation to rest: put simply, David is a great friend. He is one of my closest and most trusted partners in the world. 'On many of the challenges we face... we see the world the same way. 'Great Britain is our indispensable partner - and David personally an outstanding partner.' Suggesting Britain should stick to its current economic course, President Obama declared: 'On the economy, I would note that Great Britain and the US are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. 'So we must be doing something right.' The glowing tribute came during a press conference in the White House after a two-day visit to Washington . Labour leader Ed Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election . Labour irritation at the remarks spilled into the public today, when Ms Harman, the party's deputy leader, insisted the US President was wrong. 'He's wrong in that he's not reflecting the fact that, although the economy is back in growth, that growth is not being felt by people and it's a recovery that is being accompanied by a stagnation in living standards,' she told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. 'And that's why we are saying that people are no better off, the recovery hasn't reached their front door and the economy is not working for everyday people – it's just working for a few people at the top. 'And I'm sure President Obama, if he heard me say that, would agree with me.' Christine Lagarde, head of the international Monetary Fund, shakes hands with Prime Minister David Cameron after giving a glowing endorsement of the British economy last wek . Ms Harman also questioned Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who last week said the UK was setting an example to the rest of the world. Labour's deputy leader said the IMF had failed to address the question of living standards. 'Ed Miliband is absolutely right that although there is a recovery, it is not helping ordinary everyday people whose living standards are stagnating. And he's right to say the deficit has not been brought down by the Tories.' A spokesman for Miliband said: 'Barack Obama met Ed, which is not something he normally does with a leader of the opposition. I don't think the White House is endorsing any political party in this election and nor should they be.'","US President used White House visit to hail the PM as a 'great friend'

"South Africa batsman AB de Villiers scored the fastest-ever one-day international century as South Africa piled on the runs in a crushing 148-run defeat of the West Indies. The number three needed 31 deliveries to reach the milestone in the second ODI in Johannesburg, five fewer than previous record holder Corey Anderson, who needed 36 balls to pass the mark against the same opposition last year. The Proteas ended their innings on 439 for two, four runs shy of the highest ever ODI score by a team - set by Sri Lanka in 2006 against Holland. And it was a target that proved well beyond the tourists, who reached 291 for seven in reply with Dwayne Smith (64) and Denesh Ramdin (57) the highlights of a respectable - if futile - chase. AB de Villiers celebrates his stunning century in 31 deliveries against West Indies in Johannesburg . De Villiers reached his landmark five balls quicker than New Zealand's Corey Anderson did in 2014 . Chris Gayle salutes De Villiers as the South African leaves the ground after his dismissal . Gayle and De Villiers, who are team-mates in the Indian Premier League, shake hands . 1. 31 balls - AB De Villiers (South Africa vs West Indies, Johannesburg, January 2015) 2. 36 balls – Corey Anderson (New Zealand vs West Indies, Queesntown, January 2014) 3. 37 balls – Shahid Afridi (Pakistan vs Sri Lanka, Nairobi, October 1996) 4. 44 balls – Mark Boucher (South Africa vs Zimbabwe, Potchefstroom, September 2006) 5. 45 balls – Brian Lara (West Indies vs Bangladesh, Dhaka, October 1999) = 45 balls – Shahid Afridi (Pakistan vs India, Kanpur, April 2005) South Africa openers Hashim Amla and Rilee Rossouw also scored centuries as they made 247 in just over 38 overs for the first wicket. Rossouw scored 128 from 115 balls before he was caught at mid-off to give Jerome Taylor a wicket, while Amla finished unbeaten on 153 from 142 deliveries. But it was largely the De Villiers show and he quickly broke Sanath Jayasuriya's 19-year record for the fastest ODI fifty, taking a mere 16 deliveries to achieve the feat by launching Jason Holder over the long-off boundary. He then needed a further 15 balls to break Anderson's year-old fastest ODI century record - smashing 10 sixes and eight fours in doing so. Any West Indian hopes that De Villiers would subsequently relax were soon dismissed as he and Amla continued to pepper the New Wanderers Stadium boundary on regular occasion. De Villiers soon set his sights on breaking another record - the most sixes in an individual ODI innings - and equalled the record Rohit Sharma set in 2013 against Australia when he smashed his 16th maximum on the penultimate ball of the penultimate over. De Villiers hits a delivery during the second One-Day International against the West Indies . Jerome Taylor (left) attempts a catch after making a delivery to South Africa captain De Villiers . The wicketkeeper-batsman could not score another to make the record his own, however, when he went for another huge hit off Andre Russell and was caught at deep extra cover with two balls left having scored 149 from 44 balls. De Villers received a standing ovation from the crowd at the Wanderers as he made his way off the field, and he was saluted by West Indian batsman Chris Gayle. De Villiers and Gayle, who are team-mates in the Indian Premier League with the Royal Challengers Bangalore, then shook hands just before end end of South Africa's innings. Amla and David Miller saw out proceedings for South Africa, while West Indies' daunting task became even more difficult when Chris Gayle pulled Morne Morkel to Farhaan Behardien for 19. Leon Johnson came and went for a single but Smith and Marlon Samuels tried to make a fight of it with a fourth-wicket stand of 59 before the former was removed by Behardien. Vernon Philander then ended Samuels' stay on 40 before another successful partnership of 83 was built between Ramdin and Jonathan Carter. However, the runs could not come quickly enough despite their best efforts and Carter fell for 40 to Dale Steyn with Russell soon following for a duck. De Villiers is all smiles after hitting a century against the West Indies at the Wanderers Stadium . 1. 443-9 – SRI LANKA vs Netherlands, Amstelveen, July 2006 . 2. 439-2 – SOUTH AFRICA vs West Indies, Johannesburg, January 2015 . 3. 438-9 – SOUTH AFRICA vs Australia, Johannesburg, March 2006 . 4. 434-4 – AUSTRALIA vs South Africa, Johannesburg, March 2006 . 5. 418-5 – SOUTH AFRICA vs Zimbabwe, Potchefstroom, September 2006 . = 418-5 – INDIA vs West Indies, Indore, December 2011 . Ramdin was the last wicket to fall, Faf du Plessis taking the catch at deep square leg to give Morkel his second scalp, with the damage largely done before West Indies had even arrived at the crease. Speaking on Sky Sports, De Villiers said: 'I think I was on 92 when I realised it had to be close. 'I was never sure how many balls it was that Corey Anderson took to get to 100 but I knew I had to be close and I wasn't going to take ones in the 90s. '(Coach) Russell (Domingo) actually made a really good call towards the end of the innings asking me to go in. I wanted David (Miller) to go in to go and take the left-arm spinner on. 'I sort of played my knock even before I went out to bat and the word aggression was probably the thing for me today. I wanted to go from the word go.'","The South Africa captain scored the fastest-ever one-day international century against the West Indies on Sunday .

"Endless flights of swans who arrive here because they think our dark and chilly island is the most blissful place on earth . Swanfall. A good word: a great spectacle. Swan after swan after swan, falling from the wintry sky as if cold were the most blessed thing in the world. It’s one of the greatest sights that Britain can offer: endless flights of swans who arrive here because they think our dark and chilly island is the most blissful place on earth. Human observers may feel the cold bite into the marrow of their bones as temperatures plummet this week, but for these swans it’s like landing on the beach in Barbados. And their first job is to get their towels on the sun-loungers. So the birds sort themselves out: who is the most important, who gives way to whom. It’s a family thing: they go at it in gangs of up to half-a-dozen, united in purpose. Parents and the offspring they have raised that year fly in from the Arctic together, so no wonder they find our winter balmy. They return to traditional sites, and once they have made their descent to the lake — water- skiing in on big black feet — they settle the question of dominance. Family groups will have face-offs with each other. No fighting: just a noisy demonstration of strength: synchronised neck-waving while making a noise like a bugle. Numbers matter: a family of six will force a family of four to back down, but there are other factors, some of them unclear even to the most clued-up observer. Once the league table is sorted out, they co-exist amicably and socially, so long as no one crosses the line. They hang out together all winter, often foraging in fields by day before returning to the lake when dusk falls in mid-afternoon — a luxuriously long day by the standards of an Arctic winter. The noise, the honking and the bugling, fills the skies as the birds come in on their evening flight: proud-looking, stiff-necked birds with great yellow beaks, dramatically unlike the swans that we have with us all year. These are whooper swans and Bewick’s swans: often collectively referred to as wild swans. We tend to measure the wild winter by the birds that fly south in the autumn to escape the chill, such as swallows and swifts, cuckoos, warblers and nightingales. But for plenty of birds, Britain in winter is a haven of warmth and shelter and food. We’re an island, and that’s of great relevance to our shifting population of birds. The Gulf Stream ocean current keeps our weather milder than the rest of continental Europe. Meanwhile, what could be more English than a blackbird? You’ll see plenty. But a closer look will tell you a rum thing: they all seem to be cock birds. The females are browny and dull-looking: only the males are black with those banana-coloured beaks. You wonder how there could be enough females for them when it’s spring and time to breed. But many of them aren’t British in the sense of being hatched here, breeding here and living here all year round. A lot of those you see in winter breed in Scandinavia, Poland, Russia and the Baltic. They come here to escape the continental winter. The females tend to fly further south, to winter in warmer places than Britain, places where the food supply is more certain. But for the males, the closer they are to the breeding-grounds, the earlier they can get back. For the cock blackbirds in your garden, the waders on the estuary and the swans who take over the lake, Britain in winter is a subtropical paradise . The earliest birds get the best territories and defend them by singing to stake their claim. By the time they’ve done so, the females make their leisurely way back, ready to meet a great blackbird with an inviting spread of territory and the sexiest singing voice in the neighbourhood. So the male birds’ winter stay in Britain is, in fact, a kind of extended stag weekend. Here’s a way to understand what winter really means. Wrap up well this week and take a walk along a river estuary. Our island has hundreds of them, and they tend to be the bleakest places on earth, hence the need for at least one more layer than you think physically possible. But it’s here you can look for birds that come in their thousands to revel in the comparative kindness of our climate and in the abundant food on offer. The mud exposed by the outgoing tide is covered with long- legged birds that paddle and poke their beaks into this gloopy silt in search of the millions of wormy creatures that live there. But you can also savour the joys of winter just by looking through the window at a garden or from the car as you pass a park. That English robin that seems to have hopped from a Christmas card may be a Russian: continental birds fly through Britain in the autumn on their way to somewhere warmer, and a good few of them decide to go no further. Then there are the winter thrushes: birds we see only in the colder months. If it wears a lavish eyebrow it’s a redwing, if it flies away and shows you a black tail — clucking a little like a chicken — it’s a fieldfare. Both thrushes breed in Scandinavia and Russia and come here for winter holidays. But perhaps the best tip for winter birding is to go to supermarket car parks. They are the ideal habitat for one of the most dashing winter visitors of them all: birds that look raffish and a shade disreputable. They’re waxwings, unpredictable birds that arrive sometimes in ones and twos, more often in small groups, sometimes in decent-sized flocks. And like planners of supermarkets: they’re mad for berries. Supermarket car parks tend to be planted with low-maintenance, berry-laden cotoneasters, and waxwings often descend on them. Or they will take a fancy to a suburban street, one on which the householders share their taste for berries, and hang out for a day or a week. There are times when Britain feels like an Arctic wasteland, at least to those of us who live here. But some of our visitors see the place in a different way. For the cock blackbirds in your garden, the waders on the estuary and the swans who take over the lake, Britain in winter is a subtropical paradise. Even in winter, our island — the wild parts that remain — represents the future, hope, and life.","Every year, birds flock to Britain to settle in lakes and river estuaries .

"The Sydney siege gunman was reportedly rejected from joining a bikie gang in Australia before he claimed he was a member of terrorist group Islamic State. Man Haron Monis, who staged the fatal 16-hour siege at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, was turned down by the Rebels Motorcycle Club ‘because he was mad,’ a former NSW detective has revealed. ‘My information is that he was a nominee for Rebels not so long ago. They got rid of him… they said he was not suitable for us,’ Michael Kennedy, now the head of the University of Western Sydney policing ­program, told The Australian. Scroll down for video . Fake sheikh Man Haron Monis reportedly tried to join the Rebels bikie gang before he began claiming he was a member of terrorist group Islamic State . The Rebels are the oldest and largest bikie club in Australia, having some 70 chapters and over 2000 members across the country. Monis, who arrived in Australia as a refugee in 1996, reportedly tried to join the leather-clad bikers before April 2013. The lone-wolf terrorist, 50, was shot by police on December 16 2014 after he had seized control of the busy café in Martin Place and held staff and patrons hostage for almost 17 hours before police stormed in. Two hostages - barrister Katrina Dawson and café manager Tori Johnson – were also killed in the shootout. The Rebels (left) are said to have rejected the Sydney siege gunman (right) because he was 'mad' The Rebels are the oldest and largest bikie club in Australia, having some 70 chapters and over 2000 members across the country . The self-proclaimed sheik was on bail facing charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, when he stormed the café. Monis, who was born in Iran and whose real name is recorded as Mohammad Hassas Manteghi, was due to face court on February 27 next year. He was placed on a good behaviour bond in 2013 when he wrote a series of offensive letters to families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. But within a year he had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife's murder and more than 40 sex offences against several women. Ms Pal, 30, was stabbed to death and set alight in April 2013 in a Werrington unit block in western Sydney. Many of Monis's hostages, one seen here, managed to escape the Lindt Chocolat cafe in Martin Place, Sydney, before a police shootout . Hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson were killed as the 16-hour siege came to an end . He had been released on bail in December last year on the accessory charge under the old bail laws. However, he reappeared in court on May 26, only days after new bail laws came into effect, and again in October over new sexual assault offences. He was deemed then to pose an 'unacceptable risk to interfering with witnesses and endangering the safety of victims and individuals in the community'. But the 50-year-old committed sexual offences against women in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September 2014. The assaults committed in his registered business called Spiritual Consultation included sexual intercourse without consent and rubbing of genitalia during sessions in which he apparently acted as a 'spiritual healer'. Further court documents show he threatened to shoot the mother of his two sons at Minchinbrook in western Sydney, almost two years before Noleen Hayson Pal was murdered.","Man Haron Monis reportedly tried to join motorcycle club before April 2013 .

"Oprah Winfrey and other stars from the Martin Luther King biopic Selma marched with hundreds of others on Sunday ahead of the holiday to mark the  civil rights leader's achievements. Winfrey, who produced and starred in Selma,  marched hand-in-hand with the film's director, Ava DuVernay, actor David Oyelowo, who portrayed King in the movie, and the rapper Common. They marched from Selma City Hall to the city's Edmund Pettus Bridge, where civil rights protesters were beaten and tear-gassed by officers in 1965. 'Every single person who was on that bridge is a hero,' Winfrey told the marchers before they walked up the bridge as the sun was going down over the Alabama River. Scroll down for video .

Common and John Legend join the Tuskegee University Choir during a commemorative march in Selma, Alabama to mark the historic civil rights event . Their steps in tribute to Dr King in Alabama came as key black members of Congress elsewhere invoked recent police shootings of young black men as evidence that reforms are needed to ensure equal justice for all. Winfrey said those who came to Selma were seeking to remember 'Martin Luther King as an idea, Selma as an idea and what can happen with strategy, with discipline and with love'. Winfrey played the civil rights activist Annie Lee Cooper in the movie, which has been nominated for two Oscars, in categories of best picture and best original song. A new march, led by Martin Luther King Jr., began on March 21 of 1965 and arrived in Montgomery days later with the crowd swelling to 25,000 . Selma chronicled the campaign leading up to the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and the subsequent passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Law enforcement officers used clubs and tear gas on March 7, 1965 — Bloody Sunday — to rout marchers intent on walking some 50 miles to Montgomery, the Alabama capital, to seek the right for blacks to register to vote. A new march, led by Martin Luther King Jr., began on March 21 of that year and arrived in Montgomery days later with the crowd swelling to 25,000.

Common and John Legend join the Tuskegee University Choir in Alabama on Sunday. Movie stars from the MLK biopic Selma were also at the commemorative march . On Sunday, the Selma bridge and adjoining downtown business district look much as they did in 1965, though many storefronts are empty and government buildings are occupied largely by African-American officials who are beneficiaries of the Voting Rights Act. Lisa Stevens brought her two children, aged six and ten, so they could walk the bridge that King walked. 'I wanted to bring my children here so they can know their history and for them to participate in this walk,' said Stevens, who moved recently from New York to Greensboro, Alabama. Winfrey told marchers before they walked up the bridge that in Selma that 'every single person who was on that bridge is a hero' Marchers hold up a ""March On"" sign as they make their way towards the Edmund Pettus Bridge the Edmund Pettus Bridge in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. on Sunday .

Being that we're in the South now I want them to understand everything that is going on around them,' Stevens added. McLinda Gilchrist, 63, said the movie should help a younger generation understand what life was like in the 1960s during the struggle to end racial discrimination. 'They treated us worse than animals,' Gilchrist said of how the original marchers were treated. David Oyelowo, second left, portrays Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in a scene from Selma. The film was nominated for an Oscar Award for best feature on Thursday . 'It was terrifying,' recalled Lynda Blackmon Lowery, who still lives in Selma, Alabama, and was the youngest person to march there in 1965 as a teenager. A mother and grandmother who is now 65, she spoke on Sunday in New York of a harrowing experience of unarmed marchers going up against rifles, billy clubs and fierce dogs.  She has since written a memoir, 'Turning 15 on the Road to Freedom.' Common and John Legend performed their Oscar-nominated song Glory from the movie as marchers crested the top of the bridge amid the setting sun. Lynda Blackmon Lowery speaks during an appearance at the New York Historical Society on Sunday. At 15, she was the youngest person to join Martin Luther King Jr. for the nonviolent 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery . For Monday's federal holiday, people around the country were remembering King's leadership, some in light of the fatal police shootings that had recently shaken the U.S., including the death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown last year in Ferguson, Missouri. Eight members of the Congressional Black Caucus joined U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay at Wellspring United Methodist Church in Ferguson on Sunday as they invoked King's legacy. They vowed to seek criminal justice reform. 'We need to be outraged when local law enforcement and the justice system repeatedly allow young, unarmed black men to encounter police and then wind up dead with no consequences,' the St. Louis Democrat said.

Martin Luther King Jr. also was being celebrated at the church he pastored in Atlanta. The current pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, said the annual King holiday is a time when 'all of God's children are busy spreading the message of freedom and justice.' In the Sunday sermon, Professor James Cone of New York's Union Theological Seminary urged Ebenezer's congregation to celebrate the slain civil rights leader 'by making a political and a religious commitment to complete his work of justice.'

"If his PR machine is a reliable source of information, North Korea's Dear Leader Kim Jong Un is constantly touring his domain offering his 'field guidance' on everything from missile launches to mushroom farms. After five years at Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung University, the despot is no doubt a highly efficient technocrat. But these pictures show him working on a problem he can really sink his teeth into - food. Scroll down for video . Serious work: North Korea's leader Kim Jon Un inspects cellophane-wrapped snacks as he gives field guidance to workers at the Kumkop General Foodstuff Factory for Sportspersons . Pitiless: Aides look on nervously and take notes as Kim inspects rows of soft drinks at the factory . Kim is seen here staring intently at rows of packaged snacks and soft drinks, as he offered his nuggets of wisdom to the workers at the Kumkop General Foodstuff Factory for Sportspersons. Appearing jovial in most pictures, the 32-year-old First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea chatted happily to staff and henchmen, who eagerly took down his advice in tiny notebooks. However, he turned serious when confronted with the final packaged products, staring pitilessly at bottles of soft drinks and squatting down on his haunches to get a closer look at cellophane-wrapped snacks. As white-coated aides peered nervously over their Dear Leader's shoulder, he took one package of unidentified multi-coloured sportspersons' foodstuff in hand and glowered at the rest. The fate of the snacks is not known, but it is understood that the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army has a prodigious appetite. I'll have these delivered to my country retreat: Kim talks to factory managers in front of stacks of bottled soft drinks - which from afar look curiously similar to capitalist equivalents available in the West . Next time I want a white coat that does up: Factory bosses scribble notes as Kim - who is a graduate of five years military officer training school - pronounces on the best way to run a food factory . Resisting temptation: Kim keeps his hands stuffed firmly in his pockets as he peers into a storage bin that looks like it contains thousands of crisps that assembly line workers are toiling to make in the background . Last September, after North Korea admitted Kim was ill, rumours swept the world that the tubby tyrant may have gout - a condition linked to an overindulgent lifestyle that is historically known as 'the disease of kings'. Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. North Korea observers have speculated that Kim's weight and family background may have contributed to his apparent gout. As pictures emerged today of Kim contemplating foodstuffs for sportspersons, on the world stage former senior U.S. officials met with North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator in Singapore. Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council, a U.S.-based nonprofit, said the meeting would cover the North's nuclear missile programmes. He said: 'It's two ways of taking each other's temperature.' I like this place: Kim grins, although his aides are beginning to look rather uncomfortable behind him . You can all live, except the old guy! The aide pictured far right looks particularly unhappy with the visit . The U.S. and North Korea have no formal diplomatic ties, but former U.S. officials occasionally meet the North's diplomats in a bid to settle the impasse over Pyongyang's apparent pursuit of a long-range nuclear missile that could hit the U.S. mainland. Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs and has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006. But experts are divided on how far the opaque government has come in the technology needed to miniaturise a warhead. Pictures of tyrant Kim's tours of his domain's nuclear weapons facilities have as yet not been released by North Korean state media.","Kim visited the Kumkop General Foodstuff Factory for Sportspersons .

"The U.S. has become a less affordable place to live this year - but still trumps the UK and Australia in cost of living figures. A survey reveals Australia is the sixth-most expensive state to live, and Britain the 10th, in 2015. America clocks in at number 24 on this year's official chart, up from 28 last year. The survey took into account cost of groceries, transportation, restaurants and utilities. More expensive but not in the big leagues: The U.S. ranked 24th in the world's cost of living table . Switzerland, Norway and Denmark appeared in the top five for the third year in a row. In a damning reflection of Venezuela's domestic problems, the Latin American country has climbed from 12th place in 2013 to third place in 2015. Iceland has also jumped significantly - up from 10th place in 2013 to fourth in 2015. The world report done by Numbeo was fashioned into an infographic by movehub - a resource for people moving abroad. Pricey! Australia is the sixth most expensive place in the world to live in, according to new research . In it for the long haul: Switzerland is the costliest place to live in the world after four years in second place . All nations were compared to the cost of living in New York. For example, if a country has a consumer price index of 70 on movehub's infographic then on average its cost of living is 30 per cent cheaper than that of New York's. Movehub explains the cost of groceries took into account the price for meat, bread, rice, eggs, fruits, vegetables and alcohol. While, transportation costs included one-way tickets, monthly passes, taxi fares, petrol prices and other costs related to running a car based on the use of Volkswagen Golf. Top ten: The UK was 10th on the cost of living table which takes into account groceries and travel . India comes out as having the lowest cost of living, with poor wages matched by poor living conditions . Meal prices at expensive, mid-range and inexpensive restaurants were taken into account along with prices of coffee products, alcohol and water. Electricity, heating, water the internet were the utilities assessed. Therefore, the average cost of living for an Australian is almost one per cent cheaper than for someone living in the Big Apple. Venezuela's tightening financial situation has fanned market anxiety about a default, especially as oil slumps to near six-year lows. President Nicholas Maduro has vowed to pay bondholders and most economists doubt a default is coming in the near-term, but investors are getting skittish as the economic crisis worsens. Venezuela depends on oil for 96 per cent of its export revenue. There were not many surprises where it comes to the countries with the lowest cost of living. India topped the pile in this regard, followed in by Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia and Algeria. South America's sole entry in the top 15 cheapest places to live was Colombia, typically another country dependent on the strengths of the oil industry.","US now 24th most costly place to live in the world, up from 28th last year .

The billionaire announced on Saturday he would take on Steven Pinker's 'The Better Angels of Our Nature,' a widely discussed and occasionally criticized 2011 book that contends violence has decreased in modern times and the world has become more humane. He posted the news on his Facebook page and on a community page  for his club, A Year of Books. 'Recent events might make it seem like violence and terrorism are more common than ever, so it's worth understanding that all violence - even terrorism - is actually decreasing over time,' he wrote. 'If we understand how we are achieving this, we can continue our path towards peace. A few people I trust have told me this is the best book they've ever read.'

"After escaping into the world of spiritual healing, an Australian couple made an unambiguous move to leave their comfortable lifestyle to run a retreat in the Amazon Jungle of Peru. It was a life-changing experience for Julian, 30 and Angela Moran, 31, when they discovered an ancient psychedelic plant medicine called ‘ayahuasca’, which is used to heal extensive mental, emotional and physical problems and produces a 'hallucinogenic experience'. Sprawled across 490 hectares of rainforest, the Refugio Altiplano Healing Centre offers tourists a natural paradise and the perfect environment to practice Ayahuasca Shamanism and natural medicine healing within a ceremonial setting. Leaving behind their normal working jobs in engineering and mining, the Perth couple work full time at the centre in the north-eastern city of Iquitos, which is only reachable via a 40-kilometre boat ride. Scroll down for video . Julian and Angela Moran left their comfortable lifestyle in Perth to run a retreat in the Amazon Jungle of Peru . Walking away from the life of comfort, there are limited facilities, a petrol generator used for power for about five hours per night, reception drops in and out and no hot water. But the pair felt obligated to inject ‘money, energy and love’ into the popular tourism industry after the previous owner passed away. ‘We felt so fortunate to have had the gift of transformation that we couldn’t bear to think of ‘The Refugio’ being shut down and denying others the same opportunity,’ Mr Moran told Daily Mail Australia. 'As we are from the mining and resources sector we are passionate about helping those from our industry [among others] who are under extensive pressure from work and the related high stress. 'We were living in Perth for over 20 years but we feel strongly about this line of work and saw the positive results in ourselves and others and felt that we could provide the safety, comfort and support to those wishing this experience for themselves.' The hallucinogenic tea is being prepared by a shaman for guests during a traditional ceremony at the retreat . The centre provides healthy, balanced meals, accommodation in jungle-styled two storey houses . The identification of stress and its source, as well as the tools to deal with it, may become accessible during the ayahuasca experience . The mind-expanding tea contains a compound called DMT, which is illegal in most countries, causing controversy and concerns around the globe after reports of several-related deaths. It comes after British teenager Henry Miller was found dead after taking the  drug in a tribal ritual in Columbia and his body was dumped on a lonely dirt road last year. But Mr Moran ensures the centre’s professional supervision, authenticity and highly qualified staff offering a safe environment distinguishes it from the deceitful operators. 'The class of ‘drugs’ that ayahuasca belongs to is known as ‘psychedelics’. But what most people don’t understand is that they are non-addictive and non-toxic,’ Mr Moran said. ‘Our services provide you with a qualified shaman of high integrity, the medicine is authentic and absent of additives so you are safe, controlled and supervised environment – you are not at risk. ‘The fatalities have occurred when one or more of the above has been compromised.’ Leaving behind their comfortable jobs in engineering and mining, Julian and Angela wanted to pursue a career help those who are suffering from extensive mental and emotional and physical problems . Given the potential for ‘burn out’ in highly pressurised work environments, ayahuasca may assist an individual in the avoidance of problematic thinking and overloading . ‘The medicine’ is known for its ability to heal extensive mental and emotional, and physical problems . Mr Moran said there is a sewage system for their flushable toilets - which is one of the luxuries out there . Mr Moran said it creates a hallucinogenic state that is 'like being awake inside a dream'. 'The chemical responsible for this experience is DMT. It is involved in birth, sleep (dreaming) and death, which is why it is unnecessarily controversial,' Mr Moran explains. 'DMT is produced by the human brain and used by it daily - For it to be illegal, is illogical. 'I believe there is a very close relationship between dreaming and the state that is created by the ingestion of ayahuasca.' As hundreds of tourists from around the world travel to the Peruvian jungle to seek for ‘healing and introspection’, the drug has also helped people with certain types of ailments. It was originally Mr Moran’s background in Anthropology that first interested him in medicinal plants, but this was compounded when he experienced significant relief from depression, bi-polar disorder and alcoholism through the pursuit of natural remedies. ‘The brew is currently being rediscovered by Western medicine, with extensive anecdotal evidence suggesting its application to conditions such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, alcoholism and addiction, physical illness and mental and emotional problems,’ he explains. ‘I have seen excellent results in people suffering from depression, PTSD, anxiety and other mental illness. It is also effective in physical ailments, such as IBS, digestive issues, skin conditions etc. ‘We have also seen great results with eating disorders - both obesity and anorexia.’ The Refugio Altiplano Healing Centre is a natural paradise for healing and introspection. The course of accommodation ranges from three nights and two ceremonies, 12 days and seven ceremonies to even a month long. It costs USD$160 per night to stay with us, or USD$1500 for a 12 Day Retreat or $100 per night if people want to stay long term (30 night minimum). The centre provides healthy, balanced meals, accommodation in jungle-styled two storey houses and can accommodate up to four people. Hundreds of tourists from around the world travel to the Peruvian jungle to seek for ‘healing and introspection' Moran describes the feeling after consuming the medicine, saying: 'Think of it as being awake inside a dream' The mind-expanding tea contains a compound called DMT, which is illegal in most countries . Mr Moran said ayahuasca shamanism refers to the use of ayahuasca to attain a modified state of consciousness, during which participants are able to process trauma and repressed memories. Given the potential for ‘burn out’ in highly pressurised work environments, ayahuasca may assist an individual in the avoidance of problematic thinking and overloading. ‘Our guests often include people who want to break their reliance on pharmaceutical drugs. They are sick of dealing with the symptoms, and want to address the root-cause of their problem,' his wife Angela said. Before the ceremony, the user will usually fast for more than five hours prior to consuming the medicine and there are negative side effects that may strike during the experience. ‘The ayahuasca vine is a purgative. It is a necessary component of the medicine, as it allows for the cleansing of the body,' Mr Moran said. 'Physical 'purges' include vomiting and diarrhoea, while the emotional purges include yawning, crying, shaking, sweating. In all cases, it allows your body to expel toxins, and energy, that you do not need. ‘It is not uncommon for people to feel as though a weight has been lifted following a powerful purge. ‘In the West, vomiting is reflective of being 'sick'. Here, [in relation to ayahuasca] it is referred to as 'getting well'.’ Guests pay $US1500 for a 12-day retreat, which includes seven ceremonies and accommodation . The retreat includes seven ceremonies with ‘strict processes governing the pouring of medicine, the blessings and protection of the room’ The pair felt obligated to inject ‘money, energy and love’ into the popular tourism industry after the previous owner passed away . Once the tea is consumed after being made by brewing two Amazonian plants in water on high heat for many hours, guests may experience a range of affects where they enter an 'altered state of consciousness'. ‘They may experience the presence of something or someone or 'other worldly' and may also experience their 'higher self',’ he said. ‘The ayahuasca experience has been described as being like having “the best doctor, the best psychologist and the best Priest at your beck and call”,’ Mr Moran said. ‘Now, the ayahuasca experience lasts 6-10 hours. Compared to costs of conventional therapy via psychologists or psychotherapists, not including medication, these costs are small. 'While we have a small percentage of repeat guests, the vast majority use the medicine in a ceremonial setting with us over the course of a number of days, and return to their lives happier and healthier and more in control of their lives.' The centre is located in the north-eastern city of Iquitos, which is only accessible via a 40 kilometre boat ride .

While Peru is a long way from home, Julian and Angela encourage Australians to take control of their lives and make the journey for themselves. 'This is an ancient practice and allows people to connect with themselves on a level that is not available in ordinary, waking consciousness,' Mr Moran said. 'I would encourage people to research why substances within this class of 'drugs' are illegal, before discounting them as valid avenues of exploration in the search for a healthier life. 'This medicine provides healing, insight, direction and purpose.'

"These never-before-seen images show how the childhood friends of African American photographer Gordon Parks ended up 20 years after being school in segregated Kansas. Parks, then 38, took the images after being assigned by Life magazine to find his classmates, with whom he was educated in Fort Scott, Kansas. He found that almost everybody had moved out of town. One poignant image from Fort Scott shows a young black couple outside a movie theater they couldn't enter due to segregation laws. Scroll down for video . Unveiled: The old Gordon Parks photographs were commissioned in 1950 and saw the photographer return to his hometown of Fort Scott, Kansas. Above, a black couple are seen outside a segregated movie theater they could not go inside . Homely: The pictures are being exhibited in Boston. According to the exhibit's curator, Karen Haas, the images are remarkable in showing black families in proud, domestic situations - often in front of their houses, such as this one in Chicago . Karen Haas, the Lane Curator of Photographs at MFA Boston, who is curating the images in a new exhibition, explained that showing African American subjects in a normal, dignified situation was revolutionary. She told Slate: 'This was a time when it would have been difficult for an African-American citizen walking down the street to look a white person directly in the eye on the sidewalk. Here, they’re being invited to look into the camera. I find their gazes incredibly stirring because they’re so strong.' The finished feature, which was set to appear in a 1950 issue of life, then a 1951 edition, but was ultimately left on the shelf for reasons which remain unclear. Half Past Autumn: The Life and Works of Gordon Parks . Casual: The images show families of Parks's classmates in relaxed positions, such as this couple posing with a child in Columbus, Ohio . Respectable: According to Haas, the images would have been a surprise for many of Life's mostly-white readership, were they published. Above, a husband and wife walk through Detroit on a Sunday morning . Real life: The images, which were slated for 1950 then 1951 publication but ultimately shelved, differ from contemporary depictions of African Americans.

"Shaking in his orange jumpsuit, a nine-year-old boy wept as he was accused of accidentally shooting a girl in his . third-grade class. Amina Kocer-Bowman, eight, was fighting for her life after being shot when a gun brought to a Washington school inside her classmate's backpack discharged. The girl was in a critical condition in hospital tonight after having surgery on a bullet wound in her stomach, authorities said. The third-grade boy has been arrested and is facing charges of suspicion of unlawful . possession of a gun, bringing a dangerous weapon to school and . third-degree assault. Scroll down for video . Consequences: The boy appeared in court, supported by his uncle and father, facing charges of shooting a classmate with a handgun he had brought in his backpack . The boy is being held at Kitsap County juvenile detention centre after his bail was set at $50,000 during the preliminary hearing yesterday. As court officers led the boy away after the hearing, his father hugged him and gave him a kiss while they both cried. The boy's father, Jason Cochran, said outside the courthouse: 'I just want everyone to know that my kid made a mistake. It was a terrible mistake. If the bail is met, the boy would be released to his uncle and placed under house arrest. The uncle, Patrick Cochran, is the boy's legal guardian and also sat by his nephew's side in the courthouse. 'He's a good kid. It's all I can say,' said Patrick Cochran. 'I apologize to the family of that girl. I really do.' He added: 'I just want him back home.' A capacity hearing will be held in two . weeks to determine if the charges will ultimately proceed. Under state . law, children between eight and 12 years old can face charges if a court . determines the child has the capacity to understand an act is wrong. Detectives believe the incident at . Armin Jahr Elementary in Bremerton, near Seattle, was accidental. Victim: Amina Kocer-Bowman was accidentally shot in the abdomen when the gun that was inside another student's backpack went off and hit her . Critical: Amina's mother was already on her way to pick her daughter up from school when she learned of the shooting, and shortly after that the 8-year-old girl was airlifted to a Seattle Hospital where she had surgery . Authorities say the boy brought a .45-caliber handgun he found at his mother's house to the elementary school in Bremerton on Wednesday, and the weapon discharged from inside his backpack just before classes let out, critically injuring Amina Kocer-Bowman in the abdomen and arm. Court documents stated that the boy told a classmate five days ago that he was going to bring his 'dad's gun' to school and run away. The gun discharged after the boy slammed his backpack down on a desk, it was reported. Officials said both the child's mother and father have criminal records. 'I just want everyone to know that my kid made a mistake. It was a terrible mistake.' Jason Cochran, father . Police Lt. Peter Fisher would not discuss whether authorities were investigating any adults in connection with the shooting. Court documents show Jamie Lee Chaffin, who is listed as the boy's mother, sued his father for failing to pay child support. In 2005, Ms Chaffin was arrested for possession of meth in Bremerton but pleaded guilty to a drug paraphernalia charge. She also was convicted of marijuana deliver and forgery. Patrick Cochran said the boy's grandmother adopted him but she died a year ago and he became the child's legal guardian. He said he lives with the boy's father and the boy's two sisters. KING-TV reported that her friends and relatives gave a 'thumbs up' signal to reporters as they left the Harborview Medical Center last night. Dr Eileen Bulger said the girl will likely be in hospital for several weeks and face further surgeries. She was sedated and on a ventilator but has woken up and interacted with her parents.

Distress: Kiomi Pavlock (left) and another pupil (right) weep outside school as they collected by their parents . Distraught: Savannah Anderson, 13, hugs her little sister Kaylee, 10, after arriving in the school's gymnasium to take her home after the shooting . Her father, John Bowman, thanked his . daughter's teacher. He said: 'Had she not administered first aid and . stopped the bleeding from the gunshot wound, this event would have . surely been tragic.' Lori Morsette, a friend of the . victim's family, said: 'She is a sweet little girl and I don't know what . to do. I'm trying to be supportive for my friends, I'm trying to be . there for them.' The school is in a quiet residential neighborhood about 20 miles west of Seattle, across Puget Sound. Officers and emergency crews were dispatched to the school around 1.30pm yesterday in response to a call that a student was shot by another pupil. The school went into lockdown immediately after the shooting, said Bremerton Schools spokeswoman Patty Glaser. Such procedures call for announcements to be made over the school's loudspeakers and for teachers to lock their classrooms, she said. Parents picked up their children later in the afternoon. Probe: The third-grade boy who allegedly brought the gun into school is being held at a juvenile detention centre on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm and third-degree assault . Worried: A police officer offers reassurances to a pupil as the investigation into the shooting continues . Emergency: A police officer stands watch by the entrance to Armin Jahr Elementary School in Washington, where eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman was shot when a gun discharged inside a boy's backpack . Armin Jahr Elementary has about 400 students The school has reopened and three counsellors were available to talk to teachers, students and parents. In the latest scorecard by the Brady Campaign, a national gun control advocacy group, Washington scored no points in the child safety category because the state does not require trigger locks for guns and lacks laws to prevent child access to firearms. 'Washington state is a loosely regulated state when it comes to firearms,' said Gregory Roberts, executive director of Washington Cease Fire, a Brady Campaign affiliate. Amanda Roth, a staff attorney for the San Francisco-based Legal Community Against Violence, said 27 states and the District of Columbia have some form of firearm child access prevention laws. Such laws can include requirements to use gun locks and criminal penalties for adults who allow children to get their hands on guns.","Mother and father both have criminal records .

"The Lib Dems would be happy to join a coalition with the Tories or Labour after the election, Nick Clegg said yesterday, dismissing predictions that more than half his MPs would lose their seats. The Lib Dem leader said he would add heart to the Tories or backbone to Labour, during a TV interview. Defying bleak opinion polls, he denied his party would be trounced at the election on May 7. But a forecast yesterday by influential pundit Iain Dale – who correctly predicted EU election results – suggests the party would keep just 24 of 56 seats. Scroll down for video . Denial: Nick Clegg dismissed predictions that more than half his MPs would lose their seats, and said he would be happy to govern in coalition with either Labour or Tories . Mr Dale expects Labour to be the largest party with 302 seats, ahead of the Tories with just 279 MPs after a loss of 28 seats. This would mean Labour, even in coalition with the Lib Dems, would have a majority of just one in the 650-seat Commons, paving the way for a ‘rainbow coalition’ with a third party such as the Scottish Nationalists, who are predicted to take 12 Labour and Lib Dem seats in Scotland and keep the six they have. As a result, the Lib Dems could hold the balance of power even if they do badly in May. The party has suffered a number of setbacks, including a backlash after reneging on its pledge to block any increase in university fees, which tripled to £9,000. Mr Clegg claimed yesterday he should have described the rise as a graduate tax to make it clear that students do not pay up front but repay it after they get a job. Either way: Nick Clegg said he would add heart to the Tories or backbone to Labour in a coalition . Pondering: The Deputy Prime Minister took a few moments to reflect ahead of his appearance . A study of every constituency in the country by political commentator Iain Dale reveals no two parties will be able to get over 325 seats to secure an overall majority . He added: ‘What we’ve actually introduced is a graduate tax and I wish we’d called it a graduate tax. I suspect it would have saved us a lot of heartache.’ The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed the idea that his party would not do well in the election, claiming the Lib Dem message that they would ‘cut less than the Conservatives, borrow less than Labour’ appealed to voters. Yesterday he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I’m not going to pretend that I’m going to be Prime Minister. 'I wish I might become Prime Minister, but I think it’s most likely that Liberal Democrats back in government mean either a coalition with Labour or a coalition with the Conservatives. 'We would add, as we have done for five years, heart to a Conservative-led coalition and sort of spine and backbone on the economy which clearly the Labour Party lacks.’ Asked which he would prefer, he said: ‘It’s not about my personal preferences or whims. 'I feel as passionately I disagree as much Ed Miliband’s flaky approach to the economy as I do with the Conservatives’ heartless approach to society. ‘I think we will do so much better than the pundits are predicting. 'Iain Dale will have to eat his words – some of his predictions are getting a bit silly.’ In a sign of confidence that his party will be in coalition again, he said he would find it ‘difficult to imagine’ governing alongside Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former First Minister who is likely to win a seat for the SNP. He also said he would not sit in a cabinet with Ukip – predicted to win five seats.","Liberal Democrats would 'add heart to Tories or backbone to Labour'

Fears of similar carnage in the UK intensified on Thursday after commandos in Belgium killed Islamic State fanatics who wanted to behead a policeman or a judge. The plot held chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013. The guidance to Met officers was reported by The Sunday Times, which also claimed that an additional 800 counter-terrorism police could be deployed on Britain's streets. In addition, the newspaper said Scotland Yard was in talks with the Home Office about extra funding to fight the increased threat to Britain. The Met would not comment on whether police had been told to remove their names from the electoral register when contacted by MailOnline tonight. However, a spokesman said earlier today: ‘We do not discuss the details of our security response. 'But actions taken already include security advice to officers and staff; measures around police buildings; changing risk assessments that affect how we deploy to certain incidents; (and) bolstering levels of specialist support, including firearms officers. ‘The MPS has not decided to implement a blanket response regarding levels of crewing and patrolling in response to concerns about the risk of an attack on officers.’ Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, who says there is a heightened concern about the safety of the Jewish community in the UK . He added: ‘Senior officers across London have reviewed and will continue to review procedures as part of our established risk assessment process. ‘This will also take into account the risks to public safety, to ensure that any changes to our approach to patrolling, or responding to calls, recognises the potential risks to all communities.’ Last week, in other developments: . Mark Rowley, the UK’s senior counter-terrorism officer, said: ‘The global picture of terrorist activity does give us heightened concern about the risk to the Jewish community.’ The Met assistant commissioner said the murders at a kosher supermarket in Paris, coupled with a rise in anti-semitic rhetoric from extremists, justified more patrols in areas with large Jewish populations, including London, Leeds and Manchester. There was a visible increase in security for the Duchess of Cambridge while on a visit to an event in north London last week, with bodyguards standing close to her at all times . Some 263,000 people in Britain describe themselves as Jewish. The country’s 70 Jewish schools have been put on high alert. The Community Security Trust, which advises Jewish institutions and groups on safety, said: ‘We spend an inordinate amount of money on security, particularly on our schools – as we should. 'Obviously there’s a change in the threat level because there could be people who might be perversely inspired by what they saw happen [in Paris].’ Mr Rowley added: ‘We are also considering what further measures we might put in place to enhance the security of police officers, given some of the deliberate targeting of the police we have seen in a number of countries across Europe and the world.’ He said the authorities were also looking at the safety of other minority communities. Speaking after talks with President Obama at the White House, Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s very important to learn the lessons from anything happening elsewhere in Europe. ‘Could that happen here? What steps should be taken? So the police have announced today that they’ll be stepping up patrols, particularly to protect the Jewish community. ‘We have to be incredibly vigilant and look at all of these risks, particularly risks to police officers themselves and take every action that we can.’ The Prime Minister used the talks to press for tougher action to require internet firms to join the fight against terror by alerting authorities to suspicious exchanges online. An official report last year concluded that Facebook failed to pass on information that could have prevented the murder of Fusilier Rigby and the site was a ‘safe haven for terrorists’. The increased security in Britain comes after the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris last week, after gunman Amedy Coulibaly took more than a dozen people hostage . Investigators across Europe are working around the clock to target returning Islamic State fighters. The UK security services believe around 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the so-called jihad, with around half now back home. Counter-terror chiefs fear they may carry out ‘lone wolf’ attacks. Professor Michael Clarke, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think-tank, said the chance of marauding attacks by armed gunmen was ‘likely to increase’. Last year 3,934 potential extremists were referred to a Government deradicalisation programme and 777 were assessed as such a danger that they needed to take part.","Security is dramatically stepped up for police and Jewish community .

"The watchdog which branded the first privately run NHS hospital as 'inadequate' ignored a large survey showing patients were very happy with the care they received. A damning report by the Care Quality Commission last week gave Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire the lowest ever score for standards of care. The report was particularly scathing of Hinchingbrooke's A&E unit, with inspectors saying that 16 out of the 17 patients they had spoken to were unhappy with their treatment. Scroll down for video . Hinchingbrooke Hospital is in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, and serves 160,000 patients . But new evidence has emerged showing the watchdog ignored its own much larger survey of nearly 300 patients carried out eight months earlier and published only last month. This found patients gave it an average score of 8.4 out of ten, rising to nine out of ten for the respect and dignity patients were treated with. The CQC report and financial pressures led to Circle, the firm running hospital, resigning its contract – to the dismay of patients and staff who fear it may now close, or lose vital departments. But an investigation by the Daily Mail this weekend raised suspicions that the report had been 'stitched-up' by senior Labour and union figures implacably opposed to privatisation. They included one of the CQC inspectors who is linked to the pressure group Keep Our NHS Public, and another a former member of the doctors' trade union. In addition, a paediatrician believed to have heavily influenced the report is the local Labour parliamentary candidate. The glowing patients' survey was carried out by the CQC just eight months prior to the inspection as part of a national poll involving nearly 40,000 patients from 140 hospitals in England. A damning report by the CQC last week gave Hinchingbrooke Hospital the lowest ever score for standards of care, but it ignored a larger survey showing patients were very happy with the level of care . There are now growing calls for an independent inquiry into the CQC's inspection over suspicions that it was unfairly critical. They are being led by Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman, who has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging him to carry out a review into the watchdog's behaviour. And since publishing our investigation on Saturday, scores of patients have been in touch with the Mail, relating their own experiences of first-class care at the hospital. They include one who wrote on our website: 'My father had a knee replacement surgery at this hospital in November and the place is immaculate, his care could not have been better. Honestly, I am stunned that the place is in trouble.' Another said: 'Had to go to Hinchingbrooke on a couple of occasions and I must say I found the hospital to be one of the best I have been to.' The hospital, just outside Huntingdon, serves 160,000 patients. Under NHS management, it had been run by the private healthcare firm Circle since 2012. One of its key principles was to give more power to doctors and nurses, rather than middle managers, because they know what patients need. Healthcare assistants pictured working on the stroke ward at Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Huntingdon in 2011 . Since Circle took over, the hospital's waiting times for A&E and treatment have been among the best in the country and patient reviews have been excellent. The CQC's initial survey of 293 patients treated at Hinchingbrooke's A&E – undertaken by post between January and March last year – gave it an average score of 8.4 out of ten. This rose to 9.1 for being treated with privacy and 8.7 for whether doctors and nurses properly listened. Yet when the CQC visited the hospital in September, they claimed patients did not feel 'supported' or 'well-cared for'. Inspectors said they received 'feedback cards' from 17 patients of which 16 contained 'negative comments' and 12 who said they had not been treated with respect. This led the CQC to conclude the A&E unit 'requires improvement', while the hospital as a whole was branded 'inadequate' and given the lowest ever rating for patient care. Mr Campbell Bannerman said: 'I'm really astonished by this report and find it very suspicious. It doesn't stand up. 'The patient feedback has been fantastic, Circle have really turned it around.' A larger survey found that patients gave the hospital an average score of 8.4 out of ten, rising to nine out of ten for the respect and dignity patients were treated with by hospital staff (pictured) More than 3,000 people have 'liked' a Facebook page set up to show backing for nurses, doctors and other staff at Hinchingbrooke. And last week dozens of passionate supporters held up 'We love Hinchingbrooke' signs at a public meeting held to discuss the hospital's future. Meanwhile a group of more than 40 doctors have written an open letter to the BMJ journal pointing out that Hinchingbrooke's very promising statistics do not tally with its 'inadequate' rating. These include figures showing that 97 per cent of patients would recommend the hospital to friends and family – one of the best scores in the country. Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said: 'We stand fully behind our assessment that safety, caring and leadership at Hinchingbrooke hospital were inadequate. There is no reason to question the integrity of any member of the inspection team. 'Our findings highlight the significant failings at Hinchingbrooke. They are not a judgment on the role of the private sector in the NHS or on franchise arrangements. Our priority is the care that patients receive. Where hospitals are failing to promote good care, we will say so regardless of who owns and runs them.'","Report gave Hinchingbrooke Hospital lowest ever score for care standards .

But investigation raised suspicions report was 'stitched up' by senior Labour and union figures strongly opposed to privatisation .
A spokesman for Circle, the private company which has been running services at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, explained in full his company’s reasons for terminating its involvement:  ‘Since the contract was put out to procurement in 2009, the playing field has changed. First, like most hospitals, over the past year we have seen unprecedented A&E attendances at times up to 30% higher, year-on-year - and not enough care places for healthy patients who await discharge.Second, at the same time, our funding has been cut by approximately 10.1% this year. With these pressures on the system, to maintain the standards our patients deserve requires significant further investment, on top of the £4.84 million and considerable resources Circle have invested in the hospital to date.We believe that solving the problems facing Hinchingbrooke can only be achieved through joined-up reform in Cambridgeshire across hospitals, GPs and community services. We fully support the vision of Simon Stevens (NHS England Chief Executive) 5-year Forward View, but these potentially exciting reforms are too far into the future.Finally, we were one of the first hospitals to be inspected under the CQC's new process. We understand their report will be published soon, and fully expect it to be unbalanced and to disagree with many of its conclusions. We are not the only hospital to find their process problematic, and believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenges for acute hospitals in the current environment.The combination of these factors means we have now reluctantly concluded that in its existing form, Circle's involvement in Hinchingbrooke is unsustainable.’"
"Smart phones are so much more than making calls or taking the odd picture. But if you are one of those who use your mobile to send emails, watch TV and read the news-paper online every day, you’ll find that the battery can run down perilously quickly.

This functional-looking black charger is around the size of a smart phone and has enough battery for about two-and-a-half times the charge of an iPhone. TEST: It’s idiot proof — it is obvious how to use it and I can see how much power it has left via a row of four lights. Not only did it charge my phone, but it also boosted the charge over the next four days. TONY SAYS: A solar-powered phone is environmentally friendly, but most of these don’t come with the right phone lead, so you’ll need one. 10/10 . LET THERE BE LIGHT . Audio powerbank, £20 . Audio powerbank, £20, tesco.com . USP: This is both a torch and a charger. Slightly bigger than a lipstick, this will charge an iPhone one-and-a-half times before you need to recharge it — but it does suit many electrical devices including Samsung and Blackberry. Charge it up by plugging it into a laptop or USB port with the lead provided. Check you have your own lead to charge from charger to phone. TEST: During last winter’s storms where I live in the West Country, I found myself in the pitch black with no phone battery.

USP: A sexy, slender credit card-sized charger with enough charge for to get an iPhone to half power. It’s compatible with the iPhone 5. TEST: By far the coolest looking charger, it is put through its paces in rural Dorset where one of my sons is playing hockey. I forget to charge my phone and by the time I reach the match it is almost dead. When I plug this in using the tiny attached lead, a slim white light flashes on the front. I delightedly watch my phone takes on just enough juice to get me through the afternoon. TONY SAYS: Excellent, but only as a back-up. 8/10 . LOTS OF TALK TIME . Innergie Pocket Cell, £69.99 .

TEST: Plug this into your phone using a lead. It charges all USB powered devices — phones, mp3 players and tablets — adding four-and-a-half hours to an iPad. I use it on a day in London without a charged phone. It is dark and freezing cold, but I plug this in and within a couple of minutes I am connected.

"Wolfing down an entire box of chocolates is enough to make anyone feel a little full. But for Booster the dog, who was rushed to the vet after eating a tin of Quality Street with the wrappers still on, the binge was just the start of his discomfort. For once taking a peek at the Alaskan Malamute's stomach, vets were shocked to discover the animal had also eaten five rubber toys. Booster the Alaskan Malamute was rushed to the vet by owner Guy Kelly after eating an entire tin of Quality Street. There, X-rays revealed he had in fact also swallowed five rubber balls (pictured above) X-rays showing five toys in Booster's stomach. The dog has since had an operation to have them removed . It came after his owners Jackie and Guy Kelly from Plymouth, Devon, found the dog severely bloated and writhing in pain after eating the chocolates that had been left over from Christmas. 'We came downstairs one morning and he was the size of a cow,' said Mr Kelly, a builder. 'He was really bloated and didn't look well - we could see he had eaten a 750g tin of Quality Street so we took him to the vets.' After spending two days in vets' care, Booster was sent home but still seemed to be in pain. When Mr Kelly returned to weeks later, an X-ray revealed the pet had swallowed five rubber balls that were lodged in his stomach. 'He takes them off other dogs in the park and tends to chew them up, so we try to keep him away from balls,' Mr Kelly, 55, said. 'But we never thought he would eat one, let alone five.' Mr Kelly said in the past he had tried to keep Booster away from rubber balls as he had a tendency to chew them up . The dog owner knew something was wrong with his pet after finding him writhing in pain and bloated 'to the size of a cow' one morning after Christmas . Adam Coulson, of Plymouth Veterinary Hospital where Booster was treated, said the dog's pain came after gases from the chocolates stopped his blood flow. 'His immediate problem was that all of the gas blowing up his stomach was preventing blood from flowing back to his heart, and so his circulation was failing.' It was only weeks later Mr Coulson discovered the toys lurking in his stomach. 'X-rays showed some very strange shadows in his abdomen and exploratory surgery yielded two balls and three toys from his now slightly sagging stomach. 'However, not a Quality Street in sight. 'Booster has recovered from his surgery with further care at the hospital and on examination this week has returned to his old, noisy and slightly cantankerous self. 'We still don't know where the toys came from and how long they had been inside his stomach. 'They only seemed to cause him a problem after his chocolate eating antics. We are hoping for no repeat performances and are very glad that Mr Kelly had him insured for all of his life saving treatment.'","Booster the Alaskan Malamute ate an entire tin of Quality Street chocolates .

"A 26-year-old master's degree student working as a trainee social worker at a school for troubled teens in Chicago was charged Saturday with having sex with a student. Brandi Edwards admitted in court that she had a sexual relationship with the 16-year-old sophomore at RISE  Alternative High School starting in November. The relationship began when Edwards wrote her phone number on the boy's journal, reports the Chicago Tribune. Brandi Edwards has admitted to having sex with a 16-year-old student at the Chicago high school where she was interning as a trainee social worker while working on her master's degree . Soon after, in November, Edwards allegedly picked the boy up and had sex with him in her car outside his home. Before the meeting, prosecutors say the two exchanged sexual text messages. Edwards and the boy had sex a second time in her car and then a third time at a forest preserve, prosecutors said Saturday. They had sex a final time at a hotel room, say investigators. At this weekend's court hearing, Cook County Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr. was none too pleased with the admitted sex offender. 'Some days, I'm baffled,' he said. Judge Bourgeois ordered Edwards to wear an ankle monitoring bracelet and to stay in her Homer Glen home. 'You better not set foot outside that house,' the judge said. Edwards was also ordered not to have any contact with the boy via social media. Edwards was charged Saturday with sexual assault of a minor.

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter is staying away from the United States because he doesn’t want to be questioned by the FBI about World Cup bid corruption, according to a high-ranking football insider. The astonishing claim comes as America’s national crime investigators are making their own inquiries about the murky process around the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively. Globetrotter Blatter has only set foot in the USA once since those controversial World Cup votes in Zurich in December 2010, despite America becoming a rapidly growing marketplace for football in the intervening years. Sepp Blatter has been accused of staying away from the United States to avoid FBI questioning . Blatter’s last brief visit was for the CONCACAF Congress in Miami in May 2011. Before that there was a four-day trip in July 2009, when he watched the Gold Cup final between the USA and Mexico in New York and had an audience with President Obama at the White House. The FIFA delegation that accompanied Blatter to meet Obama included then CONCACAF president Jack Warner, since exposed as the biggest rogue on the FIFA ExCo. Warner has now resigned all his football positions. The FBI’s own World Cup probe has involved warning Phaedra Al-Majid, the American former press officer for the Qatar 2022 bid, that she is in danger. Al-Majid, who alleges Qatar’s bid was corrupt, has been offered protection. Former press officer for Qatar 2022 bid Phaedra Al-Majid has been warned she is in danger . Federal agents turned discredited FIFA ExCo member Chuck Blazer, faced with a bill for millions of dollars in unpaid tax, to act as an informant. Blazer reportedly used a key-fob bugging device to record meetings with colleagues at the London 2012 Olympics. FIFA would not comment about Blatter allegedly wanting to avoid the FBI but said he tended to only visit countries for specific tournaments or football-related activities. There is understood to be angst inside Liverpool at how diligently their crocked star striker Daniel Sturridge goes about the daily grind of rehab exercises. The belief is that Sturridge didn’t give himself the best chance of avoiding another injury — such as the thigh strain he has suffered — when he returned to training six weeks after damaging the same thigh on England duty. Daniel Sturridge has not featured since getting injured during England training in September . FIFA president Sepp Blatter, in his letter to FA chairman Greg Dyke, cites Swiss law to explain why Zurich-based FIFA would not be able to publish Michael Garcia’s report on World Cup bid corruption in full. However Brian Cookson, the British president of cycling’s world body UCI — located in Aigle, Switzerland — intends to be totally transparent over his sport’s independent probe into chronic doping problems, due out in February. Cookson wants everything published apart from witness statements where confidentiality was agreed. Meanwhile, the Olympic reforms to be rubber-stamped in Monaco next month will see Blatter having to step down from the Olympic governing body on reaching 80 in March 2016, when he will be less than a year into a ridiculous fifth term at the FIFA helm. Brian Cookson has promised transparency over sport's probe into cycling's doping problems . North Korea, the most reclusive nation on Earth, are bidding to host a World Weightlifting Championships. This follows the communist state finishing top of the medal table at this month’s event in Kazakhstan. The Koreans’ success has sparked allegations of doping but only one of their weightlifters is banned and out-of-competition testers have been allowed into the country. Peers win touts fight . A cross-party alliance of sporting peers in the House of Lords have shown up the toothless Department for Culture, Media and Sport by defeating the Government over secondary- market ticket touting. Colin Moynihan, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Rachel Heyhoe-Flint secured the amendment in the Consumer Rights Bill, which will demand far greater transparency over online ticket-selling — if it becomes law. Ticket-trading websites will have to show the location of the seat, the identity of the seller and the ticket’s terms and conditions — hopefully in time for the Rugby World Cup next autumn. England Rugby 2015 have been campaigning for this much-needed reform but have been frustrated by a lack of impetus at the DCMS.","FIFA president is staying away from the United States to avoid questioning, according to a high-ranking football insider .

"An NYPD chief who was a first responder at Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attack has died from a rare form of blood cancer believed to be linked to the incident. Steven Bonano, 53, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center surrounded by friends and family, officials said. A 30-year veteran of the force, Bonano was commander of the NYPD's elite Emergency Service Unit at the time of the attack. Steven Bonano, 53, was commander of the NYPD's elite Emergency Service Unit at the time of the attack. He died on Saturday from a rare form of blood cancer linked to inhaling toxic materials . It is believed he may have contracted cancer as a result of inhaling toxic materials while he participated in the rescue and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center site in the weeks following the terrorist attacks. The NYPD declined to say whether his cancer was linked to the site. More than 900 first responders have died of ailments blamed on their service at Ground Zero, officials say. 'He loved the police department, it was his life,' a colleague told the New York Post. 'He was a cop's cop. He was my mentor. He was always looking for us to do better. He always did better for himself. He accomplished so much.' During his time with the NYPD, Bonano was awarded the Police Combat Cross, the department's second highest medal, earned his pilot's license and a Master's degree from Harvard University. Bonano is believed to have contracted cancer as a result of inhaling toxic materials while he participated in the rescue and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center site in the weeks following the terrorist attacks . 'Bonano was a true leader not because of rank but because of the man he was,' said Dennis Gonzalez of the NYPD Hispanic Society, which Bonano was a member of. 'Those who knew him as a police officer knew he was destined for greatness.' In 2012, the Bronx-born cop had become the head of security at the Barclays Center venue in Brooklyn, which hosted a bone-marrow registry in 2013 to help prolong his life. Cancer among 9/11 responders is 15 percent higher than among people not exposed to the Ground Zero toxins, a recent study by Mount Sinai Medical Center's World Trade Center Health Program found. The increase was seen primarily in three types of the disease, including blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. More than 900 first responders have died of ailments blamed on their service at Ground Zero, officials say.","Steven Bonano, 53, was commander of the NYPD's elite Emergency Service Unit at the time of the attack .

"An anti-gay activist has filed a religious discrimination complaint against a bakery that refused to decorate a Bible-shaped cake with words describing homosexuals as 'detestable'. Azucar Bakery in Denver, Colorado, agreed to the order last March but said they would not inscribe the incendiary words. They also refused the elderly man's request for a design featuring two men holding hands with an 'X' over them, followed by the words 'god hates homosexuality'. Refused: Marjorie Silva, owner of Azucar Bakery, refused to create a homophobic cake for a customer . Unperturbed, he suggested, instead, icing on anti-gay scripture and the ghostbusters logo. Their refusal enraged the man, who threatened to involve his attorney. When owner Marjorie Silva explained they could provide the man with icing and a piping bag to design his own decoration, he stormed out and took action. If unresolved, the case could go to trial. The controversy has emerged just days after the Supreme Court agreed to address same-sex marriage in Colorado this term. Silva believes the man may have targeted their firm deliberately after she made pro-gay comments to a Spanish-speaking news agency. Inclusive: She said she could make a Bible-shaped cake but would not ice discriminatory words or images . Targeted? Silva fears their firm may have been targeted by the man after she made pro-gay comments . 'We make [Christian-themed] cakes all the time,' she told Out Front. 'No problem at all.' 'He wanted us to write God hates... just really radical stuff against gays. 'He wouldn’t allow me to make a copy of the message, but it was really hateful. 'I remember the words detestable, disgrace, homosexuality, and sinners. 'I told him that I would bake the cake in the shape of a Bible.' Legal action: The firm now has two months to file a response to avoid a 'religious discrimination' court case . Now, the bakery has received an official complaint letter from the man via the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA). Silva, who is filing a response, said: 'I would like to make it clear that we never refused service. We only refused to write and draw what we felt was discriminatory against gays.

"When Hayley Waddell's 18-month-old daughter Lily refused to wear pink frilly knickers, instead insisting upon Bob The Builder pants, she put it down to her being a bit of a tomboy, simply less girly than her three sisters. But as Lily grew older and continued squirming in dresses, playing only with cars and actually insisting she was a boy - even cutting her blonde hair short at the age of five - Hayley, 48, a hairdresser from Lowestoft, Suffolk, wondered if this was more than just a phase. And when, at the age of nine, Lily said, 'You're not taking me seriously! I don't want to be a girl anymore!', Hayley knew something had to change. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Born a girl and named Lily, Leo Waddell, left, has known he was a boy from the age of five, and his mother Hayley, right, is doing everything she can to support him . Social services stepped in, arriving at their home following complaints Hayley was 'forcing' her child to be a boy since she already had three other girls. But when her son, who changed his name to Leo by deed poll at the age of 11, stood up to them and defended his mother, even they could see the family were all completely serious. Leo is now one of Britain's youngest people with gender dysphoria, a condition whereby you feel have been physically assigned the wrong gender at birth. 'I knew when I was pregnant with Leo that something was different,' Hayley told Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on ITV's This Morning today. 'I've been pregnant with three other girls and this one was completely new. I was so horribly sick all the way through. I was just certain I was having a boy.' But having never heard the word 'transgender', Hayley was at a loss as to how to act, and simply lived day by day, letting Leo be their guide. Social services once visited . the family's home following complaints that Hayley was 'forcing' her child to . be a boy since she already had three other girls. And having lived as a boy since the age of five, Leo, now 12, is about to begin taking hormone blockers to prevent himself developing as a woman. When he is 16 he will begin taking testosterone, and when he is 18 he will have gender reassignment surgery. 'I've just always felt like a boy,' said Leo. 'School was tough. It was normal until year six, but then when I got my name changed they wouldn't call me Leo for about three months, and then when they started calling me Leo they still wouldn't call me ""she"", they carried on calling me ""he"".' Leo and his mother Hayley talking about his life with Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on ITV's This Morning . Speaking about supporting her son, Hayley said: 'Just as it is with all my kids, they are who they are and I do believe in . encouraging that. There was no big decision to make, it was just the way . it flowed, until we actually decided to change his name. 'The school . weren't very happy about it and tried to look for legal reasons why they . couldn't call him ""he"". Eventually, by law, they had to. But that was a . very difficult time for us. 'Especially where we come from there was a lot of ignorance surrounding . it because no one had heard of it - not the doctor, not the schools, not even . social services. Though they were really, rreally good, and went away . and found out what they needed to.' Leo, who grimaces at the thought of taking hormones but laughs when people tell him it's 'just a phase', confesses he would not be able to live if he were made to do so as a girl, saying: 'I would probably kill myself.' A young Leo Waddell, who decided at the age of five that he was a boy, not the girl he was born . Leo, who wants to be a gender specialist when he grows up, now feels strongly about sharing his story, saying: 'I think people need to learn to understand it, so they can accept it if it happens again. And it is happening more' Happily, in 2001, he was referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, and then to Tavistock Clinic in North London, the only one of its kind for under-18s, who referred him to UCL to get the hormone blockers. For the first time, the family felt as though their story had been heard and understood, and Leo says it felt 'amazing' to finally be able to start living his life. For Hayley, it was relief, and 'confirmation that I wasn't doing anything wrong'. She said: 'There was always this doubt. If all these people were saying ""Why are you doing this?"", I'd question: Am I doing something to make him this way?' Leo, who wants to be a gender specialist when he grows up, now feels strongly about sharing his story, saying: 'I think people need to learn to understand it, so they can accept it if it happens again. And it is happening more.'","Leo Waddell, 12, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was born Lily .

Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge showed the philosophical side to his game on Monday as he insists it will only be a matter of time before he returns from his latest injury setback. The England forward only returned to full training recently following a 10-week lay off with a thigh injury, sustained while on international duty in September. And last Monday while training at Melwood, Sturridge ended up suffering a similar injury to the same thigh he injured just two months previously, with the 25-year-old now set for a further six weeks on the sidelines. Daniel Sturridge posted a philosophical, yet positive message about his battle to return to fitness for Liverpool after his latest injury blow .

"Vladimir Putin has formally divorced his wife of 30 years, it has been announced. The couple declared their intention to separate last June, but the recent removal of Lyudmila Putina's name from the Russian president's website 'means the divorce took place', his spokesman said. There has been speculation for a number of years that Putin's marriage was in difficulty, with much made of an apparent secret relationship with 30-year-old former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva. Over: The recent removal of all mention of Lyudmila Putina (right) from the biography page on Vladimir Putin's official website 'means the divorce took place', according to the Russian president's spokesman . The confirmation of the divorce comes after all mentions of Putin's marriage to Lyudmila Putina, 56, were removed from the biography page of his official website. The references were replaced with a simple note saying he has two daughters - Maria and Katerina. Putin's personal spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed to Russian media that the edits were official notice that a divorce had now been formalised. Putina, who was born Lyudmila Shkrebneva, met Putin in the early 1980s while they were both studying at the then Leningrad State University. The couple married on 28 July 1983, with their first daughter, Maria, born in 1985, and their second, Katerina, arriving the following year. Divorce: Putina, who was born Lyudmila Shkrebneva, met Vladimir Putin in the early 1980s while they were both studying at the then Leningrad State University . Low key: While Putin's political career flourished in the 1990s, Putina chose to keep a low profile - initially teaching German at Leningrad State University . The couple spent much of the 1980s in the East German city of Dresden, where Putin worked for the KGB, before moving back to Leningrad in 1990 - the year before the city changed its named to Saint Petersburg. While Putin's political career flourished in the 1990s, Putina chose to keep a low profile - initially teaching German at Leningrad State University. The only public statements she has made have generally been regarding the Russian education system - specifically the preservation of traditional spelling and grammatical rules - and broader comments supporting the policies of her former husband. There has been speculation about the state of the couple's marriage for years following the absence of Putina from almost every public event during Putin's second term as president. Last June the couple formally confirmed rumours of their separation in a staged interview that was broadcast on state television. Rumours: There has been speculation for a number of years that Putin's marriage was in difficulty, with much made of an apparent secret relationship with 30-year-old former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva (pictured) Denials: Despite denying rumours of an imminent marriage to Alina Kabayev as long ago as 2008, speculation over their alleged relationship has persisted . During their appearance, Mr Putin said: 'It was a joint decision: we hardly see each other, each of us has our own life.' Putina added that flying was difficult for her and that her husband was 'completely drowned in work'. The divorce was 'civilised' and the couple would 'always remain close', she went on to say. Despite denying rumours of an imminent marriage to Alina Kabayev as long ago as 2008, speculation over their alleged relationship has persisted. In October last year it was reported that Putin had secretly married Kabayev, prompting the Kremlin to release a statement saying the president's love life was a personal matter and only he could make an announcement on it. In January this year the rumours resurfaced after the former Olympic gymnast was pictured wearing a ring on the fourth finger of her right hand - the finger on which Russian women traditionally wear their wedding rings. Kabayeva was later seen among the final six torchbearers at the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in February.","Russian president and Lyudmila Putina have been married for 30 years .

"Pesticides have been found in fresh salmon sold by leading supermarkets. Farmed salmon from Norway and Scotland is hugely popular as a healthy oily fish. However, the production process involves dousing the fish, reared in cages moored in the sea, in chemicals to kill parasitic lice. They are also given a protein feed, created from small waste fish which can be contaminated with chemicals from the environment – including DDT and its by-products. Fresh salmon sold in five major supermarkets was found to contain trace levels of pesticide DDT . Trace levels of these chemicals were found in fish sold by Waitrose, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Iceland. DDT was banned for use almost 30 years ago because of its risk to human health. A recently published study  suggested a link between DDT, an associated by-product compound called pp-DDE and Alzheimer’s disease in the elderly. Official studies show farmed salmon is more likely to carry traces of chemical pesticides than any other food type. The Pesticides Residues Monitoring Programme, which is overseen by the Health & Safety Executive (HSE), tested farmed salmon and trout sold in the supermarkets. The figures from 2013, which have  just been released through a Freedom of Information Act request, found the pesticides pp-DDE, Dieldrin and Cypermethrin, as well as other chemicals, in fish sold by supermarkets. Dieldrin, a powerful pesticide, was banned in the 1970s. It has been linked to health problems such as Parkinson’s, breast cancer, and immune, reproductive, and nervous system damage. Cypermethrin is a pesticide used on farmed salmon to kill off lice that live on the captive fish. The results revealed two samples of rainbow trout fillets from the UK sold by Morrisons tested positive for Dieldrin, while salmon sold by Iceland also tested positive. Tesco Everyday Value salmon fillets from Norway were found to contain traces of pp-DDE. The production process of salmon involves covering the fish in chemicals to kill parasitic lice. The creatures are also given a protein feed which can be contaminated with chemicals from the environment - including DDT and its by-products . The chemicals accumulate in the fat of the fish. Salmon which is farmed is far fattier than the wild fish and therefore more likely to carry chemical traces. The details were revealed by Don Staniford, Director of the Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture, who is a long standing critic of fish farms. He said: ‘Farmed salmon is the most contaminated food on the supermarket shelf. It should carry a Government health warning. ‘Salmon farmers can decontaminate fish feed – this has been known for decades but the industry has refused to take action.’ Government experts have ruled that the chemical levels are so low as to not pose a risk, say the HSE. The HSE added that it ‘does detect and report occasional residues of substances used to control lice on fish. When used for this purpose these substances are regulated as veterinary medicines.’ The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for food stores, said: ‘The HSE has confirmed the microscopic residues present no issues for consumers. ‘The chemical banned since the 1980s is still present in minute levels in the environment and the survey is to assess the levels present.’","Trace levels found in Waitrose, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Iceland salmon .

"Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has been hospitalized three weeks after he broke seven ribs after he was thrown from a horse while  on safari in Africa over Christmas. Doctors had expected him to recover on his own from the accident, but on Monday he was admitted to the hospital when a test found fluid collecting around his lungs as a result of the weeks-old injury. The 57-year-old Democrat will stay at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center overnight and then is expected to be 'back in action' after two to three days.

He was on a 'once-in-a-lifetime' safari on horseback in Tanzania around Christmas Day when something spooked his horse and it threw him to the ground. 'It's fair to say it's not his favorite choice of activities,' spokesman Brian Coy said of his boss and his ill-fated ride. Coy stressed that McAuliffe has been working since the accident, including delivering his State of the Commonwealth address last week and a visit to Norfolk on Monday. 'He's been going about his job.

"Just because they're floating in microgravity, orbiting 267 miles above Earth, doesn't mean astronauts don't want to look their best.

"A Texas meteorologist who was shot last month outside the Waco area TV station where he works has returned to the air — wearing a Superman T-shirt. Patrick Crawford presented the Monday morning forecast at KCEN. KCEN's on-air and control room staff wore T-shirts Monday bearing the Superman logo on the front and the words 'Crawford Strong' on the back. Scroll down for video . Surprise: Waco, Texas-area TV meteorologist Patrick Crawford ripped open his shirt to reveal a Superman shirt as he appeared behind the desk of KCEN for the first time since he was shot multiple times outside the studio last month . Crawford then opened his button-down shirt to reveal his own Superman T-shirt. 'I timed my comeback very nicely with today's forecast,' he said. 'We've got great weather today. We can expect the warm weather we saw over the weekend to return again today.' Authorities are hunting for the man who shot Crawford three times on December 17 as the meteorologist was starting to drive home from the station. Crawford spent several days in a hospital but was back in fighting form this week. 'It's good to be back. A little difficult waking up early this morning to get back to the station, but I am glad to be back,' he joked. Authorities are still investigating the attack. The Associated Press left a message Monday seeking comment from the Department of Public Safety. No motive had previously been uncovered for the shooting and police are offering $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of the suspect. Thrilled: The anchor desk was all about celebrating Crawford's return on Monday and donned t-shirts to prove it . Crawford strong: Crawford's co-workers surprised him with the shirts, though he soon surprised them right back . Crawford revealed late last month that the attack came out of nowhere. 'There was no interaction,' Crawford said at a press conference while in a wheelchair. 'He just started shooting at me as I was leaving the parking lot. ' Two of the bullets hit Crawford, one on the arm and another in the abdomen. A third bullet grazed his head. The weatherman managed to drive off and stopped his car in a construction zone, where workers called an ambulance. Falls County Crime Stoppers originally offered a reward of $5,000 for information, but an anonymous donor contributed an additional $5,000 and the station added $10,000. A composite sketch of the shooter was released by police , leading to many calls to Texas Rangers and other law enforcement officials but not to an arrest.

"Scientists have developed a new microscope that can image living things in 3D, ten to 100 times faster than existing technologies. The system could be used to capture remarkable details, such as single cells in the zebrafish heart while it is beating, the researchers say. Dubbed 'Scape', the technology can also help unlock the secrets of brain activity by monitoring neurons as they fire in real-time. Scientists have developed a new microscope that can image living things in 3D, ten to 100 times faster than existing technologies.  Dubbed 'Scape', the technology can also help unlock the secrets of brain activity by monitoring neurons as they fire in real-time (pictured) The microscope was developed by Elizabeth Hillman, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), . 'With Scape, we can now image complex, living things, such as neurons firing in the rodent brain…this has not been possible until now,' said Professor Hillman. While conventional light-sheet microscopes use two awkwardly positioned lenses, Professor Hillman realised that she could use a single lens, and then that she could sweep the light sheet to generate 3D images without moving the objective or the sample. 'This combination makes Scape both fast and very simple to use, as well as surprisingly inexpensive,' she said. 'We think it will be transformative in bringing the ability to capture high-speed 3D cellular activity to a wide range of living samples.' Imaging techniques that can capture these dizzying dynamic processes, such as neurons firing in the brain, have lagged behind other breakthroughs. Time can be crucial when diagnosing illness. And with conditions such as cancer, the current method of testing samples of tissue for disease - a biopsy - can be a slow process, with an anxious wait for results. The procedure can cause discomfort and pain. Furthermore, it often has to be repeated, as the sampling is not always accurate. Now, scientists have developed the world's smallest microscope - the size of a pin - which is inserted into the body, allowing doctors to 'see' cancer and make an instant, precise diagnosis, saving the patient from the need for a biopsy. It is already being used for pancreatic cancer, a disease with a poor prognosis as it's often detected late, and scientists are now looking at using it for colon, bladder, oesophageal and lung cancer. The endomicroscope was developed in France and is so powerful it can see individual cells and the blood vessels that run between them. Professor Hillman has already used the system to observe firing in 3D neurons trees in layers of the mouse brain. In small organisms, including zebrafish larvae, Scape can see through the entire organism. By tracking these tiny, unrestrained creatures in 3D at high speeds, the microscope can capture both cellular structure and function and behaviour. 'It wasn't until we built it that we realized it was a light-sheet microscope,' said Professor Hillman. 'It took us a while to realize how versatile the imaging geometry was, how simple and inexpensive the layout was—and just how many problems we had overcome.' Next-generation versions of Scape are in development that will deliver even better speed, resolution, sensitivity, and penetration depth. 'Deciphering the functions of brain and mind demands improved methods for visualizing, monitoring, and manipulating the activity of neural circuits in natural settings,' says Thomas M. Jessell, co-director of the Zuckerman Institute and Claire Tow Professor of Motor Neuron Disorders. 'Hillman's sophistication in optical physics has led her to develop a new imaging technique that permits large-scale detection of neuronal firing in three-dimensional brain tissues. 'This methodological advance offers the potential to unlock the secrets of brain activity in ways barely imaginable a few years ago.'","Dubbed 'Scape', the technology can help unlock the secrets of brain .

The toddler's mother Shelia wasn't at home at the time of the attack and the child was being watched by his grandfather, 51-year-old Gregory Moss. Declin Moss, pictured with his mom Shelia, was playing on the front porch at the home in Brookville, Florida, when for unknown reasons the two 'mixed breed' dogs attacked him as his grandfather looked on . The attack happened at around 11 a.m. When authorities arrived at the home after receiving a call about a boy being bitten by a dog, they found the toddler dead from his injuries. Investigators have described the two animals - named Thumper and Max - as 'mixed breed,' but are awaiting confirmation from a vet to determine their breed types. Neighbors described the dogs as pit bulls. 'It's sad. It's definitely something you don't want to deal with, especially with a young child like that, just 18 months,' Michael Terry, a spokesman for the Hernando County Sheriff's Office, told the Tampa Bay Times. Declin had lived at the home with his mom and grandfather who witnessed the incident and had attempted to save his young grandson. Local police had not previously received complaints regarding the dogs and the family are said to be shocked at the dogs' uncharacteristic aggressiveness . 'Our technicians are out here interviewing the grandfather and trying to get the details from him, but he's obviously pretty shaken up,' said Terry. Local police had not previously received complaints regarding the dogs and Terry said the family were shocked at the two animals' uncharacteristic aggressiveness. Deputies were continuing to investigate at the home at 16251 Cherokee Road on Monday afternoon and Terry said 'it's too early to tell' if charges will be filed. The family own four dogs, the two involved in the terrible incident have been removed by Animal Control.

"A special prosecutor who had accused Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of ordering impunity for Iranian suspects in the South American country's worst terrorist attack was found shot dead in his bathroom, authorities said Monday. Alberto Nisman, who was set to testify Monday in a closed-door hearing, was found in the bathroom of his Buenos Aires apartment late Sunday, federal prosecutor Viviana Fein told Telam, Argentina's official news agency. 'We can confirm that it was a gunshot wound, .22 caliber,' she said, adding that it was too early in the investigation to know what had happened. Police carry the remains of prosecutor Alberto Nisman outside his house in Buenos Aires, Argentina, early on Monday . Federal prosecutor Viviana Fein confirmed that Mr Nisman died of a .22 caliber gunshot wound. Pictured is an Argentine Federal Police forensic unit carrying his body away from his home . Alberto Nisman (left) was found shot hours before he was due to present a case against Argentine President Cristina Fernandez (right), who he accused of protecting Iranian suspects in a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires . Nisman had been appointed 10 years ago by Fernandez's late husband, then President Nestor Kirchner, to investigate the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people and injured more than 200. In 2013, Argentina and Iran reached an agreement to investigate the attack, which remains unsolved. That year, Nisman released an indictment accusing Iran and Hezbollah of organizing the blast. Iran denies any involvement. Last week, Nisman accused Fernandez and other senior Argentine officials of agreeing not to punish at least two former Iranian officials in the case. He asked a judge to call Fernandez and others, including Foreign Minister Hector Timerman, for questioning. 'The president and her foreign minister took the criminal decision to fabricate Iran's innocence to sate Argentina's commercial, political and geopolitical interests,' Nisman said last week. Government officials called the prosecutor's allegations ludicrous. A federal judge had begun the process of deciding whether to hear the complaint and whether anyone should be summoned for questioning. Late Sunday, federal police agents in charge of Nisman's protection alerted their superiors that he wasn't answering phone calls, according to a statement from the Health Ministry. When he also didn't answer the door, they decided to alert family members, according to the statement. When Nisman's mother wasn't able to open the door because a key was in the lock on the other side, a locksmith was called to open it, the ministry said. A .22 caliber handgun and a shell casing were found next to Nisman's body. Israel's foreign ministry expressed 'deep sorrow' over Nisman's death. 'Nisman, a courageous, venerable jurist who fought intrepidly for justice, acted with determination to expose the identities of the terrorists and their dispatchers,' a ministry statement said. Firefighters and rescue workers search through the rubble of the Buenos Aires Jewish Community center in this July 18, 1994, picture, after a car bomb rocked the building, killing 86 people.

"They are two of the most ambitious firms in the hi-tech space - and could combine to put the internet in orbit and accessible to everyone. Google is set to invest in Elon Musk's plan to launch a constellation of satellites in space. The firm is already developing its own hi-altitude balloons to deliver access to remote areas. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk, (pictured) says he wants to build a second internet in space, which could one day be used to enable people living on Mars to get online . Mark Zuckerburg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. Small satellite manufacturers: Sierra Nevada and Britain's Surrey Satellite Technology are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record. According to The Information the deal would help SpaceX develop satellites that could beam low-cost Internet around the globe to billions who don’t have it. 'The price and terms Google and SpaceX are discussing couldn’t be learned although one person familiar with them said Google has agreed to value SpaceX north of $10 billion and that the size of the total round, which includes other investors, is very large,' the site said. Google was believed to be  planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online. Google is tipped to spend $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones. Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below. The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions. In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity. The news comes days after SpaceX founder Elon Musk said he has set his sights on bringing it to space too. The entrepreneur says he wants to build a second internet in space, which could one day be used to enable any people living in colonies on Mars to get online. There is currently no name for the ambitious space venture, but it could speed up internet services on Earth too. Mr Musk told Bloomberg Businessweek's Ashlee Vance, that his aim is to create 'a global communications system that would be larger than anything that has been talked about to date.' Earlier this month, he said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on Mars, later this year. He said: 'It will be important for Mars to have a global communications network as well. I think this needs to be done, and I don't see anyone else doing it.' Mr Musk's project would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles (1,207km) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles (35,406 km). A stock image is shown . The project could cost $10 billion (£7 billion) and $15 billion (£10 billion), Mr Musk revealed in a Tweet, adding that any revenues would be used to fund a colony on the red planet. It would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles (1,207km) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles (35,406 km). At the moment, internet data packets travelling from London to New York, for example, have to pass through numerous routers and different networks, whereas Mr Musk plans to route packs via space satellites instead. This would make services faster and potentially cheaper too. The project will be run from SpaceX's Seattle office, whose employees will also work on the firm's Falcon rockets, for example. The ultimate goal is provide high-speed internet to the three billion people who have poor or no access to the web. It's thought it will take at least five years to produce and launch the first generation of satellites and the project could take over 15 years to work how Mr Musk envisions, The Huffington Post reported. The race is on to connect remote parts of the world, with both Google and Facebook also investing in technologies such as balloons and drones.

"A female lawn bowls player has been banned from competing for her local team, because the league claims women are 'not as good as men'. Claire Williams, 51, helped get Burway Bowling Club in Ludlow, Shropshire into the top lawn bowls division in the county last year. However, the Shropshire Premier Bowling League (SPBL) has a strict male-only policy and its president has today pledged to 'fight vehemently' to keep her and other women players out. Banned champion: Burway Bowling Club are trying to overturn the ban on women players in the Shropshire Premier Bowling League after Claire Williams, 51, (front) was not allowed to play for her team . Ms Williams' club are appealing to overturn the 21-year-old rule after branding the league regulations old-fashioned and outdated. But Mike Hinton, 73, president of the SPBL, has said there is 'no way' the league will allow a change in the rules and allow women to play. 'The plain fact is we don't think they are good enough,' Mr Hinton said, adding that Burway Bowling Club made a similar - unsuccessful - appeal for change last year. Sexist rules: The league's president has said he will 'fight vehemently' to keep female players like Claire Williams out . 'I would put my house and £1,000 on it not being passed again this year. 'I will be fighting vehemently to make sure women are not allowed to join our league. 'One of the middle leagues changed the rules  and they started putting women's names down on the team sheet before men, I couldn't believe it. 'I have been president for 13 years and I am standing down tomorrow, but there is no way we will let this rule change pass. 'The simple reason is because men are generally better players than women.' Ms Williams, who works for the Ministry of Defence, led her side to the top of the Flowfit Ludlow & District Bowls League last year, allowing the team to play in the top county league. However, this achievement also meant that Ms Williams had to be dropped from the team because of the men-only rule. When the issue was raised at the Shropshire Premier Bowling League annual meeting last year, many teams had not held their annual general meetings to discuss the matter, so it was voted down. Yesterday Duncan Pressley, captain of the Burway Bowling Club,  said it was time the sport caught up with the times. He said: 'We put a letter in last year asking why women couldn't be included in teams in the league. 'Obviously it was in our interest to have Claire as part of our team. 'She was one of the best players we had and not just of the ladies - she's better than a lot of the men. 'Claire doesn't play for us anymore, but it wasn't just about her. 'Somebody has got to be the first one to put up their hands and say in this day and age should we still be doing this? Outdated views: President Mike Hinton, 73,  said there is 'no way' the Shropshire Premier Bowling League will approve Burway's appeal for change as 'women are not as good as men'. 'It's probably the only league in the county which doesn't allow women to play. Ludlow and District has been a mixed league for 15 to 20 years. 'Most sports that aren't intensely physical these days are coming round to the idea that women can be allowed to compete alongside men. 'Look at golf, where women are now allowed in the club house at St..Andrews. 'There are ladies' leagues, obviously, but just within localised areas as far as I know. 'I know of several clubs that wouldn't have a problem with this, we have women that are good enough players just stood on the side watching. 'I think these things need to be looked at in today's world.'","Claire Williams can't play for her lawn bowls team as women are banned .

"The son of a 7/7 victim whose mother stole his £50,000 compensation says he has no sympathy for her as she is jailed for 30 months. Adam Gray, who was 11 when his father Richard was killed in the terrorist attack, entrusted the sum to his mother Louise for safe keeping on his 18th birthday. After blowing the money on seven chihuahuas, new cars and expensive dinners at Ritz, the 42-year-old widow was told to reimburse her son in civil court. Having failed to repay the money,  she was  jailed  after being found guilty of theft at Ipswich Crown Court, and imprisoned for 30 months. Scroll down for video . Adam Gray (right) said he feels no sympathy for his mother Louise (left) who was jailed for two years and eight months after squandering the money left to him following the death of his father in the 7/7 bombings . Speaking of her sentencing, Mr Gray, now 20, said she has 'brought it on herself'. 'To be honest, based upon how she has approached this whole situation, I feel like she has brought this upon herself and I don’t have any sympathy,' he said. 'It was even stated that she showed no emotion in the court room. Even now, she’s shown no remorse and continues to try and play the victim and manipulate everyone around her.' Ipswich Crown Court heard how following his father's death in 2005, Mr Gray was awarded £50,000 and his sister £100,000 in compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. The money was placed in a trust fund until their 18th birthdays. But after turning 18, Mr Gray entrusted the money to his mother for safe keeping, worried he was not responsible enough at the time to handle such a large sum. When he asked for access to it in 2013 to move to London from Ipswich, Suffolk, he was told it was all but gone - his mother having already spent the £250,000 given to her separately. While Mr Gray said he 'should not have had' to go to such extreme lengths, he is hopeful a prison stint will make his mother feel remorse. 'I don’t think she’ll cope very well in prison, I think it’ll be hard for her. 'She’s in a situation where she’ll have to tell everyone inside what she’s done. It’s not going to be a holiday for her. 'She’ll have to say that she stole her son’s money and the chances are the other inmates will be mothers. Grieving: Louise Gray (right with her daughter Ruby, now 16) met the Queen at a memorial service in 2005 . 'I don’t think this is going to be an easy time for her. I’m not sure if I’m going to visit her or not. 'Part of me hopes that she might actually learn from this experience but I don’t want to get my hopes up as so far she’s shown no remorse. 'I lost my dad as a young child, and now I’ve lost my mum.' In court the woman's behaviour was described as 'an act of wickedness beyond belief.' Sentencing, Judge David Goodin said of Mr Gray: 'He has lost not one parent, but two.' Judge David Goodin said: 'It's an act of wickedness almost beyond belief. He has lost not one parent, but two.' 'The theft of £43,000 is one thing. The theft of £43,000 by a parent from a young adult's trust is quite another, when that sum represented most - practically all - the compensation he received for his father's tragic death. 'The offence you have committed against your son, the trust you betrayed - a second hammer blow following the death of his father - is so serious it can only be met by a custodial sentence. 'The loss of a father in any circumstances, particularly in such violent circumstances, would have been a grievous blow to an 11-year-old Adam. Nobody would have known that better than you.' 'The theft of £43,000 is one thing.

'The loss of a father in any circumstances, particularly in such violent circumstances, would have been a grievous blow to an 11-year-old Adam. Nobody would have known that better than you.' In November 2013 the woman was sued by her son after revealing she had spent most of the money. She was ordered to repay him £43,750 but refused to do so after unsuccessfully appealing the verdict of the civil case. It was then police became involved, pursuing the mother-of-three on a count of theft. During the Crown Court trial, it was heard Gray, who has a three-year-old daughter with partner Umar Shamshoom, sent her 20-year-old son a text message pleading with him to bring the case to a halt. 'If you prosecute me, I will lose you. I can't face that,' the message is said to have read. Louise Gray (pictured left on a family holiday in 2004) has admitted theft at Ipswich Crown Court after squandering the cash left to her son Adam (bottom left in the left picture) following Richard's (right) death . Adam was 11 years old when his father Richard was killed in the suicide bomb attack on a Tube train near Aldgate station in 2005 (pictured). He was left £50,000 compensation and it was put in a trust until he was 18 . She is also said to have told Mr Gray she feared for her health and thought she had a tumour, an 'unfounded' claim according to Prosecutor Michael Crimp. 'To him it seemed like a guilt trip. The effect was, as far as he was concerned, emotional blackmail on him,' Mr Crimp said. Previously defending barrister Richard Conely denied claims his client had 'frittered away' her son's money, describing her circumstances following her husband's death as 'impossible'. 'This is a case which is rooted in tragic circumstances which came about when a terrorist detonated a bomb on the Circle line,' he said. 'His assault destroyed the lives of countless others in ways he and his co-conspirators could never have imagined.' 'She was living in a situation where she simply couldn't work ... paying the ordinary annual amount to meet the cost of living, in the region of £30,000 or thereabouts,' he said. Previously Mr Gray said his mother left him no choice but to take legal action. 'I felt confusion when the police told me she could face prison. But at the same time I wanted some justice for what she had done to me. 'She never showed me any remorse and she made me feel as if everything was my fault. Although it is hard to think of your own mother going to prison because of a crime she has committed against you, I believe that I deserve some form of justice. 'Hopefully she will be forced to pay me the money now. But I should not have had to go to such extreme lengths. Sadly, she left me no choice.' He did not attend her sentencing in Ipswich Crown Court today. Louise spent the £43,000 on lavish shopping sprees, a fleet of new cars, dinner at the Ritz, seven dogs and a jacuzzi for the family home. She was jailed today for more than two years.

Miss Evans had been taking photographs of Dave having his shower and spotted the face in his ear when she showed them to her boyfriend James Williams, 28 . Miss Evans said the image of the face, which she though resembled Jesus (right) was 'spooky', and that she was 'a bit freaked out' when she saw it . 'We looked a but closer and realised it looked like Jesus. It’s a bit strange.' Dog-lover Miss Evans shares eight-month-old Dave with her house mate Lewis Evans, 24, along with a seven-month-old chihuahua called Gilbert and whippet Flo, one. The pair hope the divine appearance is a good omen, and she added: 'We’ve not long moved into the house, so that would be good.' The face of Jesus has previously been spotted on a drainpipe, on a half eaten taco, in a burned frying pan, in the lid of a Marmite jar and even on an ultrasound scan in 2006. The Messiah's image was also spotted on Google Earth in a field in Hungary in 2010.","Rachel Evans, 25, was bathing mini Yorkshire terrier Dave in the sink .

"Using a minimum of eight body measurements, forensic teams were able to correctly identify people by their unique shape - even through clothes . Grainy CCTV footage in which a criminal’s face is obscured can make it difficult to identify perpetrators, and this job is even harder if no fingerprints are left at the scene. But, in what’s been dubbed a biometric breakthrough, researchers have discovered that a person’s body shape could equally give them away. Using just eight measurements, forensic teams were able to correctly identify people - even through clothes. Dubbed ‘body recognition’, the technique was developed at the University of Adelaide, and is said to be comparable with facial and fingerprint analysis. A team of researchers, led by PhD student Teghan Lucas, studied the anatomical measurements of 4,000 US armed services personnel from a national database. In particular, they compared eight facial and eight body measurements to see if a person’s body shape could be used for identification. Measurements included overall height, length of the body from the hip bone to the feet, length of wrist to elbow, jaw line, pelvic width, chest width, the width of a person’s face, from ear to ear, and the skull. The breadth of hips across the 4,000 people studied varied by up to 5.9 inches (150mm), making an individual measurement more unique. But, the length of ears across the sample varied by just 1.3 inches (35mm), making them harder to distinguish between. Other measurements that can change, and were discounted in body recognition, include the width of the stomach, inner arm and calf. These areas are directly affected by weight gain and loss, for example. During tests, the results revealed that, compared with the face, fewer body measurements are needed to identify a person. ‘There's been a lot of work conducted over the years on facial recognition,’ said Ms Lucas. Measurements included height, length from hip to the feet, wrist to elbow, jaw line, pelvic width, chest width and the width of a person’s face, from ear to ear. These measurements can be identified no matter what clothing the person may be wearing (example pictured), because of the way gravity affects body shape . The researchers studied the anatomical measurements of 4,000 US armed services personnel from a national database. In particular, they compared eight facial and eight body measurements to see if a person’s body shape could be used for identification. Measurements included overall height, length of the body from the top of the hip bones to the feet, length of wrist to elbow, jaw line, pelvic width, chest width, the width of a person’s face, from ear to ear, and the skull. The breadth of hips across the sample studied varied by up to 5.9 inches (150mm), making an individual measurement more unique. But, the length of ears across the sample varied by just 1.3 inches (35mm), making them harder to distinguish between. Other measurements that can change, and were discounted in body recognition, include the width of the stomach, inner arm and calf. These areas are directly affected by weight gain and loss, for example. During tests, the results revealed that, compared with the face, fewer body measurements are needed to identify a person. ‘This makes sense - humans have evolved to recognise faces, which is part of our survival mechanism, and the face contains some very distinctive features. ‘But what happens if the face is not shown, or if there is an unusual facial resemblance between two people? 'What happens if identification of the face alone just isn't enough?’ She continued that the technique would prove particularly useful when trying to identify criminals, or missing persons, from CCTV footage, for example. ‘Measurements of the body, as well as the face, were used for forensic identification as early as the 19th century,' continued Ms Lucas. 'It was believed that no two individuals had the exact same measurements. ‘However, this was overtaken by fingerprint analysis because it was considered more reliable in court proceedings, and the probability of finding matching individuals could be easily calculated.’ Ms Lucas’ research discovered that, with a combination of eight body measurements, it is possible to reduce the probability of finding a duplicate to the order of one in a quintillion. This makes the results comparable with fingerprint analysis, she added. The larger the range of each of the measurements, the less chance there is of finding a duplicate, too, and the measurements can be identified no matter what clothing the person may be wearing. This could help identify criminals or missing persons on CCTV when the face is obscured. 'There's been a lot of work conducted over the years on facial recognition,’ said the study. Facial recognition app True Key is pictured. 'But what happens if the face is not shown? What happens if identification of the face isn't enough?’ Experts said that with eight measurements,  the probability of finding a duplicate is one in a quintillion - comparable with fingerprint analysis . This is because the way gravity affects the overall body shape remains unchanged, and any movements - such as those on security footage - will reveal the outline of a body. For example, once fully formed, an adult's skeleton changes very little over the course of their life. The length of the femur, or the proportions from the wrist to the elbow, don’t change until a person becomes elderly. The larger measurements provided by the body compared to the face mean that there is more variation between people. ‘Despite what television and the movies would have people believe, there is often a lack of good quality video evidence,’ said Ms Lucas. ‘Criminal cases usually involve a deliberate attempt to cover the face, or fine details can't be seen. ‘In our experience, the body is more variable than the face and should be used in identification more often. ‘Another advantage to using the body is that larger dimensions are easier to locate on images and not affected by facial expressions.’","'Body recognition' technique was developed at the University of Adelaide .

"Witnesses in New Jersey have spoken of their horror at seeing a young mother douse her new born baby in a flammable liquid and set her alight. Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier, 22, is accused of burning her daughter alive on a public roadway at about 11 p.m. on Friday in Pemberton Township. 'It was just horrible. Like nothing you've ever seen,' said David Joseph, who lives across from where the incident occurred. Scroll down for videos . Accused: Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier has been charged with murdering her newborn baby. Her bail has been set at $50,000 . Neighbor Joseph, 45, initially thought he had caught someone dumping garbage when she stepped out of her Land Rover - such was her calm demeanor. 'We saw the fire and we thought someone was over there burning trash,' he said. Joseph's wife then notice what was really going on and screamed. The woman then tried to flee but he managed to restrain her until police arrived. A makeshift memorial now stands where the baby was killed. Scene: Witnesses say 22-year-old mother got out of her car and stopped in the middle of Simontown Road in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, on Friday night and burned the child alive . 'It was just mind-boggling. It was a nightmare even if you have a strong heart. Hopefully she'll pay for it,' said Joseph. Dorvilier was arrested at the scene. She is being held on $500,000 bail, prosecutors said. Medics rushed to the scene and airlifted the young child, which was still alive and breathing when they arrived, to St Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia with severe burns. However the baby succumbed to its injuries a short time later. Emergency services were called to the scene after residents described a 'commotion' inside a nearby home before the horrific act . The woman, who witnesses say lit the child on fire, was taken to Deborah Hospital, in Brown Mills, New Jersey according to NBC Philadelphia. She was then arrested after her condition stabilized. A statement by the Burlington County Prosecutors read: 'Burlington County Prosecutor Robert D. Bernardi and Pemberton Township Police Chief David H. Jantas announced today that a Pemberton Township woman has been charged with killing her newborn baby by setting her ablaze last night on Simontown Road. 'Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier, age 22, of Rutgers Avenue in Pemberton Township, was charged with one count of Murder. Bail was set at $500,000 by the Hon. Jeanne T. Covert, J.S.C. 'Dorvilier was lodged in the Burlington County Corrections and Work Release Center in Pemberton Township. 'Officers from the Pemberton Township Police Department were dispatched to Simontown Road just before 11 p.m. yesterday after a resident called to report the fire in the roadway. Response: Medics rushed to the scene and airlifted the young child to St Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia with severe burns. It succumbed to its injuries a short time later . 'At approximately 11:15 p.m., the baby was airlifted to Saint Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia and was reported to be alive and breathing at that time. The baby died approximately two hours later. 'The investigation revealed that the infant had been doused with an accelerant prior to being set ablaze. Dorvilier was taken into custody at the scene. 'An autopsy will be performed by Burlington County Medical Examiner Dr. Ian Hood. 'The details of the baby's birth are being investigated. The investigation is being conducted by detectives from the Pemberton Township Police Department and the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office.'","Young child was found burning alive in Pemberton Township, New Jersey .

"An investigation has revealed how cyber criminals can easily use public Wi-Fi networks to access private information on your smartphone. Crooks rely on the fact many people are relaxed about the security of the networks they connect to. While the majority of these networks are run by legitimate companies, they are sometimes created by a criminal who may be sitting nearby with little more than a laptop. Scroll down for video . An investigation by 5 News reveals how easy it is for hackers to get information using public Wi-Fi networks . Aside from using a smartphone's Wi-Fi connection, hackers can also access a phone through the wireless 'Bluetooth' function. When Bluetooth is switched on, it allows it to 'talk' to other enabled devices nearby. This means that a hacker sitting near you can use his Bluetooth-enabled laptop to connect to your device without your knowledge. This process is sometimes called 'bluejacking' or, more properly, 'bluesnarfing' Now, a Channel 5 experiment has shown just how simple it is for hackers to suck information out of smartphones. In the investigation, security expert Jason Hart used a device which forced customers in a café to switch their phones from the establishment's legitimate Wi-Fi to his own fake Wi-Fi without them knowing. Mr Hart's device succeeding in overriding and effectively tricking phones and computers. This would enable a thief to hack email accounts, obtain log-in passwords, track people's movements and steal thousands of pounds in just a few hours. The networks set up by criminals are often given innocent-sounding names, such as 'Free Public Wi-Fi', that con smartphone users in to logging in. A security expert used a device which forced customers in a cafe to switch their phones to his fake Wi-Fi . Survey conducted by Channel 5. How often, if ever, do you log-in to free public Wi-Fi on your smartphone? Very often 5 . Fairly often 17 . Rarely 38 . Never 37 . Not sure 2 . In terms of security and the risk of people accessing your smartphone and data held on it, how safe do you think free public wifi is? Very safe 2 . Fairly safe 27 . Not very safe 35 . Not safe at all 14 . Not sure 22 . Which, if any, of the following do you use free public wifi for? Please tick all that apply? Browsing the internet 42 . Checking email 33 . Social media 32 . Online shopping 6 . Online banking 4 . Other 4 . None of these 37 . Don't know 3 . Mr Hart - who is a VP at digital security firm Gemalto - told 5 News: 'The ability for a bad guy to essentially suck information out of any wireless-enabled device is extremely easy, especially in a public area. 'I think people need to be aware of the risks of using public Wi-Fi and potentially the exposure they're putting themselves to.' 'It's very frightening,' one customer told Channel 5 after they had been tricked. 'I just assumed that hackers - for want of a better word - would have to sit there for half a day, or a day, or a few days in order to get all your information but this was literally minutes.' Maxim Weinstein, a security adviser at Sophos, told MailOnline: 'The problem of people being able to intercept data on unprotected networks is an ongoing challenge we face. 'Wi-Fi data between someone's computer, smartphone and wireless access point can be visible to anyone else using that same wireless access point. 'There are a number of things that can be done to prevent this. One is to set up your own Virtual Private Network when accessing the internet from a public network, ensuring that apps are secure and using encryption while online.' He added: 'It is generally more secure to use 3G or 4G networks. While there have been some examples of hacks against these networks, they are much more challenging to hack. 'It's actually quite straight forward to get information using public Wi-Fi networks, particularly for unencrypted data. Mike Bradshaw, a partner with Sophos, added: 'In our war biking exercise in London we found a staggering number of wireless networks with nearly a third failing to meet basic security measures. 'With less than £40 of equipment and a laptop it is easy to advertise a hot spot and then intercept the traffic of people whom connect - perhaps even downgrading their ""secure web connections"" so you can spy on really sensitive data. 'There are multiple reasons someone might do this, from the malicious cyber criminal hoping to secure financial details or personal information for further scams, or an enterprise offering wireless hoping to use your information for ""enhanced offerings"". 'It is rather difficult to identify a network which is legitimate versus one provided by a scammer and so a better strategy is simply to assume all networks have prying eyes or may be trying to manipulate your network traffic to their end.' A survey, also conducted by Channel 5, found that one in five Britons access free public Wi-Fi 'fairly or very often'. The majority use the Wi-Fi to surf the internet, browse emails and go on social media. By far the best way to beat the hackers is to set up your own Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your computer at home. Then, when you are using a public Wi-Fi hotspot, you can use your smartphone to connect to your home computer, and use its secure connection to the internet to access web pages safely. However, this is technically challenging and most of us would need help from an IT expert to do this. Another way to stay secure is to make sure that any supposedly secure webpages you look at feature a little padlock in the address bar, as well as the preface 'https' rather than 'http'. This means that the page is secure, and not visible to others. Third, make sure that you regularly install the suggested updates for your smartphone's browser software.","Security expert used device forcing customers to unknowingly switch Wi-Fi .

"The French capital is still reeling from the Charlie Hebdo-related terror attacks almost two weeks ago. And, despite reassurances from the Paris tourist board, the city is quiet as tourists stay away, according to local vendors. 'It's been so calm since the attacks. There's hardly anyone at all,' sandwich seller Kamel Bougrab, based near the Eiffel Tower. Armed security patrols around the Eiffel Tower; local believe numbers of visitors are down in the wake of the terror attacks . Tourism officials couldn't give figures of the number of sightseers in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, but  interviews with vendors indicated an initial drop in visitors. British student Eric Dale, on a group trip with his college, said one of his classmates was kept back by her parents, who were fearful for her safety. 'My parents were nervous, but in the end they left the final decision up to me,' he said. Queues around the Louvre are reported to be lower than expected for the time of year . An Eiffel Tower spokeswoman insisted that the attraction had recorded no drop in visits so far, compared to the relatively slow month of January 2014. But no official statistics have yet been compiled, and the situation could still change, she said on condition of anonymity because of company policy. Among the tourists that were still braving visits, many took comfort in the extra security presence. With 10,500 troops deployed across the country, including 6,000 in the Paris region alone, the security operation put in motion after the attacks is the most extensive on French soil in recent history. Lucinda Bay, 22, from Australia, said she came to the French capital with her sister despite initial fears. 'I'm a bit nervous, but I guess this can happen anywhere. I wouldn't want that to stop us visiting this beautiful city,' she said. A woman reads the new edition of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo as she walks by French soldiers patrolling inside Trocadero metro station, in Paris . Over in the Louvre, lines were shorter too. 'For me it's good because I didn't have to wait too long,' said Guatemalan Eric Velasquez, in front of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. 'I don't think tourists should stay away. I watched the response from the government and it was very fast, very good. It feels safe,' he added. The Louvre said that school visits to the Paris region, including museums, had been suspended by the Education Ministry because the capital was on 'attack alert' status since last week. The Louvre normally receives several hundred schoolchildren a day, and their absence partly accounts for the thinner crowds. Also, mid-January is often slow as festive tourists have often gone back home following their New Year celebrations. 'This is a slow season anyway, so it's hard to distinguish what's causing the dip, that (it's January) or the attacks,' a spokesperson for the Louvre said. Tourist who are currently visiting Paris have urged fellow visitors to carry on as normal . Among the measures following the terror raids was also an increase in police presence around airports, Jewish schools and media offices. Col. Benoit Brulon, an adviser to the Paris military governor, says the aim of these patrols isn't just to secure high-risk facilities but to reassure the public. 'I don't feel unsafe as the security measures are notched up,' said 65-year-old Marine Dupont, visiting with her husband from the northern French city of Calais along the English Channel. 'They're not going to commit a second attack straight away. On the contrary, I think we're even safer right now than before.' Yet the heavily-armed French police patrolling the streets also unsettled some, especially those from countries where police aren't normally armed so visibly. 'Seeing huge machine gun rifles is quite scary,' said 20-year-old Australian student Mimi George. 'But I suppose it does make you feel safer in the end.'","Queues around the Eiffel Tower are a fraction of the length .

The university, which announced the deal before signing a contract, has to pay over $540,000 to host the event - a fee inflated by $400,000 in arena roof work needed to accommodate cameras and lights . According to the Miami Herald, one professor wrote to the university president, warning about the dangers of 'female objectification'. One proposal to offset costs of hosting the 88 beauty queens, was to use funds intended for the university's female athletes. The newspaper quotes a memo from November 4 which notes a women's softball and golf locker room building would likely be 'scrapped' as a result of the pageant. However, the university's athletics and entertainment director, Pete Garcia, said he expected the project would begin this spring. FIU administrators insist the pageant will pay and believe the enhanced arena will make the university more competitive in securing concerts and events. The newspaper, however, contends that information provided to them paints a different story. It was originally estimated that fixing the roof would cost $70,000 - yet records suggest it ending up costing $400,000. University administrators downplayed the cost of upgrading on the roof and said the pageant simply fast tracked work that had already been planned. Professors complained that they weren't notified beforehand and some thought hosting a beauty contest wasn't appropriate for a university. FIU professor Susanne Zwingel, an expert in women's rights and gender-equality issues told the university that 'female objectification' was a dangerous part of American mainstream society; pictured above is the co-owner of the pageant, Donald Trump, with this year's contestants . FIU professor Susanne Zwingel, an expert in women's rights and gender-equality issues, wrote to the university's president Mark Rosenberg expressing her disappointment. She wrote: 'Mr. President, female objectification is a dangerous part of American mainstream society.' Ms Zwingel said that FIU had a duty to stand up to the status quo, but was instead perpetuating it. She said: 'A university has a responsibility toward young men as well,' Zwingel wrote. 'It should help them unlearn the messages sent about women by society as a whole — that they are to be judged by their looks and that it is fine to treat them as objects for men's fantasies.' To ease tensions, the university has tried to distance itself from the pageant, by not calling itself a sponsor and removing its logo from the pageant website.

"Dhanuson Dharmasena is on trial for FGM charges in the first case of its kind. Southwark Crown Court heard the alleged offence took place at the Whittington Hospital in north London . A British doctor performed female genital mutilation on a young mother after she gave birth in hospital, a court has heard. Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, is standing trial accused of carrying out the illegal procedure at the Whittington Hospital in north London in the first prosecution of its kind in the UK. A second man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, denies encouraging and abetting the offence. The woman, 24 at the time, first underwent female genital mutilation (FGM) aged six in Somalia, London's Southwark Crown Court heard. The highly dangerous procedure left her at risk of infection, haemorrhage and even death. The woman, who cannot be identified, now lives in Britain and went to hospital  in labour in 2012. During labour, her FGM stitches were torn. Dharmasena, the junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology, sewed her back up in a procedure that amounted to FGM, the court heard. Kate Bex, prosecuting, told jurors: 'The prosecution is the result of an alleged offence under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. 'Female genital mutilation is often abbreviated to FGM, it is also known as female circumcision. It may be that it is not a law that you have heard much about, or that you are unsure exactly what FGM means. 'You may be expecting to hear that the offence took place in a back-street clinic, by an unqualified and uncaring person, on a young child. This trial is quite different, but nonetheless involves FGM.' She said the woman, now 27, had been subjected to FGM as a child in Africa. And after the birth and 'at Mr Mohamed's insistence, or with his encouragement' Dharmasena 'stitched' her back up, the court was told. Ms Bex added: 'It is that stitching back together by Dr Dharmasena, and Mr Mohamed's insistence or encouragement, which the prosecution says is an offence under the Act. 'What Dr Dharmasena did... was against the policy of his employer, the Whittington Hospital. 'That policy is written and available to all midwives, nurses, obstetricians and students at the Whittington and Dr Dharmasena was expected to be aware of it.' Jurors heard that FGM is a highly dangerous procedure which risks the health of tens of millions of women worldwide. Ms Bex said:'FGM can be very dangerous for a woman's health and psychological well-being. 'It can lead to severe health problems and, in some cases, to death. FGM causes gynaecological, urological and obstetric problems in women, chronic pain and sexual dysfunction. Scroll down for video . The court heard the alleged offence happened after a woman gave birth at the hospital in  2012, where Dharmasena had been working for a month . 'It increases the risk of death in childbirth to both mother and baby.' Jurors heard the woman would have been most exposed to these side-effects when the surgery was first performed when she was six. Dharmasena's stitches would not have carried the same risks, but should not have been sewn at all 'unless medically necessary'. Mohamed denies one count of aiding or abetting the procedure, and one count of intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. Dharmasena, who took up his post at the Whittington a month before the events took place, was in charge of delivering the baby on the morning of November 24. Dharmasena initially claimed he carried out the procedure according to the woman's wishes, the court heard . Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the deliberate removal of all or part of the external female genitalia. The World Health Organisation describes FGM as any procedure that injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is also referred to as female circumcision or female cutting. FGM is mostly carried out on young girls in adolescence but is also carried out on females during childhood. It sometimes take place when the female is a baby. In some cultures, it is seen as a right of passage into womanhood and a condition of marriage. Some believe the genitals will be unhealthy or unclean if the female does not have FGM. There is also a common belief that women need to have FGM to have babies. But, infact, FGM can cause infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications. The procedure is usually carried out by a woman with no medical training. Anaesthetics and antiseptic treatments are not generally used and the practice is usually carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. The procedure can cause severe bleeding and infections, which last the female's entire lifetime. It is estimated that 3 million girls are cut every year across the world. Around 23,000 of these are carried out in the UK. The practice is particularly rife in some African, Middle Eastern and Indonesian countries. He said the woman 'was initially very reluctant' to allow him to perform incisions necessary for the birth, but was persuaded. A midwife, Aimma Ali, realised what was happening 'was illegal', jurors heard. She took Dharmasena to one side and told him. As a result he told the on-call consultant Vibha Ruparelia and explained 'he did not know that he was not allowed to do it until the midwife had told him'. The hospital trust launched an investigation into the incident within a few weeks. In a statement, Dharmasena said he carried out the procedure because he thought the woman, AB, wanted him to. He said: 'At no point in time did I intentionally or deliberately want to cause any harm to the patient. I had obeyed all of the patient's wishes.' But jurors heard he changed his justification when he was interviewed by police on August 20 2013. Ms Bex said: 'It would seem that Dr Dharmasena had familiarised himself with the law and you may feel that he changed tack as a result.' She said that it was at this interview, ten months after the operation, he raised the possibility it was 'medically justified'. Dharmasena, of Ilford, Essex, denies one count of female genital mutilation. Linked to this, Mohamed is facing one count of abetting Dharmasena in committing the offence. He faces an alternative count of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. He denies both counts. Carrying out female genital mutilation carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. The case was adjourned until 2pm tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Woman had undergone female genital mutilation in Somalia as a child .
