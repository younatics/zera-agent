Prosecutors told a court today that both men raped the girl but Kumar claims only Pradeep sexually assaulted her. Pradeep (left) was yesterday and Manoj Kumar, 24, (right) was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of the kidnap, rape and torture of a five-year-old girl in New Delhi . Pradeep covers his face as he is taken away by police after he was arrested in Lakhisarai District yesterday . Protests also continued for a fourth consecutive day today as schoolchildren and teachers held placards calling for more respect for women. Kumar, 24, who was arrested on Saturday, told investigators that he and . Pradeep had been heavily drinking and watching porn on a mobile phone . before luring the child in their room, India Today reports. He is reported to have told police that they offered her chocolate to persuade her to go into the room. They are accused of strangling her before fleeing Delhi.

On Sunday, Kumar was sent . to two weeks' judicial custody and Pradeep, a 19-year-old clothes . factory worker, was arrested yesterday in Lakhisarai.

A 28-stone nursing home worker who abused elderly vulnerable people by sitting on them was yesterday jailed for nine months. Fiona Salmon, 40, also pinched, slapped and manhandled those in her care during the campaign of physical and verbal cruelty. She sprayed deodorant in an elderly woman’s face, threw talcum powder at another and rubbed one female resident’s head so hard she made her nose bleed. Heavyweight: Fiona Salmon, a 28-stone care home worker, was found guilty of sitting on elderly residents . The court also heard how Salmon would dig her nails into her victims and punch them. On one occasion she threw a . 99-year-old onto her bed and pushed the same woman’s wheelchair into a . closed door, an act the judge described as ‘extremely callous’. She even slapped an 89-year-old man . who was suffering from skin cancer and made rude comments about him. Salmon also slapped an 85-year-old resident. Colleagues of the care assistant watched in horror as Salmon sat on residents’ legs to stop them getting up. They told how she gave residents, who . were all of reduced mental capacity, names such as ‘grubby b****’ and . told them their breath stank of dog mess. Jailed: Salmon was sentenced to nine months in prison and the judge said it was 'extremely unlikely' she would work in care again . Salmon was previously found guilty of . seven charges of ill-treating or neglecting residents and yesterday was . jailed at Truro Crown Court.

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 18:46 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:06 EST, 10 May 2013 . Theresa May has asked the College of Policing to draw up new guidelines on dealing with crime suspects . Police were last night ordered to halt their march towards arresting and charging suspects in secret. Theresa May intervened to ‘protect transparency in the criminal justice system’. It follows revelations by the Mail that one force in three is refusing to name suspects even after they have been charged. Mrs May fears that if a person’s identity is kept hidden ‘witnesses and other victims might not come forward’. The Home Secretary is warning chief constables that there ‘should be no right to anonymity at charge apart from in extremely unusual circumstances’. Where suspects have been arrested but not charged, she said, they could be named if it was in the ‘public interest’ – a broad definition that does not tie police hands. Forces have been justifying the new policy by quoting the Leveson report on Press standards.Lord Justice Leveson said that, save in exceptional circumstances, ‘the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or public’. But in a letter to police policy chiefs, Mrs May pointed out that while the comments had been included in Lord Leveson’s report, they did not form part of his ‘substantive recommendations’. She added: ‘I would like police forces to be aware of this fact.’ In the wake of the Leveson report, senior police began drawing up their own national guidelines stating that suspects should not be named on arrest. Critics likened the policy to a totalitarian state where people can be swept off the streets without anyone being told. One force said last week that it would no longer name suspects even after they had been charged with a criminal offence. Warwickshire Police made the announcement in a footnote to a press release which revealed that one of its former officers had been charged with stealing more than £100,000. Senior officers – who were later forced to scrap the policy – explicitly cited the Leveson inquiry to justify their actions. A Daily Mail survey revealed that 14 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales are keeping secret the names of suspects, even after they have been charged. Mrs May’s letter, seen by the Mail, was sent to Alex Marshall, the chief executive of the new College of Policing, which trains officers and draws up policy guidelines. She has asked the college to write new rules on dealing with crime suspects. Previously, the Association of Chief Police Officers had taken the lead on this. The Mail has campaigned for transparency in the justice system . The letter says: ‘I am writing because of my concern about the different approaches taken by police forces regarding the anonymity of suspects upon arrest and charge. ‘In particular, I am concerned that the refusal of some police forces to name suspects who have been charged undermines transparency in the criminal justice system and risks the possibility that witnesses and other victims might not come forward. ‘I strongly believe that there should be no right to anonymity at charge apart from in extremely unusual circumstances. ‘I believe that there should be a right to anonymity at arrest, but I know that there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named.‘I would like you to work on new guidance that makes this clear.’ The move follows the revelation that BBC sexual predator Stuart Hall might never have been brought to justice under the proposed secrecy regime. Publicity surrounding his arrest in December led to more than a dozen other victims coming forward. If they had not added their complaints, the case might have collapsed for lack of evidence. After his arrest, Hall, 83, declared his innocence and invoked Leveson to complain about ‘systematic leaks to the media’. Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti – an adviser to the Leveson inquiry – said that although it was wrong for the police to brief against suspects, it was ‘equally chilling’ for officers to refuse to name someone they have detained or charged. She also condemned a ‘blanket policy of arresting people in secret’. Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said it was in the interests of justice for suspects to be named because the resulting publicity could help uncover vital evidence. Kirsty Hughes, of Index on Censorship, said: ‘In certain cases, it may be appropriate to preserve anonymity but a “policy” of secrecy reverses the principle of open justice that we have in the UK.’ Earlier this week, the Mail revealed how police had concealed the arrest of Jimmy Tarbuck for almost a fortnight. The veteran comedian was questioned by North Yorkshire Police on April 26 over claims he sexually abused a young boy in the 1970s. But news of the 73-year-old’s controversial arrest did not emerge until it was discovered by the Mail 11 days later.","Home Secretary acts to halt trend of secret arrests and charges .

"By . Ian Drury and Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 16:05 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:25 EST, 9 May 2013 . Seven decades ago, tens of thousands of men stood at Loch Ewe fearful they might never again see the shores of Britain. A remote inlet in the northwest Highlands of Scotland, it was the starting point for the Arctic Convoys on their treacherous journeys to the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Described by Winston Churchill as the 'worst journey in the world', the heroes were risking their lives running a gauntlet of German warplanes and U-boats to keep the Red Army fighting on the Eastern Front. Yesterday, 39 of the dwindling band of veterans returned to the loch's shores to receive medals rewarding their bravery from the Government. Poignant: Arctic convoy veterans gathered at Loch Ewe for a memorial service where they laid wreaths . The proud former sailors were handed the Arctic Star after some 70 years of frustration. The presentation was a victory for a campaign by the Daily Mail to get official recognition for the seaman who served their country in horrendous conditions. They gathered at sun-drenched Loch Ewe for a service to remember their fallen colleagues, 3,000 of whom perished in the freezing waters between 1941 and 1945. Thousands more have died before they could be officially honoured for their part in the convoys. Today, only a few hundred veterans are alive. Only last Sunday Jock Dempster, a veteran who fought for decades to for an Arctic medal, died aged 85. He received his at a ceremony at Downing Street in March but passed away days before he could wear it in public for the first time . In a moving ceremony at Poolewe, a personal message of thanks from the Queen was read out to the seaman who were just teenagers when they embarked on their missions. Poppy wreaths were laid at a memorial as RAF jets performed a flypast in long-awaited acknowledgment of their courage. Proud: Bill Bannerman, 89, served on four Arctic Convoys in 1944 . The Arctic Convoys were described by Churchill as the 'worst journey in the world' Bert Glazebrook, 87, who sailed on two convoy missions on the destroyers HMS Serapis and HMS Walker, said: 'We got the medal for the ones who aren't here. 'Now we have got the medals I'm very pleased. Not just for me but for all my mates as well. It brings back good memories. 'We all went through hell. It was freezing cold, sleeping where you could when you have your duties to concentrate on, never knowing when it was our turn for a torpedo. 'But surrounded by your mates on a ship, we all just carried on. 'I got a little bit disillusioned while I was waiting for the medal, but today made up for it all.' Ron Leslie, 87, a member of the Fleet Air Arm, served on board the aircraft carriers HMS Vindex, HMS Campania and HMS Nairana and made various trips in support of a number of Arctic convoys. He said: 'Somebody one day said to me, ""You are so brave going to Russia"". I told them thank you, but there was more too it than that, we had to get back again. 'The enemies we had were not only German. There was the sea, the weather.' Bob Brighton, 88, was returning to Loch Ewe for the first time since the end of the Second World War. He joined the corvettee HMS Bamborough Castle and completed six convoys - experiencing the horror of seeing allied vessels torpedoed. He said: 'It is the end of the past and the beginning of the future today. It is recognition of something at last. 'These are my friends, and there is a lot more that have been gone. I have come here for the little celebration of ourselves.' Ivan Hall, 90, from Ludlow, Shropshire, was a merchant seaman on SS St Clears on one of the first convoys in 1941. He wrote of his journey in a book entitled Christmas In Archangel as his ship was icebound in the Russian port for six months. It was there he bought a mandolin which he took to yesterday's ceremony. He said: 'It is very strange being back here. It's hard to describe the memories that come back. 'But I am just amazed we are regarded so highly and people want to remember what we did. It is very humbling. We just went out there and did what we had to do. Tragic: Jock Dempster died just days before he was due to wear his medal in public for the first time . 'When we got to the ice sea it was frozen over. So the icebreakers dragged us towards Archangel but we were frozen in. 'We were in a very grim place, but one of the sailors found a shop which sold musical instruments. So we made a band. I learnt to play the Russian Mandolin while I was there and we played some songs.'I just found the instrument in my loft, it has been stored in there for about 70 years.' Thousands of vessels massed in Loch Ewe before embarking on the treacherous 1,600-mile journey past the enemy-held shores of Norway, through the Barents Sea to the frozen wastes of Murmansk and Archangel. The convoys carried four million tons of cargo including tanks, planes, fuel and food to help the Russia slow Germany's advances on the Eastern front. More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors and merchant seamen took part. In total, 87 merchant ships and 18 British warships were sunk. But the Cold War meant it was politically difficult to give the survivors a medal for assisting the Soviet Union. When the war ended those on the convoys were awarded the Atlantic Star - even though that was a separate campaign 800 miles away. But last year Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the Arctic Star medals amid concerns many veterans would die before they were awarded. He admitted he was 'righting a wrong'. Campaigners used yesterday's occasion to launch a £2.5million fundraising drive to build a museum and new community centre on the site of HMS Helicon, the Arctic Convoys base from 1941-1945.","Heroes finally honoured seven decades after risking lives .

YouTube is extending its original programming initiative into Europe, with at least 60 new video channels from media companies including the BBC, FreemantleMedia and Endemol. It will also include 'personality' channels including one fronted by TV cook Jamie Oliver. The plan is believed to be part of a bid to lure viewers away from traditional TV shows to online shows. Scroll down for video . Jamie Oliver is among those fronting his own YouTube channel in a new initiative launched today which will see 60 channels set up in Europe . The Google owned video site said the new channels, with content from Britain, Germany, France, and the United States, will be in addition to the 100 channels launched in the U.S. last year. Like the pre-existing American offerings, the European channels will have a mix of celebrity-oriented, niche, and established programs. 'Some of the channels are personality-driven, others are from partners who are totally passionate about a subject,' Ben McOwen Wilson, who manages YouTube's northern European partnerships, said in a telephone interview ahead of the announcement. He said the goal was to let content producers come up with something they couldn't deliver on TV. The expansion into Europe marks another step in YouTube's move into the territory normally occupied by traditional media companies. McOwen Wilson said the new channels would include programming from BBC Worldwide, the British public broadcaster's commercial arm; Endemol, the Dutch company behind the 'Big Brother' reality television franchise; and FreemantleMedia, an arm of German media giant Bertelsmann responsible for 'American Idol.' Factual programming includes 'Euronews Knowledge,' from rolling news channel Euronews and ""Truthloader,"" by ITN Productions. Beyonce & Jay-Z at Barklays Center, a gig which was broadcast live on YouTube . The channels will also count content from more niche players: the British offerings include co-productions such as 'Guinness World Records: OMG' and 'The Jamie Oliver Food Channel'. Other British channels range from programs on drum and bass (Mixmag TV) to childcare (Netmums) and makeup tips, fashion, royalty, and more. McOwen Wilson declined to say how much YouTube was investing in the European expansion. The Associated Press has previously reported that the company paid out $100 million ((euro) 77 million) to producers when it launched its U.S. channels in 2011, with advances reaching up to $5 million per channel. Google hopes that advertising revenue will cover the money in advance it paid the media companies to set up the channels. Any surplus money generated on top of the advance will be split between Google and the producers.","Partners include the BBC, ITN, Freemantle Media and Endemol .

The island was said to have sunk into the ocean after a failed attempt to invade Athens, Greece. In 2011, Professor Richard Freund from the University of Hartford claimed to have found evidence of Atlantis in southwestern Andalusia.","Granite samples could have been submerged by the Atlantic Ocean when Africa split from South America 100 million years ago .

A massive air and sea search has been launched off the coast of New South Wales for a man and a woman believed to have fallen overboard from a luxury cruise liner. Paul Rossington, 30 and Kristen Schroder, 27 were discovered missing when the Carnival Spirit liner arrived in Sydney today. The alarm was raised when the couple did not disembark and a search of the ship failed to find them. Investigation: Two police officers check for fingerprints on the balcony of the cabin of two passengers who fell overboard from the cuise ship Carnival Spirit as it returned to Sydney from a Pacific cruise . Search: Police arrive at Sydney's Circular Quay - the alarm was raised when the couple did not disembark and a search of the ship failed to find them . Marine Area Commander Mark Hutchings said did not rule out the possibility of a suicide pact. 'I've been a detective all my career. I actually deal with evidence, and I rule nothing out,' he said. 'It's very raw at the moment and we are talking to relatives.' The missing passengers were last seen on the deck of the . ship during Wednesday evening, some 12 hours before they were reported . missing, as the vessel came to the end of its 10-day . voyage. Police revealed later that the ship's CCTV cameras had captured images of the couple falling overboard. Shocking: A passenger looks at the view as a police officer inspects the balcony of the cabin .

'This is a tragic event at the moment, but we're holding . out hope we might be able to find these people alive,' he said. The search is concentrating on the waters between Sydney and Newcastle, 100 miles to the north of the harbour city. It is believed the US registered ship, which is currently based in Australia, has just returned from sailing through the Pacific, visiting the islands of Fiji and New Zealand. Mr Peter Taylor, a spokesman for Carnival Cruise Lines, said the couple were travelling with their family and friends. When they were found to be missing, he said, ''the ship immediately initiated standard missing person procedures, including a full search of the vessel, as per protocol.' Luxury: The 959ft, 88,500 ton vessel was launched in 2001 and is described by passengers as a 'floating holiday resort' Miss Jo Meehan, spokeswoman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is co-ordinating the search, said an aircraft, a helicopter and police boats were searching a 300-square nautical mile area of the sea north of Sydney. Carnival Cruise is a subsidiary of Miami-based Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise operator. The company is reported to have been plagued by a series of high-profile problems in recent years, the most major of which was the grounding of the Costa Concordia which ran aground off the coast of Italy last year killing 32 people. Costa is a division of Carnival Corp and also last year, the Costa Allegra caught fire and lost power in the Indian Ocean, leaving passengers working working toilets, running water or air conditioning for three days. In February this year the Carnival Triumph spent five days without power in the Gulf of Mexico after an engine-room fire put the vessel out of action.

A couple who filled their home with junk narrowly escaped jail today for child cruelty in what is thought to be the first prosecution for hoarding. Ambulance driver Duncan Scott, 47, and his partner Claire Anderson, 46, were told by a furious judge at the Old Bailey that they were lucky he was not jailing them immediately. Instead Judge John Bevan handed them suspended sentences after hearing how the couple collected so much junk from car boot sales that children living there had to eat on the stairs. Claire Anderson, 46, and her partner Duncan Scott, 47, were given suspended sentences at the Old Bailey today after pleading guilty to four charges of child cruelty today . The couple, from Bedfordshire, . pleaded guilty to four charges of child cruelty by providing . inappropriate living condition for four children between September 2007 . and September 2011. The court heard that there were piles of clothes in the bedrooms and toys and other items from car boot sales all over the house. Police and social workers who went to the three-bedroom terraced property found the youngsters were eating their meals on the stairs because the kitchen was so cluttered. The children, who are all aged under 16, cannot be identified for legal reasons. Charles Ward-Jackson, prosecuting, said the house was 'extremely untidy' but it was accepted that it was clean. The couple had been warned after social workers visited the house on a number of occasions, but were ignored. Mother-of-four Claire Anderson leaving the Old Bailey after narrowly escaping a prison sentence . Judge John Bevan observed: 'He has got money problems, she seems to spend it all at car boot sales. 'She shows a number of characteristics common in individuals who hoard, frequently shopping, visiting car boot sales on a weekly basis. 'She seems to have spent a lot of time socialising at them in order to give her a social life.' Bozzie Sheffi, representing Anderson, said she suffered from depression and was physically exhausted. Judge Bevan sentenced the couple to six months jail suspended for two years, and ordered them to do 150 hours unpaid work each. He told the couple, who were on bail: 'You can count yourselves fortunate that you are leaving by the same door you came in through.' The judge said the couple appeared to blame each other. He added: 'The evidence demonstrates, and one only has to look at the photographs, that you were slovenly. 'The photographs are dreadful. The lower bunk bed could not appear to be seen. There was nowhere to eat food other than on the stairs.' He told Scott: 'As an ambulance technician, you should have known better.' Addressing Anderson, he said: 'You were addicted to car boot sales and clutter. 'The children were unkempt and untidy. Despite claiming you were suffering depression, you were not prevented from going to car boot sales and making the situation worse and worse.' The case highlights what appears to be a growing problem of people filling up their homes with possessions. Television programmes have featured families who cannot move around their homes or sleep in their beds.","Duncan Scott, 47, and Claire Anderson, 46, pleaded guilty to child cruelty .

Jodi Arias said last night that she would prefer to be given the death penalty rather than life in prison after she was yesterday found guilty of first degree murder. Because of her emotional state, Arias is now on suicide watch as she awaits her sentencing hearing which begins today. 'The worst outcome would be natural life because longevity runs in my family,' she told MyFoxPhoenix. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaking out: Jodi Arias gave an interview to a local news station just minutes after the verdict and she said that she hopes she gets the death penalty because she doesn't want to 'spend the rest of my natural life in one place' 'The worst outcome would be natural life. I would much rather die sooner rather than later because Longevity runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and  I'll probably live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward to. 'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.' The interview took place in a holding room inside the courthouse just 20 minutes after the verdict was rendered. And now, because of the suicidal comments she made in the interview as well as prior threats, police have put her under psychological watch to insure that she does not hurt herself while in court custody. The moment: Arias showed little reaction when the verdict was read . Welling up: Arias had tears in her eyes when she looked back at her family sitting behind her in the courtroom . Since she admitted that she killed Alexander, there was no chance that she would have been found innocent, but the question of whether or not she planned the murder or whether it was committed as an act of self defense. Today five members of the 12-person jury found it was premeditated and the seven others found that it was both premeditated and a felony murder. 'It was unexpected for me yes because there was no premeditation on my part,' she said in the interview. 'The whole time I was fairly confident that I wouldn't get premeditation because there was no premeditation.' She said that she would have . understood if they simply found her guilty of felony murder 'because of . the way that the law is written' but also attributes some of her own . actions that caused the jury not to believe her. 'I can understand that because of the lies I told in the beginning, to try to cover this and hide that,' Arias said. Spectacle: Court officials told the public that the verdict was going to be read three hours before it actually happened, giving followers time to gather outside of the Maricopa Courthouse . Victory: Crowds cheer when they heard Jodi Arias was convicted of first degree murder Wednesday afternoon . She took shots at prosecutor Juan Martinez, who she sparred with for weeks during her questioning. 'Prior to trial, I respected Juan as a capable attorney even though he’s done some very shady things in my case as far as hiding evidence,' she said in the Fox interview. 'In the end what does it matter it doesn’t help my case.' Some of the hundreds of Alexander supporters who gathered outside of the courtroom awaiting the verdict held posters praising Martinez, one even suggesting he runs for governor of Arizona. Arias said that she was 'overwhelmed' and 'went blank' following the verdict, but showed little emotion. Closure: The victim's sisters Samantha Alexander (left) and Tanisha Sorenson (right) were visibly relieved . She did not apologize to the Alexander family, saying only that 'now that a verdict has been rendered that they can find peace, or some semblance of peace.' When asked what she would do if she were to go back to the moment when she was standing by her car in the desert with her hands covered in Alexander's blood, she said that she would drive directly to the Mesa, Arizona police department. In the courtroom, she repeatedly said that she did not know what she would have done. Though she has been separated from her original pod of cellmates, Arias said that she got a sense of how big the trial was getting when new inmates would enter the prison and seek her out. 'They want to shake my hand, they want to give me a hug. They want my autograph- I'm not going to sign anything,' she said. Arias was originally scheduled to speak to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren at 10pm on Wednesday, but now that she is on suicide watch, she may not be able to grant media requests. The jurors will reconvene tomorrow to begin the two-part process of deciding whether or not she will receive the death penalty.

Dog owners might have to tie up their pets to stop them attacking burglars, police have warned – amid growing controversy over a clampdown on dangerous animals. The Association of Chief Police Officers say planned amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act could leave householders 'liable to prosecution' if their dog bites a burglar while they are out. Ministers want to close a loophole in the law that makes it difficult to prosecute dog attacks that take place on private property. Planned amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act could leave householders 'liable to prosecution' if their dog bites a burglar while they are out, Acpo has said (file picture) The move – which will be included in next week's Queen's Speech – follows a string of attacks on children, postmen, and health visitors on private land. The proposals will include a defence for people whose dogs attack a burglar while they are at home. But critics warn the defence will not protect owners if a burglar is attacked while they are out, or if the attack takes place in the garden or an outbuilding. The loophole in the proposals will leave dog owners open to potential fines of up to £5,000 – or even a two-year jail sentence – if their pet attacks an intruder while they are not at home. Now Acpo, the organisation which represents senior police officers, has warned that the plans will favour burglars. In a letter to MPs they said the police 'would rather the householder was given a defence in law' to prevent prosecution if a dog attacks a burglar while they are out. Concern: Acpo's central London headquarters, in Victoria Street, near New Scotland Yard . They added: 'The consequences would be . that any individual leaving their dog in their home whilst they go out . may be liable to prosecution should their home be burgled whilst they . are away. We are confident that this is not what the Government had in . mind.' The Dogs Trust has also criticised the proposals, saying: 'If a trespasser is on private land it is nonsensical to criminalise a dog owner if that trespasser should be injured by the dog. 'Surely a trespasser must take some responsibility for their unlawful actions. Dog owners should only face criminal liability if the victim is present lawfully.' Government officials have confirmed that homeowners would not be immune from prosecution if a 'dangerously out of control' dog attacked a burglar in their home. But the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said ministers were still looking at ways to ensure dog owners would not be penalised for being burgled.","Association of Chief Police Officers say householders could be .

Downs near St Austell. Yesterday Cornwall coroner Dr Emma . Carlyon recorded unlawful killing verdicts at an inquest held in Truro . to settle unanswered questions about exactly how the men were killed and . their bodies disposed of. David Griffiths, . 35, (right) and former boxer Brett Flournoy, 31, (left) were shot dead on a remote farm in Cornwall . in June 2011. An inquest has heard they were killed unlawfully . The bodies of Flournoy, 31, from The . Wirral, and Griffiths, from Berkshire, were unearthed by police after . Stone confessed to having disposed of the corpses. Today's inquest heard father-of-three Griffiths, and pro boxer Flournoy were killed with a 12-bore shotgun by Haigh. Former cage fighter Thomas Haigh, 26, was jailed last year for a minimum of 35 years for shooting dead the men . His 'thick' accomplice Ross Stone, 26, then stuffed the bodies into a Citroen Berlingo, set it alight and buried the vehicle in a pit at the farm where he worked, it was said. The inquest heard the two victims worked for an IRA gang that ran Liverpool’s illegal drugs trade and Haigh and Stone owed them £40,000. The dealers wanted Haigh to pay them back by travelling to Brazil to bring back cocaine. But when Flournoy and Griffiths arrived at Stone’s farm on June 16, 2011, Haigh blasted them with a shotgun. Haigh and Stone tried to cover their tracks with the DIY cremation but Stone later told officers where the charred remains were buried. Despite their convictions, an inquest attempted to resolve unanswered questions about how Griffiths and Flournoy died and exactly how their bodies were destroyed. Detective Constable Steve Hambly of Devon and Cornwall Police told the hearing the pair were shot in the back and the face. DC Hambly said: 'I believe Brett Flournoy suffered one shot to his back and this shot proved fatal. It may have taken place close to the farmhouse. 'I believe that David Griffiths suffered a fatal shot to his right shoulder and on the side of his face. 'There is no evidence that they survived past June 16, 2011 or that a third person was connected to the murders. 'In my opinion, the deaths of these two men resulted in a fall out whilst the four of them were involved in a global enterprise - a drugs supply.' During his trial it emerged Stone, who lived at the farm where he worked as a digger driver, had links with large-scale suppliers in Merseyside. He would buy cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy before selling them on locally but trouble began when drugs worth £40,000 went missing from his home. Inferno: The Citroen Berlingo van in which the two men were torched . The excavated site where the burned-out van was buried by accomplice Ross Stone, who worked at the farm . Stone admitted burning the men's bodies and burying them in a huge pit at Sunny Corner farm at Trenance Downs in Cornwall .

The inquest attempted to resolve unanswered . questions about how they died and exactly how their . bodies were destroyed . The drugs disappeared but the dealers . who had supplied them, Flournoy and Griffiths, still wanted their money . and went to the farm. Flournoy, of Bebington on the Wirral, Merseyside, and Griffiths, 35, from Bracknell, Berkshire, were then shot by Haigh. Gunned down: Brett Flournoy was killed by Haigh, who wanted him to travel to Brazil to bring back cocaine . His . trial later heard Haigh had been placed at the farm as a lodger by the . two gang members to keep an eye on 'thick Cornish farmer' Stone. But Haigh killed them with a shotgun and Stone then scooped the two corpses into a wheelbarrow before using heavy machinery to dig a massive grave, the inquest heard. He then put the pair in their van and set it alight before rolling it into the pit and later covering it over. Stone later admitted 'tidying up' afterwards - including dumping the shotgun and blotting up pools of blood in the farm lane using cement powder. The makeshift grave went undiscovered for several weeks until Stone was arrested on an unrelated drugs charge. He confessed to helping destroy the bodies but denied taking part in the shootings. Haigh, of Huddersfield, fled back to Yorkshire before eventually handing himself in. Coroner Emma Carlyon said: 'Brett Flournoy and David Griffiths travelled to Cornwall to visit Sunny Corner at Trenance Downs near St Austell. 'This was with the view to commit criminal or drug activities. The remains of their bodies was located in their badly burnt vehicle, a Citroen Berlingo van which was buried in a pit on the grounds of Sunny Corner. 'Other bone fragments of the men were found close to the van. The two men were shot with a gun, not recovered, and buried in their van which was burnt.'

A woman has filed a law suit against five people she claims secretly filmed her having a sexual encounter with a Buddhist monk at the temple they both attend before leaking it to the community. Maya Men claims community member violated her right to privacy when they allegedly spread the tape of her and the Venerable Nhem Kimteng - even uploading it to YouTube briefly. It is unclear when the video was recorded at Trairatanaram Temple in North Chelmsford, Massachusetts, but Men said she had not given permission for it to be filmed or distributed. Members of the close-knit Cambodian community in Lowell have said they are disgusted by the video's . contents as Buddhist monks are supposed to be celibate. Lawsuit: Maya Men, left, is suing five community members after they allegedly leaked a secretly-filmed tape of her having a sexual encounter with the Venerable Nhem Kimteng, right, a monk at her temple . The lawsuit, filed in Middlesex Superior Court, states the defendants' actions intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Men, the Lowell Sun reported. She feels she 'has been held up to her relevant community as an individual who should be shunned and scorned, called a thief, and referred to by a plethora of pejorative terms', the suit states. The lawsuit seeks damages and seizure of all copies of the recording. The suit names Cheng Leang, a monk and a member of the board of the Community of Khmer Buddhist Monks - on which Kimteng and Men both sat until he was dismissed after the tape surfaced. Sam Meas, a CKBM executive committee . member who was dismissed last year after asking for an audit of the . project's finances, is also named. Scene: The sexual encounter took place at the Trairatanaram Temple in North Chelmsford, Massachusetts . 'Illegal': Men claimed that she did not give permission to be filmed or for the tape to be shared . It also names other community members Sovann Khon, Lee Veng Chou and Denys Meung. In the suit, Men argues that she never gave consent for her private sexual acts to be disclosed, and . says both the video and a recent email about her are evidence of illegal . action. The email said that the sex video was . secretly recorded by the Venerable Leang and accuses Men of 'using . her sex life to take control of all top-level monks', the Lowell Sun reported. The accusations have roiled the region's Cambodian community, with many now skeptical of the internal workings of the temple, as Men was helping lead an effort to raise money for a new building. Until he was removed, Kimteng was also a member of the executive committee for the $10 million Lowell temple project. Sued: The Venerable Cheng Leang, left, and Sam Meas, right, who works for a Buddhist fundraising charity . The community has held meetings and rallies to speak out about the relationship, and have called for Men to be dismissed from her role in the fundraising project. They have expressed their surprise that the head monk of the CKBM, Venerable Sao Khon, has dismissed Kimteng but not Men. Lowell City Councilor Vesna Nuon, who has urged Khon to dismiss Men, attended the rally. 'The community is being destroyed by the two individuals in the tape,' he said. 'The fact that the lady is still there is angering the community and there is agreement on what the head monk should do. 'It outraged all of us and hurt all of us. It is also embarrassing for all of us and cannot be tolerated.' Backlash: The community is calling for Men to be dismissed from the committee where she oversees a $10 million project for a new Buddhist temple. Kimteng has already been dismissed . Rithy Uong, a former Lowell city councilor, added: 'It is one of the worst things a Buddhist can do. We cannot believe it happened. It discredits the entire Cambodian and Buddhist community.' In the statement released to the Lowell Sun, the CKBM says it has begun an internal investigation into the allegations of sexual misconduct. While Kimteng and Men both deny being in the tape, The Sun reported that it received a DVD of the video and independently confirmed it did feature the pair.","Maya Men claims 5 people 'intentionally inflicted emotional distress'

Also appearing with the torch today was Kirsty Gallacher who ran with the flame in Wigan, despite having no discernible link with the area. The 13th day of the Olympic torch . relay began in Stoke-on-Trent, where Stoke City manager Tony Pulis was . the first torchbearer of the day. The torch also visited Tatton Park in . Knutsford, Cheshire, where Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne . was photographed standing next to torchbearer Michael Dooling. Its 107.95 miles journey through the . North West of England today will end in Bolton, where it will be carried . by world light-welterweight champion and Olympic silver medallist Amir . Khan. Yesterday, . before arriving in Broseley, Shropshire, the torch was taken to another Shropshire . town credited as the birthplace of the Modern Games. It was paraded in Much Wenlock before the house of Dr William Penny Brookes, the creator in 1850 of the Wenlock Olympian Games. The . small market town's direct links to the modern Olympics date back to . 1890, when International Olympic Committee founder Baron Pierre de . Coubertin visited Wenlock to inquire about the town's games. De Coubertin confessed they were an important inspiration for the first Olympics of modern times, held in Athens in 1896. In . honour of Much Wenlock's contribution to the creation of the Olympics, . one of the two mascots at the London 2012 Games was named Wenlock. Among . the seven torchbearers who made their way through the crowded town . yesterday were Olympian archer Alison Williamson and 83-year-old cancer . survivor Ronald Miles. Local . historian Mr Miles, who is from nearby Telford, said of carrying the . torch: 'It is the best experience I ever had in my life. 'I . have had some wonderful experiences, I saw Her Majesty the Queen . married in 1947, I have been all over the world to 60 countries, but . nothing touches this today. 'What was really magic were the children, someone told them my name and they all chanted 'Ron, Ron' at the top of their voices. 'I shall never have something like it even if I live to 200, will I?' Mr . Miles said he had been training to carry the torch, and this had . allowed him to run for half of his 300-metre stretch with the flame. 'I'm quite fit despite having a major operation to remove a bowel cancer in January this year,' he added. Ms Williamson, who will become just . the third British athlete to compete in six Summer Olympics when she . takes part at London 2012, said: 'The Olympics might never have taken . place if Baron De Coubertin had not come to Wenlock and seen the games . that Dr William Penny Brookes had created himself. 'I . grew up in Shropshire, my archery club trained here in the winter and I . competed in the Wenlock games when I was 10, so I have a lot of . connections with the place.' The . 40-year-old's sixth participation in the Games will put her level with . fencer Bill Hoskyns and javelin thrower Tessa Sanderson in the number of . Olympic participations. Support: Cpl Furgusson described the chance to carry the Olympic torch as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'. He is pictured carrying it flanked by dozens of supporters . Proud moment: Khan is flanked by the customary group of Olympics officials as he continues his leg of the torch relay through the Lancashire town .

"She's finally free but her beau is nowhere to be seen . Mother-to-be looked sombre as she dealt the big day in court all alone . West has been in Paris since February . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:14 EST, 19 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:01 EST, 19 April 2013 . It's the day she's been dreaming of for so, so long. Finally, a judge was able to undo the mistake that was Kim Kardashian's 72 day marriage to Kris Humphries after 536 days of bitter negotiations. This means the 32-year-old will be able to give birth to her first child in July without still being married to Humphries, and therefore should be an extra special time for both her and the baby's father, beau Kanye West. So sad: Kim Kardashian should've been celebrating on Friday when she was finally rid of Kris Humphries, but her beau Kanye West has been in Paris since February . But on Friday, as a sad looking Kim dealt with the court date alone, as Kanye, 35, was nowhere to be seen. He's in Paris, and he has been since . fashion week, and while the two have flown back and forth to see one . another, it's baffling many people that they're spending so much time . apart. Especially when you'd expect a . superstar with a private jet to want to be at his partner's side for . such a big event in their lives. A spokesperson for Kim has yet to return Mail Online's request for comment. Kim cut a lonely figure in court and barely raised a smile when a judge granted her divorce. 'I think this is a reasonable way to resolve this case,' said Superior Court Judge Hank Goldberg, who did not disclose terms of the settlement. Humphries sent his lawyer but did not appear in court. Together but apart: Kim has been based in Los Angeles throughout her pregnancy while her boyfriend Kanye West has mostly been in Paris since February . 'Ms. Kardashian, is this your signature?' the judge asked her as he perused a three-page settlement agreement. 'Yes,' she replied. She continued to . answer yes when asked if she had discussed the matter with her lawyer . and understood that there would be no trial. 'During your marriage did irreconcilable differences occur?' the judge asked, 'no' she replied. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Kris told TMZ: Kris and his family are excited to move forward and are grateful for all the support they have received in this process."" The rep then sets the priorities straight:  ""His commitment to the Brooklyn Nets and the team's incredible fans is his number one priority and he is excited to head into the playoffs tomorrow with this situation behind him.' Swellagant: Kim looked lovely in a black shirt dress with pleated skirt as she arrived for her date with destiny . Sombre: Kim was classy enough to wear black and not look too pleased about the whole debacle . Where the magic happened: Kim learned at Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday that she's officially free of Humphries . But a sombre-looking Kim acquitted . herself well by refusing to revel in getting the verdict she wanted, and . looked stunning in a beautiful, suitably black fitted dress. It's been a dirty fight, with each camp going back and forth with tales of betrayal and deceit. A . source even claimed that Kris was the one who persuaded his estranged . wife to take the honeymoon trip to the Amalfi Coast in Italy. ‘Kris was the one to push for the . honeymoon. Kim didn’t want to go on the honeymoon because they were . scheduled to move to New York City to begin filming Kourtney & Kim . Take New York,’ a source told Radar Online. ‘Kim finally relented. Kris was . absolutely dumbfounded when a photographer appeared out of nowhere and . started taking pics of them by the pool,’ the source said. ‘Kim happily . posed, and Kris realised her camp had arranged it.’ Respectful: You could've expected Kim to do a little jig but she behaved with impressive decorum . Stylish: The court date mustered a delightful outfit from Kim . At her divorce deposition Kim . confessed that she was against going on the holiday, which Kris is . allegedly using as part of his case against the 32-year-old reality . star, claiming their marriage was fraud. On Wednesday Kim, who is pregnant with her first child, was seen looking somber as she arrived at a Los Angeles studio alone. Her . boyfriend Kanye West meanwhile has been based in Paris since Fashion . Week in February, with Kim regularly flying over to visit him. It's over! Kim is finally free of Kris after 536 days of dispute over their marriage . Over before it began: Kim and Kris called time on their marriage after 72 days but the divorce has taken much, much longer to sort . Oh Kim! Wearing a sexy camisole over jeans is probably one of Kim's worst maternity moments .

Mountaineer Steven Johnson's cause of death was confirmed on Thursday as 'mass envenomation'. The 55-year-old, a counselor with some 30 years experience hiking and climbing was found dead, hanging 70-feet from the ground in his climbing gear in the Santa Rita Mountains on Monday night, according to the sheriff's office. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office says 55-year-old Steven Johnson (pictured) was found in the Santa Rita Mountains south of Tucson late Monday . His dead dog was discovered at the top of . the cliff. Johnson was last seen on Friday when he went hiking, and friends became worried when he didn't go to work on Monday. A group of climbers and friends of Mr Johnson set out in a search party to look for him. After they came across his body, they worked late into the night to bring him down. One climber described the scene as 'tragic and horrifying'. His small dog was found at the top of the cliff covered in bee stings. Mr Johnson's friend buried his loyal pet on the mountain. Friend and fellow climber Jason Mullins told Azstarnet.com: 'Steve was a well-liked, long-standing, integral part of the Tucson climbing community. We're all saddened by the news. He'll be greatly missed.' Sheriff's Lt. Raoul Rodriguez says Johnson may have disturbed bees by hammering a spike into the cliff. Rodriguez of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office . said the 55-year-old man was found hanging from his climbing gear on a . cliff near Mount Hopkins . Search and rescue teams found both Johnson and his dog dead in the Santa Rita Mountains on Monday night . 'He had anchored himself to the wall as . he was going down so he was actually anchored and he must have been . attacked and was not able to climb back up or go back down,' said Rodriguez. Johnson is described as a father, climber and friend, who was well-liked throughout the climbing community in Southern Arizona. Deputies of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Department and its search and rescue unit found Johnson’s body Monday at 6.30pm. Killer bees have become a problem in the south west of the country, especially in cities like Phoenix and Tuscson which have programs to destroy them for public safety. However, despite their fearsome reputation, Dr May Berenbaum, a professor and department head at the University of Illinois' Department of Entomology and one of the country's leading bee experts said that public information is the key to limiting fatalities. 'When bees sting, it's always in defense. They're not cruising the neighborhood to make trouble,' said Berenbaum. 'They're not kamikaze, intent on their own destruction. They sting if they perceive a threat on their own home.' However, Berenbaum's description of an African bee attack to ABC News makes for disturbing reading. Once stung, the bee releases a pheromone that attracts other bees to attack - which is why most African bee attacks are in swarms.

Austerity chic fashion chain Primark and the budget supermarket Aldi yesterday revealed a sales boom as the cost of living squeeze shakes up the high street. Sales at Primark were up 24per cent for the first half of its financial year, helped enormously by the appeal of its £5 denim shorts and £3 crop tops to teen girls. While the figure at Aldi rose by 31.1per cent as middle income Britons traded down from major supermarkets in search of bargain wine, fresh coffee and even lobster. Sales soaring: Primark saw a 24 per cent growth in sales in the first half of this year. The news sent shares in the parent company soaring 8 per cent today . The longest squeeze on living standards in a century, with price rises outpacing increases in incomes, has triggered a radical shift in shopping habits. High streets are changing with the rise of the likes of Primark at the expense of established brands like Marks & Spencer and Next. At the same time, Aldi, Lidl, and Poundland together with pawn shops and payday loan firms are thriving. Primark’s skill has been in turning . around the latest catwalk fashions and celebrity trends and offering . budget versions in double-quick time. Sales of its tiny denim shorts and . cropped tops took off after being worn by the likes of American teen . singers Carly Rae Jepson and Taylor Swift. Now, virtually every teen girl in the . nation can be seen tottering around in similar outfits, regardless of . the rain and cold that have blighted the country. Its other recent best-sellers include £9 satchels, £10 maxi skirts and a jewel collar dress at just £13. Takings at the group during the first . half of its financial year, which ended in March, were up by 24per cent . to almost £2billion. This boosted profits by 55per cent to £238million. The group opened 15 stores during this . period, taking the total to 257, while it is expanding both in the UK . and overseas with plans for its first outlets in France. Primark is owned by the giant food . company, Associated British Foods, which owns famous brands such as . Kingsmill, Ryvita and Twinings, as well as British Sugar. It described the fashion chain’s . performance as ‘exceptionally strong’, saying it had helped the group to . post a 25per cent increase in its pre-tax profits, taking them to . £452million. Chic: Primark's summer range, which is on sale in shops, is set to be Latino inspired. They announced today that sales have been booming . Success: Consumers have turned to Primark as they face a squeeze on living standards - and move away from established brands like M&S . Chairman Charles Sinclair said: ‘The . Primark success story continues. Trading in the period was very strong, . the profit margin was much improved, customers in continental Europe . have taken enthusiastically to the Primark brand and there is very real . momentum in the addition of selling space.’ Primark’s figures are in sharp . contrast to M&S, where recent cold weather and weak consumer . spending drove clothing and general merchandise sales down 3.8per cent . in the first three months of the year. Sales at Aldi are up by a remarkable . 31.1per cent in a year, according to retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel. At the same time, the figure are German-owned rival, Lidl, rose by . 10.1per cent. Aldi is opening new outlets at the . rate of two a month as Britons develop an appetite for its range of . quality products at budget prices. Sales success: Aldi saw sales grow 31.1 per cent in the first three months of the year as budget-conscious shoppers turn away from the big four supermarkets . Budget supermarket success: A cheap bottle of Gin from Aldi was named one of the best ahead of established rivals in a blind taste test . It has based its advertising strategy . on a claim that it is able to offer the same quality as big brands for . the price supermarkets charge for value own-labels. At the same time the group has made a . conscious effort to attract middle income shoppers who have been forced . to cut down on household spending. Both Aldi and Lidl have a reputation . for selling high quality wine at low prices. Also added to the mix are . Aberdeen Angus steak, prize-winning champagne, freshly ground coffee, . olive oil and parmesan cheese. Both of these firms are now making a big effort to offer a wide range of fresh meat, vegetables and fruit. Edward Garner, director at Kantar . Worldpanel, said: ‘Aldi has set two records in the latest period, with . its highest ever growth of 31.1per cent delivering a record market share . of 3.4per cent. ‘Pressure on household budgets is . undoubtedly driving some of the growth at the discounters, but messages . about quality are starting to resonate. ‘Lidl announced this week that it will . increase its fresh meat and poultry floor space by 50per cent within . the year, and Aldi’s new ‘convenience’ store in Kilburn is a departure . from its traditional edge-of-town offering. ‘These changes are likely to appeal to . a new and different group of shoppers which will bolster the . performance of the discounters even further.’ At the other end of the scale, . Waitrose is also growing strongly with sales up 12per cent in a year. Its reputation for being careful about how it sources its food has won . customers as a result of the horsemeat scandal.

When dinnertime arrives on the sun-scorched savannah of Kenya's Maasai Mara, you either fight for your life or your livelihood... but it doesn't always go according to plan. As this incredible series of photographs show, there is one kind of free dinner that likes being free, and will fight hoof and tail to keep it that way. So when Malaika the cheetah tried to hunt down a young wildebeest, the plucky calf stood its ground and gave the predator a nasty surprise. Tables turned: As this incredible series of photographs show, there is one kind of free dinner that likes being free, and will fight hoof and tail to keep it that way . Charge: The cheetah dodges the wildebeest's horns as it lunges in the long grass . Easy target? The wildebeest calf was slightly slower than the rest of the adult wildebeest and looked like an easy target . The images, taken by British photographer Manoj Shah, show the wildebeest fought back sending the cheetah running from its horns. The cheetah - named Malaika by local guides - had been tracked for several days by Manoj's party studying her hunting habits. Manoj said: 'The cheetah mother Malaika had to hunt every day or two to feed herself and the fast growing cub. 'I was taking her pictures as she was . seated with the cub on a termite mound. By being on top of the mound the . cheetah could scan the vast savanna grassland and easily spot any prey. Attack: Moving at top speed, the cheetah caught up with the wildebeest calf and put her front two feet on the wildebeests back, trying to bring it down . Hanging on: She tried to hold on to the wildebeest as it thrashed about trying to break free . Ferocious: The young wildebeest turns, dips its horns and charges at the unsuspecting cheetah in a last-ditch bid to save its own life . 'This was necessary because the grass . was taller than the cheetah's height and therefore she had to be taller . than the grass by climbing on top of a mound. 'While . on the mound, the cheetah - with a much more powerful eyesight than . humans - noticed a line of wildebeest moving across the grassland. I was . using binoculars all the time. 'She . quickly left the cub on the mound and started walking fast to the line . of the wildebeest. Her walk turned into a fast sprint at at approximate . distance of 100 metres from the wildebeest group.' Tussle: An almighty tussle broke out between the two as the wildebeest fought for its life and the cheetah its livelihood . Wild frenzy: The pair circled each other, locked in battle, as - for a brief moment - the hunted became the hunter . Victory: Incredibly, the cheetah ends up giving up the chase and running away . Manoj said the cheetah quickly singled out a potential target. He said: 'Cheetahs are known to reach a speed of about 100 kmph in a few seconds. 'The wildebeest started running on . spotting the fast encroaching cheetah. The wildebeest calf was slightly . slower than the rest of the adult wildebeest and became an easy target.

Majestic: Shah was taking her pictures as she was seated with the cub on a termite mound. By being on top of the mound the cheetah could scan the vast savanna grassland and easily spot any prey . 'But the wildebeest calf was brave and a strong fighter. It could not be brought down but instead it turned to face the cheetah, throwing off the cheetah on the ground. 'The wildebeest calf then charged with its horns and the scared the cheetah ran off. Being at a slight disadvantage the cheetah did not want to get injured as her cub was totally dependent on her hunting skills.

Big fan: Maureen Oleskiewicz, 28, was a huge fan of all the Chicago sports teams and even encouraged her students to dress like their favourite players in class occasionally . Ballpark staff and onsite EMTs responded before she was taken to hospital. Oleskiewicz an avid fan of Chicago sports. She even held school days where students would dress up in support of local teams, including the Cubs, Blackhawks and Bears. She and her brother Martin, were enjoying a pre-game lunch when she caught him off-guard by what at first seemed like an attempt at humor, their mother told the Chicago Sun Times. Quickly, though, Martin Oleskiewicz realized his sister was in grave danger as she fell to the floor choking. 'There were no signs she was in distress. She just went down,' said Martin, 23. All he could do was stand by, helplessly, as a nurse in the crowd and EMTs performed chest compressions on his sister. 'They were saying she didn't have a pulse. It felt hopeless,' he told the Chicago Tribune. Tragic: Maureen Oleskiewicz, 28, choked on a hot dog before Sunday's baseball game at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Her brother Martin, 23, who was with her at the time had no idea what was wrong . He and the others providing aid didn't know she had choked on a hot dog and was unable to breathe. 'They're sitting there eating lunch before the game, looking at the field and the next thing she's on the floor. He didn't even know she was in distress and then she's on the floor.' Oleskiewicz went into cardiac arrest and never recovered, despite efforts to revive her. Stunned: The death shocked the Chicago Cubs baseball teak and the boys and girls in 6th & 7th great at her school . Margaret said the most terrifying part was that her young daughter was otherwise healthy. Martin said she never made any noise or grabbed her throat before she fell over. 'I think it happened about 1:00, it was just before the game started. Matter of fact, I remembered seeing them give her CPR while the National Anthem was playing,' eyewitness Brent Olson said. 'You could see everyone rushing up to the top of the seating with a frantic look on their face. They performed CPR like I've never seen,' he said. She was kept alive until yesterday in order for doctors could harvest her organs for donation.The incident happened before the game started. She was given CPR at the field and then transported by ambulance to Illinois Masonic but she recovered. News of Oleskiewicz's death stunned the community at Independence Junior High, where the popular teacher and former student taught 6th and 7th grade language arts. Her school Superintendent, Kathleen Casey, wrote a letter to parents 'There is no magic wand to fix what we cannot comprehend, Maureen had a positive impact on countless students, parents and colleagues. Her vibrant, positive outlook on life and her joyful nature will be missed more than words can convey.' The Chicago Cubs issued a statement today: 'The Chicago Cubs are saddened to hear news of the untimely death of Maureen Oleskiewicz. We express our deepest sympathy to her family and friends. We will continue to keep her family in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.' Maureen's mother said she was told her daughter's 'big, giving heart' will go to a 14-year-old girl in desperate need of one. 'Even in death she was so kind and good,' Margaret Oleskiewicz said.","28-year-old teacher was eating with her brother on Sunday lunchtime .

A man due to stand trial for murder has escaped one of Russia’s most notorious prisons using a spoon and his bed sheets. Oleg Topalov, 32, accused of two counts of murder and illegal possession of firearms, broke out of maximum-security Matrosskaya Tishina jail in the early hours of Tuesday. Topalov, described as ‘mentally abnormal’ by prison staff, used a tablespoon to carve a hole into the ceiling of his cell at the Moscow prison and escaped through the ventilation vent, investigators said today. Daring escape: Oleg Topalov, due to stand trial for two counts of murder, escaped from the maximum security unit using a spoon and some bedsheets . Topalov is the fourth man in 20 years to escape from the infamous prison, and the first to break out of a detention centre in the Russian capital in 12 years. Guards at Matrosskaya Tishina discovered that Topalov was missing from the eight-person cell  around 5am Tuesday morning. 'It was established that Oleg Topalov used a spoon to scrape away the cement and brickwork from the wall of the ventilation shaft in his cell,' an investigator told Interfax. Matrosskaya Tishina opened in 1918 and although it has a reputation as one of the worst prisons in Russia, it is in desperate need of building maintenance, something which authorities say made it easy for Topalov to dig himself out. High security: Topalov is the fourth man in 20 years to escape from the infamous Matrosskaya Tishina prison, located in northern Moscow . ‘Because of the building being run-down, Topalov had no difficulty in widening the vent of the air-shaft, through which he got to the prison’s roof,’ Russian Federal Penitentiary Service representative Kristina Belousova told RIA Novosti. The escapee then jumped from the building’s roof into a neighbouring block before lowering himself to the ground using a rope he made from bed sheets. Moscow police have mobilised an extensive search, offering a ‘large reward’ for information which could lead to the capture of Topalov, from Sochi near the Georgian border. Topalov was due to appear in court accused of two counts of murder and illegal possession of firearms, and had been held on remand at Matrosskaya Tishina for a year-and-a-half before his escape.","Oleg Topalov, 32, escape from Moscow's infamous Matrosskaya Tishina jail .

Simon Couzens took out a claim against airline Ryanair after he found that he was paying £444 more than his European counterparts . Millions of British Ryanair customers could be entitled to refunds after a passenger won a fight for compensation which the company tried to hush up. The budget airline has been accused of charging Britons more than passengers booking flights in other countries – and has tacitly conceded the anomaly by repaying Simon Couzens more than £400. They handed over the money rather than face a race discrimination claim by the London-based classical musician. And a snapshot survey yesterday revealed the price difference applies to several other Ryanair routes. Now a consumer group has said other UK customers of the airline, which carries 80million people a year, may be eligible for refunds. Mr Couzens was alerted to the discrepancy when he paid £2,378.32 for seven return tickets between Stansted and Croatia for a family holiday this summer. He discovered that Ryanair customers booking from Croatia would have paid the same headline price, but in euros. Using the exchange rate at the time he made the purchase, which was £1 to 1.23 euros, continental customers would have paid £1,933.59 – a difference of £444.73. After failing to get a satisfactory explanation for the mark-up, Mr Couzens found he could bring a case of indirect race discrimination through Ireland’s Equality Tribunal. However before it could consider the complaint, the airline called him and agreed to settle. A follow-up letter offered to refund the difference between the ticket prices if he abandoned the case. The letter said that the deal was ‘strictly subject to you agreeing to keep the settlement confidential’. Mr Couzens did not agree to the gagging order, but Ryanair has paid the money in to his account. Mr Couzens, from Finsbury Park, north London, said: ‘British travellers are paying considerably more for the same trip. It is not as if it is a greater distance or they need to use more fuel. I have a feeling they responded because they were in a sticky situation. I would like to see them refund everyone. I don’t think they should charge different rates to different people.’ Ryanair have settled with Mr Couzen's by paying him compensation rather than go to court . Marc Gander, from the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘Ryanair is notoriously careful about money so if they think it was worth paying to gag the story, then it must be worth consumers getting claim letters in the post as soon as they can. ‘A little windfall in these difficult times would never be unwelcome.’ A spokesman for the airline said: ‘Passengers pay for flights in the currency their flight departs from.’","Simon Couzens brought accused Ryanair of indirect race discrimination .

This adorable family dog narrowly escaped death after eating cocktail sausages that had been deliberately stuffed with inch-long nails by sadistic animal-haters. Meggie became the victim of a recent spate of barbaric attacks aimed at dogs, which has seen meaty treats laced with nails and then scattered in the path of unsuspecting pets. Meggie, an eight-year-old Bernese mountain dog, had to undergo emergency surgery after swallowing the potentially deadly sausages that were left lying in the garden of her home in Elgin, Scotland. Victim: Family pet Meggie needed life-saving emergency surgery after gobbling down sausages that had been deliberately laced with nails . Narrow escape: The sausages eaten by the Bernese mountain dog in Elgin, Moray, had been spiked with nails, similar to those seen in this mocked-up image . Meggie is thought to have eaten five of the sausages, and another three were found lying in the garden. The dog was rushed to a vet where X-ray scans revealed 10 inch-long nails in her stomach. Her owner, a young mother who does not want to be named due to her fear of reprisals, said: 'We are shocked at the level some people go to. 'The sausages must have been planted overnight. There was a gardener in on Thursday trimming the grass so it must have been after that. 'I found three other sausages. She's had five, so there must have been eight or nine in total,' the woman added. Heartless: Meggie, seen left after undergoing surgery, could have died as a result of the cruel set-up . Cruel: The meaty treats were left in the garden of the home in Elgin, Moray, where Meggie lives with her owner - a young mother who has asked not to be named because she fears reprisals . After undergoing surgery - at a cost of £990 - Meggie was kept at the vets overnight for observation before returning home to Elgin, Moray, where she is recovering from her ordeal. Police are investigating the incident, which they believe was a deliberate attempt to harm Meggie. In January horrified dog-walkers spotted around 40 cocktail sausages embedded with nails that had been left lying around a park in Abergavenny, South Wales. The sausages - some of which had as many as ten inch-long nails inside - were removed before they could cause any harm, but local vets said they would almost certainly have proved fatal should a dog have eaten them. A spokesman for anti-cruelty group Peta, which offered a £1,000 reward to try and help catch the culprits, said there was 'no way this can be anything other than the intention to kill animals'. Investigation: Police believe the cruel ploy was a deliberate attempt to kill Meggie, a Bernese mountain dog . Trusting: The eight-year-old dog is believed to have eaten five of the sausages that were stuffed with nails . A dog-walker who noticed the lethal sausages as he walked his pet in the park said he was aware of previous incidents involving shards of broken glass being inserted into treats. 'I have been extra diligent while out walking my dogs since as I believe it would have caused a slow death in the animal,' the man said at the time.","Family pet ate laced sausages left in garden of her home in Scotland .

Just as humans make a noise as they desperately try to gulp air, living trees make ultrasonic popping noises as they draw in as much moisture as possible to survive during a drought. The sounds are a hundred times faster than can be heard by the human ear, but a team led by French physicist Philippe Marmottant at Grenoble University believe they have been able to slow the process down sufficiently to be heard during a recent lab experiment. Researchers used slivers of dead pine wood covered in hydrogel to recreate the conditions of a living tree . Using slivers of dead pine tree wood bathed in hydrogel, they recreated the conditions of a living tree. The gel was then exposed to an artificially dry environment, and the researchers listened in as the wood began to make popping sounds. The noise comes from air bubbles rising up and then disappearing, a process called cavitation. As leaves on a tree collect carbon dioxide, they open their pores, leaving them vulnerable to losing water. To counteract this, trees collect water from the ground through their root system. The effort of trying to pull this moisture in from the ground creates the air bubbles. 'We can track the articulation of . bubbles, and what we found is the majority of the sounds that we hear . are linked to bubbles,' said Mr Marmottant. The trees create air bubbles through the effort of trying to pull in water from the ground through their root system . 'I say majority, because there may be . other causes like cracks in the wood or insects. But the majority of . sounds that occur during cavitations (tiny air bubbles that pop out in . the water) are due to these bubbles.' Scientists are now racing to try and come up with equipment capable of listening to these unique sounds created by nature. It will also prove useful because these air bubbles can block the flow of water in living trees and prove deadly. Mr Marmottant said he is in early discussions with biologists to produce a sensor.'These biologists have good experience to do this, so we hope that our study will bring some new information about the sounds that could be heard in trees,' he said.","Noise created by air bubbles as they try to draw in water during drought .

Ayanle Adan, 26, of Southend-on-Sea, Essex, was sentenced to at least 26 years in prison after he launched a surprise attack on Hanad Osman, 24, after buying two knives from a Sainsbury’s store. Mr Osman, who was looking at his phone, suffered an 8in gash to his neck and bled to death at the scene in front of shocked customers at the Waaberi Business Centre in Streatham, south London. Killer: Ayanle Adan (left), 26, of Southend-on-Sea, Essex, was sentenced to at least 26 years in prison after he launched a surprise attack on Hanad Osman (right), 24, after buying two knives from a Sainsbury’s store . Adan then used a ‘double slashing motion’ with a knife in each hand to cause ‘partial decapitation’ of Mr Osman’s head at the café, which is a meeting place for Somalians and other khat users. The killer who has 18 previous convictions for 26 offences ranging from assault to vehicle taking - claimed he was only trying to ‘scare’ Hanad after the victim threatened him with a knife. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with the Recorder of London, Judge Brian Barker QC, telling him: ‘This was described by one of the officers as a partial decapitation. ‘The real background to this killing may never fully emerge. For reasons beyond the understanding of the court you initiated a surprise attack when you were in no danger. ‘This was a planned killing. It was done in front of others and was totally unacceptable. It was a waste of a young life and no doubt his family have been severely affected by his death. ‘On any view you have been leading a life of crime. This behaviour in public displays a complete disregard for human life and outrages and horrifies the community who have come to hear about it.’ Adan, who was addicted to khat, was one . of many young men who gathered at the Waaberi Business Centre to use the . plant, which gives users a feeling of euphoria when chewed.

Adan and his friend Ahmed Hassan headed first to Morrison’s supermarket to look at scissors before walking down the road to Sainsbury’s. They selected two knives, which were paid for by Hassan, and then got a lift back to the Waaberi Business Centre in an Audi Q7. At 7.12pm Adan got out of the car and walked straight through the gate to the yard where Mr Osman was sitting. The blow severed the exterior jugular . vein and cut into the very top of the spine, leaving an 8in wound . stretching from the middle of the neck to the left side of the mouth. 'This was a planned killing. It was done in front of others and was totally unacceptable. It was a waste of a young life and no doubt his family have been severely affected by his death' Recorder of London, Judge Brian Barker . Adan also swung with the second knife in his left hand but missed. Adan and Hassan fled to a ‘safe house’ in Stratford, east London, where they were arrested three days later. Adan made no comment but Hassan told officers: ‘I was there but I didn’t do anything.’ Hassan was said to be jointly responsible for the murder because he bought the knives and went back to the scene with Adan even though he did not physically take part in the attack. The jury cleared Hassan of both murder and manslaughter and he walked free from court. Adan and Hassan both denied murder. Legal drug: Khat is a leafy stimulant that gives you a mild ecstasy or amphetamine-like high . Khat is a leafy stimulant grown in East Africa and Yemen that gives you a mild ecstasy or amphetamine-like high for as long as you chew it. For centuries, Christian hermits in the mountains of Ethiopia called it the ‘food of the pious’, using it to suppress sleep and hunger while they sat up all night studying the Bible. Nineteenth-century explorer Sir Richard Burton believed khat was the plant of the Lotos eaters in Homer’s Odyssey. The Netherlands, famously liberal in its attitude towards drugs, is the latest country to introduce a ban on khat. It is already illegal in most other European countries and Canada. In the U.S., khat is regarded as a narcotic ranked alongside heroin and cocaine. Convicted smugglers are given long jail sentences. But in Britain, the Government has relied on advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which has repeatedly held back from recommending a ban.

"The influential period Photoplay, which ceased in 1980, used a panel of industry experts to scrutinize actress' body proportions . By . Sadie Whitelocks . PUBLISHED: . 14:48 EST, 19 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:07 EST, 19 April 2013 . Winning proportions: Dolores Del Rio was voted as having the best figure in Hollywood in the 1931 issue of Photoplay magazine . Offering a fascinating insight into how the 'ideal' body type has changed over the years, a 1931 magazine debates which leading lady has the 'best figure in Hollywood'. Twenty-one women were selected by the influential period Photoplay, which ceased publication in 1980, with their statistics scrutinized by a panel of industry experts. Even their glove and wrist sizes were up for assessment. Overall the late Mexican movie star Delores Del Rio, then 26, was crowned winner - beating the likes of Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford with her 'warmly curved' silhouette. The actress, who famously had a love affair with Orson Welles ten years her junior, stood 5ft 4.5in tall and weighed 120lbs according to the article. Her bust measured 33in, her waist 25in and hips 36in. 'Her selection definitely establishes the superiority of the roundly turned, warmly curved figure . . . She is a far hail from the straight up and down type,' the magazine notes. Slate highlights that to a modern audience sensitive to body . issues, the magazine feature seems 'abhorrent' with women’s measurements being 'explicitly' assessed. However the perception of the ideal body type was shifting greatly at the time. During the Twenties, in the aftermath of World War I, a lean, flat-chested silhouette and generally androgynous appearance was in vogue. But by the early Thirties fashion slowly started gravitating towards a fuller and more feminine figure. 'The general notion of what is a good . figure no longer seems to be what [it] was a year or more ago when, . influenced by the unsound fad which glorifies boyish forms,' the . magazine continues. 'Mrs and Miss America survived on lamb chops and pineapple, oranges and lettuce.' The judging panel included Broadway producer Earl Carroll. He eliminated Swedish starlet Greta Garbo because he felt she was too slim. 'Backbones should not be social, protruding like clipped wings when low cut evening gowns are worn' 'He feels Greta should weigh more . than she does, be closer to the weight she was in Sweden before she . reduced to comply with our American picture ideals,' the editorial . states. In the end he made . his final choice from Marion Davies, Dolores Del Rio, Clara Bow and Bebe . Daniels - the ‘four girls who weigh the most for their height’. 'There is no sense of frailty about them. They are roundly turned. They are, in every instance, a far hail from any boyish form, and they are not the underdeveloped, adolescent type,' he explained, before selecting Del Rio as winner. Runners-up: (From left) Marion Davies . interested judges because of her 'well-developed' figure, Joan Crawford was rated high by one judge and Bebe Danies came very near to . being winner in the 'contest' Fellow judge Earl Christy, an American . artist who was responsible for many of the Photoplay front covers, also . expressed distaste for skinny women. ‘Backbones . . . should not be social, protruding like clipped wings when low cut evening gowns are worn,' he warned. 'They rob a women a that lovely, rounded look. They are reminders of the mechanism of the body, of joint fitting into joint. Joints of course are very important, but they function quite as efficiently unseen.' He immediately eliminated two girls from his list for this reason and three more because when they stood with their feet together 'daylight was visible between their knees.' In the end he plumped for the film and stage star Bebe Daniels for her 'glowing warmth' and 'lovely symmetry'. Vital statistics: This chart from a 1931 issue of Phototplay magazine reveals how Hollywood's leading ladies measured-up - it states that many went on 'starvation diets' to conform to 'American picture ideals' New York-based doctor AL Goldwater, also weighed in on the discussion. He wrote: 'I most earnestly hope that a star who has curves and looks as a women should look will be granted as having Hollywood's best figure. 'There was something in that old rumor about men preferring a more curved figure than women feel ideal' 'I know the tremendous influence the screen exerts on modern life. And I am a little dismayed by the number of girls and young women who come to my office suffering from anemia and low blood pressure. Too often their ailments can be traced to ill-advised and strenuous dieting.’ Like Carroll he picked Del Rio as the star with the best body. But going against the general verdict, the only female judge, famed dressmaker Hattie Carnegie, opted for the slimmer actress Constance Bennett. 'Miss Bennett is a trifle slim . perhaps, but to my mind, she more than atones for this but her carriage . and by the way her head is placed on her gracious shoulders,' the late . fashion expert said. Controversial: The March 1931 issue of Photoplay asked which leading lady had the 'best figure in Hollywood' 'It looks as if there was something in that old rumor about men preferring a more curved figure than women feel ideal,' the magazine followed. In the end Del Rio, who was away from the acting scene at the time due to a kidney infection, was voted as having the best figure in Hollywood with 13 points. Bebe Daniels was runner-up. The magazine concludes: 'Beauty is what it always has been and always will be, the result of health.' The article came from the March 1931 issue of Photoplay, the premier film fan magazine of Hollywood from its 1911 founding through the 1950s.","The influential period Photoplay, which ceased in 1980, used a panel of industry experts to scrutinize actress' body proportions ."

British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford faces an agonising wait of up to 18 weeks before she learns whether a new appeal against her death sentence has been successful. The day after Britain's Court of Appeal ruled the UK government was not obliged to pay for an 'adequate lawyer' for her in Bali, a local solicitor has agreed to continue fighting for her without charge - for now. Fadillah Agus said today that he had lodged a last-ditch appeal to Indonesia's highest authority, the Supreme Court. He added that he hoped that friends and supporters would be able to find the £8,000 she needs to cover his fees. Running out of options: Lindsay Sandiford sits in her cell knitting while on death row in Kerobokan prison, Bali. Her lawyer has lodged a last-ditch appeal against her death sentence to Indonesia's Supreme Court . Sandiford, 56, from Cheltenham - who was condemned to death for carrying £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali last year - has already lost one appeal to a lower court and her options are now running out. With a second appeal now formally lodged by Mr Agus, he has 14 days to submit to the Supreme Court the actual grounds of her appeal against death. Sandiford will then have to wait for up to 18 weeks before the Supreme Court judges announce whether she has been successful. Should she lose again, her lawyer can ask force a judicial review and should that fail only a plea for mercy to the President would be able to save the grandmother from the firing squad. The Foreign Office has refused to pay for Sandiford's fight through the Indonesian courts as a matter of policy. Officials say that paying her fees would open the floodgates for all other Britons in trouble with the law overseas. Lord Dyson, sitting with two other judges at the Court of Appeal yesterday, said the court had given 'very careful consideration' to the issues raised in what he described as a 'troubling' case. He said the reasons for the judgment would be given 'as soon as possible'. The Strand façade of the Royal Courts of Justice: Yesterday three judges at the Court of Appeal said ruled that the UK government was not obliged to pay for an 'adequate lawyer' for Sandiford in Bali . Lord Dyson, when announcing the decision to dismiss the appeal, said it was 'obviously a terribly serious matter'. He said it was 'most unfortunate' that the sum required to secure the representation sought by the appellant - roughly £6,000 - was 'relatively speaking' a 'very small sum indeed'. The judge added: 'But that cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. 'But it may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum in the course of the next few days.' Mr Agus has agreed to fight on without payment but admits he hopes Sandiford's friends can come up with the further £6,000 to add to the £2,000 they have managed to club together. 'I lodged an official notification to appeal to the Supreme Court through the district court Denpasar (Bali's capital)', he said today. The lack of money, he said, 'will not change my position to defend Lindsay because I don't defend her only for the money.' Sandiford during her trial last October: In an open letter before the British court handed down its ruling, Mrs Sandiford said she hoped lessons would be learned if she was eventually put to death . He hit out at the British government's decision not to fund his client's case. 'I can't comprehend it,' he said. 'Even Indonesia tries to defend its citizens when they are facing serious problems overseas.' Mr Agus said the Supreme Court would consider the second appeal in a closed hearing and announce its decision at a later stage, which could be up to four months. In an open letter before the British court handed down its ruling, Sandiford said she hoped lessons would be learned if she was eventually put to death. 'If I should die - and I hope I don't, but I fear I may - then I hope that my execution will prompt the British government to do more for others,' she said.","Britain's Court of Appeal has ruled the UK doesn't have to pay her legal fees .

They said on one occasion they were going to kill me, and they threatened to burn peoples’ houses down. ‘I’m not talking about kids either, these were fully grown men behaving this way.’ The landowner, Noah Burton, who bought . the protected land for £100,000 from a farmer, planned to build park . homes on the site that he could sell off. He . has been acting as a spokesman for the travellers throughout the . dispute and said yesterday there were no winners in this battle. Barren land: An aerial shot of the village and the nearby field, which was turned into an illegal camp site, taken Monday shows the damage done by the travellers . In recovery: The travellers who lived on the site have been given one month to restore the land to its former green glory . Disarray: The travellers, the last of whom left on Sunday, have all but destroyed the greenbelt land in the Warwickshire village where they camped illegally for three years . Destruction: The plots used for the travellers caravans can still be seen on the field as well as mounds of ashes where they set fire to debris and a caravan before they left the site . Damage: The field, which has been occupied by travellers since April 2010, was left torn up by vehicles . Mr Burton said: ‘We have been left homeless and the residents have been left with the stigma of the gypsy site having been there. 'This was never about green belt land, it was only about not wanting gypsies on their doorsteps, they told me that many times.' He added: 'I can't tell you where the families have gone because many of them are forced to stop at the roadside now and the police have moved them on a few times already.’ West Midlands MEP Nikki Sinclaire, who . has supported the community throughout their struggle, said: ‘When I . first heard about this three years ago I saw a village in dismay, the . people were terrified about what was going to happen to this beautiful . part of the country. ‘I am thrilled these people have won, it just shows what you can do doesn’t it.’ Honoured: David McGrath, right, with Jo Hipwood, centre, and Maz Crawley, left, get emotional during the one minute's silence for the four protesters who passed away during their vigil .

In a final act of defiance, the travellers torched a caravan and left it burning at the entrance of the site before it was put out by firefighters on Sunday afternoon. Mavis Lapworth, 74, a retired bed and breakfast owner, who has lived in the village 17 years, said: ‘We are all delighted it’s over. This community is closer now than it ever has been before, and long may that continue. ‘The gypsies were rude, abusive and showed us no respect at all. ‘I have nothing against travellers, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy protected land. Jo Hipwood, 71, a retired caterer, . said: ‘I feel quite emotional really.

Guilty: MOD official Mark Scully found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman he offered to help after she missed her train station . A top Ministry of Defence executive has been  found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman after offering to find her a taxi home when she missed her train station. Mark Scully, 37, pretended to be helping the business woman, who had fallen asleep on a train from London Waterloo to Surrey after a night out, but instead launched an attack on her, punching her in the face and choking her. The married father-of-one, an assistant head of support for operations at the MoD, told concerned fellow passengers that he would escort the intoxicated 29-year-old to a cab at Woking station, but instead dragged her off the road. The victim told Guildford Crown Court how he held her by the throat and punched her in the eye, telling her not to struggle but to ‘enjoy it’ before she managed to escape. ‘To passengers on the train he appeared as a knight in shining armour,’ Ruby Selva, prosecuting, told the jury. Instead 6ft2in Scully, a high-ranking civil servant who advised Nato chiefs on reconstruction in Southern Afghanistan in 2009-10, guided the petite woman past the taxi rank at Woking Station and into a wooded area. The prosecutor alleged he took advantage of her intoxicated condition to over-power her, calling it a 'violent and predatory attack.' 'The defendant had earlier spied her on . the train - alone and vulnerable through drink - and had taken his . opportunity,’ said Ms Selva. The defendant, a former Territorial Army Captain and a qualified bomb disposal officer, from Pirbright, Surrey, throttled the woman and punched her in the eye to stop her struggling before penetrating with his fingers, the jury was told. After the violent incident at Greenheys Place, Woking, the battered and bruised complainant ran screaming and sobbing to a nearby house to get help. Scully consistently denied attempted rape and two offences of assault by penetration during the trial. He was acquitted of attempted rape and one attempt of assault by . penetration, but the jury found him guilty of one count of vaginal penetration. Ms . Selva told the court that the complainant was so desperate to get away that she left one of her earrings, her . mobile phone, one of her bags and her shoes at the scene of the attack. The court was told that the incident took place in the early hours of July 27 last year after the complainant, . caught a night train home from Waterloo intending to alight at . Weybridge. Assault: Scully attacked the 29-year-old business woman when pretending to help her get a taxi home from Woking Station in Surrey after she fell asleep on the train and missed her stop at Weybridge . Ms Selva said the victim had 'quite a lot to drink,’ and as a result fell asleep and missed her stop. When fellow passengers noticed the sleeping woman, Scully, . who had also been drinking with his Ministry of Defence colleagues, said that if others would . assist him in getting her off the train he would help her to get home. After . the train stopped at Woking the defendant asked fellow passengers where . she had intended to get off and someone said ‘Weybridge’, it was . claimed. Ms Selva said witnesses described Scully as calm and reassuring, as he escorted her off the station telling her: ‘Don't worry’. The complainant later told police: ‘I thought he was going to help me to get a taxi. I wouldn’t have trusted him otherwise’ But jurors heard that Scully guided her past a cab rank before bundling her into a wooded area, . The complainant said she was either pushed or thrown to the ground. She told police: ‘I remember being held by my throat and told not to struggle. I realised . that I had to stop fighting or I was going to die there.' The . vicitm told police she was struggling to stop the assault but the . defendant kept repeating ‘Just enjoy it. Just enjoy it.’ The victim lost her shoes during the attack and . sustained scratches from the undergrowth. ‘My head was all bumps,' she said. 'He punched me in the eye to keep me still.’ The victim told police that Scully began pleasuring himself, which gave her the opportunity to escape . ‘I got up and ran away crying and screaming’, she said. She reached a nearby house and woke up the occupant by exclaiming: ‘I've been raped!’ Attacker: Scully punched the woman in the eye and tried to strangle her while telling her to 'enjoy it' The occupant described the woman as 'very distraught and crying a lot,' adding that she had a black eye and scratches. ‘She was crying and dishevelled. Her eye continued to swell and there were red marks on her throat’. Ms Selva added that the victim was covered in scratches and had blood in her tangled hair. The court heard that Scully was traced to his home after having taken a taxi there - and was arrested. Jurors were told that the defendant told his wife Polly: ‘I met a woman on the train. Something happened between us and now she has alleged rape.’ He told detectives ‘I'm a bomb disposal officer.’ He said that he had escorted the woman out of Woking Station because he thought she lived nearby. ‘We bumped into each other and she started to kiss me,’ he said. Scully told police that he used his fingers to penetrate the victim, whom he described as ‘pretty,’ as part of consenting sexual activity, . Then ‘It dawned on him what was happening’ and he decided to stop - but he claimed that she wouldn't let him go and bit him on the finger. ‘I was practically imploring her to let me go,’ said Scully. He said he was left in agony after fighting to free his hand from her mouth - and lost one of his fingernails as a result. ‘It was really painful,’ Scully told the court. He denied pleasuring himself. ‘I was shaking my hand because it really hurt,’ he added. Scene: Scully dragged the woman into Greenheys Place near Woking station, where the attack took place in July last year . After the incident finished, he told the jury, he left the woman by herself and walked back to the Woking Station to get a taxi home. He said hefelt ashamed that he had got involved in a casual sexual encounter when he was a happily married man with a young son. Fighting back the tears, Scully todl the jury: ‘I'm extremely disappointed at the way I behaved that night. It was an extraordinary lowering of the standards I have. I really regret it.’ He added that he did not believe that the woman was hurt when he left her and he denied punching her. Ms Selva said that that the woman's flight from the scene and the injuries she sustained were a clear demonstration that what had happened had been against her will. The court was told that Scully, who graduated from Keele University in international relations, was an assistant head of a team of nine at the Ministry of Defence and in 2009/10 had been civil service advisor to a two-star army general in charge of 50,000 troops in Southern Afghanistan. He said his wife Polly worked for the Ministry of Defence and was on loan to the Cabinet Office. ‘She's 12 weeks pregnant and has been in court to support me throughout all this,’ added Scully. Scully, who had been suspended from his . position at the MOD pending the outcome of the trial could face up to . seven years, and will be sentenced Monday.","Mark Scully, 37, found guilty of attack on woman at Woking Station, Surrey .

The U.S. presidential election became the most-searched item and Kim Kardashian was the most-searched person on Yahoo in a year when online searches were dominated by big news stories and pop culture obsessions, the search engine company said on Monday. The search term 'election' topped the list of searches, led not only by extensive media coverage but also widening conversation on online social media platforms. The term 'political polls' was No. 8 of the top 10 searches of the year. Kim Kardashian was the most searched for person online, the latest survey from Yahoo has found . Source: Yahoo . 'The 2012 elections dominated the online searches, which is amazing because if something is in the news, it's already accessible ... people were really saturated by it, but even so, that was a key word that people typed throughout the year,' Vera Chan, Yahoo's web trend analyst, said in a conference call. Chan said only two other news stories have topped the list in the past decade, those being the death of Michael Jackson in 2009 and the BP oil spill in 2010. 'iPhone 5' came in at No. 2, which Chan said was interesting 'in a post-Steve Jobs era' because while Apple Inc's iPhone has featured regularly in the top searches since the first generation emerged in 2007, this was the first time a specific model had appeared high on the list. Reality star Kim Kardashian was the most-searched person on the website, coming in at No. 3 and leading six famous women in the top 10. Chan said Kardashian's 'notoriety has kept her at the top,' citing her ongoing divorce saga with ex-husband Kris Humphries, her high-profile relationship with rapper Kanye West and her E! channel reality shows. Sports Illustrated cover model Kate Upton, British royal Kate Middleton, late singer Whitney Houston, troubled former child star Lindsay Lohan and pop star and former ""American Idol"" judge Jennifer Lopez all featured in the top 10 after being in the news prominently throughout the year. Middleton, who was followed eagerly by fans and critics in her first year as a royal married to Britain's Prince William and being a staple at the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, also garnered the most-searched scandal of the year when a French magazine published photos of her topless. 'Olympics' came in at No. 7 on the list, as many turned to online media to watch and keep tabs on the global sporting event held in London during the summer. On Yahoo's separate list of top-searched obsessions, pop culture dominated this year, with 'The Hunger Games,' reality star Honey Boo Boo, erotic novel 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' British boy band One Direction, Carly Rae Jepsen's hit song 'Call Me Maybe' and Korean rapper Psy's 'Gangnam Style' featuring in the top 10.

As the powerful volcano grumbles beneath their feet, one brave couple refused to let their fear take over and captured these beautiful pictures of lava breaking through the surface. The eruption at the Plosky Tolbachik volcano on Kamchatka Peninsula, east Russia, saw a river of fiery lava flow down the mountain, underneath a bright full moon. These stunning pictures of the volcano were taken by daredevil bloggers Liudmila and Andrey. Scroll down for video .

The travelling pair were visiting the site with a group of volcanologist and what started out as a quiet lava flow, soon turned into an inferno. 'We had been standing up quietly, sipping vodka. Lava was flowing past calmly,’ Andrey told Siberian Times. ‘At some point I left to pick up my camera that was lying on the edge of the lava crater. I was just on time to see that it is filling with lava, while the lava stream in the canyon has almost dried out'. Andrey explained his concern to the team who told him not to worry, but they were soon forced to eat their own words.

Artist's impression: Anthony McCall had designed Column, a spiral of steam that should have risen up . The Arts Council was last night blasted for wasting £535,000 on a giant steam artwork - which ended up being nothing but hot air. Artist Anthony McCall had designed Column, a spiral of steam that should have risen more than six miles into the sky from a floating platform on the River Mersey in Wirral, Merseyside. Now, following huge amounts of National Lottery money being spent on the steam spiral project, the Arts Council has finally admitted defeat after 15 months of repeatedly failing to make it work. Wirral Metropolitan Borough councillor Jim Crabtree insisted yesterday that the project was ‘a complete and utter waste of public money’. He said: ‘They should have done their homework before committing £500,000, especially given what we've got going on today - people starving, we've got food banks all over the place. How many people could you feed with £500,000?’ The budget for Mr McCall's project was originally £500,000, including a £40,000 fee for the artist, but it subsequently rose by £35,410. None of the money will be recouped. The project was set to have run throughout last year as part of the Cultural Olympiad tie-in with London 2012. Column was originally due to launch in December 2011 and run for 12 months. The steam spiral was intended to have risen from East Float dock in Birkenhead and been visible for at least 62 miles on a clear day, becoming a ‘nationally and internationally recognised landmark’. Artist: Anthony McCall is known for using mist, light and projection to create ethereal 'sculptures' in mid-air . But it was repeatedly delayed. The Civil Aviation Authority was worried that it would interfere with aircraft and the Port Health Authority had concerns that it could cause Legionella. Vision: Mr McCall's working maquette of Column. The Arts Council has finally admitted defeat after repeatedly failing to make the full version work . However even after those fears were . allayed, the steam-generating mechanism did not work properly and the . column still did not appear. Such vertical steam spirals occur . occasionally in nature, when they are known as waterspouts, but nobody . has managed to recreate one on this scale by man-made means. The Arts Council yesterday rejected accusations that it was a waste of money. Arts Council England executive director . Laura Dyer said she was ‘disappointed’ that the artwork was scrapped but . there was always a risk in commissioning ground-breaking artworks. She added: ‘What became clear was that it just couldn't be done within the budget or the timescale. I think there comes a point where you have to say we really tried, we worked hard to realise it, but it can't be done. ‘It is a project that was visionary and testing new technical equipment. In the end it wasn't able to deliver the vision of the artist.’ The project was originally announced in 2009, when Arts Councils across the UK commissioned 12 works to coincide with the London 2012 Olympics. The other 11 Artists Taking the Lead commissions - ranging from a set of three crocheted lions in the East Midlands to a new football pitch created in a forest in the Scottish Borders - were all a success. Ms Dyer stressed that most of the money spent on Column had gone into the local economy. Anthony McCall, born in 1946, studied graphic design in Bromley, Kent, in the late 1960s before moving to America. There he began experimenting with light and cinema techniques but withdrew from creating art for 20 years until he restarted his 'solid light' series - using digital projections rather than 16mm film. She added: ‘The investment has been into the region. The final project, in all its magnificence, hasn't been realised, but it absolutely is not a waste of money.’ British-born and New York-based Mr McCall is known for using mist, light and projection to create ethereal ‘sculptures’ in mid-air. He said: ‘It is with profound disappointment that we have decided to draw our project to a close. ‘My team has worked long and hard but, due to the many regulatory and technical challenges, we have not been able to bring Column to completion.’","Anthony McCall had designed Column to rise into sky from River Mersey .

Mystery: Paulina Starczewska's body had been buried on a campsite in Landsmeer, outside Amsterdam . A suspected killer buried a woman’s body underneath his caravan and lived above the corpse for five months, an extradition hearing was told. Darius Majchrzak, 39, and his partner Samea Kubiak, 35, are accused of strangling Paulina Starczewska before hiding her body more than a decade ago. The couple, who now live in the West Midlands, were only linked to the unsolved killing after Kubiak confessed to police when they attended a domestic incident outside their home. She was flown to Holland and led officers to the body, which had been buried on a campsite in Landsmeer, outside Amsterdam. Kubiak claimed Majchrzak had strangled the victim to death after trying to sexually assault both women following a booze and drug-fuelled party. The couple had continued living at the campsite for another five months, despite the body being buried just yards away, she said. A judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court ordered Majchrzak should be extradited to the Netherlands to face a murder charge and an associated offence relating to unlawful burial. Kubiak, who also faces similar allegations, will learn whether she will be extradited today. The couple left the campsite for France shortly after the killing in early 2000, before settling in Dudley six years ago. Both were arrested in May after police were called to a domestic incident outside their home in Occupation Street, Dudley. Kubiak was initially treated as a witness but became a suspect after she returned to the UK, and was arrested by West Midlands Police on the request of Dutch authorities. Ordering Majchrzak’s extradition, District Judge Michael Snow said: ‘It is apparent that the Dutch authorities knew nothing about the murder of Ms Starczewska until Ms Kubiak reported it to the police in May 2012. ‘After contact between the Dutch and UK authorities, Ms Kubiak travelled to Holland where she identified the location of the body of Ms Starczewska.’ The extradition request was not an abuse of process and complied with the European Convention on Human Rights, he added. Majchrzak has seven days to appeal the decision and has been remanded in custody pending his removal to Holland.","Darius Majchrzak, 39, and his partner .

A mother tearfully appealed to the man who murdered her daughter to confess after a coroner today ruled she had met a ‘violent and unlawful’ death. Becky Godden-Edwards’s remains were found buried beneath farmland after taxi driver Christopher Halliwell marked out the spot to detectives. He had previously taken police to the body of Sian O’Callaghan who he had abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered after picking her up while she stumbled home from a nightclub. Battle for justice: Karen Edwards, left, has pleaded with convicted murderer Christopher Halliwell to confess to killing her daughter Becky Godden-Edwards, right, ten years ago . Still hope: Speaking after the inquest, Becky Godden-Edwards' father John said he is still looking for 'answers' But a judge ruled that although he pleaded guilty to Miss O’Callaghan’s murder, he could not be charged for killing Miss Godden-Edwards as investigating officers had breached his legal rights while arresting him. Today, Miss Godden-Edwards’s mother Karen wept as a coroner’s court heard how police archaeologists had only recovered partial skeletal remains. Speaking outside of court, Mrs Edwards said: ‘I would also like to appeal to Christopher Halliwell. 'This is your chance now, come clean, please, please, what have you got to lose? 'My personal opinion I don’t think he’s ever going to come out, so why not put everyone out of their misery?' ‘She is my daughter and I’m not going to give up until I get that conviction.’ Detailed CCTV pictures led detectives to Christopher Halliwell after his taxi was seen cruising the area where Miss O’Callaghan, 22, was last seen making her way home from a Swindon nightclub in March 2011. Fearing he was about to commit . suicide and Mrs O’Callaghan was being held captive, officers carried out . a controversial Urgent Interview – usually reserved for terrorism . suspects in cases where lives are at risk. Killer: Christopher Halliwell was jailed for the murder of 22-year-old office worker Sian O'Callaghan . Tributes and flowers were left at the crop field in East Leach, Gloucestershire where the body of Becky Godden Edwards was found by police . After Halliwell took them to the site . by the side of the road where Miss O’Callaghan’s naked body had been . dumped, he requested a meeting with Detective Superintendent Steve . Fulcher in which he offered to show him ‘another one’ in return for a . cigarette. Christopher Halliwell was jailed for life for the abduction, sexual assault and murder of Sian O'Callaghan last October . Detectives drove him to a remote crop . field in Eastleech, on the Oxfordshire border, where after using a . groove in a stone wall, he paced out to the spot when Miss . Godden-Edwards’ was buried. The 20-year-old was last seen in . Swindon shortly after Christmas 2002 and despite coming from a wealthy . family, had turned to prostitution after becoming addicted to drugs. Forensic experts believe she was killed shortly after her last sighting. Halliwell, 49, was initially charged . with both murders, but Mrs Justice Cox ruled that detectives had broken . the Police and Criminal Evidence Act that protects the legal rights of . those arrested. He eventually pleaded guilty to Miss . O’Callaghan’s murder after his DNA was found on her body and was . sentenced to life with a minimum of 25 years in October last year. Miss Godden-Edwards’s remains were . unable to provide forensic evidence and the coroner’s court heard that . her skull and hands were missing probably due to the field . being ploughed. Anguish: An inquest in Oxford heard how Becky Godden-Edwards met a 'violent and unlawful' death . As the field had only been disturbed once since 2003 and harvested one crop, the skeleton was not completely destroyed.

The young City worker, who had a position as a engineering manger at U.S. multinational General Electric, was ‘in the happiest time of his life,’ his parents told the Italian newspaper the Corriere della Sera. ‘When he was younger he was a little reckless but he had settled.' Both leave behind young children, although they were separated from their children’s mothers. Mr Schiatti returned from London every fortnight to see his five-year-old daughter, who lived with her mother in another apartment in his family's palazzo in central Milan. His relationship with the mother had ended but was said to be friendly and he saw his daughter regularly. ‘Forgive me for what I have done. I am desperate and without work' - Fabio Bernini . Meanwhile Mr Bernini, whom he had known his entire life, had been working as a salesman but had lost his job and was living with his parents outside Milan. He also had a child, a two-year-old son called Jacopo, who he left a suicide letter for. The poignant note asked for forgiveness and said he was sorry that he hadn’t been able to give him a proper family. ‘You won’t remember me anyway,’ he wrote. Another letter, for his mother, said he was 'desperate'. He wrote: ‘Forgive me for what I have done. ‘I am desperate and without work.’ The last person to see the two old friends alive had been Mr Schiatti’s brother-in law who had gone with the pair to see a football match between Inter Milan and Parma on Sunday afternoon. Mr Schiatti was supposed to return to London on Monday morning. But his mother raised the alarm when she hadn’t been able to reach him since Sunday night. Finding the apartment locked from the inside she called the fire brigade who broke in and discovered the bodies.","Guido Schiatti lived in Fulham and was an engineering manager .

With coffee shops springing up across the country, it seemed Britain’s reputation as a nation of tea drinkers was under strain. But a study has revealed that our love affair with the cuppa is still as strong as ever. We typically brew up three-and-a-half times a day, although one in four thirsty Britons will get through five cups or more. The poll for WRVS, a charity that provides support for older people, revealed 35 per cent of people like their tea to be mid-brown, with only 3 per cent preferring their tea very milky. One in five like to brew their tea in a teapot, while a traditional 6 per cent still use a cup and saucer. And 7 per cent are so picky that they will not let anyone else make them a cuppa. A study has revealed that our love affair with the cuppa is still as strong as ever . Scots have the sweetest teeth, with 41 per cent taking sugar in their tea compared to just 26 per cent in Yorkshire. Unsurprisingly, tea was seen as a comfort drink – 43 per cent of people claimed they feel better after a brew. Almost a third said that if a friend received bad news they would offer to put the kettle on. The study of the nation’s tea-drinking, which  surveyed 2,000 people, marks the Great Brew Break fundraising event. Launching on Monday, April 29, it’s aimed at raising money to alleviate loneliness among older people. Verity Haines, from WRVS, said: ‘A cup of tea, when it comes with a friendly ear, is a welcome combination. 'But it’s particularly important to many of the older people we support who may not see anyone but a WRVS volunteer that week. 'In May, we celebrate our 75th Anniversary and throughout the years, the charity has become renowned for its tea making abilities. 'Our focus now is on improving the lives of older people and the money raised through this campaign will mean more older people will benefit from the practical support, comfort and kindness our volunteers provide.","Nation typically brews up three-and-a-half times a day, charity poll reveals .

Scientists have discovered a methane-rich tropical lake and several ponds near the equator of Saturn's largest moon Titan. Lakes were previously spied near Titan's polar regions but it was previously believed that bodies of . liquid could not exist at Titan's midsection because energy from the sun . at those latitudes would cause methane pools to evaporate. 'This discovery was completely . unexpected because lakes are not stable at tropical latitudes,' said . planetary scientist Caitlin Griffith of the University of Arizona, who . led the discovery team. Tropical lake: This NASA image shows Titan with Saturn's rings in the background. A new study suggests the dark areas near the moon's equator indicate the presence of a hydrocarbon lake and several ponds . By measuring reflected sunlight from Titan's surface and atmosphere, the international Cassini spacecraft detected a dark region near the landing site of Huygens, a companion probe that parachuted to Titan's equator in 2005. Scientists said further analysis of the dark feature suggests the presence of a 927-square-mile (2,400 square-kilometer) hydrocarbon lake - twice as big as Lake Champlain, a freshwater lake that borders upstate New York and Vermont. Near the equatorial lake were hints of four shallow ponds similar in size and depth to marshes on Earth. The findings were detailed in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. Titan is among the few bodies in the . solar system with a dense atmosphere, but scientists have wrestled over . the source of the thick blanket of nitrogen and methane. Yellow moon: Another Nasa photograph of Titan. Scientists have been surprised at the findings having previously thought lakes only existed at the poles . Methane gas in the atmosphere is constantly broken up by sunlight and falls to the surface where it is transported back to the poles, condensing to form lakes. Scientists do not think this process is driving the presence of mid-latitude lakes and ponds. Rather, they think there may be an underground source of methane that periodically vents to the surface to form the hydrocarbon bodies of liquid. 'Titan may have oases,' Griffith said. David Stevenson, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said the latest find was interesting, but noted that the evidence was indirect. If a subterranean source of methane is confirmed, it's a step toward understanding the persistence of methane in Titan's atmosphere, said Stevenson, who was not part of the research team.","It was previously believed that bodies of .

Injuries: Jodie O'Donohoe, now aged 10, with permanent scars after face burns which her mother says were contributed to by head lice shampoo . The mother of a little girl who suffered appalling burns to her face believes a lice shampoo she was using contributed to the fire that caused the injuries. Nichola O’Donohoe has set up a Facebook page called Justice For Jodie in tribute to her now 10-year-old daughter’s bravery. And despite the fact that the accident occurred more than six years ago, Jodie is still receiving treatment for the burns. Her mother, Nichola, 44, said she had used the lice shampoo Prioderm and believes this may have contributed to the fire. Jodie’s father, Phil, 45, had put the treatment on both Jodie and her sister Jasmine, 12, after they caught head lice off their friends. But the manufacturers of the shampoo, Reckitt Benckiser, claim that there are no safety issues with the product if the instructions are followed. Mrs O’Donohoe said she had lit a candle with Jodie earlier on that day and said the flame was ‘nearly out’ and not powerful enough to cause damage. She was out at the time of the accident, and said: ‘Phil wouldn’t tell me what happened but I could hear Jodie screaming – I never expected what I was about to walk into. ‘I rushed home and there was a horrible stench of smoke and Jodie’s hair was all over the floor and then I knew. It was horrific. ‘Her face was burnt all over – her eyebrows, eyelashes, nose, ears, lips and the top of her head. It was terrible. She was shivering and had gone into shock. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.’ The County Tipperary, Ireland, schoolgirl has suffered tremendously since the accident, according to her family. Seriously injured: Jodie O'Donohoe was treated in hospital for six weeks following the incident which saw her suffer horrific burns . Her father, a carer for an Autism charity, tried to put the fire out but when he was unable to he put Jodie’s head under running water. Mrs O’Donohoe said: ‘I was in hell, absolute hell. I felt like I had been picked up and thrown head first into a blender. 'Jodie was only seconds away from burning everything on her face. Any longer and she would have lost her eyes, her whole face would have been gone.’ Jodie was treated in hospital for six weeks and was heavily sedated while she received treatment. Then and now: Jodie pictured aged five (left), just days before she suffered her burns, and pictured now as a ten year old (right) The family say they were told by doctors the burns would not heal and skin grafts were the only option. ‘They took the skin from her head so they had to shave her hair off. It was horrible. This was my little baby girl. 'She was such a beautiful girl people would swoon over her. She was absolutely perfect.’ Treatment: Mother Nichola claims that Prioderm head lice shampoo may have contributed to the fire which injured her daughter . Mrs O’Donohoe, who says she has suffered with post-traumatic stress since the accident, added: ‘Originally her face looked like red candle wax. We couldn’t go into a shop without people staring, pointing and even shrieking. 'Every time we went out I felt like I was being stabbed in the heart. ‘Luckily her features have recovered, her eyebrows and eyelashes have grown back. The fact Jodie is alive is only by the grace of God. Recovering: Jodie, pictured at the age of eight, three years after she suffered her horrific injuries . ‘Only now has she been able to talk about what happened. She couldn’t look at any pictures of her face. It is so difficult for her to talk about it.’ It is still not known exactly what caused the fire to break out. The manufacturers of Prioderm, Reckitt Benckiser, told the Irish Daily Mail yesterday: ‘At the time of the incident, which we understand was in 2007, Prioderm was part of the Seton/SSL portfolio which was later acquired by Reckitt Benckiser in November 2010.

A new study suggests that Neanderthals may have learned how to make certain tools and jewellery from humans . Neanderthals learned how to make jewellery and sophisticated tools from the ancestors of modern humans, a study published today suggests. New high precision radiocarbon dating shows that a cultural exchange may have taken place between modern humans and Neanderthals in France and Spain more than 40,000 years ago. The findings have important implications for our understanding of our long-extinct sister species. If Neanderthals made the ornaments, they must have been capable of symbolic behaviour thought to be unique to man. Artefacts discovered strewn among the remains of Neanderthals in the Grotte du Renne cave in central France and several other locations have long presented anthropologists with a puzzle. Belonging to what archaeologists term the Châtelperronian culture, a transitional industry from south-west France and northern Spain, it has been hotly debated whether they were made by Neanderthals or humans. The artefacts bear all the hallmarks of production by humans, but their discovery among Neanderthal remains has suggested that they were the work of our rugged evolutionary cousins. Previous research had suggested that the artefacts were in fact produced by human ancestors before settling into deeper layers of cave strata until they sat among the earlier remains of Neanderthals. But now the findings of an international team from the Max Planck Institute, Germany, suggest that the tools and body ornaments were indeed produced by Neanderthals - but only after humans arrived in the area. The so-called 'transitional industries' like the Châtelperronian culture are a key for understanding the replacement process of Neanderthals by modern humans in western Eurasia at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago. Ancient: Châtelperronian Neanderthal body ornaments from the Grotte du Renne cave . The Max Planck Institute team, led by Jean-Jacques Hublin, selected 40 well-preserved bone samples from the Grotte du Renne, primarily from those areas that contained Châtelperronian body ornaments or Neanderthal remains but also from older and younger layers. In addition, a Neanderthal tibia bone from Saint Césaire was analysed. The researchers extracted collagen from the samples and dated the bones by taking isotopic measurements. Using an accelerator mass spectrometer the researchers obtained very high precision 14C dates. 'In Leipzig, scientists use the most advanced techniques for high precision radiocarbon (14C) dating of bones,' said Dr Hublin. At the Grotte du Renne, the large series of dates obtained prove that no major layer admixture occurred in the site. More ornaments from Grotte du Renne: A new study suggests they may have been made by Neanderthals . The Châtelperronian phase is dated to between 44,500 and 41,000 years ago and the Châtelperronian  Neanderthal skeleton of Saint-Césaire from the end of this time period ca. 41,500 years ago. This, the researchers say, confirms that Neanderthal populations are directly responsible for the production of Châtelperronian assemblages in central France, including the body ornaments of Arcy. 'These ages are significant for another reason as well, namely because modern humans replaced the last known European Neanderthals starting around 50,000 years ago and were already present in Southern France and in Germany when Neanderthals produced the CP (Châtelperronian),' said Dr Hublin. 'Given the dating results, we believe that Neanderthals made sophisticated bone tools and body ornaments only after modern humans introduced these new behaviours in Western Europe. Most likely, some level of cultural diffusion occurred from one group to the other more than 40,000 years ago.'","Findings could revolutionise how we see our extinct evolutionary cousins .

The DNA of Ohio kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro was provided to the state crime lab yesterday afternoon and entered into a database to see if they can link the accused rapist to any more crimes. The Bureau of Criminal Investigation lab . staff is rushing the DNA testing to provide investigators with results. The process usually takes around 22 days, but the lab can complete the testing in 24 to 48 hours if necessary. The FBI will find out later today if there are any matches with any profiles in the database. Cleveland schoolgirl Tammy Seals, 14, pictured left, was kidnapped and murdered in 1981. Lawyers are now investigating whether Ariel Castro, pictured right, who was this week accused of the kidnap and rape of three other Cleveland girls, was also responsible for the abduction of Ms Seals . Since Castro has never been convicted of a crime, his DNA would not be stored in state or national databases. Some DNA profiles in the databases are . from unknown individuals who left behind their genetic fingerprint at a . crime scene, such as a rape, murder or burglary, reported The Plain Dealer. One crime that lawyers believe Castro may have responsible for is the murder of a newspaper delivery girl in the 1980s. Orlando 'Chico' Morales was convicted . and jailed in 1981 for the kidnapping, rape and murder of Cleveland . schoolgirl Tammy Seals. But . Morales has always maintained his innocence and lawyers are now looking . into the possibility of whether the main suspect in the recent . Cleveland kidnapping case may in fact be responsible for the death of . 14-year-old Ms Seals. Now lawyers from the Ohio Public Defender's Wrongful Conviction Project, who have been working to clear Morales' name, are looking into whether Castro could also be behind the abduction of Tammy Seals. Wrongful Conviction Project Director Joe . Bodenhamer told Cleveland.com: 'There were so many similarities, that's . what piqued our interest.' In prison: Orlando 'Chico Morales was found guilty by a jury of the kidnap, rape and murder of Tammy Seals but he has always maintained his innocence . The lawyers point out that while Ms Seals was kidnapped years before Castro's alleged victims, Morales was a similar age to Castro and lived in the same area when he was charged with her murder. Ms Seals was abducted while delivering Plain Dealer newspapers and her body was found four months later in an abandoned house on Franklin Avenue near West 28th Street. She was tied up and had been sexually assaulted before being murdered. Lawyers working on Morales case, who has already served more than 30 years in prison, claim there was no physical evidence to link Morales to the crime. Detectives also found hairs found on Ms Seal's body which were 'dissimilar' to both those of Morales and the murdered teen. Now with samples of Castro's DNA, they may be able to link him to the murder if he is responsible. In 1985, two Plain Dealer reporters wrote an investigative piece looking into the case which found jurors said Morales' conviction was based mainly on the evidence of a convicted criminal who later changed his story. Another witness later admitted to lying for reward money. Lawyers also highlighted that hispanic Morales was featured in a lineup with all black suspects when witnessed had reported seeing two or three hispanic men chasing Ms Seals. They also pointed out that witnesses claimed he was driving a car even though Morales couldn't drive and always used the bus for transport. Amy Borror, a spokeswoman for the state office, told Cleveland,com: 'We have long believed in Chico's innocence, but hadn't been able to find any leads as to who the actual perpetrators may have been. 'The similarities between the details emerging (in the abduction case) and Tammy Seals' abduction and murder are striking, and have us wondering whether this might be the break in Chico's case we've been waiting for.' Castro is currently in prison after a judge at Cleveland Municipal Court set his bond at $8 million. Ashley Summers and, right, an 'age-progressed' rendering of her, as might would look now at 19 . Ashley Summers is another missing Ohio girl whose disappearance was believed to have been linked to Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus' disappearance. She was 14-years-old on July 6, 2007, when she was reported missing from her home in the same neighborhood where Berry and DeJesus had vanished. Initially Ashley was considered a runaway as she had lived with her great-uncle and they had argued prior to her disappearance. But a year later the police and FBI believed Ashley was an ‘endangered juvenile’ who could be ‘being held again her will.’ In 2009, the FBI said they suspected a link between Ashley’s disappearance and those of Berry and DeJesus. Ashley's physical appearance and the proximity of her home to the other disappearances lead investigators to suspect the cases were linked and that all three might have been kidnapped by the same man. Special Agent Vicki Anderson, of the FBI Cleveland Division told Cleveland.com on Tuesday that Ashley remains in their thoughts as they gather evidence at Ariel Castro's Seymore Avenue home. ‘We are keeping Ashley in our thoughts as we go every step of the way,’ she said. ‘Whether it is something we find at the house, or someone seeing the stories remembers something, we continue our search for Ashley.’ Ashley Summers was 14 years old when she was . reported missing in 2007 from her home in the same neighborhood where . Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus had vanished . A cadaver dog, along with various law enforcement officers, searched Ariel Castro's Cleveland home on Tuesday, said Anderson. It was not clear why a cadaver dog might be needed, or if it found anything amiss. Prior to the disclosure of the naming of the women discovered on Monday, Summers’ family had briefly thought their daughter could be amongst those discovered. 'We're hoping that it's connected, and they knew where she was,' her aunt Debra Summers told CNN. 'We're hoping for a miracle.' The Summers family is renewing their efforts to publicize Ashley's disappearance. The FBI's missing person website says Ashley Summers has a tattoo of 'Gene' enclosed in a heart on her upper arm, and her birthday is June 16, 1993, making her 19 years old. Investigators will speak to Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight to see if they know anything about Summers' disappearance.

Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah has hinted that they are ready to support President Assad in the Syria war . The leader of Hezbollah has hinted he is ready support the Assad regime in the Syrian war. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the powerful Lebanese Shiite militia, warned on Tuesday during a rare interview that Syria had 'real friends' who . would not allow it 'to fall into the hands' of America, Israel and even . Islamic extremists. His comments came after U.S. President Barack Obama that he was ready to up the game in Syria, following reports of chemical weapons allegedly used by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad fighters. Hezbollah has previously only sent small groups of fighters for battles with other Lebanese groups fighting in Syria but seems to have been provoked by Obama's comments into a stronger stance. The Washington Post on Tuesday reported senior officials describing Obama as ready to move on what one described as the 'left-hand side' of a broad spectrum that ranged from 'arming the opposition to boots on the ground.' Consequently, the Syria regime has got the support that it needs from Hezbollah, an impressive Lebanese military group which proved its capability when it defeated highly equipped Israeli army soldiers who invaded Lebanon briefly in the summer of 2006. On Tuesday the Hezbollah leader openly acknowledged for the first time that its fighters were battling rebels in neighbouring Syria, an intervention that is already threatening to drag Lebanon deeper into that conflict. Nasrallah appeared to be referring to Iran, a patron of both Hezbollah and the Syrian government, as well as Hezbollah itself, which has relied entirely in the past on Iran and Syria to supply its arms. 'You won’t be able to bring down Damascus and you cannot bring down the regime, militarily,' Nasrallah said. 'The battle will be long.' Yet it’s more Hezbollah’s link with Iran which is believed to be a decisive move to up the stakes with Washington. His comments came after President Barack Obama strongly suggested he would consider military action against Syria if it can be confirmed that President Bashar Assad's government used chemical weapons . Images emerged last week from Syria of people who had apparently been injured by chemical weapons . Iran has nuclear weapons as well as the ability to produce chemical weapons. Also, if the Syrian regime needs to move some of its chemical weapons quickly, the only destination can be Hezbollah held areas of Lebanon. Alternatively, those same weapons could be moved within Syria and guarded by Hezbollah fighters, considered to be highly disciplined and far superior to their Syrian Army comrades. This week President Obama is reported to be trying to rally support from international supporters of his plans to oust Assad with a much more decisive role in arming the rebels with much heavier and lethal firepower. British foreign secretary William Hague is also currently battling with EU foreign ministers in Europe to try and lift the current EU arms embargo on the Syrian rebels. U.S. media reported that President Obama is preparing to send lethal weaponry to the Syrian opposition and has taken steps to 'assert more aggressive U.S. leadership among allies and partners' in seeking to oust Assad. Until now, Hezbollah has only made subdued public statements on the Syria situation to avoid further inflaming tensions within Lebanon. But after the Hezbollah-led government was dissolved last month, Nasrallah is reported by many pundits to have calculated that an all-out push to save Hezbollah’s ally, Mr. Assad, is worth the political trade-off in the long run. Syrian President Bahsar Assad, centre, has denied that his regime has used chemical weapons in the war . A wounded Syrian man holding his injured son after an air raid in the northwestern of Syria. There is growing pressure on international community to help resolve the conflict . It would not be the first time that Hezbollah has used a war to increase its political support ahead of key elections. In 2006, it virtually got a 100 per cent backing from the entire Shia community in Lebanon after giving the Israelis a bloody nose on the battlefields of southern Lebanon. Lebanese leaders are struggling to form a new government, deeply divided by the Syrian conflict, despite the country’s official policy of 'disassociation' from it. However, momentum is building in the country and this week Lebanese media reported that 'hundreds' of Sunni hard-core Islamists were lining up to join Syrian rebel fighters, after a rallying speech of a Sunni Salafist leader. Hezbollah, meanwhile, seems to have gone back to basics and given up on the conventional rules of political horse-trading and opted for the Assad ticket. War is after all, a more familiar ground than the awkward setting of parliament and diplomatic foibles. But it’s also about the new Lebanese Prime Minister fighting his own battle to have the crucial ‘one third’ voting veto removed from the parliament so that a new government will not be hampered by pushing crucial reforms through, by Hezbollah blocking it. Top of the list for reforms is addressing the issue of the arms that Hezbollah has. Lebanon’s ‘neutrality’ though is more important than many think. If Lebanon is dragged into the war and itself becomes a battlefield, then the Syrian war becomes a regional war, something that Obama is fighting the bitter end to prevent as he knows this will play into Assad’s hands.","Hassan Nasrallah warned the battle in Syria 'will be long'

Loss: Aspiring actress Jenna Latham, fell to her death from the third floor balcony of her mother's Newcastle home in September 2011 . A troubled young woman who dreamed of becoming an actress died after her life descended into a chaos of drink and drugs, an inquest has heard. Aspiring actress Jenna Latham had a promising future after completing a performing arts course with top grades. On September 9, 2011, after being arrested that morning, she went to her mother's home in Newcastle and fell from the third-floor balcony. Mother Lynne Latham and a police officer tried to save her but their efforts were in vain and Jenna plunged to her death at around 6.30pm. At the resumed inquest in Newcastle, which could last up to four days, coroner David Mitford heard from Ms Latham, who said she was consumed with fear her daughter would try to hurt herself following a history of threats to take her own life. She said: 'She was often saying that she didn't want to be here and was suicidal. 'I remember one time about a year before she died I picked her up and took her back to my house when she was really drunk and she went to the window and I had to get her away.' Just months earlier, talented Jenna had completed a course at Newcastle College and Ms Latham told the hearing: 'She did dancing, acting and got the highest mark. She got loads of certificates and was going to be an actress.' 'She had got three auditions but she was very poorly at that time. I believe she could've got them if she wasn't ill. 'She was wanting to go away to London and to travel the world - she was going places.' But after moving to Byker, in Newcastle, Ms Latham became concerned about her daughter hanging out with some 'dodgy' types. Grief: Mother Lynne Latham (left), who desperately tried to save her daughter as she clung to the balcony railings. Jenna (right) was drunk and had a variety of drugs in her system, including cannabis, tranquillisers, methadone and tramadol, when she died . She said during the following months she noticed a change in Jenna and was led to believe she was suffering with depression which could have led her to turn to alcohol and drugs. A toxicology report showed Jenna was double the legal drink-drive limit at the time of her death as well as having a cocktail of drugs in her system, including cannabis, tranquillisers, methadone and tramadol. Ms Latham added: 'I got the shock of my life when these things turned up in her system. I was absolutely shocked, I nearly hit the floor. 'She wasn't well, it was because she was depressed that she drank and took drugs. She wasn't a druggie, she's no less than any other person.' The court also heard how shortly after 9am on the day of her death, Jenna had been arrested outside her flat for being drunk and disorderly. She was taken into custody at Clifford Street police station, Newcastle, where she was held for around five hours. Her mother feared the 21-year-old had fallen in with some 'dodgy' people . The custody officer requested Jenna be strip-searched after she claimed she had taken a range of drugs including heroin, methadone and crack cocaine. The search proved negative but during the process she told a woman officer she was going to hurt herself. She was made a 'level three' prisoner which means she was being continually monitored on CCTV as well as having regular visits to her cell. Later that day, she went to her mother's flat at St Peter's Basin to recover her mobile phone which Ms Latham had taken from Jenna's home. St Peter's Basin in Newcastle, where Jenna died after falling from the balcony of her mother's flat . Ms Latham recalled Jenna turning up to her flat in an agitated state, kicking at the door to the communal entrance. The worried mother said she phoned the police officer who had dealings with Jenna, who told her to keep her there until she arrived. As this was happening someone from the block let Jenna in and she came up to her mother's home. After initially being worked up about her mobile phone, Ms Latham managed to calm her and she sat down. The buzzer to the flat went and she went to quietly let the officer in without letting Jenna know who it was. Accolades: Jenna had recently received top marks in a performing arts course . But when the officer came into the house Jenna became agitated once again. Ms Latham explained to the court: 'Jenna went straight over the balcony, when I came into the living room she was already getting her second leg over the railings. 'She was holding on facing me and I knew by the look on her face she wasn't well. 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing so I eased myself forward and was looking at her and when I got in reach of Jenna I reached to grab her arm. The court heard she suffered severe injuries to the brain and spine and her death would have been almost instantaneous . 'When I did this she lifted her arm and as she took the hand off her footing went.' She tried desperately to grab her daughter again but it was too late and Jenna fell to the ground below. Pathologist Nigel Kirkham confirmed that she auffered severe injuries to the brain and spine andher death would have been almost instantaneous. He said the cause of death had been due to multiple injuries sustained at a time when Jenna had been intoxicated with alcohol and had taken other drugs. The inquest continues.","Jenna Latham died after fall from third-floor flat in Newcastle .

Kim Jong Un may be fond of fiery anti-Western rhetoric, but in fact the North Korean dictator is obsessed with the European and American lifestyle, according to a man who has known him since he was a little boy. Kenji Fujimoto, who served as the personal sushi chef of Kim's father Kim Jong Il for 13 years, has revealed that the 30-year-old despot is a fan of the Beatles and longs to look like Hollywood star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Kim also drinks Bordeaux wine, smokes Cartier menthol cigarettes and has enjoyed driving around his palace in a Mercedes since he was just seven years old. Threats: But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a secret lover of the Western lifestyle, it has been revealed . Mr Fujimoto has known Kim for more than two decades after he was hired to cook delicacies from his native Japan for Kim Jong Il in 1988. He managed to defect in 2001 by pretending to travel to Japan in search of a rare type of sea urchin, and has since written a series of books about the secretive North Korean regime. The cook told The Sun this week that even though Kim Jong Un has issued a string of apocalyptic threats directed at the West, he loves to indulge in luxuries denied to his famine-stricken countrymen. Kim's cigarette of choice is Cartier menthols, while his preferred drink is Bordeaux - unlike his father, who drank so much expensive cognac that he was thought to be one of Hennessy's best customers. Warlike: The 30-year-old dictator has issued a series of thundering pronouncements directed at the West . Claims: Kenji Fujimoto, who was Kim Jong Il's sushi chef, has opened up about his former boss . He also enjoys Hollywood hits, and the Beatles are his favourite Western band. One film in particular had a big impact on Kim, when a Jean-Claude Van Damme karate movie inspired him to start bulking up so he could look more like the Belgian star. 'His action is so awesome,' the teenager said, according to Mr Fujimoto, who added: 'He started buying fitness equipment and taking protein supplements.' When the future leader was a child, he learned how to drive a Mercedes and would take it for a spin around the grounds of the presidential palace. 'He drove it perfectly when he was only seven,' Mr Fujimoto told The Sun. 'They made a special seat for him because he could not reach the pedals.' The chef - who uses a pseudonym - has previously revealed that Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011, enjoyed eating fish which had been killed so recently that it was still moving. He also described how the unhinged despot . would order his staff to dance with scantily clad girls, and claimed . that he had been married off to one of the exotic dancers. Close: Kenji Fujimoto embraces Kim Jong Un, who he knew as a child, after returning to North Korea last year . Fan: Kim was obsessed with Jean-Claude Van Damme, left, and the Beatles, right, when he was growing up . Mr Fujimoto managed to escape North Korea by showing Kim a video of a Japanese cooking programme featuring a sea urchin dish, and persuading the dictator to allow him to travel to Japan in an attempt to recreate the meal. However, he returned to the country last year and was pictured sharing a hug with the despot he knew as a child, claiming that the situation in North Korea had improved since he left. Kim Jong Un has put the West on high alert in recent weeks by issuing blood-curdling threats to launch nuclear attacks on South Korea, the U.S. and Europe. North Korea has apparently been amassing troops in preparation for renewed hostilities, and although the situation seems to have cooled this week the country's enemies have remained ready for the possibility of military confrontation.","North Korean despot had specially adapted car when he was just seven .

Norfolk PCC Stephen Bett has been criticised for declaring speed limits should be abolished and drivers should be able to go 'flat out' on some roads . A police and crime commissioner has apologised today after saying speed limits on motorways and main roads should be scrapped and skilled drivers allowed to drive as fast they like/ . Stephen Bett, who is paid a salary of £70,000 as the independent PCC for Norfolk, was criticised after saying: ‘We ought to drive to road conditions rather than set limits. ‘The problem is there’s so many signs. You are driving along and you get mesmerised by them and you get situations where you get a 50 [limit], to 40, to 30 and it goes to 20 and back up again.’ ‘If we’re going to do something about speed and villages, we ought to just take all the signs down and say all villages are 30mph, or whatever it’s going to be, and you drive on roads – like they do in Germany and Italy – as road conditions say.’ He added: ‘People say if people are going fast they will cause trouble, but a lot of people, if [the limit] was 70mph, would go faster anyway.’ When asked at what speed a driver could safely travel on an open road in the early morning, he said: ‘If you have got someone who’s a Formula 1 racing driver, well, you can go flat out. If he was a racing driver and really good and had tremendous reflexes, probably as fast as the car will go.’ However, David Williams, chief executive of the Guild of Experienced Motorists, said: ‘Twenty-four per cent of road deaths are caused by inappropriate speed. 'We need to protect innocent road users from people who think that they can drive faster, like racing drivers, on the highway. That just is nonsense.’ Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at . the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, added: ‘Abolishing . speed limits is a daft idea.’ Speaking after the interview, Mr Bett, . who was chairman of the Norfolk Police Authority for six years before . his election last November, was unrepentant. He said: ‘I do agree with those who . believe we should revisit the upper speed limit of 70mph on our . motorways and modern roads which have been built, along with vehicles, . with safety in mind. Mr Bett has said he agrees with those 'who believe we should revisit the current upper speed limit of 70mph on our motorways' and modern roads . ‘Whilst this may be unpopular in some . quarters, research would point to whether this could be universally . acceptable. My comments were designed to provoke the debate.’ However, Mr Bett has today apologised for his remarks. He said: ‘With hindsight, my message around the clutter of associated signage has been lost in my flippant comments about speeding. ‘I fully acknowledge that speed is regarded as a contributory factor in determining the outcome of collisions. ‘My comments were not meant to be offensive. I have been out with Roads Policing Officers, and I have lost a close personal friend in a collision, and therefore understand the misery and heartbreak that follow loss of life and serious injury on our roads. ‘I am supporting the Norfolk Joint Casualty Reduction Partnership (with Norfolk County Council) and this has contributed to a significant reduction in road deaths and serious injury casualties.’ Earlier this year, the Department for .

Under fire: Education minister Elizabeth Truss's claim that nurseries are too 'chaotic' has already outraged teaching unions and childcare providers . Elizabeth Truss risked a fresh clash with nursery chiefs yesterday by saying a third of children start school without basic language and communication skills. The education minister’s claim that nurseries are too ‘chaotic’ has already outraged teaching unions and childcare providers. But yesterday she told MPs there was clear evidence that toddlers who took part in structured sessions led by a graduate were better prepared for primary school. ‘It is a very sad fact that 33 per cent of children arrive at school without the requisite communication and language skills to take part in school education,’ she said. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the minister, who is increasingly tipped for a Cabinet post, said too many childcare settings were ‘chaotic’ and saw children ‘running around’ with ‘no sense of purpose’. She praised a traditional approach akin to France’s écoles maternelles, which studies suggest are more effective academically and produce better adjusted, happier children. Her remarks came after Ofsted’s chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said failing pre-schools face closure if they do not improve quickly. Tory MPs urged Miss Truss to ‘stick to her guns’ yesterday. One, Damian Hinds, urged her to ‘continue her drive to improve standards in our nurseries’. Miss Truss told the Commons that ‘countries like France . . . have much higher salaries and higher qualifications in early years. ‘At the moment, only one third of nurseries have a teacher-led  structure,’ she said. ‘Good providers have high-quality, structured learning from age three which really benefits later on.’ Reading: Miss Truss told MPs there was clear evidence that toddlers who took part in structured sessions led by a graduate were better prepared for primary school (file picture) Miss Truss’s intervention drew an angry response from trade union Unison. Its head of education Jon Richards said: ‘This unwarranted attack on “unruly nurseries” suggests Liz Truss would rather that children were seen but not heard. ‘Whilst claiming it wants to boost . standards, the Government’s plans to reduce the ratio of staff to . children in nurseries will have a  disastrous impact.’ Tough: Her remarks came after Ofsted's chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said failing pre- schools face closure if they do not improve quickly . Neil Leitch, of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: ‘It is frankly astonishing that the minister in charge of childcare makes such ill-judged, off-the-cuff statements. 'The picture the minister paints is not one that would be recognised by anyone who knows anything about child development. Day nurseries are not hothouses of anarchy, as the minister seems to believe. ‘What she sees as the ideal French model is regarded by many French practitioners themselves as dull, and uninspiring for children. ‘Young children are by nature active, energetic and inquisitive. It is these features that good-quality nursery staff nurture and develop through a balance of child-oriented and adult-led activities.’ Penny Webb, a registered childminder who runs Penny’s Place in Kidderminster, said: ‘I find it rather annoying – no, very annoying – that the early years minister can go on and on and on about early years practitioners needing higher qualifications, needing to do x, y and z to improve outcomes for children – when she herself does not have any formal qualification in early years childcare.’ But Greg Martin, head of the Durand Academy in South London, which operates one of the country’s biggest nursery and primary facilities, backed Miss Truss, saying: ‘We see nursery school as exactly that – a school, a place to learn. ‘The early years in a child’s life are so important for their educational development. That’s why we employ qualified teachers at our early years centre, who deliver structured and engaging lessons to children from age three. ‘And the model works: children at Durand, in a socially disadvantaged area of South London, exceed national averages by the time they are in year one.’","Elizabeth Truss's criticism of 'chaotic' nurseries has outraged unions .

An elephant lies maimed and dead by a pool of its own blood, one of at least 26 of the majestic creatures slaughtered for their ivory in Central African Republic. Four calves were among the victims of the massacre, which was carried out by 17 members of the 'transitional government forces' armed with Kalashnikov rifles in Dzanga Bai, a World Heritage site known as the 'Village of Elephants'. After their tusks were ripped from their carcasses, locals began hacking meat from the bones. Horror: Gunmen massacred at least 26 elephants in the Central African Republic - all for their tusks . Waste: The creatures lost their lives at a World Heritage Site at which as as many as 200 a day gather to drink nutrients from the sands . Senseless deaths: The animals were killed by 17 men armed with rifles . Charity workers described the area, at which between 50-200 of the animals gather every day to drink nutrients present in sands, as an 'elephant mortuary'. In 2011, almost 25 tons of contraband . ivory was collected from around the world - the product of an estimated . 2,500 slaughtered elephants – making it the worst year for poaching . since ivory harvesting was banned in 1989. Figures . for 2012 are yet unknown, but most black-market ivory harvested in . Kenya and Tanzania is bound for Asia, with China, Japan and Thailand . among the top destinations. It is used for billiard balls, piano keys, carved art and jewelry. The number of elephants killed by poacher has doubled in the last decade. Today, . eight out of every ten elephant deaths is the result of poaching, . compared with four out of ten deaths six years ago, the prosecutor's . office said. 'The killing has started,' Jim Leape, WWF's international director general, said in a statement. 'The Central African Republic must act immediately to secure this unique World Heritage site. 'The brutal violence we are witnessing in Dzanga Bai threatens to destroy one of the world's great natural treasures, and to jeopardize the future of the people who live there.' The 17 killers have now left the area, but the WWF fear the slaughter could continue. The Central African Republic has been rocked by violence and chaos since the beginning of the year, and WWF and other conservation organisations left the field office next to the Bai in April for security reasons. Mr Leape said international governments needed to help. 'The international community must also act to assist the Central African Republic to restore peace and order in this country to safeguard its population and its natural heritage. 'WWF also asks Cameroon and the Republic of Congo to assist the Central African Republic in preserving this World Heritage Site, which not only encompasses the Bai, but also includes large neighbouring areas of these two countries. 'The events in Dzanga Bai are a vivid reminder of the existential threat faced by forest elephants in Central Africa. Populations of this species have plummeted 62 per cent over the past ten years. 'The unfolding tragedy in Dzanga Bai must also spur the governments of China and Thailand to act on their commitments to shut down the ivory markets in their countries that are fueling this illicit trade.'

Take a look around this giant graveyard of 60,000 trolleys which are waiting to be refurbished and sent back to supermarkets across Europe. Instead of being scrapped, the metal contraptions are taken to the Reviva factory in Tibshelf, Derbyshire. But that’s not the end of the line for these trolleys, which are re-built and shipped back out to stores such as Tesco, Asda and Morrisons. Trained workmen bring the tired and broken trolleys of all shapes and sizes back to life so they can be used again by shoppers. The giant trolley graveyard at the Reviva factory in Tibshelf, Derbyshire, where 60,000 damaged trolleys are waiting to be rebuilt and sent back out to supermarkets . Reviva reconditions supermarket trollies of all shapes and sizes from across the UK and Europe . Reviva, a part of Storetec UK, has reconditioned and recycled more than 160,000 trolleys in the past four years. From wobbly wheels to a damaged baskets, the staff at Reviva work hard to recycle the trolleys, which makes sound economic and environmental sense. Storetec managing director Tony Barber said the number of trolleys being . sent for re-manufacturing has increased from 8,000 in 2008 to more than . 60,000 in 2011 – a 750 per cent increase. During this time, the process which sees the trolleys completely . recondition has saved more than 12,000 tonnes of CO2 for retailers by . re-manufacturing more than 150,000 trolleys. A triple-layer protective finish is put on the metal while every trolly . is fitted with new plastics and castors to ensure it 'deliver years of . reliable performance'. Reviva has brought more than 160,000 trolleys back into use over the past four years . Trolleys with wobbly wheels in the giant graveyard are destined to be fixed and sent back to supermarkets so they can be used again . Backed by a 30-month warranty, Reviva claim the trolleys are the affordable, eco-friendly alternative to buying new. 'Demand for more carbon efficient production combined with tougher . economic times has pushed re-manufacture up the agenda,' Mr Barber said. 'Ultimately, this helps retailers save money on their equipment, which means less cost being passed onto the consumer. 'Moreover, it is helping retailers meet their CSR commitments by reducing their carbon footprint.' And the future is looking bright for the company even though the economy is stalling. Storetec say the number of trolleys being sent for re-manufacturing has increased from 8,000 in 2008 to more than 60,000 in 2011 - a 750 per cent increase . 'The evidence suggests that, over the coming years, we will see retailer . demand for re-manufactured trolleys continue to grow, as economic and . environmental concerns weigh heavier and financial constraints get ever . tighter.' The first shopping trolley was . introduced on June 4, 1937, by Sylvan Goldman, owner of the Piggly . Wiggly supermarket chain in Oklahoma City, America. He wanted to help customers move more groceries. Teaming up with one of his employees, Fred Young, a mechanic, they made first shopping cart using a metal frame that held two wire baskets. Another mechanic, Arthur Kosted, developed a method to mass produce the carts by inventing an assembly line capable of forming and welding the wire. The invention did not catch on immediately. Men found them effeminate while women found them suggestive of a baby carriage. After hiring male and female models to push his new invention around his store, shopping carts became extremely popular and Goldman became a multimillionaire. Now millions of trolleys are used around the world. It is estimated that missing shopping trolleys cost UK supermarkets £8million a year.","Reviva factory is Derbyshire brings broken trolleys back to life and ships them to supermarkets across Europe .

He is accused of killing university . lecturer Jifeng 'Jeff' Ding, his wife Ge 'Helen' Chui and their two . daughters Alice, 12, and Xing, 18, on April 29 2011. An international search was mounted for Du after the family were found stabbed to death at their home in the quiet suburb of Wootton, Northampton. He was eventually arrested in Tangier in July last year after a 15-month manhunt which saw police travel to China in pursuit of the fugitive. But the case had to be adjourned and a trial date which was originally scheduled for August had to be put back until November after the interpreter failed to turn up. Because of the company, the judge had to delay the hearing at Nottingham Crown Court by two months . Mr Justice Flaux told the court he didn't know which company was involved, but that they had chosen not to send an interpreter despite repeat requests to do so. He fumed: 'The company, I don't know which one, said it was not worthwhile sending and interpreter as they will not make enough money. 'They were asked to provide mandarin interpreter at two, they said it wouldn't be worthwhile, they were asked again and said one would be here at 2.30, they were told to be here for two and they haven't turned up. 'It would be completely unfair on Mr Du to go ahead without an interpreter. 'I will be asking for a written explanation to explain what has happened, then consider costs. 'It is a complete disgrace, some people suggest things have got better, that depends what the starting point is.' Du, who is in custody, will now appear at Northampton Crown Court on July 19 for a plea and case management hearing. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Unnamed company said it was 'not worthwhile to send interpreter as it would not make enough money'

Florida citrus growers are battling their biggest threat in history as a disease with the potential to decimate orange crops sweeps the state. Called citrus greening, the bacterial disease causes the fruits of orange and grapefruit trees to turn bitter and fall uselessly to the ground. First spotted in 2005, the disease has been spreading ever since and now affects all 32 of the Sunshine State’s citrus-growing counties. Historic: A Lake Placid, Florida citrus grower holds up a healthy orange, left, and one affected by citrus greening, right, the worst scourge in industry history . And losses in 2013 have been more extensive than previous years, suggesting the problem is getting worse. ‘(It) represents an existential threat to Florida's signature crop,’ Florida’s agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam told the Wall Street Journal in January. Since then, the USDA has downgraded its estimates for the year’s crop by more each month. The epidemic now has growers and lawmakers struggling to find a solution. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida helped obtain $11 million in federal funds to combat the disease. Deadly: Citrus greening causes fruit to turn bitter and fall off trees. There is no known cure . Widespread: A grower tags an infected tree. The disease has caused massive damage throughout Florida's citrus groves . 'The long and short of it is that the industry that made Florida, that is synonymous with Florida, that is a staple on every American breakfast table, is totally threatened,' the Democrat told the New York Times. Prior to this year, the industry the state’s industry had already been on the decline for 15 years and efforts to curb losses from greening, according to insiders, have thus far failed. The problem has been further compounded in 2013 by an unusually dry winter and trees overloaded with fruit. A 2012 University of Florida study, estimated the disease had cost the state $3.6 in revenue since 2006 as well as 6,600 lost jobs. But efforts to stop the plague continue. Some focus on the tiny insect, the Asian Citrus Psyllid, that carries the bacteria. Epidemic: A tractor carries an infected tree to be burned. The USDA's estimate for 2013's orange crop has been downgraded every month since January . Other efforts seek to treat trees with new antibiotics that combat the bacteria. Scientists are also looking into making new breeds of citrus tree that are more resistant to the disease. And a ray of hope comes from another, if rather unlikely, place. The Coca-Cola Company, which produces Minute Maid and the Simply juice brands, said Tuesday that it is spending $2 billion to support the planting of 25,000 acres of new orange groves in Florida. Some 5 million new trees will be planted in the new groves, believed to be the largest citrus addition in the state for at least 25 years, and officials remain hopeful it is a sign the tides of the state’s citrus industry are changing for the better. Tiny: Efforts to curb the disease have been unfruitful as new research focuses on the minute insect that spreads the bacterial disease, the Asiatic citrus psyllid .","Growers and state officials desperate for money and resources to combat the bacterial disease called citrus greening that causes fruit to turn bitter and fall off trees .

The defendant wept throughout the evidence and, according to witnesses in the public gallery, April’s mother Coral left the court room in tears. Former slaughterhouse worker Bridger denies abducting and murdering April as she played near her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, on the evening of October 1 last year. Giving evidence to the jury today, PC Saunders read from the notes he made after he detained Bridger as he walked along the A487 at 3.30pm on the next day. He said: 'I was travelling down the A487 with my sergeant who instructed me that if we saw Mark Bridger, he was to be arrested on suspicion of the abduction of April Jones. At approximately 3.30pm, I saw a male who matched his description. 'I stopped the car and asked him what his name was. He confirmed to me he was Mark Bridger and at that point I arrested him on suspicion of abduction and cautioned him.' The officer said Bridger replied: 'I know what this is all about.'

She had gone a funny colour, she was only a little thing. 'I remember being by the clock by Rob’s garage. I went numb, I don’t know what I was doing.' PC Saunders said: 'From the point of arrest, he was very emotional, crying. He seemed to be, what I would call, an emotional wreck.' The prosecution claims Bridger snatched and murdered April, who had cerebral palsy, in a sexually motivated attack. Her body was never found despite the largest search operation ever staged by British police. Earlier the jury heard evidence from one of the first police officers to arrive at Bridger’s home, Mount Pleasant in the hamlet of Ceinws, near Machynlleth. Detective Constable Sarah Totterdale said she and two colleagues were told to attend the address to search for April and arrest the defendant. She said she arrived at the isolated cottage shortly after 3pm. After trying the back door of the property and finding it locked and secured, the officers forced entry through the front door.

'I continued to call out April, April, April, but there was no response.' In the bathroom, she said she noticed a strong smell of washing powder. She could also smell Deep Heat and saw a bottle of the muscle treatment nearby.

I haven’t got a TV or radio up there.' She said: 'I believed he was talking about the missing girl. He looked very upset and was teary-eyed when he said it. But he didn’t mention April by name.'

A previous attempt by Norris to appeal against his murder conviction failed last summer, but yesterday he made a new one. Defeat: David Norris, left, has lost his bid to appeal against his conviction for the murder of Stephen Lawrence . Gary Dobson, 37, the other man jailed . for life in January last year for Stephen’s racist murder, dropped his . appeal two months ago. Stephen, an 18-year-old A-level . student, was stabbed to death by a gang of white youths who set upon him . at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993. Norris and Dobson were among five . thugs famously named as his killers by the Daily Mail in 1997. But it . was only last year, after a forensic breakthrough, that anyone was . convicted. Norris was not in court yesterday as his barrister, Tim Owen QC, argued that his conviction at the Old Bailey was unfair. Mr Owen said the judge should not . have allowed the jury access to secret recordings of Norris telling his . racist friends 20 months after Stephen’s murder that he wanted to . torture and kill black people. The jury was unfairly biased by . hearing his client’s racist remarks, because they contained nothing to . suggest he was involved in murdering Stephen. Killing: The other convicted murderer is Gary Dobson, left; Stephen's mother Doreen, right, has become a leading anti-racism campaigner since her son's death . Memorial: This plaque at the site of the student's death marks the murder which shocked Britain . Mr Owen also claimed that prosecution . evidence about Stephen’s hair and clothes fibres being found on . clothing at Norris’s home had changed during the trial, and that the . defence should have gathered new expert opinion and challenged it. He said the steps taken by Norris’s . previous barrister, Stephen Batten QC, to address the fibres issue at . the trial were ‘inadequate’, and that Mr Batten admitted so. Mr Owen added that as his client was . not legally aided, he was requesting £4,000 of public funds to hire a . new expert to look at the hair and fibres evidence.

The 29-year-old victim feared for her life when the Ministry of Defence official hurled her to the ground in woodland and grabbed her by the throat. She managed to escape only by biting the former Territorial Army captain and bomb disposal officer on the hand before running for help at a nearby house. Last night Scully, who advised Nato chiefs in war zones, was starting a jail sentence of five years and four months after a jury convicted him of sexual assault. Judge Peter Moss told the father of one, whose wife Polly is pregnant with his second child, that he was previously a man of ‘impeccable character’. But his victim had suffered a life-changing ordeal from which she would never fully recover. The judge told Guildford Crown Court that Scully used his ‘charm’ to take advantage of her trust and led her to a secluded spot. He added: ‘You were a high- flying civil servant with a bright future. But you have destroyed all that.’ The attack took place after Scully met the woman on  a train from London’s Waterloo Station to Woking in Surrey.

"PUBLISHED: . 10:22 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:59 EST, 10 May 2013 . After months of testing hundreds of patients of a Tulsa dentist who is accused of unclean medical practices, results have been revealed that will send a chill through anyone who had sat in the dentists' chair. The Tulsa Health Department says three patients have tested positive for the HIV virus which causes AIDS, 70 patients have tested positive for hepatitis C and a further four patients have tested positive for hepatitis B. At one time, it was believed up to 7,000 patients may have been exposed to blood-borne viruses at the clinics of Dr. Scott Harrington in Tulsa and Owasso because he used filthy instruments in their mouths. Scroll down for video... Investigated: A health . scare was sparked over the work of Dr Wayne Scott Harrington, an oral surgeon . in Tulsa. Now at least three of his patients have tested positive for HIV and 70 for . hepatitis C . So far, 3,796 patients have been tested at Oklahoma health departments across the state. The department says they will personally contact those who have tested positive for any of the diseases and will offer them and their family counseling. The department notes the possibility that some that test positive may not be related to the dental procedures at the Harrington practice. 'This is a complex investigation,' emphasized State Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley. Health officials opened their investigation into Harrington's surgeries after a patient with no known risk factors tested positive for both hepatitis C and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It turned out the person was a patient of Harrington's and had recently had a dental procedure at one of his clinics. On one occasion authorities launched a surprise inspection at his practice on March 18 that turned up old needles, rusty instruments and a practice of pouring bleach on patients' wounds, until they 'turned white,' according to a complaint filed by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. No charged yet: Three have tested positive for HIV and 74 have been diagnosed with hepatitis. In total 7,000 patients have been advised to get tested . While . testing for HIV and hepatitis continues among former patients of . Harrington, the criminal investigation continues with the involvement of . both state and federal authorities. Tulsa County District . Attorney Tim Harris has released a statement regarding the allegations . against Harrington by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. The state dental board filed a 17-count complaint calling Harrington ""a menace to the public health.' Among the allegations, Harrington allowed dental assistants to administer IV sedation and reused equipment on multiple patients. It . is improper sterilization procedures such as this that could have . infected many of his patients with any number of blood-borne viruses. Among the claims was one detailing the use of rusty instruments in patients known to have infectious diseases that were dipped twice in bleach in hope of cleaning them. ‘The CDC has determined that rusted instruments are porous and cannot be properly sterilized,’ the board said of that practice. Harrington told officials he left questions about sterilization and drug procedures to his employees. ‘They take care of that, I don't,’ the dentistry board quoted him as saying. Nearly 200 patients of Dr. W. Scott Harrington line up outside the Tulsa Health Department North Regional Health and Wellness Center in Tulsa to be tested for HIV and hepatitis . 'The . goal is to do a thorough investigation and then make some common sense . decisions on potential criminal charges and which agency is in the best . position to prosecute any case,' Harris said. Based on the number . of individuals to be interviewed and the involvement of both federal . and state investigators, Harris says the investigation is likely to be a . long one. 'Once an investigation is complete, the case will be reviewed for potential criminal charges.' Health inspectors found expired . morphine and dirty, rusty instruments that were used on patients with . infectious diseases inside an Oklahoma dental clinic, putting thousands . of people at risk for hepatitis and the virus that causes AIDS. Health officials opened their . investigation after a patient with no known risk factors tested positive . for both hepatitis C and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. After . determining the 'index patient' had a dental procedure about the likely . time of exposure, investigators visited Harrington's office and found a . number of unsafe practices, state epidemiologist Kristy Bradley said. Inspectors allege workers at his two . clinics risked cross-contamination to the point that the state Dentistry . Board branded Harrington a 'menace to the public health.' Shocking: Health officials are urging 7,000 patients of an Oklahoma dentist (pictured Dr. W. Scott Harrington's dental office in Tulsa) to seek medical tests to ensure they haven't been exposed to the virus that causes AIDS . According to the insepctors' complaint, needles were re-inserted in drug vials after their initial . use and the office had no written infection-protection procedure. Harrington told officials he left questions about sterilization and drug procedures to his employees. 'They take care of that, I don't,' the dentistry board quoted him as saying. The doctor also is accused of letting . his assistants perform tasks only a licensed dentist should have done, . including administering IV sedation. The complaint says the doctor's . staff could not produce permits for the assistants when asked. Susan Rogers, executive director of . the state Dentistry Board, said that as an oral surgeon Harrington . regularly did invasive procedures involving 'pulling teeth, open wounds, . open blood vessels.' The board's complaint also noted Harrington and . his staff told investigators a 'high population of known infectious . disease carrier patients' received dental care from him. Despite the high-risk clientele, a . device used to sterilize instruments wasn't being properly used and . hadn't been tested in six years, the board complaint said. Tests are . required monthly. Also, a drug vial found at a clinic . this year had an expiration date of 1993 and one assistant's drug log . said morphine had been used in the clinic last year despite its not . receiving any morphine shipments since 2009. Health risk: The agencies said they found 'major violations' of the Oklahoma Dental Act (pictured the dental office is Owasso) Investigation: Letters were sent to 7,000 patients from Harrington's clinics in Tulsa and suburban Owasso since 2007 recommending testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV (stock photos) 'The office looked clean,' said Joyce . Baylor, who had a tooth pulled at Harrington's Tulsa office 1½ years . ago. In an interview, Baylor, 69, said she'll be tested next week to . determine whether she contracted any infection. 'I'm sure he's not suffering financially that he can't afford instruments,' Baylor said of Harrington. Harrington voluntarily gave up his . license, closed his offices in Tulsa and suburban Owasso, and is . cooperating with investigators, said Kaitlin Snider, a spokeswoman for . the Tulsa Health Department. 'It's uncertain how long those practices have been in place,' Snider said. 'He's been practicing for 36 years.' The Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention is consulting on the case, and agency spokeswoman Abbigail . Tumpey said such situations involving dental clinics are rare. Last year . a Colorado oral surgeon was accused of reusing needles and syringes, . prompting letters to 8,000 patients, Tumpey said. It wasn't clear . whether anyone was actually infected. 'We've only had a handful of dental facilities where we've had notifications in the last decade,' Tumpey said. The Oklahoma Dentistry Board lodged a . 17-count complaint against Harrington, saying he was a 'menace to the . public health by reasons of practicing dentistry in an unsafe or . unsanitary manner.' Among the claims was one detailing the use of rusty . instruments in patients known to have infectious diseases. 'The CDC has determined that rusted instruments are porous and cannot be properly sterilized,' the board said. Health officials sent letters . to 7,000 known patients but cautioned that they don't know who visited . his clinics before 2007. The letters urged the patients to be tested for . hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV — viruses typically spread through . intravenous drug use or unprotected sex, not occupational settings.","Tulsa County's top prosecutor says no decision has been made on pursuing criminal charges against Dr Scott Harrington .

Others are of an age to remember the catastrophic Kanto earthquake and tsunami in 1923 which wiped out up to 135,000 Tokyo residents. There are even some that were born before the city's main railway station opened. But some are not old enough to have explored Tokyo's vast urban sprawl at all yet. A fascinating new collection of pictures . from a Finnish photographer features Tokyo residents from the cradle . (almost) to the grave featuring 101 photos of different people of every . age from newborn babies to 100 year olds. Toddlers: These two pictures featured in 100 Years in Tokyo show two of the city's youngest residents - they are both aged two . Teenagers: This pair are both aged 16. The are among 2,500 strangers approached to have their picture taken by Petri Artturi Asikainen . Growing up: This pair, pictured in Tokyo city's bustling urban sprawl, are both aged 27 . Petri Artturi Asikainen, armed with his camera, spent three years approaching complete strangers in the Japanese capital city and asking if he could take their photo to complete his 100 Years in Tokyo project. When a resident wasn't too shy to say no to Petri - many refused - he would ask them their age and collected a photo of a male and a female Tokyoite for each year up to his oldest subjects, a pair of centenarians. Petri estimates that he approached around 2,500 people and amassed a collection of 500 pictures during his time on the project. Life begins at 40: These two are about to enter their fifth decade - they are both aged 39 . Not shy: Of the 2,500 approached by Petri, just 500 people agreed to have their picture taken for the book, including these two aged 48 . Good eye for an age: Petri says that when he became adept at guessing people's ages despite Japanese people looking younger than their years. He guessed that these two were both aged 60 . But he admitted that when he set out on his mission to collect such a vast range of ages, he wasn't sure if it'd be possible. A freelance photographer, working mainly for magazines and businesses, 100 Years in Tokyo is Petri's first personal project. His collection manages not only to capture the entire spectrum of Tokyoites in terms of age, the images he shot depict the city's diversity, not only in terms of location - he took pictures all other Tokyo - but of the different types of people who live there. The images feature people from all manor of backgrounds, from students to labourers and one shot even features a homeless man. Diverse: His pictures don't only capture a spectrum of ages - these two are both 74 - they also capture the city's diversity . All ages: The group of pictures features all manor of subjects, from babies to labourers to people in residential care. These two were 94 when the shots were taken . Centenarians: This man and woman were among the oldest people photographed by Petri - they were both aged 100 . Petri told the Japan Times that he became an expert at guessing people's ages while collecting the pictures. He said: 'The funny thing is, for western people it's difficult to tell some people's ages here because Japanese people look much younger than they are. 'But when I was doing it, I got very good at it.

A church Dean has resigned after becoming embroiled in a row with her choir over a paltry payment for their appearance on the BBC’s Songs of Praise. Janet Henderson, 55, fell out with the singers just two months after she was made the first woman Dean of Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff. Choristers were angry after being booked to appear on Songs of Praise for an ‘insulting’ fee, but Dean Henderson said appearing on the ‘low-budget’ Sunday evening show was an ‘honour’ which should not be done for personal gain. She has since resigned from her role at the cathedral. Resignation: Janet Henderson has stepped down just two months after being appointed the first woman Dean of Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff . The Llandaff Cathedral Choir is the . only professional Anglican cathedral choir in Wales, and has toured . Europe, with its members receiving a monthly salary from the Llandaff . diocese for singing at six services a week. The agreed rate for a day of singing . is £214 but choristers were offered just £110 each to perform for two . days for Songs of Praise. Some choir members were furious after . discovering the BBC is paying an independent production company £180,000 . for three editions of Songs of Praise from Llandaff. When the fees were revealed last . month, chorister Adam Poole said: ‘The fee offered to members of the . choir for singing in these programmes is £110 – considerably less than . the rate agreed between the BBC and my union Equity. ‘It seems to me there is an attempt to . deprive choir members of the fees they are entitled to.’ Fellow singer . Matthew Mudge, who has 17 years of choir experience, said: ‘The BBC TV . agreement with Equity says choir members should be paid £214 for a daily . session of up to five hours. ‘But the recording is taking place over two days so people should be paid two daily fees.’ He added: ‘I think it’s pretty insulting to expect members of the choir to sing for less money than they are entitled to. ‘I can’t imagine them expecting the choir of St Paul’s Cathedral in London to perform cut-price.’ Row: Members of the Llandaff Cathedral (pictured) Choir claimed the fee agreed for their appearance on the religious programme was 'insulting' Dean Henderson responded to the . disquiet in April: ‘It is a privilege for Llandaff Cathedral as it . allows us to share our worship with millions of viewers across the UK . and beyond. ‘It’s a low-budget programme and we are not taking part in order to profit financially.’ Dean Henderson was not at any of the seven services held at the cathedral last Sunday. A spokesman said she had been given . compassionate leave after a member of her family had been taken ill, but . 24 hours later it was confirmed that she had resigned. Dean Henderson, a former nurse who was ordained more than 20 years ago, was not available for comment yesterday. She was Archdeacon of Richmond in North Yorkshire before taking up her appointment as Dean of Llandaff in March. She became the first female Dean of Llandaff and only the second female dean ever in Wales. She said at the time: 'I am thrilled . and humbled to have been appointed as the next Dean of Llandaff . Cathedral and Vicar of the parish. 'I'm . looking forward to meeting everyone and working with the Cathedral to . continue to develop worship and address the pressing fabric and . financial challenges that face every cathedral community today.' A source at the cathedral said: ‘The .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:31 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 10 May 2013 . Mystery: Historians have spent 150 years debating what finally caused the death of Thomas J 'Stonewall' Jackson . Historians have debated for decades what medical complications caused the death of legendary Confederate fighter Thomas J 'Stonewall' Jackson, who was felled by friendly fire from his troops during the Civil War. But after 150 years of mystery, a trauma surgeon has revealed that pneumonia was most likely responsible for delivering the death blow to the injured soldier. Shot three times while returning from scouting enemy lines in the Virginia wilderness, Jackson was left badly wounded in the left arm by one of the large bullets the night of May 2, 1863. It took at least two hours to get him to a field hospital as blood gushed from a severed artery and Jackson was dropped twice in a stretcher before his arm was amputated. He died days later, aged just 39. But scholars have long questioned whether it was an infection or pneumonia that killed Jackson, who gained the nickname 'Stonewall' early in the war and went on to be lionized in the South and feared in the North because of his military exploits. Today, on the 150th anniversary of Jackson's death, a trauma surgeon with experience on the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan has revealed his diagnosis of Jackson's death after re-investigating the medical record. After reviewing the 1860s files and subsequent reports, University of Maryland surgeon and professor Joseph DuBose told The Associated Press that Jackson most likely died of pneumonia. DuBose is confirming the original diagnosis given by Jackson's personal physician, the famed Confederate doctor Hunter H. McGuire. 'You would be hard-pressed to find someone more qualified than him for the treatment of this injury and taking care of Stonewall Jackson,' DuBose said. Fresh outlook: Trauma surgeon Joseph DuBose believes pneumonia was the most likely cause of death of Thomas Jonathan 'Stonewall' Jackson after reviewing the medical records . 150th anniversary: This tombstone still marks the burial ground of the amputated arm of Confederate General Thomas J 'Stonewall' Jackson near Orange County, Virginia . 'I do defer to him in some regard. I kind of have to. He's not only the treating physician; he's also the only source of information.' McGuire's original medical notes were lost when he was captured by Union soldiers. He recreated them from memory three years later for the Richmond Medical Journal. Pneumonia was common in the Civil War, becoming the third most fatal disease for soldiers. Jackson is the subject of an annual conference Friday at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore that reviews medical diagnoses of historical figures. In the past, researchers have reviewed the deaths of Alexander the Great, Edgar Allan Poe and Abraham Lincoln, among others. DuBose is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, where Jackson was a professor before the Civil War. A large statue of Jackson stands near the campus barracks. So, his legacy and death were ingrained in DuBose's experience as a cadet. Legend: Thomas J 'Stonewall' Jackson, one of the Confederacy's most legendary fighters, is shown in this painting with his troops at Bull Run on July 21, 1861 . Jackson was shot by soldiers from the 18th North Carolina regiment in a moment of confusion. He had led a surprise attack in the Battle of Chancellorsville in Virginia, and the Confederates drove Union forces back about three miles. Civil War historian James I. Robertson Jr. recounts that Jackson wasn't satisfied and rode out at night to review the enemy's position. When he rode back, he was shot by his own soldiers. Then, being dropped during a frantic nighttime rescue may well have contributed to Jackson's death, DuBose found. 'If he had been dropped and had a pulmonary contusion, or bruise of the lung, it creates an area of the lung that doesn't clear secretions real well, and it can be a focus that pneumonia can start in,' DuBose said. 'That's probably what happened in this particular instance.' DuBose, a U.S. Air Force veteran, said pulmonary embolism - a blockage of the major blood vessel in the lung - still occurs in nearly 6 percent of combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is even more common among those who have amputations, as Jackson did. Still, the debate will continue over Jackson's death. A painting commemorating the last meeting between General Robert Lee and Stonewall Jackson, the two confederate leaders of the U.S. Civil War . Dr. Philip Mackowiak, an internist who organizes the conference each year, said he differs with DuBose on the Jackson case. He reviewed the records and said he believes a recurrent pulmonary emboli destroyed Jackson's lung over time, leading to his death. The medical records don't describe Jackson coughing, as one would expect with pneumonia, Mackowiak said. It's impossible to know for sure what killed Jackson. But DuBose said modern medicine could have saved him. Jackson's doctor didn't have the tools or knowledge to treat the complications after the shooting. Robertson, a former Virginia Tech historian and professor who wrote Jackson's biography, said he has been persuaded that sepsis, caused by severe infection, killed Jackson, due to his chaotic rescue and unsanitary conditions. He noted, though, doctors at the time agreed Jackson had pneumonia. 'Unfortunately, medicine in the mid-19th century was still in the dark ages,' he said. 'Obviously, I'm not overly concerned with how he died. I'm terribly concerned that he died.' Jackson was a pivotal figure and perhaps the most esteemed soldier in the war, Robertson said. He was known for secrecy and speed to execute surprise flank attacks for Gen. Robert E. Lee's strategy. 'He was killed in what may be the high-water mark of the Confederacy,' Robertson said. 'You can make a case that after Chancellorsville, it's just a question of time for Lee.'","Confederate fighter Thomas J 'Stonewall' Jackson was shot on May 2, 1863 .

Police have released the image in a bid to track down the culprits for the attack and photographs of Mr Topping's injuries have also been published. Police have released a picture of these men they want to speak to in connection with the attack . He suffered a fractured left cheekbone and deep cuts to his forehead in the 2.30am incident. The . assault happened after Mr Topping had been with members of his family . celebrating at the Bliss nightclub in Wigan town centre in Greater . Manchester. Police said Mr . Topping got into an argument with a man who bumped into him on the . nightclub dancefloor and knocked him to the side. His son stepped in to calm the argument down and they both left the club, with other friends and family members.

Is the the most luxurious drive-thru ever? Selfridges is set to launch a drive-thru so customers can collect designer handbags on the go . You don't even need to lift a finger (or pay for parking) because after ordering your luxurious goods, they will be brought to your car by the department store’s staff. The exciting new concept, which is set to be up and running by January 2014, is part of the 104-year-old store’s massive online push. Inspiration: Taking inspiration from fast food drive-thrus such as Mcdonalds, Selfridges hope to have the concept up and running by January 2014 . Speaking to The Evening Standard, Simon Forster, the company’s multi-channel director said: 'There will be a dedicated area providing the level of service you would expect from Selfridges. 'It will not just be the first drive-thru service, it will be the best.' Currently, around half of Selfridges products are available to order online but the store predict that everything but perishable food will be available to purchase online by the end of the year.

The Provo model, from Korean car-maker Kia, is billed as a 'radical super-mini coupe  which aims to set the streets alight'. But critics say Provo has unfortunate echoes of the name by which the Provisional IRA was known during its terror campaigns across Britain and Northern Ireland. Unfortunate: Critics say Kia's new Provo model echoes the name by which the Provisional IRA was known . Kia said the name had been chosen at its European headquarters in Frankfurt. A spokesman said: 'There was absolutely no intention to cause offence. The name comes from  'provoke' – as in provoking a reaction.' Ironically, despite the name, the roof of the model on display at the Geneva Motor Show is orange - the colour most closely associated with the Loyalist community in Northern Ireland. The Provo is powered by a turbo-charged 1.6 T-GDi 204 horse-power petrol engine linked to a smart four-wheel-drive hybrid electric system that can add another 45 horse-power surge to the rear wheels as required and also allowing low-speed electric-only motion. It is not the first time foreign car firms have come a cropper with their choice of names. The term Provo is associated with the Provisional IRA in Ireland and the UK. Pictured, a group of IRA militants setting fire to a van in Belfast in 1981 . Unintentional: A Kia spokesman said the company has 'absolutely no intention to cause offence' German car bosses at Volkswagen got into trouble in January 2012 launching the 'Black Up!' city car. Volkswagen executives in Britain argued successfully for the name to be changed in the UK to the 'Up! Black', fearing that it could give offence to ethnic minorities because of the connotation of white actors and singers 'blacking up' on stage to perform as minstrels. But in Germany and across the rest of Europe it continued to be sold as the 'Black Up!' because VW said the term did not have the same ‘resonance’ as in Britain. Volkswagen's British arm had sought in vain in the mid 1990s to change the name in the UK of its first people-mover called the 'Sharan' fearing it sounded too close to 'Sharon' and had connotations of the downmarket 'Kev and Sharon' from Essex. German bosses overruled them. Toyota’s MR2, when pronounced by French owners, sounds uncannily like 'merde!', while Mitsubishi’s Shogun off-roader is called the Pajereo in many markets - despite sounding like a rude Spanish word for a sexual act. Road wars: The Provo is set to take on the Mini and is billed as a 'radical super-mini coupe' Mitsubishi also produced a car called the Zero - the same name as the legendary Japanese fighter which inflicted such heavy casualties on the allies during World War II. In the 1960s Rolls-Royce, now owned by Germany’s BMW, were apparently going to call their successor to the Silver Cloud the 'Silver Mist' until it was pointed out that 'Mist' in German means pile of manure or dirt. General Motors, parent company of Vauxhall and Opel, produced a car called the Nova, which in Spanish-speaking markets means ‘no go.’ Nissan has had a Cedric and a Pantry Boy, though not in UK markets. Japan’s Mazda missed a beat with its Bongo and Bongo Friendee.","Critics say Provo echoes name by which the Provisional IRA was known .

David Cameron has warned North Korea that it would be 'unacceptable' to defy calls for rocket tests to be abandoned. Speaking on a visit to nearby Japan, the Prime Minister urged the state to 'take a different path' and engage with the international community. Mr Cameron and counterpart Yoshihiko Noda discussed the threat from North Korea when they held talks today. The nuclear-armed regime is putting the finishing touches to a rocket that it says is designed to put a satellite into orbit. However, the US believes the launch - due this week - is a cover for testing a ballistic missile and Japan has deployed its anti-missile systems. 'On the issue of North Korea we have said very clearly and the Japanese and others have said that it is unacceptable to launch these satellites and missiles,' Mr Cameron told TV station News Zero. 'Now there is a new leadership in North Korea they should be taking this opportunity to change their approach, engaging with the rest of the word and stopping this sort of activity. 'If they go ahead it should be condemned in the strongest possible terms by the UN Security Council. 'We have to send the clearest possible message... Clearly North Korea is quite a bankrupt country; they are unable to feed their own people and interestingly America has been helping. 'We need to explain that they need to take a different path. They need to do less in terms of weapons and the military and more engagement with the rest of the world. 'If they launch this satellite, that is clearly a breach of the UN resolution that has already been ratified.' He will also call for faster progress towards establishing a free trade area between the EU and Japan. Japan . is still the world’s third largest economy despite enduring a 'lost . decade' of stagnation - similar to that predicted by some for Britain. They . will also hold talks on the dangers posed by nearby North Korea - which . is expected to stoke controversy by test firing a rocket later this . week. However, Mr Cameron’s focus on wider . political and economic matters is unlikely to mean he escapes pressure . over the continuing domestic fallout from the Budget and civil liberties . rows that have been dogging the coalition. Speaking to Japanese newspaper Yomiuri ahead of his visit, he said the countries were 'old friends' but wanted to deepen ties. 'There’s an important diplomatic, political sense to this. 'But . also I think that we’re both in need of economic growth and economic . development, and I think the chance of expanding our trade and . investment ties is very strong... 'There is obviously very important inward investment from Japan into Britain. 'We’re . very proud of the fact that companies like Nissan, Toyota, Honda - all . of whom I’ve visited in the UK - very proud of that investment. I want . to see a new generation of investment into those plants. 'But also we think there’s a big opportunity to open up greater exports from Britain into the Japanese economy.' Mr . Cameron went on: 'I greatly admire and respect the way the Japanese . have overcome the enormous challenges of recovery following last year’s . earthquake. 'The UK stood by Japan in the . immediate aftermath of the earthquake when we kept our Embassy open in . Tokyo and through the reassuring advice of our Chief Scientific Adviser, . Sir John Beddington, who will be joining me on this trip. 'Looking . to the future, we want to continue to support the Japanese as they . reconstruct the Tohoku region and tackle the challenges of the nuclear . clean-up.

Mr Cameron talks with Nissan's Executive Vice President Andy Palmer as Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga looks on.  (Right) An employee takes a photograph of the Prime Minister during a tour of the factory . Speaking to journalists on the flight to Japan, Mr Cameron said: 'Part of the job of the Prime Minister is to load up an aeroplane full of business people, large and small, get our exports up, get our investment up, get out there and fly the flag for Britain. That is what I am trying to do this week.' He insisted there was no moral issue with taking arms manufacturers on such trips. 'There are a number of defence manufacturers with us,' he said. 'I’m completely upfront about that because we do have a very strong defence sector. It accounts for a lot of jobs, we have some of the toughest rules on defence exports anywhere in the world. 'But as these countries, particularly Japan, that have tended in the past to buy only American equipment are opening up, there are opportunities for people like AgustaWestland, who make helicopters, who are on this plane. 'I think that’s perfectly responsible and respectable.' Landmark: Cameron will meet with Burma's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday . David . Cameron is to become the first Western leader to visit Aung San Suu Kyi . since the Nobel Peace Prize laureate was elected to parliament.

Andrew Mitchell was clinging to his job last night as Downing Street struggled to contain open revolt over his future. The Chief Whip was effectively put on probation as he was ordered to try to ‘rebuild relations’ with MPs furious at the controversy caused by his row with Downing Street police. The abrasive Cabinet minister caused further consternation by appearing to change his story – insisting he did not swear at officers who told him he should use a side gate rather than have the main entrance specially opened for him and his bicycle. Under-fire Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell shouted across the Commons chamber that he did not swear at police, but the row refuses to go away . Mr Mitchell’s deputy John Randall had . to be talked out of quitting last night, and sources said at least one . other whip – whose job is to maintain party discipline –was considering . resigning rather than work under him. Previously, Mr Mitchell’s allies had . not disputed that he swore during the altercation, though they firmly . reject police claims that he called officers ‘plebs’ and ‘morons’. The . Chief Whip had been understood to be claiming that he told an officer: . ‘You guys are supposed to ****ing help us.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband used Prime . Minister’s Questions to claim Mr Mitchell is ‘toast’ and accuse David . Cameron of ‘total double standards’ for supporting police in arresting . yobs who swear at officers but refusing to sack his own minister. But sitting on the government frontbench, the Chief Whip was seen mouthing the words: ‘I didn’t swear.’ Labour party leader Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of 'total double standards' for not sacking Mr Mitchell . Tory MP Michael Fabricant, a whip . until last month’s reshuffle, said: ‘Several MPs have confirmed to me . that Andrew Mitchell did indeed say “I didn’t swear”. ‘This puts a whole new light on the . issue. Labour were never going to let the story go away, but now he has . managed to re-ignite it himself.’ At a meeting of the backbench 1922 . committee last night, five MPs – Anne Main, James Duddridge, Andrew . Percy, Sarah Wollaston and Philip Davies – openly questioned Mr . Mitchell’s position. Another three said they felt he should . have resigned earlier on and they were only backing him because it . would be even messier to throw him overboard now. The Prime Minister (left) and the Labour leader went head to head in the Commons for the first time since Mr Mitchell lost his temper after being told he could not ride his bike through the main gates of Downing Street . Mr Percy complained the row had become . so widely discussed that he had had to listen to sermons in church on . Mr Mitchell’s behaviour. However, more than ten MPs, including Bernard . Jenkin, chairman of the public administration committee, spoke in his . favour. Sources said the mood had largely been against giving the Police . Federation – which has been waging a campaign to force Mr Mitchell out . of his job – a scalp. Some MPs said they felt sorry for Mr . Mitchell because he appeared to have lost weight and now cuts a ‘pitiful . figure’.One senior source said the Chief Whip would now have to work . hard to build credibility with MPs. In a less than resounding endorsement . of Mr Mitchell’s position, a senior figure in the party admitted that . his job was safe only because ‘no new facts’ have emerged in the last . month and that MPs judged it would have been ‘a messy ending’ to see him . quit now. Mr Mitchell ranted at officers after being told he to get off his bike and use a side exit to leave Downing Street . In the Commons, Mr Miliband pointed to . Mr Mitchell and insisted he should have been arrested. ‘While it is a . night in the cell for the yobs, it is a night at the Carlton Club for . the Chief Whip. Isn’t that the clearest case there could be of total . double standards?’ he said. ‘His position is untenable. In other words, . he is toast.’ Mr Cameron replied: ‘What the Chief . Whip did and said were wrong. I am absolutely clear about that. That is . why it was important that the Chief Whip apologised and that apology was . accepted.’ Last night Mr Mitchell’s denial that he swore at the police . was challenged by officers who met with him to discuss the incident. Stuart Hinton, of the Warwickshire . Police Federation, tweeted: ‘Having been in the meeting with Mitchell on . Friday and having asked questions, I am now confused – he told us he . DID swear!’ Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said: . ‘The Police Federation are trying to remind us they are a powerful trade . union. Most people have at some time lost their temper, said something . they should not, and had to apologise fairly abjectly afterward when . they felt ashamed of themselves.’","The Chief Whip heckled Labour leader Ed Miliband to insist he did not swear .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 03:53 EST, 23 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:26 EST, 23 April 2013 . Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, pictured in Glasgow today, denied getting panicky about the state of the economy . George Osborne today denied getting ‘panicky’ about the state of the British economy as new figures revealed borrowing by the government remains stubbornly high. Borrowing fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12. It is is worse than City hopes for a £117 billion deficit in the financial year. Asked today if was ‘getting a bit panicky’ about the economy's parlous state, Mr Osborne replied: ‘No, no, no. The answer is no.’ The government has trumpeted its efforts to cut the deficit as proof its austerity cuts are working. The headline borrowing figure for last year stood at £86.2billion. But when the transfer of Royal Mail pension assets to the public purse, plus cash transfers from the Government's quantitative easing programme, are factored in it stands at £120.6billion. This is only down £300million on the £120.9billion borrowed by the government in 2011-12. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects borrowing to remain high at £120billion in the next year to March 2014 as well. Mr Osborne was forced to deny being ‘cute’ by claiming that the deficit – the gap between what the government spends and what it raises in taxes - had fallen by a third. ‘It’s not being cute at all. The budget deficit was 11.5 per cent of our national income when this Government came to office, it is now forecast to be just under 8 per cent - that is a reduction, it’s a reduction of a third thanks to the very difficult decisions,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘As a result, the British economy, when you compare it to lots of its neighbours, of course faces a difficult situation but not nearly as difficult as those other countries that have not faced up to their problems, that have not supported their private sector, that have not made themselves more competitive so they can compete in the global race.’ The Chancellor is under pressure ahead of figures on growth out this Thursday which will show if the economy is back in recession . Underlying figures show the government borrowed £120.6billion last year, compared to £120.9billion in 2011-12, the Office for National Statistics said . But Labour claimed today's borrowing figures were proof that the government's plan is not working. Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said: 'These figures show that the government’s failed economic policies have been totally self-defeating as a flatlining economy has seen deficit reduction grind to a halt. 'Underlying borrowing was essentially the same last year as the year before and the OBR forecasts it will be around the same this year. 'George Osborne no longer has a deficit reduction plan. In fact, at this rate, it will take 400 years to balance the books.' Total public sector net debt was a . record £1.186 trillion in March, equating to 75.4 per cent of GDP and up from £1.1 trillion a year earlier. IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer said the pace of deficit reduction 'makes a snail look fast'. He said: 'March public finance data are unlikely to take the heat off . the Chancellor and he faces another very difficult year ahead on both . the growth and the public finance fronts.' James Knightley at ING Bank said that while the March outcome was a . little better than expected, the 'underlying story on the UK's fiscal . position was one of hardly any improvement despite so much talk of . austerity'. A Treasury spokeswoman said: 'Though it is taking time, the Government is fixing this country's economic problems. 'The deficit is down by a third, a million and a quarter new private . sector jobs have been created and interest rates are at near-record . lows, benefiting households and businesses.' Figures on Thursday will reveal whether or not Britain has fallen into an unprecedented triple dip recession . The Chancellor is under pressure ahead of figures this week which will show if the UK managed to avoid an unprecedented triple-dip recession by growing in the first three months of the year. The International Monetary Fund last week cut the UK's growth forecast growth from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent for this year and 2014's projection from 1.9 per cent to 1.5 per cent, noting the recovery was 'progressing slowly'. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard has accused Mr Osborne of ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with cuts despite a lack of growth. But today Mr Osborne dismissed Mr Blanchard’s criticism as  ‘one voice, one person’. The Chancellor told BBC Radio 4: ‘What the IMF has said actually is that the United Kingdom is forecast to grow more than Germany, than France, than the rest of the eurozone – that is one voice, one person. ‘The chief economist has a well-known set of views on this, which he has expressed in various forms over several years. The IMF will do its analysis of the British economy, as it does all economies – it’s coming to Britain in May to do that.’ Of the major economies listed in the IMF's World Economic Outlook, the prediction of 0.7 per cent growth puts the UK well below the US, Canada, Japan and much of Europe . Mr Blanchard has been a longstanding critics of the UK’s austerity programme. Last week he said: ‘The UK economy has turned out to be somewhat weaker than had been foreseen, so our view is that the pace of consolidation ought to be reconsidered, and we’ll want to come and have some discussions about that.’ Yesterday it also emerged that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has privately voiced frustrations at the different approaches to the economy taken by Mr Osborne, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Vince Cable. Sir Jeremy told senior bankers that the Prime Minister is prioritising exports, Mr Clegg wants regional growth schemes, while Business Secretary Mr Cable wants to pressure the banks into lending and Mr Osborne is concentrating on infrastructure. Sir John Gieve, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, also questioned whether the Chancellor is truly in charge of his economic policy. In a newspaper article published yesterday, Sir John pointed out that Mr Osborne has subcontracted much of his policy to the Bank, which is in charge of quantitative easing - effectively printing money in a bid to boost the economy. ‘It leaves unclear who is in charge,’ he wrote. ‘The chancellor is responsible for the strategy of monetary activism alongside fiscal and prudential retrenchment. But he has not given himself the powers to determine the policy mixture’.","Chancellor insists he is taking the right 'tough decisions' for the economy .

The 41-year-old comedian got an A* after undertaking the paper for the Radio Times to promote his maths TV show School Of Hard Sums. After completing the test - a GCSE higher-level paper from June 2011 - O Briain asked: 'Are you sure that's not an ordinary-level paper and then there's another harder one? Surely? What do you do if you're really bright?' Maths and theoretical physics graduate Dara O Briain has lamented the standard of a maths GCSE paper . He told the magazine: 'I don't believe that my generation is the point at which evolution peaked. 'That makes no sense to me. But I'd find that paper very boring. I'd be racing to finish it and get out of the door.' He added: 'There should be an additional, challenging paper. I don't mind there being a general paper to help you get some idea of what kids can do. 'But that's like the first 10 questions that you can just bang off before you get to the meaty stuff. There's nothing unexpected or unusual there. 'And that's why they're not interesting. That's the most telling criticism of it all - they're not very interesting questions.' O Briain, a maths and theoretical physics graduate, added: 'Maths is the language in which the universe is written. It's innate to the human brain and is a spectacular thing that we've discovered/invented. Also it permeates our lives. Mr O Briain got an A* after undertaking the paper for the Radio Times to promote his maths TV show School Of Hard Sums . 'If you have to discuss something in terms of its utility, we're moving increasingly to being a technological society and therefore you need to be conversant with it. 'But in all honesty, I am over discussing things in terms of their utility, as if education is just training for jobs - it isn't. 'I encounter the same argument in teaching obscure languages: it fires neurons in different ways, helps you with problems. The example I quote is if people really understood probability, they'd save a lot of money on lottery tickets.' O Briain said that a report that the strongest UK maths students, while on an equal footing with their counterparts in the Far East at age 10 had fallen two years behind them by the age of 16, was 'shocking'. 'It reminds me of this joke on (US satirical show) Saturday Night Live', O Briain said. 'They said 'This week President Obama held the largest single class, where they linked several hundred American schools and they all sang a song, I Wanna Play, and it was an amazing, beautiful event.

Controversial support: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe agrees that all arrests should be carried out secretly . Britain's most senior police chief is backing controversial rules to ensure that all arrests, including those involving high-profile figures, are carried out in secret. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner, has insisted that new guidelines being drawn up by the Association of Chief Police Officers are as draconian as possible. It follows Lord Justice Leveson’s call in his report on the media for a blanket ban on naming suspects. Under the new rules, police will be banned from confirming suspects’ names, even when journalists know their identity. Without confirmation, the legal risks of incorrect identification will prevent the media publishing suspects’ names. A senior source who is close to the proposed rules and has met Andy Trotter, the ACPO officer in charge of the guidance, said Sir Bernard was driving through the changes. The source said part of the reason for his determination to enforce the blanket restriction was growing concern that Scotland Yard was committing disproportionate resources to high-profile arrests. He said: ‘It was put to me that ‘‘we arrest so many people that it would be ridiculous to name everybody’’.’ The claim emerged at the same time as the former Director of Public Prosecutions condemned the police plans. Lord Macdonald QC, said: ‘There should be a presumption police will reveal names of arrested people... It’s important the public are told who police are locking up.’ Sir Bernard, who is in charge of more than 30,000 police officers, is also said to be concerned about the harm caused by publicity surrounding an arrest when the individual may later be released without charge. Support: Home Secretary Theresa May also backed plans for anonymity . The police plan for ‘secret arrests’ is opposed by the Law Commission, the Government’s own adviser on legal reform, which believes it is in the interests of justice that police release the names of everyone who is arrested, apart from exceptional cases. Lord Macdonald said: ‘My experience as DPP showed it is common that an arrest triggers other victims  to come forward.’ Yesterday it emerged that Home Secretary Theresa May had intervened in the debate by writing to all chief constables, saying she also backed plans for anonymity in arrests. ‘I believe that there should be a right to anonymity at arrest, but I know there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that  an arrested suspect should  be named,’ she said.","Under new rules police will be banned from confirming suspects .

Labour Party conference in 2008 . Former Cabinet Minister James Purnell is at the centre of claims that he ‘covered up’ his membership of a Labour Party social club in an attempt to defuse the controversy over his new high-powered job at the BBC. His appointment as the BBC’s £295,000-a-year director of strategy and digital has angered senior Conservatives because he was a Labour MP between 2001 and 2010 and served as Culture Secretary under Gordon Brown. Mr Purnell’s boss, BBC director-general Lord Hall, insists that Mr Purnell is now impartial, having ‘hung his boots up at the door and left politics behind’. But doubt has been cast on this claim after it emerged he is still listed in the 2013 edition of Who’s Who as a member of Stalybridge Labour Club near Manchester. The BBC insisted the entry was a mistake – only to be contradicted by the club. The saga then took a farcical turn when a club stewardess mistook a Mail on Sunday reporter for Mr Purnell and told him: ‘Sorry, James, a reporter has been on and caught me unawares.’ The club is in Mr Purnell’s former Stalybridge constituency. Disgraced BBC presenter Stuart Hall has also been a frequent visitor. When a reporter first rang the club, the stewardess said Mr Purnell ‘definitely’ belonged, adding: ‘Something happened the other week and his name came up.’ But when the BBC was asked if Purnell was still a member, a spokesman insisted he left the club in 2010. A Mail on Sunday journalist then phoned the stewardess, saying he wanted to ‘talk about James Purnell’. Mishearing, the stewardess said: ‘Sorry, James, I can’t really hear what you are saying but it’s about a journalist from the Mail who has been on. He caught me unawares. But when he called back again later, I said I couldn’t divulge anything.’ A club regular later claimed Purnell had been there as recently as last autumn. Awkward questions: Is James Purnell still a member of Stalybridge Labour Club in Tameside, Greater Manchester? And a source at Who’s Who confirms that although Purnell has updated some details since 2010 in his listing, he has never removed his membership of the club. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It appears James Purnell has not been totally straight about this matter and hasn’t hung up his political boots.’ A BBC spokesman last night insisted Mr Purnell left the club in 2010. The spokesman said the confusion had arisen from an outdated Who’s Who entry – and falsely accused The Mail on Sunday of masquerading as James Purnell in a phone conversation. 'No longer political': James Purnell with then Prime Minister Gordon Brown . A spokesman said: ‘The Stalybridge Labour Club has confirmed that James Purnell has not been a member since 2010. The only contact Purnell has had with the club in the last three years was this week when a trustee alerted him to journalist enquiries and a phone call they had received from someone purporting to be Purnell but who was not him.’ James Purnell said: ‘I have not been a member of the Stalybridge Labour Club since 2010.

But this unique living tree root bridge called 'Jembatan Akar' is actually a vital link to connect the residents of two tiny villages in Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The bridge was created by weaving a combination of roots into two Kubang trees placed on either side of the Bayang River that gradually grew strong enough over the course of 26 years for the residents of of Pulut-pulut and Lubuak Glare to use it as a crossing.

For more than 100 years, families have used the 30 metre bridge to reach one another, trade supplies and connect and it is now a mainstay tourist attraction of the province. The incredible engineering was captured by amateur photographer Robertus Pudyanto who visited the villages with help from the locals. Robertus said: 'The root bridge is frequently visited by tourists during the holidays or before Eid as they are considered sacred. 'They are extremely vital to the villagers and their entire lives depend on them. 'The creations are remarkable but you have to be careful when walking on them in the rain as they become slippery - and that's not good when hovering five metres over a fast-flowing river.' Ancient: The 30 metre bridge took 26 years to fully form over the Bayang River and has been used ever since for the last 100 years . Dangerous: Crossing the bridge can be dangerous when it is raining as the water makes it slippery . Woven together: The roots are woven across the river to Kubang trees growing on either side . Root bridges were first created by Muslim Ulama named Pakih Sohan and have been used in the region since 1890. The construction process takes approximately 26 years. They were created after original bamboo bridges were battered and broken by the Bayang River's torrential currents. The process of creating the bridge begins by stringing together tree roots along a stem bridge made of bamboo. They then strengthen and grow over time into a bridge strong enough to cross. Around the base of the bridge, there are thousands Larangan fish that are also considered sacred and are forbidden to be fished or taken. According to local belief, when residents bathe in the Bayang River around the root bridge their hopes and wishes to find love and better fortune will be granted by God.

Family history: Samantha Cameron, wife of the Prime Minister, who researchers have discovered is linked to a 19th Century plantation owner . One of Samantha Cameron's ancestors was a slave owner who received millions from the British government following abolition, researchers have discovered. The Prime Minister's wife is descended from 19th Century businessman William Jolliffe, from West Sussex, whose company was responsible for building Waterloo Bridge, Dartmoor Prison and the new London Bridge. He subsequently gave up his commercial interests to become a vicar, but before he embraced the church Jolliffe was among those who received a huge payout after the 1833 Act of Parliament. The Ballenbouche Estate in St Lucia, which was linked to the prominent businessman, received £4,000 in compensation for 164 slaves, or around £3.25million in today's money. African slaves were brought to St Lucia in the 1700s and the Ballenbouche Estate, a sugar plantation, was probably established in the 1740s. Jolliffe's son was the 1st Baronet Hylton, a former home secretary under the Earl of Derby, who married the daughter of the 4th Baronet Sheffield. Mrs Cameron’s father, Sir Reginald Sheffield, . is the 8th baronet and has an estimated fortune of £25m. Her intriguing ancestry was revealed by researchers looking into the records of the Slave Compensation Commission, which was set up to manage the £20m fund. Their findings appear in a database, the Legacies of British Slave-ownership, which has been compiled by University College London. Dr Nick Draper, from UCL, was one of several academics who spent three years working on the project. He said that up to 10% of Britons who died in the 18th century had benefited from slavery and that up to 15% of the British elite were involved. 'The amount of money available to the compensation fund reflects how much influence the elite had on the government. 'But they were not so powerful they could not stop the Abolition of Slavery Bill going through.' Human trade: African slaves, like those depicted in this file picture, were sent across the world including to St Lucia, where Samantha Cameron's ancestor had a sugar plantation. Historic: Normanby estate, near Scunthorpe, has been in Samantha Cameron's family since the 16th Century . Family links: Samantha Cameron's father Sir Reginald Sheffield is the 8th Baronet Hylton . Mrs Cameron descends from a long line of aristocrats on both sides of her family. Her father, who is a direct descendent of Charles II, can trace his bloodline back to the Knights Templar and the Fifth Crusade, and owns 3,000 acres of prime Lincolnshire farmland. Much of the furniture at his country home once graced Buckingham Palace - which was the family's London pad, before they passed it on to the Queen. His family's crest is a boar's head framed by two arrows. He lives in Thealby Hall, north Lincolnshire, and manages the 3,000 acre Normanby estate, near Scunthorpe, which has been in the family since the 16th century. He also owns Sutton Park, near York. Mrs Cameron's mother, Annabel Jones, is descended from the 10th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. After divorcing Sir Reginald, she married the aristocratic Viscount Astor. Meanwhile husband David is descended from King William IV and according to Debrett's is the fifth cousin, twice removed, of the Queen. The Camerons' combined wealth is estimated in excess of £30m.

Daytime viewers will get to see only seven new shows. It also emerged an episode of Homes Under the Hammer, first shown in February last year, was repeated three times in just five days last month. The BBC’s new daytime controller, Damian Kavanagh, recently defended the corporation’s decision to air repeats. He said in the Mirror: 'For us to continue to do the distinctive programming that we aspire to do, we have to play some repeats.' He added: 'If we didn’t play any repeats, we wouldn’t be able to afford to do any original drama in the afternoons and we wouldn’t be able to afford to continue doing campaigning shows.' Mr Kavanagh admitted a 'mistake was made' after the Homes Under The Hammer debacle and added: 'We will try and ensure that never happens again. 'I am happy to give a guarantee that we will leave a gap of at least six months between a repeat of any programme on the same channel.' The Hairy Bikers was also among the most repeated BBC daytime shows . The BBC’s reliance on repeats is down to its money-saving plans after it was forced to freeze the annual licence fee at £145.50 until 2017. Last July, the broadcaster’s annual report revealed 55% of all BBC2 shows were repeats – up from almost 50% the previous year. BBC1’s re-run rate was 33.1%, compared to 32.5% the year before. During peak time, 8.4% of BBC1 shows and 31% of BBC2 programmes are currently re-runs.

The Boston bombings could be a 'gift' to Vladimir Putin in the Russian president's quest to enlist the West as an ally in his fight against the Chechens, according to a prominent opposition leader. Akhmed Zakayev, who was deputy prime minister of Chechnya's breakaway government in the 1990s, insists that Chechen culture is 'not responsible' for the atrocity at last Monday's marathon apparently carried out by Chechen brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. And he also suggests that the Russian government will use the tragedy as an excuse to impose further controls on the Caucasus. Scroll down for video . Claims: Exiled Chechen separatist Akhmed Zakayev, left, says Vladimir Putin will seek to use the revelation that the Boston Marathon bombing was carried out by Chechens as an excuse to oppress them . Mr Zakayev was a leading rebel commander after the break-up of the Soviet Union, when Chechens were fighting for an independent state. After the Second Chechen War which led to Moscow re-imposing central control on the territory, he was forced into exile and is now living in Britain, where he remains a fierce critic of Mr Putin. He told the Daily Beast that the revelation that the main suspects in the Boston Marathon attack which left three dead and more than 170 injured was 'a gift to the Kremlin and Putin'. The Russian government has long sought to link its campaigns in Muslim-majority Chechnya with the global war against Islamist terror, and Mr Zakayev predicted that Boston would make this link seem more natural. 'They will say, ""This is the Chechen,""' he said. Suspects: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his brother Dzhokhar, right, are accused of carrying out the atrocity . This prediction seems to be coming true already, as a number of senior Russians have pointed to the bombings as proof that the Chechens have always posed a threat to the rest. 'There is a sense of frustration that the Western intelligence services have not been fully co-operative with the Russian intelligence services,' former Kremlin adviser Alexander Nekrassov told the BBC yesterday. 'These people who are waging the terrorist threat in Chechnya and beyond are dangerous to everyone, and not just to Russia.' Military adviser Igor Korotchenko used the crisis as an opportunity to warn against allowing exiles from the Caucasus into Western countries as asylum seekers. 'The question we should ask America is why are they not co-operating as much as the Russian secret services want them to on matters of terrorism,' he said. Bomb: The moment the explosives went off at the Boston Marathon's finish line last Monday . Mr Korotchenko added that Britain had 'created a ticking time-bomb' by welcoming exiled Chechens such as Mr Zakayev. Many American commentators have also argued that the U.S. must build stronger intelligence-sharing ties with Russia in the wake of the attack. The Russian reaction to the news of the Tsarnaevs' identity was so swift that Mr Zakayev even suggested that the Moscow government could have had a hand in the attack in order to discredit Chechen separatists. 'Which Chechen military group trained this guy? Nobody trained this guy,' he said. 'I could believe if they come to Moscow that they have some instruction from someone, from Russian special services.' There is no evidence of Russian state involvement in the Boston atrocity, but many believe the Kremlin was responsible for the 1999 apartment bombings which killed 293 and led to the start of the Second Chechen War. Conflict: Russian soldiers patrolling Grozny in Chechnya during the Second Chechen War in 2000 . The alleged Boston terrorists are of Chechen ancestry, but grew up in the independent country of Kyrgyzstan before moving to Dagestan, which borders Chechnya. They moved to the U.S. in 2002, settling in Massachusetts - and Mr Zakayev pointed to the brothers' American upbringing as evidence that Chechnya bears no blame for the atrocity. 'Chechens and the Chechen nation are not responsible what two crazy guys committed in the United States,' he said. 'We always condemn any terrorist actions. These are not the methods to reach our political goal.' He concluded: 'Don't try to link this tragic crime in Boston to the Chechen nation.'","Marathon terror attack 'carried out by two brothers of Chechen ancestry'

Whats more, the number of older people contracting STIs had risen, HealthExpress having treated 453 patients who over the age of 60. A 2010 report from the Health Protection Agency found a rise in the number of people in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s having sex with new partners since 2000. The study also found that there had been an increase in all of the five main STIs in older age groups, with the age group 45 to 64 witnessing the biggest rise in syphilis, herpes, chlamydia and genital warts between 2000 and 2009. ‘For the last two decades, the number of reported STIs has continued to increase, despite further education drives to teach us how to have safe sex,’ said Dr Hilary Jones, Medical Adviser at HealthExpress. ‘There are a number of STIs that can be caught from either unprotected sex or close contact. ‘Some are treatable, such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea, however those caused by viral infections such as genital herpes and genital warts may be difficult to treat or be incurable, and you could suffer symptoms throughout your life. ‘Curable, or incurable, all STIs pose a risk to your health and can cause permanent damage or infertility if left untreated, so it is imperative you seek advice if you have been put at risk of infection.' Urgent action is needed to prevent drug-resistant gonorrhoea spreading, say experts. Gonorroea - or 'the clap' - is the second most common STI in England. In 2011 new diagnoses rose to nearly 21,000 - a jump of 25 per cent in just one year. Over a third of cases were men, up from around a quarter in 2010. Professor Cathy Ilson, lead author of the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programe (GRASP) said: ' Ensuring treatment resistant gonorrheoa strains do not persist and spread remains a major public health concern.' Cases of treatment failure have been reported globally and, with no antimicrobial agents in the pipeline, England's Chief Medical Officer recently advised government to add the threat of infection resistance to frontline antibiotics to the civil emergencies risk register.

Spain plunged deeper into crisis yesterday amid mounting fears that it will need an emergency bailout to save it from financial ruin. Borrowing costs soared and the cost of insuring Spanish debt against default hit a record high as investors fretted about the health of the economy and banking system. The bleak start to the week sparked warnings that Spain will be the fourth eurozone country to need a bailout following the rescues of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. A report by the International Monetary Fund is today expected to warn that the eurozone faces recession this year with Spain and Italy among those economies worst hit. ‘We’re back in full crisis mode,’ said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a strategist at banking giant Rabobank. ‘It is looking more and more likely that Spain is going to have some form of bailout.’ Spain is suffering from a deep economic slump following a spectacular and bruising crash in its property market. Unemployment is the highest in Europe with a record 4.75million out of work. Half of Spanish youngsters do not have a job. The government is battling to cut the crippling deficit and has embarked on one of the toughest austerity programmes in Europe. But Madrid recently admitted that the deficit will fall from 8.5 per cent of national output last year to 5.3 per cent this year – more than the 4.4 per cent  planned. Economy minister Luis de Guindos yesterday conceded that the country was back in recession. Anger: Frustration at what is seen as a never-ending line of cuts has resulted in a series of riots across Spain in recent weeks . He said the first three months of 2012 . followed ‘a similar pattern to the last quarter of last year’ when . output fell 0.3 per cent – resulting in two consecutive quarters of . decline. Japan pledged to loan $60billion to the International Monetary Fund today in an effort to ensure the debt crisis in some European economies will not spread. Japanese finance minister Jun Azumi said the emergency loan will use its foreign exchange reserves. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde welcomed the move and encouraged other fund members to do the same. She said: 'This is an important step forward in the ongoing international effort to strengthen the adequacy of the global resources available to prevent and fight crises and to promote global economic stability.' IMF lending is expected to be on the agenda when finance chiefs from the Group of 20 leading economies meet in Washington later this week. Spanish ten-year bond yields – the . interest the government pays to borrow money – jumped above 6 per cent . for the first time this year to 6.17 per cent. That put Madrid firmly back in the . danger zone with yields worryingly close to the 7 per cent level which . triggered emergency bailouts in other countries. Borrowing costs in Spain are now . higher than in December when the European Central Bank flooded the . eurozone banking system with cheap funds in a desperate attempt to . prevent another credit crunch and ease pressure on countries such as . Italy and Spain. ‘This artificial high from the ECB . drugs has worn off and now we’re basically back to where we started,’ said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets . Europe. ‘After three months that were calmer . than expected, the euro crisis is back,’ said Holger Schmieding, chief . economist at Berenberg Bank in London. ‘The speed of the recent surge in . yields has elements of a renewed market panic.’ Despite the doom and gloom, European markets opened slightly up this morning. Help: The European Central Bank may be forced to intervene in the Spanish crisis should the country's 10-year government bond rate rise even further . The FTSE 100 started 0.26 per cent up at 5,681.19; France's CAC 40 is 0.30 per cent up at 3,215.03 and Germany's DAX is 0.48 per cent up at 6,656.77. Asian stock markets also vacillated between gains and losses today as signs of a recovering U.S. economy offset Spanish fears. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.2 per cent to 9,487.59 as the yen stabilised against the dollar. But South Korea's Kospi index slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,990.29 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.3 per cent to 20,558.38. On the up: Chaos in euroland has pushed the pound to a 19 month-high against the single currency . Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained marginally to 4,305.90. Benchmarks in mainland China, Singapore and Taiwan fell while Indonesia and the Philippines rose. A strong retail sales report in the US was not enough to counteract fears that the debt crisis enveloping Europe's smaller economies might morph into something even bigger. 'Eurozone stress, particularly in Spain continues to act as a weight on market sentiment, with equity markets ignoring a relatively strong US retail sales report,' said analysts at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.

A collection of motoring memorabilia saved from the skip and restored to its former glory is set to make its owner a millionaire. Robin Barnard has spent the past 40 years amassing hundreds of classic petrol pumps, enamel signs, rare petrol globes and motorbikes. Many of the 800 items have been salvaged from skips and rubbish dumps for free before being painstakingly restored by the devoted 72-year-old. Golden age: Auctioneer Richard Edmonds with a lovingly preserved BSA M20 AA motorbike, one of the centrepieces of Robin Barnard's £1million motoring memorabilia collection . Bygone era: The collection includes more than 30 petrol pumps, some up to nine foot tall and worth £5,000 . Mr Barnard used to run a Grade II-listed 1920s filling station at Colyford in Devon, and displayed many of the items inside it. But his collection grew so big he opened up a small museum in an adjoining building in 2004 to house his memorial to motoring. Mr Barnard has now decided to part with the collection which could fetch up to £1million when it goes under the hammer. He ran the traditional filling station, which is not included in the auction, from 1982 until 2001. Built to last: Classic motoring signs are valued between £50-£200 . Histroy: The artefacts are housed in Mr Barnard's Motoring Memories museum . Light traffic: Classic illuminated motoring signs are much sought-after and can attract prices of £500-£1000 . Rescued: Much of the collection was destined for the scrap heap before Mr Barnard rescued it . The entire collection, which includes some classic and rare vehicles, is worth £1million . The garage was used by Lawrence of Arabia in the late 1920s and has featured in episodes of Top Gear and Miss Marple. Mr . Barnard said: 'In the early 70s I bought a run-down old Ferguson . tractor for five pounds and that's what really got me into collecting . anything to do with motoring. 'A lot of the items were collected just because people were throwing them out, so I'd take them off their hands. Labour of love: The collection was amassed over 40 years . 'When I bought the filling station in 1982 I got rid of the tractors but I kept adding to my collection of motoring memorabilia.' He added: 'Word got round that I was collecting . motoring things and people would phone me up to see if I wanted what . they were getting rid of. 'I didn't always want the stuff but I thought it was a shame to throw it away. I've built it up into quite a special collection.' Included in the collection are more than 30 petrol pumps, some up to 9ft tall and worth £5,000, 300 enamel signs of varying sizes and values and small lapel badges worth around £20. Three motorbikes are up for auction including a genuine 1951 BSA M20 bike used by the AA, which is expected to fetch upwards of £10,000. The majority of the artefacts were collected from within a few miles of the Colyford Filling Station. Mr Barnard, who prior to running the filling station owned a nightclub, added: 'There are a lot of nostalgic items and some beautiful artwork in the collection. 'They're not like the things you see at filling stations today - these things were built to last. 'I love every last bit of the collection and it will be a wrench to see it go but it's become too much for me to deal with. 'Now is the time to pass it on to someone else to enjoy. 'I haven't thought about what I will do with the money - it's more about clearing the decks.' Auctioneer Richard Edmonds said: 'Mr Barnard preserved the historic filling station and filled his museum with beautifully restored memorabilia. 'He was always collecting and restoring things - he saved them for the nation.' The collection will be auctioned by Richard Edmonds Auctions in Chippenham, Wiltshire, on July 13.

Be wary: Chris suffers from rickets due to a vitamin D deficiency and mother Suzi thinks it was caused by high-factor sunscreen . Chris Head’s mother Suzi believed she was doing her best for her sports-mad young son by smothering him in factor 50 sunscreen every time he went out to play. But it meant that the football and cricket-loving youngster had very little exposure to direct sunlight – our main source of vitamin D – despite spending most of his days in the garden. Now Mrs Head has been told her six-year-old son has got rickets, the bone-softening disease caused by a lack of vitamin D, with the high factor sun cream thought to be to blame. The disease, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning in children due partly to lack of outdoor play and to diets low in oily fish, eggs, liver and other foods rich in vitamin D. However some experts also blame the  over-zealous application of sun cream by parents anxious about skin cancer. Vitamin D – known as the sunshine vitamin – is made when the body is exposed to sunlight. Chris first developed joint pain when he was three and would wake up during the night screaming in pain. ‘It would take me hours to settle him and I was constantly having to give him Calpol and ibuprofen,’ said Mrs Head, 43, of Lutterworth, Leicestershire. ‘I would be back and forth to the doctors every couple of months for about two years trying to get a diagnosis, but I was always told that it was probably growing pains.’ It was only when Chris started school that he was referred to a paediatrician who diagnosed serious vitamin D deficiency and rickets. Mrs Head, a mother of two who had to give up her work as a teacher due to ill health, said: ‘I was really shocked when we got the diagnosis. Chris has a balanced diet and plays outside all the time. ‘The doctor told us that the sun was the main source of vitamin D but that using a higher factor sunscreen could stop your body from generating it. Rickets is back: Mother Suzi always thought she was doing right by protecting her son Chris from the sun . ‘After we got home I did some research about rickets and found that Chris had every symptom. Since then I’ve met other mums with children suffering from a similar thing. 'You’re told that the sun is dangerous and you think that by buying the highest factor sunscreen you’re protecting your family, when that isn’t necessarily the case. ‘Now I tend to leave the sunscreen unless Chris is going to be in strong sun all day. ‘I make sure that he goes outside for short bursts of time early in the day or in the evening so he gets his vitamin D without burning.’ Chris is being treated with vitamin D drops and it is hoped that this will eventually remove all symptoms of rickets. But he is still experiencing pain in his bones, so his mother fears that some of the damage may be permanent. Leading paediatric surgeon Professor Nick Clarke said: ‘Practically the only available source of vitamin D is from sunshine. ‘Most children don’t like oily fish and that is practically the only food which contains high levels of it. If you’re protecting against the sun by using a factor 50 sunscreen you will not generate any vitamin D. ‘There is a growing problem because children are outside much less than they used to be. They are texting each other instead of playing outside and parents often drive them to and from school. They are outdoors less than ever before. ‘This can have important consequences for adult life and we are now linking vitamin D deficiency to multiple sclerosis.’ Playing out: Six-year-old Chris now has to make sure his Vitamin D levels are maintained, which means taking in some of the sun when he can .","Chris Head had very little exposure to sunlight when playing out .

X Faxctor judge Nicole Scherzinger’s decision to hide her eating disorder caused tensions which contributed to her former band splitting up, it was claimed. Miss Scherzinger, now a soloist, spearheaded The Pussycat Dolls to international success, selling more than 50million records, before they split in 2010. But former bandmate Carmit Bacher said Miss Scherzinger, 34, damaged relationships within the all-girl group by failing to confide in them about her battle with bulimia, a fact she made public in a interview only last year. Tensions: Singer Carmit Bachar said the Pussy Cat Dolls split because of tensions caused by Nicole Scherzinger's secret eating disorder . Split: The Pussy Cat Dolls broke up in 2010 . According to Miss Bachar, 38, who was . left feeling ‘stupid’ for missing the signs of the illness, it . made Miss Scherzinger fractious. She also blamed the split on Miss Scherzinger’s ambitions for a solo career. Miss Bachar was in London for the Pulse dance tour. Miss Scherzinger, 34, who is in a relationship with British Formula one Champion Lewis Hamilton, has  become known as the sweet natured, slightly goofy, X Factor judge. But as a Pussycat Doll she was ruthlessly ambitious, career driven and prone to mood swings, Miss Bachar said. And her eating disorder, which was revealed last year, made her erratic and temperamental. Miss Bachar, 38, said: ‘It’s quite scary but obviously that can affect you deeply, emotionally obviously there are things there that need to be dealt with too but we were working so hard so we didn’t think.’ Toned: Miss Scherzinger is known for her trim physique . Disorder: She admitted in an interview last year that she had suffered from bulimia . Miss Bachar, who had a successful . solo career before joining the Pussycat Dolls, was the oldest of the six . girls and prided herself on being the one the others could turn to. She . was the Vida Loca girl for Ricky Martin, had danced on stage with . Beyoncé and described herself as being a ‘mumma hen’ to the younger . Dolls. But she missed . the signs of her friend’s illness and as she spoke about their . relationship for the first time she said she felt ‘stupid’ because of . it. ‘I might be stupid and oblivious to things, but I didn’t see any of that,’ she said. ‘Obviously people who have disorders like that are very good at hiding it. I feel stupid though not knowing. We were so close and I was shocked. I thought how could you hide that? ‘We would go out together, go to dinners, label dinners, and we’d all eat and I mean when do you have time to do that? I don’t understand it.’ Success: Miss Scherzinger has gone on to have a solo career and become a judge on the X Factor . Boyfriend: The singer is dating British Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton . Miss Scherzinger, who is known for . her impeccably toned figure, has in the past put her slim frame down to . an exercise regime that included long runs several times a week as well . as regular circuit training and dance sessions. But last October she admitted she had suffered from bulimia on an episode of VH1’s ‘Behind The Music’. She described it as ‘my addiction’ and said she had felt too embarrassed to open up about it sooner. Miss Bachar made her comments during her time in London for the Pulse dance tour (Subs, please leave), said: ‘She’s ambitious and she’s driven and she wanted to have her solo career. We were made very aware of that. ‘I was never thinking about a lead, to me a group is a group, so I thought it was gonna be more of like all of us. ‘We didn’t think it was going to veer to being as much of Nicole as it did. We thought of her as being the lead vocalist and spearheading the situation but then it really became a separation between us.’","Carmit Bacher, 38, said bulimia made her bandmate fractious .

Because, according to a leading family lawyer, couples who overspend on their big day are headed for divorce. Amanda McAlister, head of family law at Slater and Gordon, said eight in ten couples who divorce within five years cite spending too much on the wedding as a reason. But she praised Keira Knightley, whose wedding earlier this month was a low-key affair. Low key: Only 12 guests were invited to Keira Knightley's wedding to Klaxons musician James Righton . Understated: The couple chose this town hall in the south of France for their wedding and were driven away in a Renault Clio . She said: ‘Young people are already under increasing financial pressure with tuition fees and high rents, and the prospect of a lavish wedding ceremony is a huge added strain. ‘The example set by Keira Knightley of abandoning the limo, big dress and expensive cake is one that could prove essential to ensuring a stable and successful partnership.’ Miss Knightley wore an old dress, was driven to the ceremony by her mother in a Renault Clio, invited only 12 guests to the wedding, and gave a low-key reception for just 50. By contrast, Miss McAlister said that young people are frequently drawn into spending over £30,000 on their wedding day. ‘However, after the honeymoon period, . when reality bites, repaying such sums becomes a great strain on the . relationship; along with the ever-increased costs of starting a family . in the shadow of uncertain economic times. ‘In the heat of romance and celebration it can be too easy to ignore the . often crippling long-term implications which naturally impose a huge . strain on new relationships,’ she said in a letter to The Times. She endorsed the view of High Court family judge Sir Paul Coleridge, head of the Marriage Foundation think tank, that more couples should key things low key. ‘More should be done to tackle the issue of young couples in debt and the rising cost of getting married,’ she said. ‘As unromantic as the concept may seem, keeping spending on wedding ceremonies reasonable will build solid foundations for couples and allow the greater financial security that is imperative in today’s economic climate.'","Eight in 10 couples who divorce within five years cite high wedding costs .

Charmer: Juan Ramon Fernandez Paz, nicknamed Joe Bravo, was said to have seduced female security guards while in a maximum security prison . Italian police fear a trans-Atlantic Mafia war after the charred and bullet ridden bodies of two Canadian gangsters were found on the Mediterranean island of Sicily. Convicted killer and mob enforcer Juan Ramon Fernandez Paz, nicknamed Joe Bravo, was discovered along with his associate Fernando Pimentel after an anonymous tip off to police. Investigators said they were 'riddled with at least 30 bullet wounds' and an attempt had been made to burn their bodies following the hit. One senior police source said: 'The hit was ordered from Canada. Paz was the main target and Pimentel was probably killed because he was with him at the time. The fear now is that their could be more blood letting.' The bodies were discovered on wasteland in the hamlet of Casteldaccia, near to the city of Palermo, on the Mafia's island stronghold of Sicily. Paz, 56, had been deported from Canada last year after serving a 10 year jail sentence for drug offences and was in Sicily negotiating with mob bosses in a bid to secure lucrative trans Atlantic drug deals. Italian police were aware that he and Pimentel were in Sicily after being tipped off by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and they were named as wanted in a round up of 24 mobsters earlier this week but could not be found. Investigators say that Paz was working . as the Mafia's 'Canadian ambassador' and was a key player in the . multi-million pound deals using his ties with well known Montreal . Godfather Vito Rizzuto as his introduction. Brutal: Italian police discovered the 'bullet riddled' and charred bodies after an anonymous tip-off . Fears: Police are worried the killings could spark a trans-Atlantic gang war . With his good looks and smart designer clothes Paz could have walked straight of the set of mob TV blockbuster The Sopranos but he had a fiercesome reputation who served time for killing his 17-year-old girlfriend after punching her so hard in the throat she died. Connections: Police believe Juan Ramon Fernandez Paz was a high level player in the clan headed by notorious Godfather Vito Rizzuto . In jail he also had a powerful reputation, threatening inmates and using his influence as an enforcer for Rizzuto to carve himself influence and secure drugs could be smuggled in for inmates. He also managed to secure shipments of drugs from Jamaica and there were even rumours that with his good looks he had managed to seduce female guards at a maximum security jail where he was being held. Unusually, Spaniard Paz had managed to reach a reasonably high level of power within the Rizzuto clan. But as he was not Italian he would never have earned the ultimate accolade of Godfather and his own crime family. Paz had arrived in Sicily last year and had opened a gym in the Palermo suburb of Bagheria and Pimentel is thought to have arrived last month from Canada to visit him, with the last positive sighting of both men being in early April. Pietro Scaduto, 49 and his brother Salvatore, 51, have been arrested by police in Palermo in connection with the murder but they said others were also being sought for the double killing. A police spokesman said: 'We had been monitoring Paz's activities for several months but he had not been seen since early April. He was named in a prosecution order to be arrested and we believe he was involved in drugs trafficking between Canada and Sicily.' Arrested: Pietro and Salvatore Scaduto have been detained in connection with the murders . 'We also think he was using his links with Vito Rizzuto to look into the possibility of importing drugs from South America into Sicily and then onwards to Canada. We shall be liaising with colleagues from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as part of the investigation.' Rizzuto was the Godfather of the Montreal Mafia and was released from a US prison last November after serving a lengthy sentence for three mob murders in the 1980's. During his time in jail a bloody war raged between rival factions in Montreal for control of his empire and his son Nick was a victim, gunned down at the age of 42 three years ago.","Convicted killer Juan Ramon Fernandez Paz, nicknamed Joe Bravo, and associate Fernando Pimentel found dead .

Dr Andrea Cozzolino, 57, is accused of having persuaded a teenager to have her baby and then selling it to a childless couple for £21,000 . An Italian doctor talked a woman out of having an abortion before delivering the baby himself and then selling it on to a childless couple, Italian police say. The gynaecologist, Andrea Cozzolino, 57, is said to have sold the infant to a 54-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman for €25,000 (£21,000) after delivering the student's baby in a hospital near Naples. Cozzolino, who told the teenage mother he would have her baby adopted, was arrested this week on suspicion of corruption and abuse of office. It is alleged that the teenager became pregnant by her student boyfriend and went to Dr Cozzolino to ask him to perform an illegal abortion on her because she did not want her parents to learn she was pregnant. When the doctor said the procedure would cost €6,000, he is believed to have offered to deliver the baby free at the Santa Lucia di San Giuseppe Vesuviano near Naples and put it up for adoption. According to details released by Alessandro Tocco, deputy chief of police in Caserta, where the student is from, Dr Cozzolino went to great lengths to ensure his scheme worked. He made sure the 48-year-old woman was in the same hospital - an exclusive private clinic - at the same time so that the baby boy could be passed to the new family soon after he was born in October 2011. All seemed to have gone to plan until the birth mother discovered a few months later that she had been named on local birth records.  To explain her pregnancy she pretended she had been raped, and in the ensuing investigation the couple who bought her baby were tracked down. The boy was then placed with another couple. According to the Independent, detectives tapped the couple's conversations and heard them demanding their money back from the doctor. Dr Cozzolino is said to have blamed the registration upon the birth being registered quickly before he had had time to step in himself. Police in Naples, pictured, discovered the doctor's alleged scam when they bugged conversations between him and the childless couple . He is also said to have replied he couldn't repay the cash as he had already used it to pay off gambling debts. Adnkronos news agency said the couple who bought the baby, who it named as Carmela Giordano and Elio Miranda, from Salerno, had been asked to report to police.  They, and the birth mother, are reportedly being investigated for alleged breach of Italy's adoption laws. Dr Cozzolino is said to have been suspended by L'Ordine dei Medici medical body pending an investigation.","Andrea Cozzolino, 57, arrested for suspected corruption and abuse of office .

Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weineris running for mayor of New York City, and he's back on Twitter, the social networking portal that destroyed his national political career. And Donald Trump is not amused. 'Sexting Pervert @anthonyweiner has returned to twitter,' Trump warned in a tweet on Tuesday. 'Parents of all underage girls should BLOCK him immediately!' In a second zinger, the Celebrity Apprentice star and real estate mogul asked the question that's now on New Yorkers' minds: 'Will @anthonyweiner be fully clothed in his mayoral ads?' The Donald has never been accused of keeping his thoughts to himself, and Anthony Weiner could be a casualty of the Celebrity Apprentice's massive reach on Twitter . A contrite Weiner announced his resignation from Congress on June 16, 2011 following an earlier press conference where he admitted sextng a series of women over three years . This isn't the first time The Donald has tweeted his outrage at Weiner's re-entry into politics at a high level. 'Sexual pervert Anthony Weiner has zero business holding public office,' he tweeted two weeks ago. In July 2012 when Weiner popped out from hiding to test the mayoral waters, Trump warned that 'he's a sexual pervert & they can never be healed.' He also advised Huma Abedin, Weiner's wife, that she 'should drop him before it happens again.' The 'it' is a reference to the scandal that plummeted Weiner from the heights of national political popularity after he tweeted suggestive private messages to several young women not named Huma Abedin. The two had been married for less than a year when the scandal developed. Donald Trump resumed his tweet-beating of Anthony Weiner on Tuesday, taking jabs at his mayoral aspirations . If Weiner were to go bare-chested in his ads, Trump would certainly yell, 'You're Fired!' - but few New York City voters say they plan to give him a chance . Weiner's exit from the political stage began when one tweet was found to contain a photograph of his erect penis straining against his underwear. He mistakenly sent it as a public tweet instead of a private message, showing millions of Americans what he was doing in his spare time and, some said, from his Capitol Hill office. Another photo unveiled later showed a bare-chested Weiner photographing himself in front of a mirror. Weiner claimed for weeks that his Twitter account had been hacked, but he was dogged all the way by conservative media raconteur Andrew Breitbart, who demanded his resignation daily and insisted that his deception made him unfit for office. The liberal Democrat ultimately stepped down from the House of Representatives in June 2011 after serving nearly seven terms, offering an apology to his constituents - and to Breitbart personally.  He had remained largely out of the public eye since then. The tweet heard 'round the world showed Weiner's genitals, and was meant for a female admirer, but he mistakenly sent it as a message that the world could see. The bare-chested selfie emerged later when a woman who shared it with Andrew Breitbart's website said Weiner emailed it to her . In the months following his resignation, the disgraced former congressman stayed out of the public eye, appearing only a few times on the street of New York with his wife, Huma Abedin, and their son Jordan . In a circus-like 2011 press conference, Weiner admitted that he had 'exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years.' Those women included the pornographic actress Ginger Lee, a Las Vegas blackjack dealer, and a 26-year-old single mother from Texas. Breitbart died tragically of a heart attack the following February. Weiner has kept his tweeting to a minimum since rejoining the network under a new handle - @anthonyweiner instead of @RepWeiner. The most recent of his only three tweets advocates that New York City employees who use tobacco should be forced to pay higher health insurance premiums than their nonsmoking colleagues. A representative for Trump didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Weiner's attorney and representative also didn't return a phone call. In his darkest days, constituents were echoing calls for his resignation. This sign, hoisted outside a car in front of Weiner's ueens, New York home, read, 'Fit for Congress? Resign now!' Trump, shown in the April 2013 All Star Celebrity Apprentice broadcast, may have the last laugh since his Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, reaches more than 2.1 million readers . But the former congressman wil have an uphill climb if he wants to succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A recent poll showed that just 16 per cent of New Yorkers would vote for him, compared to 25 per cent support for City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. A separate poll indicated that more than half of registered Democrats would not even consider voting for him. In July 2012, Trump tweeter that when he was 'in his prime, I predicted that @RepWeiner would never be mayor & I was right for all of the wrong reasons.'","Shamed former seven-term congressman will run for NYC mayor despite sexting scandal that torpedoed his Washington career .

Amazon was warned last month by campaigner Maryon Stewart that other firms were using its site to sell the drugs, but failed to take action. Amazon pulled legal high Salvia from sale after warnings from campaigners and following an article in the Daily Mail . Nitrous oxide and poppers were also on sale on the Amazon website but have now been removed . Following the Mail’s article, however, every entry for salvia, a psychoactive herb, and amyl nitrate – known as poppers – was removed. The company has also removed dozens of listings for similar products in other countries. Mrs Stewart, whose daughter Hester died after taking the drug GBL, founded the Angelus Foundation to raise awareness of the dangers of legal highs. She said Amazon’s action was ‘a great victory’ for the foundation and the Mail. ‘I’m particularly impressed that they took the action so quickly to drop them and on their websites around the world,’ she said. ‘These are dangerous chemicals which are potentially lethal and can cause life-long harm to health. ‘This is a lesson to other retailers, that we really need to be vigilant about what is being sold. ‘People need to understand these are dangerous chemicals which are potentially lethal and can cause life-long harm to health.’ Maryon Stewart, left, whose daughter Hester died after taking the drug GBL, said the removal of the drugs was 'a great victory' for the Mail and the Angelus Foundation she set up to raise awareness on legal highs . The legal high sales were removed after the Mail's article on Saturday . Mrs Stewart urged ministers to take steps to deal with a third product, nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, which is still on sale. She said it should be licensed so it can only be bought by approved companies for a legitimate purpose. Nitrous oxide is used in foam cream dispensers, but is also often abused and can cause death. When contacted by the Mail last week, Amazon said: ‘We act quickly to remove any items that contravene our guidelines [for sellers] and take appropriate action with the seller.’ The listings that were removed include one for Salvia promising ‘the purest extracts at the best prices in the UK’ and citing Press articles describing the psychoactive herb as ‘more powerful than LSD, and legal’. Drug experts warn salvia can trigger psychotic episodes, particularly in young people and those with mental health problems. Amyl nitrate was also was on sale as a ‘bottled room aroma’, but the product description made clear it was intended for use as a drug. The Government’s drug website warns that poppers can cause death by reduced oxygen to vital organs. In June 2011, Eric James, a 46-year-old married father, died after inhaling amyl nitrate on Clapham Common.","Daily Mail revealed that salvia and amyl nitrate were on sale on Saturday .

Exit strategy: Education Secretary Michael Gove said he would vote for Britain to leave Europe if there was a referendum tomorrow . Michael Gove and Philip Hammond . yesterday became the first Cabinet ministers to say publicly that they . would vote for Britain to leave the EU. Government sources said at least seven of their senior colleagues agreed privately. Mr Gove said life outside the EU ‘would be perfectly tolerable’. Mr Hammond, when asked if he would vote to leave if significant powers cannot be reclaimed, replied: ‘Yes.’ The revelations will pile pressure on David Cameron to make clear that he would lead an ‘Out’ campaign if he does not secure a major change in Britain’s relationship with Brussels. If he cannot negotiate a new deal, Chris Grayling, Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, Justine Greening, Francis Maude, Theresa Villiers and Oliver Letwin would all reportedly favour an EU exit. Some Tories are calling for another, earlier referendum seeking a mandate to claw back powers from Brussels, held on the same day as next year’s European elections. Mr Cameron’s inner circle is concerned that, instead of taking a clear stance on Europe and putting pressure on Labour, the Prime Minister’s pledge to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 – after negotiating looser ties – has prompted Eurosceptics to push harder. Some have tabled an amendment to the Queen’s Speech that could be put to a vote tomorrow, lamenting the lack of any legislation in this Parliament guaranteeing a referendum in the next one. They argue that even though such a Bill would have little chance of being passed by the Commons, voters would be reassured that Mr Cameron meant what he said. Mr Gove said yesterday that he and other ministers would abstain in this week’s vote – but added that Tory backbenchers and ministerial aides would be free to vote in favour, a process he described as ‘letting off steam’.

Asked whether he thought . Britain should leave the EU if there were a referendum today, Mr Gove . told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘Yes, I’m not happy with our position . in the European Union. But my preference is for a change in Britain’s . relationship with the European Union. Go to the vote: Lord Michael Forsyth argues the Prime Minister should put 'country before Coalition' ‘My ideal is what the majority of the British public’s ideal is, which is to recognise the current situation is no good, to say that life outside would be perfectly tolerable, we could contemplate it, there would be certain advantages. 'But the best deal for Europe, and for Britain, would be if . Britain were to lead the change that Europe needs.’ ‘My own view . is, let the Prime Minister lay out our negotiating strategy, make sure . he has a majority – which I am convinced he will secure at the next . election – and let’s have the referendum then.' Mr Gove, touted as a . potential successor to Mr Cameron, dismissed Labour’s claims that . allowing Tory MPs to back the Queen’s Speech motion showed the party was . in turmoil, claiming: ‘You can’t have a civil war when everyone is on . the same side.’ However, he admitted that ‘some of my colleagues . want to let off steam’. After Mr Gove’s interview, Mr Hammond, asked on . the BBC’s Pienaar’s Politics radio programme whether he would vote to . leave the EU as things stand, replied: ‘Yes, because I believe that we . have to negotiate a better solution that works better for Britain if we . are going to stay in and play a part in the European Union in the . future. ‘But let me be absolutely clear: I think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the European Union. Support: Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond said they would abstain . ‘We’re going to try and change the rules and change the way it works and change the objectives that it has in order to make it something that works for Britain.’ However, he added: ‘If the choice is between an EU exactly as it is today and not being a part of that then I have to say that I’m on the side of the argument that Michael Gove has put forward.’ Eurosceptic former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said he . would support the Queen’s Speech amendment, adding that the biggest . problem was ‘letting Labour off the hook, because it’s quite clear the .

In his Daily Telegraph column, Boris Johnson said he supported legislation backing a referendum – but warned colleagues that Britain’s problems will not be solved by simply leaving the EU. 'If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate, and we would have to recognise that most of our problems are not caused by ""Bwussels"", but by chronic British short-termism, inadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and underinvestment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure,' he wrote.","Education Secretary said he would vote to exit Europe if there was a referendum held tomorrow .

'Today Croatia is entering Europe, but more importantly Europe is entering Croatia,' Croatian President Ivo Josipovic told the heads of government of all 27 current members, who were attending a summit focused on saving their common currency. British Prime Minister David Cameron also announcemed after an all night sitting that he had 'effectively wielded the veto' to prevent Brussels being handed more powers. Croatia will become the second nation from the former Yugoslavia to join the EU after Slovenia in 2004.

Avid fans of the Doctor have been blamed for causing a stampede for online tickets to the Proms - prompting the system to crash and touts to sell them for more than ten times their original value. The Doctor Who Proms will return for the show's 50th anniversary - and prompted a rush to snap up tickets to the two exclusive performances. The huge demand for tickets - and subsequent crash of the official website - was criticised as 'atrocious organisation'. Sell out! The stampede for tickets meant many were left disappointed as they could not get tickets online or on the phone . More than 100,000 tickets sold online, while the rest were bought over the phone, by post or in person from London's Royal Albert Hall . Visitors were greeted with error messages and hopeful attendees complained of spending four hours trying to get tickets to various shows. Hopeful attendees were left disappointed when their attempts to purchase tickets were abruptly terminated online, or kept for hours on the telephone. Some tickets were already being sold by touts before the weekend was out, with tickets for the much-anticipated Last Night of The Proms advertised for £1,250 - when tickets should have cost between £27 and £95, The Daily Telegraph reported. One customer told the Daily Telegraph he would formally complain after spending two hours online and on the telephone, but continuously met 'error' messages . A record 114,000 tickets for the BBC Proms 2013 have sold since booking opened on Saturday, a 17 per cent rise from last year. More than 100,000 tickets were sold online, while the rest were bought over the phone, by post or in person from London's Royal Albert Hall. The Proms is the UK's premier classical music festival - and ticket sales have seen a 17 per cent rise from last year . Dr Who fans have been blamed as crashing the website as they clamoured for tickets . Fans had hoped to hear Murray Gold's music from the past eight years, early Doctor Who compositions and the work of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. But despite the attacks, BBC Proms director Roger Wright described the 'record-breaking' sales as a 'thrill', the BBC reported. Wright, who is controller of Radio 3, urged people to continue looking. He added that there were still tickets available for the 'vast majority of events' and that 'you can always come and Prom on the day'. The 2013 programme has revealed a diverse programme - featuring rap and punk amid the Elgar and Wagner. The revelation led to the corporation being accused of dumbing down the eight-week festival. The inclusion of rap for the first time is an attempt to attract a younger audience. The Urban Classic Prom includes rappers Maverick Sabre and Fazer, as well as soul singer Laura Mvula, interspersed with pieces by modernist classical composers. Another of the concerts, a 6 Music Prom put together by the radio station’s Steve Lamacq, includes performances from punk veterans The Stranglers and former Catatonia singer Cerys Matthews.","Record 114,000 tickets for the BBC Proms 2013 have sold since booking opened on Saturday - a 17 per cent rise from last year's sales .

The country will be battered by 40mph gales today, with the mercury plunging below the May average of 60F (15C), according to the Met Office. A brolly will come in handy tomorrow when almost an inch (20mm) of rain is expected to fall in the south in just 12 hours. Sunny Sunday: Don't be fooled by today's good weather. Forecasters say it won't last and the coming weather holds prospects of strong rain and wind .

The weather will then revert to a mix of downpours and sunshine. Met Office forecaster Emma Compton said: ‘Over the next five days we will have unsettled weather with temperatures below average.’ She added: ‘It’ll be much wetter on Wednesday with no sun, but more rain in the south east and in the rest of the UK. ‘Thursday and Friday will be pretty unremarkable with rain spreading across the country.’London could see highs of just 57F (14C).

These scenes are a world away from the wind and rain of last week, and the blustery weather to come tomorrow . Blustery: Fierce winds are said to be on their way, because of the position of the Jet Stream . Deserted: Britain's beaches were packed last Bank Holiday Monday, but the weather has since taken a turn for the worse . Met Office forecaster Reid Morrison said: 'Unsettled weather ahead is due to the jet stream being further south . than normal, allowing low pressure systems to track across the UK rather . than further north. 'It certainly looks like the jet stream will remain further south than normal for the next nine days. 'Last summer’s unsettled weather was also due to the jet stream being further south than normal.' Last year's record breaking downpours made it the wettest Summer in England and Wales in 100 years. The jet stream's southerly position is said to have caused the freak downpours.

Referendum vote: Mr Cameron will allow Ministers a free vote next week when Eurosceptics force a vote on the failure to include legislation on an EU referendum in the Queen's speech . David Cameron is allowing senior Cabinet ministers to back an EU referendum Bill and vote against the Queen’s Speech. Eurosceptic MPs will next week force a vote condemning the Queen’s Speech for failing to include legislation on a referendum. The Prime Minister will be on a visit to the US but he has given colleagues a free vote on the issue. Eurosceptic ministers including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, and even Foreign Secretary William Hague, are among at least 100 Conservatives who may support the move, sources said. Labour leader Ed Miliband will today announce that Labour will not back an in/out referendum on Europe, in a move that will dash the hopes of many of his own MPs who think he should match Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum after the next election. In a reference to UKIP leader Nigel Farage, he will accuse Mr Cameron of trying to ‘out-Farage Farage on Britain’s membership of the European Union’. He will say that the Prime Minister is ‘wrong’ to have announced that an in/out referendum will take place and will insist that Britain must stay in the EU. Although Mr Cameron is said to be ‘relaxed’ about next week’s vote, it will be unprecedented for members of the Cabinet to criticise the Queen’s Speech, which they are responsible for writing, in a parliamentary vote. The situation has come about because the Coalition cannot bring forward a Bill to reinforce Mr Cameron’s pledge of a referendum in late 2017 or early 2018 after a renegotiation of Britain’s membership, since it is not supported by the Lib Dems. But Tory Eurosceptics believe the party should underscore the commitment by attempting to introduce legislation, even if it is voted down by the Lib Dems and Labour. Vote: Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague are among 100 Tory MPs expected to support the move next week . They have tabled an amendment that states that the Commons ‘respectfully regrets that an EU referendum bill was not included in the Queen’s Speech’. Though next week’s vote will be largely symbolic, it is expected to be followed by a Bill tabled by backbenchers. Downing Street sources indicated that MPs and ministers may be allowed to vote in favour of that as well. TV presenter Des Lynam (pictured) threw his weight behind UKIP yesterday and said he had penned a song to celebrate. The former Grandstand host revealed he voted for the Eurosceptic party in last week’s local elections, although he admitted it was an act of protest. And – in a tongue-in-cheek reference to Ken Clarke’s description of UKIP candidates as clowns – he rewrote the lyrics to the Stephen Sondheim classic Send In The Clowns. Mr Lynam’s new lyrics include the verse: ‘We used to be rich / Now we are not / But here at last there’s a chance / To stop all the rot / Send in the clowns.’ His backing is another boost for UKIP, which received around a quarter of the vote.  UKIP leader Nigel Farage pledged to lead a rendition of Mr Lynam’s song at the party’s next conference. And it is thought the Prime Minister might vote himself in favour of a private member’s Bill on the issue which is expected to be unveiled within weeks, though it stands no chance of becoming law without Labour and Lib Dem support. London Mayor Boris Johnson, Mr Cameron’s chief rival, yesterday said the Prime Minister’s approach was ‘completely right’. He said: ‘What we need to do is to say to our friends and partners: “Listen chums, this thing isn’t working for either of us”. ‘We need a renegotiation. We need to look at the way the thing is managed.’ The London Mayor said he would only vote to stay in the EU if there was a ‘substantial improvement’ when Britain renegotiates its relationship with Europe. ‘If you get rid of a lot of the barnacles that have accreted around business thanks to European Union regulation and legislation over the last 30 or 40 years, then I’d be content to stay in the single market. ‘But if not, then we should be absolutely clear that we’ve got to be ready to walk away.’ Tory MP Philip Hollobone said that ‘a very large number’ of MPs would support next week’s EU referendum amendment to the Queen’s Speech. ‘There are 81 Conservative MPs who rebelled on the EU referendum issue last time. I wouldn’t be surprised if the number is in excess of 100,’ he said. ‘The Prime Minister is making it quite clear that he wants to have a referendum by the end of 2017, provided he wins. We have to hold his feet to the flames to make sure that comes about.’ Bill Cash, chairman of the European scrutiny committee, said: ‘We need a referendum this side of the general election.’","Eurosceptic MPs will force vote on EU referendum law next week .

New Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today struck a tougher tone on criminal policy . Chris Grayling yesterday ripped up Kenneth Clarke’s hugely  controversial policy of seeking to reduce the prison population. In his first appearance before MPs as Justice Secretary, Mr Grayling took a far harder line on law and order than his predecessor. He told the Commons: ‘The only changes I want to see to the prison population will come through returning more foreign national prisoners to their countries of origin.’ Mr Clarke, who was shifted to the post of minister without portfolio in this month’s Cabinet reshuffle, had angered backbench MPs by shifting away from the party’s  traditional view that ‘prison works’. He claimed that ‘just banging up more and more people for longer without actively seeking to change them is what you would expect of Victorian England’. But Mr Grayling yesterday said his strategy for making room in packed jails would be to try to deport more foreign convicts to serve their sentences overseas. Our jails contain inmates from 156 countries – more than three out of every four nations in the world. The total number of foreign prisoners has risen despite pledges by David Cameron to fix the problem. By March this year, there were 11,127 behind bars, at an estimated cost to the UK public purse of more than £420million. Mr Grayling and his ministers said they wanted to make it a priority to pursue more prisoner transfer agreements so they can be sent home. He also pledged to do ‘a much better job on the rehabilitation of offenders, so far fewer people come back to prison’. Ken Clarke had promised to cut prison numbers when he was Justice Secretary . His comments were applauded by Tory MPs who had been highly critical of Mr Clarke for pursuing ‘soft justice’ policies. Initially, Mr Clarke wanted to slash the prison population by 6,000. He abandoned a Tory election promise to make jail sentences mandatory for youths carrying a knife and proposed huge discounts for rapists and other convicts who admitted guilt at the first possibility. Even after the sentencing discount plan was ditched, following the intervention of No 10, he was still committed to cutting the number behind bars by 2,000. The prison population has been falling recently – down to 86,000, compared with the all-time high of 88,179 in December last year. Mr Clarke also shied away from the full-blooded confrontation with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which many Tory supporters wanted to see after the row over whether prisoners should be allowed to vote. The Ministry of Justice is struggling to balance its books after Mr Clarke agreed to slash £2billion for the department’s £9billion budget. Labour criticised Mr Grayling for shifting away from his predecessor’s policy on prisons and complained about the loss of Mr Clarke from the post. MP Paul Flynn said: ‘We’ve lost one of the few civilised, vintage politicians, who demonstrated that he had a working brain, and that he understood the benefits of remedial work in prison. Haven’t we sadly exchanged old lace for arsenic?’ Mr Grayling replied: ‘He can go on thinking what he likes, but as I’ve made absolutely clear, I also see it as a priority to ensure that we make sure we tackle the rehabilitation challenge and that we stop people going back to prison again and again.’","New minister signals a shift in policy from his predecessor Ken Clarke .

A Grandmother who killed herself left a note apparently blaming the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ for driving her to suicide. Stephanie Bottrill, 53, lived alone in a three-bedroom house after both her son and her daughter moved out. Under the new rules she was told she had to move to a smaller property or lose £80 a month in housing benefit. The bungalow she was offered as an alternative was six miles away from her friends and family. But according to her local Labour councillor, Miss Bottrill, who was unemployed, could barely afford to feed herself, let alone fund the shortfall in rent. On Saturday May 4 Miss Bottrill wrote a series of suicide notes before stepping out in front of a lorry. She died instantly. In one of the notes, addressed to her son Steven, 27, she wrote: ‘Don’t . blame yourself for me ending my life. The only people to blame are the . Government, no-one else.’ Miss Bottrill’s death has renewed the debate over the ‘bedroom tax’ – . described by the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith as the . ‘spare rooms subsidy’. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls seized on the case, saying: ‘There is no . doubt that this policy is driving people to the edge of despair’. However Mr Balls acknowledged that he did not know the details of Miss Bottrill’s case. Home: Meriden Drive in Solihull, where Stephanie Bottrill lived in for 18 years .

She raised her children Steven and Laura, now 23, there alone after . their father left. Steven, a lorry driver with a five-year-old son, said . his mother had an auto-immune deficiency and doctors told her she was . too ill to work. Her £320-a-month rent was paid in full by housing benefit. But her son . moved out several years ago and her daughter left in March. As a result she had two empty bedrooms and was due to have her housing benefit cut by £80 a month. Last night Miss Bottrill’s son told the Daily Mail that his mother had . been on anti-depressants when she died but had never attempted suicide . before. He added: ‘She was fine before this bedroom tax. ‘It was dreamt up in London, by people in offices and big houses. They have no idea the effect it has on people like my mum.’ Neighbours said that on the night before her death Miss Bottrill looked over the garden fence to greet guests at a barbecue. She told them she had been too poor to eat properly for three days and then gratefully accepted a plate of food. Mr Jamieson, leader of the Labour group on Solihull council, said: ‘As . well as not being able to afford food I think it’s possible Stephanie . didn’t have the electricity on.

A new attempt to persuade MPs and peers to back a right-to-die law has been branded ‘Orwellian’ by one of the country’s leading lawyers. Lord Falconer, the former Labour Lord Chancellor, wants to legalise ‘assisted dying’ for terminally ill patients. But he has been accused of using ‘Orwellian spin’ by attempting to distinguish between ‘assisted suicide’ and ‘assisted dying’. Critics say there is no difference between the two. Lord Alex Carlile QC, left, said the terms of Lord Falconer's, right, bill are based on 'euphemisms' and criticised an attempt to call doctors helping a patient to die as 'assisted dying' rather than 'assisted suicide' Among his critics was leading Liberal . Democrat peer Lord Carlile, who said that giving doctors power to help . terminally ill people to die ‘would not pass the public safety test’. Lord Carlile, a prominent QC, said in a . newspaper article: ‘Advocates of such a law tell us that they are not . talking about suicide. They say that helping people who are terminally . ill to end their lives is not assisting suicide because they are . expected to die. ‘This is, of course, nonsense. In law, . as in the English language, if you take your own life, whatever your . state of health, that is suicide; and a doctor or anyone else who . supplies you with the means to do so is assisting suicide. ‘Sound lawmaking demands clarity. It cannot be based on euphemisms, verbal evasions or Orwellian spin.’ Lord Falconer was also accused of . exploiting the impact of right-to-die court cases involving terribly . disabled people to win support for the proposal. Critics said its timing had been . ‘carefully planned’ to coincide with the hearing of the case of Paul . Lamb, 57, a severely disabled former lorry driver, who is seeking . permission for a doctor to kill him by lethal injection. Jane Nicklinson, the widow of Tony Nicklinson, pictured together, will go to the Court of Appeal to fight for legal protection from murder charges for doctors if they help a patient die . Dr Peter Saunders, a campaigner . against euthanasia, said: ‘Lord Falconer is using the emotions generated . by hard court cases, but his agenda is very dangerous for disabled and . elderly people.’ Lord Falconer is planning to table his . Private Member’s Bill before peers on Wednesday. It will allow adults . with six months or less to live to request a doctor’s help to commit . suicide, and supporters say it is bound around with safeguards to . prevent abuse. His Bill follows a report produced . last year under his leadership which made a similar call for assisted . suicide for the terminally ill. The report said help to die should be . available for anyone with 12 months to live, but following widespread . criticism that has been cut down to six months. It will be the third Parliamentary . attempt in seven years to legalise assisted dying. Peers rejected calls . for legalisation in 2006 and 2009. This week, judges in the Court of . Appeal will begin hearing Mr Lamb’s case, and the case of a man known . only as Martin, a victim of locked-in syndrome. Mr Lamb, who is . quadriplegic, has taken over the claim of Tony Nicklinson, another . locked-in syndrome victim, who died shortly after losing his case in the . High Court last year. Martin is claiming that assisted . suicide laws – which set a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail for . helping someone kill themselves – break Article Eight of the European . human rights charter, which protects the right to privacy and family . life. Dr Saunders said: ‘The timing has been . carefully planned. Off the back of media coverage of this case, . Falconer, who is being backed by Dignity in Dying, the former Voluntary . Euthanasia Society, will argue that his proposal is modest in . comparison. ‘Lamb is not terminally ill and wants a . doctor to give him a lethal injection. Falconer, however, is only . asking for people who are terminally ill to have the right to receive . help to kill themselves – assisted suicide.’ Dr Saunders added: ‘The last thing we . need is a change in the law to put more pressure on people who already . feel themselves to be a burden to others.’ Assisted suicide laws were effectively . reformed without any Parliamentary vote by Keir Starmer, the director . of public prosecutions, in 2010. Following instructions passed down in . one of the last cases heard by the Law Lords, Mr Starmer issued . guidelines that said no-one is likely to be prosecuted for helping . someone to die if they are a family member or friend, rather than a . professional, and if they act out of compassion and not greed. Between 150 and 200 people are thought . to have gone to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to be helped to . commit suicide. But no family member who helped has ever been . prosecuted.","Lord Falconer wants to legalise assisted suicide for terminally people .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:53 EST, 12 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:51 EST, 12 May 2013 . Under pressure: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg only blocked key Tory policies to bolster his own support against a Vince Cable coup, claims Michael Gove . Nick Clegg’s leadership of the Liberal Democrats was in turmoil yesterday as Michael Gove claimed he was blocking key Tory policies purely to head off a plot to have him replaced by Vince Cable. The Education Secretary suggested that the Deputy Prime Minister’s threat to veto childcare reforms last week was an attempt to ‘show a bit of leg’ from a leader desperate to cheer up his own party rather than a principled objection. Lib Dem sources dismissed Mr Gove’s claims as ‘loopy’, but he insisted the party’s former Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott was behind attempts to have Mr Clegg ousted in favour of Business Secretary Mr Cable, his friend and ally. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond upped the pressure by agreeing it was clear that Mr Cable, who suggested yesterday he was not too old for high office despite turning 70 last week, was an ‘ambitious and distinctive’ figure. Some Tories are privately in favour of Mr Clegg being removed before the next election and replaced with Mr Cable. They say only a break with the past under a new leader is likely to help the Lib Dems recover sufficiently to head off the threat from Labour in their northern seats and help prevent it from winning other Tory/Labour marginals. Mr Clegg has objected to a number of Tory policies in recent months, including Mr Gove’s attempts to scrap GCSEs and bring back the O-level and an extension of secret courts. Last week, the Deputy Prime Minister said he was also against plans to allow some nurseries to relax the ratio of adults to children in an attempt to bring down costs for working couples. In remarks that will open up new divisions in the Coalition, Mr Gove said yesterday it was clear Mr Clegg was trying to derail another previously agreed government proposal because of party politics. Vowing the reforms drawn up by his childcare minister, Elizabeth Truss, would go ahead with minor ‘tweaks’, Mr Gove said: ‘I don’t think we can understand Nick Clegg’s position without also appreciating the position that he’s in because of internal Lib Dem politics. ‘There’s a campaign being run at the moment being led by Matthew Oakeshott, this Liberal Democrat in the Lords, to try to destabilise Nick Clegg because Matthew Oakeshott wants Vince Cable to succeed him. And Nick understandably needs to show Lib Dems he’s fighting hard.’ Talking politics: Education Secretary Michael Gove spoke out against Nick Clegg on the Andrew Marr Show . Under fire: Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure to push through childcare reform, despite Nick Clegg's objections . Mr Gove said Mr Clegg was a ‘reasonable guy’ and he believed he would agree to a compromise on childcare. ‘Lord Oakeshott is on manoeuvres, he’s trying to promote Vince,’ he added. ‘It’s understandable that within the Lib Dems these things go on. Nick has to show a bit of leg, as it were, on these issues. ‘But we’ve seen these situations arise in the past and we’ve managed to resolve them in the national interest.’ Front line: Vince Cable, who turned 70 last week, says he has no intention of stepping away from politics. Friends describe him as 'ambitious' From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four in pre-schools that want to take part. Each adult would be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. A government analysis suggests relaxing the rules would reduce costs by 12 per cent, saving the average parent £1,329 a year per child in full-time care. David Cameron is under growing pressure to overrule Mr Clegg and implement the reforms, which do not need legislation, despite his objections. Mr Gove’s intervention, an unprecedented attack on Mr Clegg by a Tory minister, caused deep anger in Lib Dem ranks. A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘We appreciate that Michael Gove has ambitions of his own and is keen to distract attention from his party’s divisions on Europe. ‘But he knows our concerns are based on the overwhelmingly negative response from experts and parents to the Government’s consultation.’ Lord Oakeshott said it was ‘old news’ that he preferred Mr Cable to Mr Clegg, ‘but there’s no plot – members decide who leads us’. A source close to the Business Secretary said: ‘It seems clear the only person with leadership ambitions is Michael Gove.’","Education Secretary said Deputy Prime Minister's threat to veto childcare reforms was an attempt to 'show a bit of leg'

It was the emotional phone call grandfather Troy Berry had waited 11 long years for. Just hours after escaping from the clutches of crazed kidnapper Ariel Castro, Mr Berry’s granddaughter Amanda – whom he had last seen as a 16-year-old – called to say: ‘Hi grandpa, it’s Mandy.’ But then the call from Amanda, who is now 27 years old and the mother of a six-year-old daughter born in captivity, took an unexpected twist. In an exclusive interview last night, Mr Berry, who is set to be reunited with Amanda soon, told how her first words were about a classic car he had promised her just days before she went missing. Mr Berry, 73, said: ‘A few days before she went, I told her I had this 1986 Chevrolet, a special Nascar limited edition, which I would teach her to drive in. And I told her if she did good, I’d give it to her. ‘The first thing she asked me was, ‘‘Grandpa, do you still have my car?’’ I joked and said, ‘‘No, I’ve given it away.’’ But then I heard silence and I told her I was kidding and she burst into tears of happiness. ‘I used to look at that car and think of her. I hope she was thinking of it too, and of us, while she was in there and I hope that helped her to get through it. I used to take Mandy to motor shows when she was a little girl. She used to love it all and ask, ‘‘Grandpa, what’s this one? How old is that one? How fast does it go?’’ ‘When she went missing, I could never bring myself to get rid of the Chevy. Every time I looked at it, I imagined her smiling, sitting behind the wheel and I’d pray to God that she’d come back to us. Now I’m going to fix it up. I kept the fancy hubcaps in the house so they wouldn’t get stolen. Hope: Amanda Berry's grandfather Troy Berry, 73, with the Chevrolet 1986 Monte Carlo, SS Nascar limited edition that he has been saving for Amanda for over a decade . ‘I’m as pleased as punch I’ll finally be able to teach her to drive in it. We’ll get a booster seat for the little one and make it a regular palace on wheels.’ Amanda Berry and her fellow captives Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, are enjoying their first weekend of freedom after escaping the clutches of brutal Ariel Castro. Mr Berry said: ‘Mandy is as happy as a freed bird. She told me it feels good to be sleeping properly. ‘She says every moment feels like a gift. Every piece of chicken, every glass of water, every little thing.  The FBI took Mandy to the doctors. She had no daylight and he starved them, only giving them the cheapest things he could find. But she’s feeling great and doing well.’ Mr Berry said Amanda had formed a ‘life bond’ with fellow victims Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight.  ‘Mandy said she was sometimes in the same room as the other two girls,’ he said. Schoolgirl: Amanda with two school friends, aged 16, shortly before she was kidnapped . Mugshot: Ariel Castro has been charged with kidnapping and rape offenses . ‘She said they kept each other going, tried to help each other, protect each other from him. She said she’ll stay friends with them for ever after what they’ve been through. They’re the only ones who know how bad it all was.’ The women are set to become overnight millionaires by telling their harrowing stories. Oprah Winfrey is said to have offered Berry £200,000 to do her first interview. A source close to Gina DeJesus claimed she was so traumatised, she was unable to sleep in a bedroom. ‘She was locked in a room for so long that she is now sleeping on an inflatable mattress in the living room,’ the source said. ‘She can’t stand the idea of being in a small room. She walks around the garden. She is beautifying herself, doing her nails and hair and experimenting with make-up. She’s been catching up on everything, reading women’s magazines, trying to figure out what she has missed and who the Kardashians are.’ Michelle Knight, 32, has been dubbed ‘the forgotten victim’ because her disappearance was never taken seriously by police. She vanished in 2002 aged 20 after her young son was taken into care. The source revealed that she refused to see family members, including her mother, after her release, preferring to stay at the DeJesus family home. When Amanda had her daughter Jocelyn, which DNA tests have confirmed was fathered by Castro, she was given ‘favoured’ status by her captor, the source added. ‘Castro referred to Amanda as his girlfriend and showered affection on Jocelyn. When they were rescued, Jocelyn was crying for her daddy. She is confused and doesn’t understand what is going on.’ Castro’s daughter Angie said that he showed her a photograph of a child she now believes was Jocelyn in February. Amanda’s mother Louwana died aged 48 while her daughter was imprisoned. She went to her grave believing she had spoken to her daughter’s kidnapper. After Amanda had been missing for three days, the story was covered on a news bulletin, after which she received a phone call from a man who told her Amanda was with him. In a TV interview she gave after the call in 2002, she said: ‘So I’m begging him to let me speak with her, just to let me know if she’s there. And he hesitated and said, ‘‘I’ll have her home in a few days.’’ I kept begging for him to let me speak with her. And he hung up.’ Cleveland police refused to say whether Castro had confessed to making the call, saying: ‘We don’t comment on an ongoing investigation.’ Additional reporting by  Isla Harvey in Tennessee . Shock: Niece of the Cleveland kidnapper Elida-Marie Caraballo . The niece of sadistic Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro has revealed how she innocently played in his ‘house of horrors’ while his three torture victims were chained up in the cellar beneath her. Elida-Marie Caraballo, 19, said she would visit ‘Uncle Ariel’ with her cousin Arlene – Ariel’s daughter – but he would demand they wait outside the back door until he ‘fixed things’ inside. ‘He would play the radio real loud and told me never to leave the kitchen,’ Elida-Marie told  The Mail on Sunday last night. ‘I thought he was weird but I had no idea he was a monster.  It gives me chills to think I was playing with my toys on the kitchen floor while those poor girls were locked in the basement. ‘My uncle and aunt were separated so I would go round with Arlene to visit her daddy.’ Elida-Marie’s mother Elida, 44, is the sister of Castro’s common-law-wife Grimilda Figueroa who died last year of a brain tumour the family say was brought on by vicious beatings by Castro. The couple bought the house where the three women were held captive, built in 1950, in 1992 and raised their four young children there until they split in 1996. Elida-Marie says her uncle’s behaviour ‘became weirder’ after he split from her aunt and that he may have abducted his victims to replace the family he lost. ‘He was a bully and used to beat my aunt badly but when she finally got the courage to leave and come live with us he cried and begged her to come home.’ In a family snap, Ariel Castro and son Anthony pose in 2001 by the door to what was to become a basement prison . Recalling her visits there, she said: ‘I had no idea those poor girls were chained up in the basement. ‘Now I wonder what would have happened if I’d heard something. Would he have locked me in the basement too? I was only a kid but the house gave me the creeps.’ Last night Castro was on suicide watch after being charged with four counts of kidnapping and three of rape.","Amanda Berry had emotional phone call with grandfather after 11 years .

A row has broken out between academics at two Oxford University colleges after a professor said a planned student accommodation block would spoil the views from his rooms. Jonathan Bate, provost of Worcester College and world-renowned Shakespeare expert, has complained that Exeter College's building would be 'overbearing, out of scale and out of character', and would 'obliterate' views from his rooms. However the Rector of Exeter College, Frances Cairncross, has hit back at Professor Bate, saying the accommodation is desperately needed for less well-off students and adding: 'We do not feel that colleges should go out of their way to deprive undergraduates of affordable accommodation.' The Provost of Worcester College, above, has asked his students to object to Exeter College's planned student block . Oxford academics Jonathan Bate, left, and Fiona Cairncross, right are at loggerheads over proposed building . An architect's drawing of how the proposed Exeter College accommodation block would look . The spat began when Prof. Bate sent an email to his students suggesting they oppose Exeter College's plans to build a four-storey block on the former Ruskin College site that would house 90 students. Prof. Bate, a governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company and board member of Princeton University Press, says he, as well as students, Fellows and staff were 'horrified' at Exeter's plans for 'the sensitive western end' of the proposed building that was far too high. He told MailOnline he that his email suggesting students lodge online protests to Exeter's plans was in response to a query from his college's Junior Common Room asking how and on what grounds they might object. The professor's email criticised the 'excessive elevation of the proposed building at the end of the site that overlooks the orchard and our accommodation, and the inappropriately garish and intrusive materials proposed for its roof and upper level', according to the Oxford Student. He said if the undergraduates complained,it would 'help us to reduce the level of intrusiveness upon the College - something for which thousands of students in future generations will thank you.' Representatives from Worcester College took part in talks before the planning process began but no agreement was reached.  There were two public consultations and a third especially for Worcester, as well as several meetings with Prof. Bate which resulted in Exeter agreeing to lower the roof line and use different cladding materials. However the academic is still unhappy with the plans that Exeter submitted to Oxford City Council 10 days ago. Worcester College's orchards are more than 700 years old and Professor Bate says they will be overshadowed . Needs more space: Historic Exeter College is short of rooms for undergraduates in the city centre . Prof Bate, 54, whose Grade I-listed lodgings are set in 26 acres of Grade II-listed grounds with a lake, objected to the fact that the new building would overlook Worcester's 700-year-old orchard. And he is also concerned that views from his lodgings towards the eighteenth century Radcliffe astronomical observatory would be ruined, according to the Daily Telegraph. He told MailOnline: 'What we want Exeter to do is step down the end of the building, to bring its height into line with our building next door and to avoid overshadowing the historic orchard so much. 'This would require them to reposition eight student rooms on the lower level elevation facing the road, so they wouldn’t actually lose any accommodation.' But Exeter's Ms Cairncross said that her historic college had the worst student accommodation in the city and urgently needed more rooms for undergraduates who could not afford to rent privately. She told MailOnline: 'We have already reduced the height to meet Worcester’s concerns. 'Any further reduction will mean the loss of 14 student rooms – and that means 14 of our students each year will have to rent on the very expensive private market in Oxford instead of having subsidised College accommodation. 'The rooms are “mini-bursaries” and we need them to reassure families who are not well off that they can afford to send their children to Oxford. That is why they matter so much.' She added: 'We have been on our very constrained site since 1315 and are desperately short of student housing, especially for our third years.' Economist Ms Cairncross said Exeter had 147 student rooms on its city centre site and 320 undergraduates, with further housing on the Iffley Road, an arterial road leading out of the city. Students at Exeter College have come out in support of their rector and her plans. Edward Nickell, president of Exeter's Junior Common Room, said: 'Never mind a b***** college orchard, 2nd and 3rd year Exonians don't even get rooms! 'Worcester have ducks and lakes, while at Exeter we're bottom in Oxford for living costs satisfaction.'","Worcester College provost Jonathan Bate opposes Exeter College's plans .

Ed Miliband is facing a party divided over Europe as senior Labour figures urge him to change his mind on holding an EU referendum. At the weekend Mr Miliband refused to commit to an in/out vote, claiming it would be bad for the country. But a group led by former Europe minister Keith Vaz has launched a campaign to convince him otherwise. Divided: Labour leader Ed Miliband is now facing a rift in his party after he refused to commit to holding an in/out referendum so the British people could have their say on whether they wanted to remain part of the EU . Yesterday the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls warned that the Opposition should not ‘set our face against consulting the British people’ – but added that now was not the time to announce a change of heart. Mr Balls, who is said to be pushing for a commitment to an EU referendum in Labour’s next manifesto, said he thought the party should ‘acknowledge the deep concerns in the country’ over the subject. The rift emerged after Mr Miliband gloated at the weekend that the Tories are ‘hopelessly divided’ on Europe. Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I believe that it is the democratic right of the people to make that decision [EU membership] for themselves.’ Former Europe minister Keith Vaz is leading a campaign calling for a referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU . The leader of the Labour for a Referendum campaign, party donor John Mills, said: ‘We all want to see Prime Minister Ed Miliband in 2015 and the best way to ensure that happens is by telling the people we too will give them a say on the EU.’ Labour MPs who support the campaign are said to include Ronnie Campbell, Rosie Cooper, John Cryer, Ian Davidson, Natascha Engel, Frank Field, Roger Godsiff, Kate Hoey, Kelvin Hopkins, John McDonnell, Austin Mitchell, Grahame Morris and  Graham Stringer. One Foot in the Grave star and Labour campaigner Richard Wilson is also backing the campaign. ‘Any sensible Labour Party member should support Labour for a Referendum,’ he said. ‘As a pro-European I want to put the issue to bed once and for all.’ Mr Balls told Sky’s Murnaghan programme that the party would have to address the issue, but added it would be wrong to do so now. ‘I think we have to acknowledge the deep concerns in the country at the direction the European Union is taking,’  he said. ‘If we give the appearance ... that we’re burying our head in the sand, we’re just going to ignore those things, people  would say “they are as out of touch as David Cameron”.’ However, he added that Labour should concentrate on EU reform first, stating: ‘I don’t think it’s sensible, it’s not wise, it’s not balanced and it’s not statesmanlike for political parties, for their short-term political advantage, to start making claims about referendums when we don’t even know where we are going to be.’ Nonetheless, he stressed: ‘I don’t think we should set our face against consulting the British people. ‘But I think if we were to start answering your question by saying “well, maybe in two years’ time...” we play the same destabilising, political, tactical, short-term game which is actually making David Cameron look like he’s not really fit to be prime minister at the moment.’","Ed Miliband has refused to commit to an in/out referendum on Europe .

Two college students were killed and two of their classmates badly injured in a car crash as they drove home from spring break in Florida. Brittney Gallagher and Courtney Miller, both 21, were pronounced dead at the scene after their car spun across the road in the Florida panhandle. Their friends Diana Mitchell and Lauren Kane, both 22, are critically injured in hospital after the accident that happened on Saturday morning as they set off back to Ohio after a trip to Panama City Beach. Both Brittney Gallagher, 21, left, and Ohio State University classmate Courtney Miller, 21, right, died at the scene . All four were OSU students. Miss Gallagher was driving the 2000 Dodge at the time of the accident, which ripped the front off the car . All four women were students at Ohio State University and were riding in a four-door dodge driven by Miss Gallagher, according to the News Herald. Miss Gallagher, 21, was driving westbound on SR 20 in her 2000 Neon, and drifted into eastbound traffic.According to the Florida Highway Patrol crash report, she ‘aggressively’ veered back into the westbound lane. She then tried to correct the car’s direction a second time and made the vehicle rotate counter clockwise, the report states. Miss Gallagher, a lacrosse-playing graduate of Lake Catholic High School in Mentor, lived in Willougby, Ohio, and was majoring in consumer and family financial services. Miss Miller, who was in the front passenger seat, a former cheerleader at Niles McKinley High School, was on the dean's list at OSU where she majored in education. Her parents, Robert and Lisa Miller, of Niles, Ohio, said their daughter had hoped to become a teacher or school administrator. Mr Miller said: 'She was very happy, outgoing and loving - she was a joy to be around.' Brittney Gallagher, left, and Courtney Miller, right, were in the front of the Dodge when it spun out of control . The girls' Dodge crashed into a truck being driven by Kelly Porter, left. Among his passengers, all of whom were injured, was Tyler Magar, right . Lauren Kane, 22, one of the Miss Gallagher's passengers, is in a critical condition in hospital after Saturday's accident near Ebro, Florida . He said his daughter, who leaves an older sister, Lauren, and younger sister Gabriella, was 'very proud to be an OSU student'. Family friend Robert McDermott, a funeral home owner who is organising Miss Miller's funeral, told the Youngstown News: 'Anyone was proud to have her as a friend.  She was a beautiful, bright and intelligent young lady.' Diana Mitchell, from Solon, Ohio, and Lauren Kane, from Willougby, Ohio, are majoring in health sciences and pre-physical therapy, and biology respectively. Both were taken to Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Florida, where they are said to be in a critical condition. The driver of the truck, 26-year-old Kelly Porter, and four passengers, all from Oklahoma, were taken to Gulf Coast Medical Center in Panama City for treatment. Porter and three of his passengers are said to be seriously injured, while one passenger is being treated for minor injuries. Authorities said the dead women had been wearing seatbelts, and added that alcohol was not a factor in the crash, which happened near Ebro, 16 miles north of Panama City Beach.","Brittney Gallagher and Courtney Miller, both 21, pronounced dead at scene of Florida crash .

Private investigators have been brought in to track down hundreds of European graduates who studied at British universities but owe £52million in loans for tuition fees. Amid fears that one in four of them will never repay a penny, the Student Loans Company (SLC) said the EU nationals have returned home and now reached the income threshold at which they should be paying off their loans. And while some have slipped into arrears, many more – accounting for loans of £41million – have refused to reveal where they live, whether they are working, or how much they are earning. If the debts are not repaid, British taxpayers will have to foot the bill – meaning foreign students are effectively receiving grants to study in the UK while English students have to fork out a fortune for their higher education. Turning their backs on repayments: Overseas graduates have failed to repay their student loans after leaving the UK . Rob Wilson MP, a former Tory education . spokesman, said: ‘The SLC has been put in a difficult position by the . nonsense of being forced to allow EU students equal access to financial . support.’ Students from Cyprus borrowed the most from the SLC, but . £15million of their £24million debt is not being repaid, while graduates . from France, Germany and Poland ran up debts of more than £10million. It is the first time that the total amount of debt owed by EU graduates to the SLC has passed the £50million mark. Andrew Percy, a Tory MP, said: ‘With . British students paying more in tuition fees than ever before, many . people will not understand how it is possible that foreign students are . able to turn up, run up taxpayer-backed debts and then leave. Many of these students will never contribute a penny in income tax to the UK and will be incredibly expensive to track down.’ Kevin O’Connor, head of SLC repayment, . said: ‘We use international trace agents and can commence legal action . to recover the full balance.’ A spokesman for the Department for . Business, Innovation and Skills added: ‘We will obtain court orders in . other jurisdictions if necessary.’ Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s important they get the money owed in full so that . UK taxpayers are not left paying off huge sums of student debt.’ Anger: The news that EU graduates are failing to pay back their student loans comes as British students are facing higher tuition fees than ever before - prompting protests in November 2012 .","Graduates have returned home without repaying loans .

A group of 175 South Koreans have been withdrawn from a jointly run factory complex in North Korea amid concerns of increasing tension between the two countries. The South Korean workers could  be . seen arriving back at the border with their belongings from the factory . park piled high on top of cars after they were recalled to Seoul. The emergency evacuation follows an earlier North Korean . rejection of a South Korean demand for talks on the labour complex that . has been closed nearly a month.

Piled high: South Korean vehicles were overloaded with finished products from North Korea's Kaesong industrial complex . Get out!: South Korean workers returned back from North Korea's Kaesong industrial complex with their possessions piled on the top of their cars . Piled high: Some of the vehicles were dangerously overloaded with stacks of wood from the factory park in North Korea . Quick escape: The South Koreans stuffed their vehicles with as much as they could take from their factories in Kaesong just on the other side of the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two Koreas. In a statement, the South Korean minister in charge of inter-Korean relations said he was worried about the workers not having access to food and medicine. Pyongyang's powerful National Defence . Commission earlier said Seoul's demand for working-level talks was . deceptive and that ongoing US-South Korean military drills and the . spreading of anti-North Korea leaflets at the border were proof of . Seoul's insincerity. The war of words calls into question the future of the complex in the North Korean border town . of Kaesong. The jointly run factory park is the most significant casualty so far in the recent . deterioration of relations between the Koreas. Heavy load: South Korean workers quickly unloaded the products made in North Korea's after arrive from the Kaesong joint industrial complex in North Korea . Tightly packed: South Korean workers had to use every inch of their vehicles to fit in all their belongings . Low visibility: Some cars were packed with so many items the driver could only see out of half the windscreen . The South Koreans loaded the items across the top of cars . A South Korean driver and security personnel load a dropped sack onto a vehicle on its way back from North Korea's Kaesong industrial complex . We're out: South Koren workers looked relieved after their quick evacuation from the Kaesong joint industrial complex in North Korea . North Korea also said today it will soon put a detained American on trial for allegedly trying to overthrow the government. The announcement further complicates the already fraught relations between Pyongyang and Washington. The indictment of Kenneth Bae comes in the middle of something of a lull after weeks of threats by North Korea against the US and South Korea. It has expressed rage over UN sanctions over a February nuclear test and ongoing US-South Korean military drills, though analysts say Pyongyang's motive is to get its Korean War enemies to negotiate on its own terms. Bae, identified in North Korean state media by his Korean name, Pae Jun Ho, is a tour operator of Korean descent who was arrested after arriving with a tour on November 3 in Rason, a special economic zone bordering China and Russia. He is the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009. The other Americans were eventually deported or released after high-profile diplomatic interventions, some involving former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. North Korea says it will soon deliver a verdict in the case of detained American Kenneth Bae . Analysts say the North will probably hand Bae a harsh punishment to use him as a bargaining chip in possible negotiations with the US. ""The preliminary inquiry into crimes committed by American citizen Pae Jun Ho closed,"" the official Korean Central News Agency said in a brief report. ""In the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the DPRK with hostility toward it. His crimes were proved by evidence."" DPRK is the acronym for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Under North Korea's criminal code, terrorist acts include murdering, kidnapping and injuring the country's citizens can lead to a death sentence or life in jail. North Korea and the US fought the 1950-53 Korean War and still do not have diplomatic relations. The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang represents the US. Dozens of South Korean workers returned from the Kaesong joint industrial complex in North Korea with their belongings piled on top of cars . KCNA did not say when Bae's trial will take place or what the charges were. North Korea's state media and the US government have made little information about Bae public. But his friends, colleagues and South Korean activists specialising in North Korea affairs said he is a Christian missionary based in a Chinese border town who frequently made trips to North Korea to feed orphans there. Officially, North Korea guarantees freedom of religion. In practice, authorities crack down on Christians, who are seen as Western-influenced threats to the government. The distribution of Bibles and secret prayer services can mean banishment to a labour camp or execution, defectors from the country have said. In 2009, American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee were arrested and sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for trespassing and unspecified hostile acts. They were freed later that year after Mr Clinton visited Pyongyang to negotiate their release. South Korean workers looked happy after arriving at the inter-Korean transit office .

Every elderly patient will have their own NHS worker responsible for both their health and care needs, the government announced today. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said dedicated ‘case managers’ would oversee support for all medical needs, in a bid to ease pressure on under-strain A&E departments. The move would see one health professional would track patients as they moved between hospitals, GP surgeries, care homes and their own houses. A shake-up of elderly care in the NHS will be unveiled today, including more one-to-one support (file picture) Mr Hunt used a speech in the Commons today to unveil a major overhaul of care for elderly patients. The way hospitals are set up to support frail and elderly people in emergencies, particularly those with dementia, will be reviewed. Mr Hunt told MPs: 'It will require a great deal of careful work asking some difficult questions and making some tough decisions. 'But if it leads to more personal care, more integrated and more compassionate care, then it stands alongside the care bill as an important step forward in reforming the care received by millions of people.' He warns that dementia has overtaken cancer as the biggest challenge the NHS faces, with 40 per cent of people being cared for in hospital when they could be treated elsewhere. The use of payment by results will be curbed, amid fears it is skewing the way some treatment is given. Out-of-hours care will also be overhauled, with GPs having access to every patients’ detailed notes no matter where they live or are being treated. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants a single person to co-ordinate patient's care needs . Ministers are also considering giving older patients one-to-one care from a named NHS worker. Mr Hunt said: ‘Nobody disagrees with the concept of a case manager. ‘But now we have to make a reality of that - because unless we do that we won't solve the long-term issues around A&E pressures - and much more importantly we won't give vulnerable elderly people the kind of care that the NHS has always been proud to give,’ he told The Independent. ‘The delight of an ageing population is we all live so much longer but it does mean that we have to cope with years of ill health at the end of our lives that perhaps we didn't have to cope with before.’ Under changes to payment by results, hospitals and GPs will be encouraged to look at care holistically . Regulator Monitor and NHS England are examining how the hospital payment system 'can do more for patients'. But Labour warned that patients caught up in the ‘A&E crisis’ would take little comfort from the plans. Jamie Reed MP, Labour's shadow health minister, said: ‘If ministers think they've found the answer to the problems in England's A&Es, they are sorely mistaken. ‘Labour has called for a single point of contact to co-ordinate older people's care needs, but patients waiting hours on end in A&Es tonight will take little comfort from this announcement. ‘Cuts to social care services have left greater numbers of older people attending A&E because they aren't getting the support they need. A&Es are suffering from the break-up of the successful NHS Direct service and the closure of NHS walk-in centres across England. ‘Thousands of nursing jobs have been axed on David Cameron's watch, leaving hospitals understaffed too. ‘Ministers must accept responsibility and act quickly to stop loss of nursing jobs, sort out the 111 service and prevent the social care system from collapse.’","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promises 'case workers' for the elderly'

"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 04:20 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:26 EST, 22 April 2013 . A rebel movement in the Russian republic of Dagestan has denied any links to the deadly bomb attacks in Boston last week. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the suspect killed during a shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday following a gun battle with authorities, has been linked with the region's bloody rebel group, the Vilyat Dagestan. But the group, locked in a bloody conflict with Russian security services, has released a statement distancing itself from Tsarnaev and the attack, which killed three and injured more than 180 people. An Islamist group has distanced itself from Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the suspect in the Boston bombings who was shot in a gun battle with police officers. His brother Dzhokhar, 19, is seriously injured . Pictures of him and his brother allegedly attending the Boston marathon and planting packages were released by the FBI on Thursday. His brother was injured and remains in hospital. It said: 'The Vilayat Dagestan command … indicates that mujahideen from the Caucasus are not at war with the United States of America. 'We are at war with Russia, which is responsible not only for the occupation of the Caucasus, but also of heinous crimes against Muslims.' The statement also said the group seeks to avoid attacks on civilians, as decreed by leader Doku Umarov, and attempts to link Vilyat Dagestan with the U.S. blasts were 'co-operation with Russian propaganda', according to the Guardian. It added: 'If U.S. authorities are really interested in establishing the true organisers of the explosions in Boston, and not co-operating with Russian speculation, then they should focus on the Russian special services involvement in the events.' 'Inspiration': One theory is that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was inspired by Doku Umarov, a Chechen terrorist known as Russia's Bin Laden. Vilyat Dagestan has denied there is a link . Combat: Russian soldiers are locked in a conflict with Islamist groups in Dagestan. File picture . A Dagestani police official source revealed to NBC News that the Russian internal security service contacted the FBI in November with some questions about Tsarnaev and handed over a copy of a case file on him. The 26-year-old Chechen, who was living in the U.S. after being granted refugee status in 2002, first caught the eye of authorities after he was spotted meeting with a person involved in the militant Islamic underground movement in Dagestan. They met at a mosque on six occasions, the source said. The source told NBC the militant and Tsarnaev disappeared before authorities could speak with them and added that the FBI never responded. The FBI has confirmed that Russia alerted the agency in 2011 that Tsarnaev had ties to 'radical Islam' groups in his homeland. Homeland Security sources have also revealed the agency received Russian tips in 2012 about his ties to extremists connected to a Boston mosque. Past: The brothers grew up in Kyrgyzstan, in the town of Tokmok, home to a Chechen community in the Central Asian nation. The family left Kyrgyzstan and moved to the Republic of Dagestan, in the North Caucasus region. From there they traveled to the United States in 2002, when they were granted refugee status . Congress is now promising a full inquiry into what intelligence had been unearthed on the suspected bombers that could have alerted authorities. Rep. Michael McCaul, the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called it 'disturbing' that the Chechen immigrant was 'on the FBI radar' in 2011 but was deemed to not be a risk to national security. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today show this morning, former Kremlin advisor Alexander Nekrassov said: 'The FSB [Russian intelligence agency] has already said that it is prepared to co-operate with the American intelligence services... they are ready to do a joint project. The brothers were spotted in surveillance footage at the marathon . 'There is a sense of frustration that the Western intelligence services have not been fully co-operative with the Russian intelligence services [over Chechnya] - and it started some time ago.' He added: 'Some of the Russian commentators are saying it must have something to do with the Sochi (Winter) Olympics (next year).' 'There's a feeling that somebody else must have been involved... these two guys don't look like terrorists... there is no professional angle to them. 'These people who are waging the terrorist threat in Chechnya and beyond are dangerous to everyone, and not just to Russia.' Questions: Rep. Michael McCaul, the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called it 'disturbing' that the Chechen immigrant was interviewed by federal officials in 2011 but after a thorough review he was deemed to not be a risk to national security . One theory into the motive for the bombings is that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar may have been ‘inspired’ by Doku Umarov, known as Russia’s Bin Laden. Umarov, like the Tsarnaev brothers, is an ethnic Chechen from the war-torn Caucasus region that lies between Europe and Central Asia. He has been accused of masterminding some of the worst terrorist atrocities in Russia, including suicide bombings carried out by two women on Moscow’s Metro system in 2010 which killed at least 40.","Insurgents in strife-hit republic say they are not behind attacks on U.S.

Authorities have confirmed that the body of Mall of America store manager who has been missing since February and feared murdered by her husband has been found in the Mississippi River. The body of Kira Trevino was spotted in the river in downtown St Paul by a passerby on Wednesday afternoon, Randy Gustafson from the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office told CBS. Authorities swarmed the scene and pulled the body from the water, but were not initially certain whether it was a man or woman. They have now confirmed the identity as 30-year-old Kira Trevino. Mrs Trevino was last seen leaving the Mall of America, where she worked as a store manager of a clothing store, with her husband, Jeffrey, on the night of February 21. Found: The body of Kira Trevino, 30 (left), has been found in the Mississippi River more than two months after she vanished. Her husband, Jeffrey, (right) has been arrested for allegedly killing her . Problems: The couple had told family members they were having marital problems before she disappeared . Mr Trevino, 39, has since been arrested and charged with his wife's murder after authorities discovered 'copious amounts' of blood throughout their home and on her abandoned car. Authorities initially focused their search on Keller Lake, which is less than two . miles from the Trevinos' St Paul residence, after witnesses said they saw two men carrying a body-sized bag there. Volunteers later came . across a plastic bag containing a bloody pillow, a bar, shirt and a sponge, and DNA on the items matched that of Kira Trevino. A hole was also discovered . in the frozen lake, and divers were called in to search an 85-foot . radius, but nothing was found, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. Scene: Her body was found near the Robert Street Bridge in St Paul, Minnesota on Wednesday . Despite the lack of a body, . authorities felt they had enough evidence to charge Mr Trevino with two . counts of second-degree murder. He is being held on $1million bail. After she went missing, security officials at the Mall of . America found the woman's car in a corner of a parking lot. Her purse . and cell phone were inside, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. Trevino's . mother, Marcie Steger, said her daughter’s car was backed into the . parking space, a maneuver she said her daughter couldn't execute. The . car was towed to an impound lot, and that is where the tow driver . spotted what appeared to be blood around the trunk. Police that were . called to the scene recovered Trevino's stained trunk liner nearby, and . tests confirmed that it was soaked with human blood. The . gruesome discovery prompted investigators to search the couple's home . in the 500 block of East Iowa Avenue in St. Paul just hours later. Happier times: Mr Trevino had told authorities that his wife was going through a 'mid-life crisis' and ran off . 'Evidence': But police found 'copious amounts' of blood at their home as well as bleached clothes and towels . Inside, . officers found several freshly washed towels in a basket next to a . dryer alongside the Arkansas Razorbacks shirt Jeffrey Trevino said he . wore on February 21 when his wife went missing. Going . through the house, police also found two bleach-stained towels, a mop, . bucket and cleaning products. In the master bedroom, detectives came . across a gory scene, with blood stains around the bed and a large . human-shaped blood stain on the carpet, according to their report. In the bedroom, blood was found on the floor, box spring, . mattress, bed frame, bookshelf, closet door, baseboard trim and the . wall. Processing of the . home found 'evidence of extensive cleanup efforts,' including furniture . moved to hide evidence, a spray . bottle of bleach solution and a carpet cleaning machine. A carpet cleaner had what appeared to . be blood and human tissue inside of it. Missed: She was last seen leaving her job at the Mall of America, where her car was later found . Troubled: Mr Trevino claimed his wife had gone tanning and then to work out, but she did not go to either . More blood was found throughout the . house, including in the kitchen, main flood living room, hallways, . bathroom, stair landing, on the stairs leading down to the basement - revealing evidence of a long and brutal struggle. According . to the charges against him, Trevino claims that his wife had been . suffering a mid-life crisis and that she had been leaving their home for . two or three days at a time. He . also said that he recently learned his wife had been lying about where . she was staying and it has emerged that family and friends both informed . the police that the couple were having relationship problems. According to the suspect, he last saw . Kira Trevino at 8.30am Friday before she left for work. She told him . that she was planning to work out at her gym in New Brighton, squeeze in . a tanning session at a Roseville salon, run some errands and stop in at . work to interview new employees. Kira did not go make it into work . that day, however, nor did she arrive to work on Saturday and Trevino . did not report her missing until 10.30am Sunday - the same day he told . her family that he could not locate her. Search: Holes are drilled into the ice on Keller Lake in search of the body of Kira Trevino in March . Support: Cadaver dogs were brought in to help . with the search at the lake, but they turned up nothing . Wading in the water: Divers search a shallow creek near Lake Keller for clues and evidence in the disappearance of Kira Trevino. A bag containing items with her DNA on were later found . Later . that day, Kira Trevino’s mother called police, reporting her concern . for the safety of her daughter, who recently shared with her that she . and her husband were having martial problems, and that Mr Trevino was . 'checking into her bank accounts,' the complaint says. Days later, police in Bloomington recovered video from the Mall of . America that showed Kira Trevino’s car entering the parking lot Friday . morning. The video isn’t clear enough to show who was in the car, but it . shows someone at the back of the vehicle throwing what appears to be a . trunk liner away from the car. The person then got into a cab, which had a GPS tracker, and was dropped off near Trevino’s home, the complaint said. Workplace: Trevino was a manager at Delia's, a clothing store for teenage girls in the Mall of America . Kira Trevino would travel daily from her home in St. Paul to the Mall of America in Bloomington - where her vehicle was found . Kira . Trevino met her husband in Wausau, Wisconsin, where her family is from, . when he was in town working on the construction of a hospital. They . married about three years ago. A 'Find Kira Trevino' Facebook page shared the tragic news on Thursday. 'The body found in the Mississippi . yesterday afternoon is Kira,' a post read.

A young Oxford University researcher who lost her eyebrows to Lupus has spoken about her devastation when her hair began falling out, and how she felt her life was being taken away from her. Emily Savage-McGlynn, 34, had married her boyfriend Kevin the same year that she was diagnosed with Lupus, an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system becomes overactive and attacks normal, healthy tissue. The psychology researcher said: 'I was devastated when I was diagnosed with Lupus. In addition to the . physical pain that I experience inside, the disease started to change . how I look on the outside, and that is very difficult to cope with. 'I . used to have lovely full eyebrows and then suddenly I noticed they were . becoming more and more sparse. By the end of it I was left with just two single hairs on each eyebrow. It looked dreadful.' Effects of Lupus: Emily Savage-McGlynn, 34, began losing her eyebrow hair as a result of autoimmune disease Lupus, until there were only one or two strands left . Before the loss: Emily before she began losing her eyebrows to Lupus, an autoimmune diseases that affects the body's natural defence against illness and infection . Lupus can affect virtually any organ in the body and the condition resulted in Emily losing all the hair on her eyebrows except for a few strands. Emily began covering up baldness by penciling in eyebrows every morning before going to work. But she hated the way her brows looked, and always felt self-conscious. She explained: 'I spent around 10 minutes every single morning penciling them in. As I didn't have any hair at all, the pencil had nothing to blend into, so they just looked painted on and very unnatural.' The chore of penciling eyebrows was not only time consuming, but Emily also felt restricted in doing some of her favourite activities and often missed out on swimming, one of her favourite past times. She said: 'I love swimming, and when I started penciling in my eyebrows I had to stop because I was so self-conscious my eyebrows would wear off. 'Something I never even cared about before had such a huge impact on my life. It felt like Lupus was starting to take my life away from me.' Ruining her life: Losing her eyebrows to Lupus made Emily feel as though the disease was robbing her of her life, and she began to get depressed . Happy whatever you look like: Emily with her husband Kevin, who said he loved her no matter what her eyebrows looked like and was reluctant for her to have the semi-permanent treatment . After years of pencilling in her eyebrows, Emily's sister Chloe suggested semi-permanent make-up as an option. Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. Some common symptoms of lupus include fatigue, skin rash, joint pain and swelling. Lupus is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system (the body's natural defence against illness and infection). In people with lupus, for reasons not clearly understood, the immune system starts to attack healthy cells, tissue and organs. As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible for triggering lupus in certain people. Source: nhs.co.uk . But Kevin was reluctant for his wife to have a treatment. She said: 'My husband didn’t want me to indulge in my insecurities and he told me I was beautiful just the way I was, he didn't even think penciling in my eyebrows was necessary. 'But I wasn’t worried about how others viewed me, I just wanted to feel good about myself again.” Emily chose Debra Robson LDN for the . treatment - a Harley Street clinic that uses the innovative FAME . technique to mimic eyebrow hair at a microscopic level. Emily recalls: 'I was very nervous, . but Debra reassured me that she had done thousands of treatments - and . soon I was getting the eyebrows that I'd missed for years. 'The . treatment was comfortable and all done within 30 minutes. 'When I saw my . eyebrows for the first time tears sprung into my eyes, I was overjoyed . with the results. My eyebrows were completely natural, symmetrical and . they looked just like real hair. 'I'm . so delighted and I finally feel like myself again. Everyone thought my . new eyebrows looked wonderful, including my husband! People couldn't get . over how real they looked, even close up.' The full look: Emily is thrilled with the result of her treatment, and says she finally feels like herself again . After the treatment: Emily's eyebrows following the semi-permanent FAME treatment she had in the Debra Robson LDN clinic . Debra Robson said: 'Emily came into the clinic with little hope and left feeling like herself again. We recreated Emily's brows with my renowned FAME technique, which builds up the brow at microscopic level, hair by hair. First we pencilled in the brow and got the correct shape for Emily's face. 'When she was happy with the shape, we began to build up her brows and as you can see from the pictures, the results were perfect.'","Emily Savage-McGlynn, 34, is a psychology researcher from Oxford .

The FBI has agreed to review the mysterious disappearance of a honeymooner from a Caribbean cruise ship eight years ago in light of new findings put forward by his family, who believe he was murdered. George Smith, 26, vanished from the . Royal Caribbean ship, Brilliance of the Seas, in the middle of the night . on July 5, 2005 just outside the Turkish port of Kusadasi. He had been partying into the early hours with his . 25-year-old wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith. His wife was found passed out drunk in a corridor but George was missing - a large blood stain beneath his cabin balcony indicating where his body had fallen and suggesting he then went overboard. Mystery: George Smith was on a honeymoon cruise with his new wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith when he died - presumed overboard . Partying: The couple had been drinking and gambling with new friends they'd made aboard the ship when it is believed Smith went overboard around 5am . Four men confirm they were the last to see him alive - Josh Askin, Rusty Kofman and Zach and Greg Rozenberg. They had all been drinking Absinthe and gambling with the newly-married man earlier in the evening. They claim they left a drunken George . in his room and put him in bed, before returning to Zach and Rusty's . suite to order room service. However, a private investigator hired . by the family told CBS's 48 hours that the ship's records show no . details of any room service order. Lost hope: A photograph taken by a passenger showed blood on the edge of a lifeboat canopy . Several short phone calls were made . from the suite following 4.13am, according to Attorney Mike Jones, but . no food was documented as ordered on the ship's log. He also points out a video . exists of three of the men - Kofman and the two Rosenberg brothers - . allegedly 'joking' about Mr Smith's death over breakfast. Though the FBI has held the recording since 2005, Jones made public its alleged contents for the first time. He claims Kofman makes a joke about . the man parachuting off his balcony while Greg Rosenberg stands up at . the end and 'makes gang signs' and says 'told you I was a gangster'. All four men and lawyers acting on their behalf have denied any involvement in the death of Smith from Greenwich, Connecticut. CBS approached Kofman in the film and . questioned him about the alleged video comment. He said he had no . comment and urged the presenter to contact his lawyer. Albert Dayan who was previously represented him was interviewed by the network in 2006 and said the men put the newlywed in bed and never saw him again. 'They actually lay George on the bed . and took off his shoes and he displays tremendous gratitude to these . young men,' he told the broadcaster. Last seen: Josh Askin, top left, Rusty Kofman, top right, and Zach, bottom left, and Greg Rozenberg, bottom right, were the last to see George Smith alive . Cabin: This is the room where the men claim they left George Smith in bed . However, one witness - a former . police officer staying next door to the couple - told CBS he only saw . three men leave the suite - something the men also deny. He also claims he heard men arguing on the balcony. Dayan said he believed the 'three . men' spotting was a mistake by the witness and says the men deny ever . going onto the balcony. The neighbor said he later heard the sound of furniture being moved and a loud thud. The witness reports, cell phone video . and room service logs have prompted the Smith family to call for a . thorough new look at George's death. They suspect foul play. 'I just don't understand how the FBI . could have had this tape in their possession and still we sit here,' George's sister Bree said. 'Get the guys in there. Question them! In another new detail, it has emerged . that the men and their families were later ejected from the ship in . Naples over a claim of sexual assault against Greg Rosenberg and Rusty . Koffman. The men also denied those claims and no charges were brought by Italian police. Jones carried out depositions with all four men in the course of his inquiries. Greg Rosenberg, who was being held in a Florida prison on charges of trafficking, emphatically denied any involvement. Last night: George Smith was captured on surveillance cameras in the casino on the night of his death . Nightmare: George Smith went missing from Royal Caribbean's Brilliance of the Seas in 2005 while on his honeymoon . Never found: Mr Smith, 26, fell from the boat during a Mediterranean cruise close to the port of Kusadasi in Turkey . Although he added that he too doubted the explanation George fell. 'Something crazy went down that night and I hope one day they find out the truth,' he said. Josh Ashkin's lawyer says he has no doubt his client has provided all the information he has on the incident and believes it boils down to a drunken accident. 'I don't know why anybody's missin' the theme here. 'Cause there's one common element ... and it's too much alcohol!' he said. 'And we can go and, you know, blame it on murder and - and -- and blame it on aggressive sexual behavior here. You know what? It's just everybody drinkin' too much and stupid stuff happening. That fits.' FBI New York confirmed to the broadcaster that they would review the investigation. The honeymooner's family have been . frustrated by the investigation to date but hope the renewed focus may . bring them the answers they require. 'We'll get justice,' George's mother . Maureen Smith said. 'Somehow we'll get justice for George. Somebody will . talk. And shame on them that don't. Shame on the people that have put . us through this eight years of hell.' Much-loved: The Smiths of Greenwich, Connecticut say they still need answers over the night their son died . 'He was the funniest guy, you know?' George Smith senior said remembering his son. 'I would sit and have a couple of beers with him and he'd make me laugh . for the whole night. And besides he was so good looking the girls just . fell all over him. He was a just a lot of fun. He was a great guy.' Jennifer Hagel-Smith, an elementary . school teacher,  passed an FBI polygraph test about what happened that . night and Jones believes she too was an innocent victim of what . occurred. The couple had been together for three years when they married in 2005 in a clifftop ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island. She has since remarried and did not take part in the CBS program.","FBI's New York field office agrees to review death of George Smith, 26, .

The suspect in the deadly Boston Marathon bombings told investigators that the widow of his late older brother had nothing to do with the April 15 attacks, it was revealed today. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has made the statement to law enforcement officials looking into Katherine Russell's possible involvement in the planning of the bombings allegedly carried out by her husband, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and her brother-in-law, NBC News reported. The older Tsarnaev sibling was killed in a police gun battle April 19. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, was captured and charged in connection to the bombings following a massive manhunt that ended when he was discovered wounded hiding inside a boat in a backyard. 'She's innocent:' Terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsranaev (left) told federal investigators that his sister-in-law, Katherine Russell (right), had nothing to do with the April 15 bombings . Tamerlan Tsaranev's 24-year-old widow has been under increased scrutiny ever since federal officials found radical Islamist materials on her laptop, including the al Qaeda magazine Inspire. Investigators also found traces of explosive residue in the Cambridge, Massachusetts, home Russell had shared with her late husband and their 2-year-old daughter. Russell's defense team said in a statement that she ‘plans to continue to meet with investigators, part of a series of meetings over many hours where she has answered questions.’ It was also revealed Wednesday that the 24-year-old Muslim convert has hired a prominent criminal lawyer with experience defending terrorism cases. Russell added New York lawyer Joshua Dratel to her legal team, her attorney Amato DeLuca confirmed. Dratel has represented a number of terrorism suspects in federal courts and military commissions, including Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detainee David Hicks, who attended an al-Qaida-linked training camp in Afghanistan. ‘Mr. Dratel's unique, specialized experience will help insure that Katie can assist in the ongoing investigation in the most constructive way possible,’ DeLuca said in a written statement. He said Russell, who has not been charged with any crime, will continue to meet with investigators as ‘part of a series of meetings over many hours where she has answered questions.’ New hire: Russell has retained criminal defense attorney Joshua Dratel (center), who has represented a number of terrorism suspects . Staying silent: Katherine Russell, the wife of Boston bomber suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office with attorney Amato DeLuca on Monday. She has reportedly stopped cooperating with authorities . Providence-based DeLuca and Miriam . Weizenbaum have been representing Russell, who is from Rhode Island. They specialize in civil cases such as personal injury law. An FBI spokeswoman wouldn't comment when asked Wednesday whether Russell is cooperating. DeLuca has said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband and his brother in the deadly April 15 bombing. Officials . have yet to determine whether the Islamist files found in Russell’s . possession belonged to the 24-year-old mother, her late 26-year-old . husband or a third party, a source told The Washington Post. 'Incriminating': Officials say among the materials discovered on Russell's computer was al Qaeda's Inspire magazine . According to a government document . obtained by NBC News, an analysis of the bombs used at the Boston . Marathon and pipe bombs that the Tsarnaevs had allegedly thrown at . police may have been built following instructions that appeared in an . Inspire article titled: Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom. Attorney Amato DeLuca had previously . said his client was kept in the dark about the deadly plot, and she was . shocked to learn that her husband and brother-in-law were allegedly . responsible for the attacks. Meanwhile, CNN reported that . investigators inspecting Russell and Tsranaev's home in Cambridge, . Massachusetts, found traces of explosive residue in the kitchen sink, . the bathtub and on a table. Following . his arrest, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told police that he and his older brother . built the pressure cooker bombs in the basement of the Cambridge . residence. It was . established last week that female DNA found one a piece of an . explosive device used in the attacks did not match Russell's, but rather . belonged to a department store clerk where the siblings had purchased . the pressure cookers. Authorities have said that Tamerlan Tsarnaev called his wife in the hours after the FBI released surveillance images of him and his younger brother. Probe: Authorities visited her parents' home this week after female DNA was found on one of the bombs . Hiding out: Russell has been staying at her parents' North Kingstown, Rhode Island home, pictured . But only Russell knows what was said in the conversation, as she has stopped cooperating with authorities over recent days, the New York Times reported. Authorities are skeptical of her . insistence that she played no role in the attack or in helping the . brothers escape the authorities following the release of the . photographs, the Times reported. Her silence comes as sources told the newspaper that the fingerprints and female DNA found on at least one of the bombs did not belong to her. Authorities had taken a sample from her this week. Spokesman Jason Pack confirmed that . agents investigating the Boston bombings visited the North Kingstown . home of Russell's parents, where Tsarnaev's widow has been staying since . the attacks. An official . had revealed that female DNA was found on at least one of the bombs, . although investigators haven't determined whose it is or whether it . means a woman helped the two suspects. Russell met Tamerlan while she was a student at Suffolk University, according to her lawyer. She converted to Islam and they married in 2010 before having a daughter, now three. Her husband was killed on April 18 following a shoot out with police in Watertown. Investigators say his younger brother hit him with a car as he fled the scene. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was caught the following day as he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard. 'Killer': Russell's husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured in 2010, died after a gun battle with police . Body: A vehicle believed to be carrying Tsarnaev's body backs into an underground garage at the Dyer-Lake Funeral Home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. His family claimed his body on Thursday . Changed: Russell, pictured left in high school and right following the bombings, met Tamerlan while she was a college student but dropped out when she fell pregnant. She converted to Islam for him . The April 15 bombing, using pressure cookers packed with explosives, . nails, ball bearings and metal shards near the marathon's finish line, . killed three people and injured more than 260 others.

Fresh-faced and strikingly pretty, the girl staring into the camera in the first clip from Jedna fotografija dnevno u najgoroj godini života (one photo a day in the worst year of my life) looks happy and confident. By the last, she is a bruised, battered shell of her former self, holding a handwritten note that when translated reads: 'Help me. I don't know if I will get to see tomorrow.' The identity of the Serbian woman featured in the film, shot over the course of 2012, is unknown and many have questioned the authenticity of the injuries and suspect the video may actually be part of a public education campaign. Regardless, it has shocked the country and brought the issue of Domestic Violence back on to the national agenda. Harrowing: The unnamed victim holds up a sign that reads: 'Help me. I do not know if I will see tomorrow' Fresh faced: At the beginning, the woman looks happy and radiant but gradually, bruises start to creep in . The film, which went viral after being posted on the Reddit site, has generated hundreds of mostly supportive messages, although a couple question the veracity of the video. Reddit user, Yarddogkodabear wrote: This looks like film make up. I'm not sure someone in this emotional state would be this dedicated to filming her face being beat. 'Another clue to it being make-up is the dramatized eyes and music flows with the edit. I'm sure that they just wanted to make a point against violence towards women.' For others, however, whether the clip is real is irrelevant, with many saying that whatever the film's origin, the message is too important to be ignored. HoneyNunches said: 'Overall it is a good message. Humans (male or female) who abuse others are some of the worse type of scum. 'It's sad that an emotional connection often leaves people clinging to those who hurt them.' Horrific: As the year unfolds, the woman's injuries get progressively more appalling . Despicable: By the last few scenes, the victim looks seriously injured, with a cut lip and badly damaged eye . Another, MulderFoxx, added: 'This life is far too short for anyone to put up with any kind of abuse. If you feel that your life is worse with a person around than it would be if you were alone, then it is time to leave. 'Go to family, friends, shelters, but go. Leave. No one deserves happiness more than you. If your sister or your mother was in this situation you would fight for them. You would tell them to exit. Why not the same for yourself?' Domestic violence is a serious problem in Serbia, with an estimated 19,000 cases a year, according to local newspaper, Novosti. The UN has also produced reports on the problem, which suggest that violence against women occurs on a scale unheard of in the UK. A UN funded survey last year showed that 54.2 per cent of women in Serbia, like the woman in the film, suffer from some form of domestic violence, with 90 per cent of the cases involving a male perpetrator. Sadly, deaths from domestic violence are not uncommon. Shockingly, domestic violence victims account for a horrifying 30 per cent of all murders in Serbia - compared with just one per cent in the USA - according to Serbian government figures .

In . a thinly-veiled plea to the Russian President, Mr Cameron said: 'We . urgently have to do more for the sake of the people of Syria to break . the vicious cycle that threatens to destroy Syria and that threatens to . export violence and extremism around the world.' The British and Russian leaders are joined by head of the Sochi 2014 organizing committee Dmitry Chernyshenko, right, aboard the helicopter as they survey the Winter Olympic venues . Mr Cameron and Mr Putin put aside the contentious subject of the Syrian civil war for a helicopter tour of Winter Olympic venues . David Cameron today met Russia's President Vladimir Putin to discuss how to end the conflict in Syria . The visit came as details emerged of Britain’s arguments in favour of lifting the arms embargo. Ahead of his visit Mr Cameron said the atrocities in Syria ‘continue to mount’ and growing evidence that the Asad regime has used chemical weapons. He told MPs: ‘There is a growing body of limited but persuasive information showing that the regime has used, and continues to use, chemical weapons including sarin. The room for doubt about that continues to diminish.’ Jon Day, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, is providing regular updates to the National Security Council on information that British forces and allies have gleaned. Russia has previously blocked international moves through the UN security council to impose sanctions on Syria. However, a leaked document has revealed the UK Government's arguments in favour of easing the EU arms embargo when the sanctions expire at the end of the month. Mr Cameron flew in for talks at the Bocharov Ruchei state residence in Sochi in Russia . Mr Cameron has warned of growing evidence that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons . The British discussion paper sets out . two options: lift the arms embargo against the Syrian National Coalition . completely, or remove the words ‘non-lethal’ from a list of exemptions, . clearing the way for weapons to be sent to the country. Carla . Del Ponte, a member of the United Nations panel examining allegations . of war crimes in Syria, claimed at the weekend that the commission had . indications that Syrian rebel forces used sarin. But . Downing Street stands by its assessment that chemical weapons use in . Syria ""is very likely to have been initiated by the regime"" and says it . has ‘no evidence’ of opposition use. Talks . between US secretary of state John Kerry and the Russian leadership . this week resulted in plans to convene an international conference on . Syria later this month. Free Syrian Army fighters carry their weapons as their move towards positions in the al-Ziyabiya area in Damascus . The UK government has drawn up options which including lifting the embargo against giving arms to opponents of the Assad regime . President Putin met U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry this week, after keeping him waiting for three hours . Mr Cameron is also expected to hold talks in coming days with US president Barack Obama and France's Francois Hollande. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The UK has taken no decision to arm the Syrian opposition. However, there is likely to be a strong case for further amendments to the EU sanctions regime - or lifting it altogether - if the situation remains as it is, or gets worse. ‘Discussions are continuing in Brussels. We need to find ways to increase pressure on the regime to accept a political solution and ensure we have flexibility to react to the deteriorating situation on the ground.’ More than 70,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011, according to the United Nations. British and Russian security services have agreed to work together for the first time since the death of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko seven years ago, David Cameron announced yesterday. The announcement came after Russia’s macho president, Vladimir Putin, took the Prime Minister on a helicopter ride high above the Winter Olympic city of Sochi. The stunt was part of an attempt to end years of frosty relations. After more than three hours of talks at Mr Putin’s Black Sea dacha, Mr Cameron agreed with him that there will be ‘limited cooperation between our security forces’ as Russia prepares to host the Games. Britain had imposed a ban on secret service co-operation since Russia’s refusal to extradite the main suspect in Litvinenko’s polonium poisoning in London in 2006, MP Andrey Lugovoy, to face murder changes. Now Mr Cameron has agreed that people in both countries are ‘safer and better off’ through more engagement between London and Moscow. Russia is an ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, but Mr Cameron also appeared to win Mr Putin’s support for Russian involvement in moves towards ‘a transitional government that all Syrians can trust to protect them’. There was, however, no clear breakthrough on the issue. Mr Cameron welcomed Russia’s agreement to convene an international conference to try to find a political solution to Syria’s two-year civil war.","British government leads argument for lifting arms embargo to help opposition forces .

A body recovered amid an intensive search is believed to be that of a missing 18-month-old girl whose mother was found dead along with two men on a Kansas farm days ago, authorities said Sunday. Franklin County Sheriff Jeff Richards said in a statement that remains recovered in eastern Kansas on Saturday are believed to those of Lana Leigh Bailey, a child authorities previously reported as presumed dead. 'It is with great sadness that I report a body found in Osage County, Kansas, is believed to be the remains of 18-month-old Lana Bailey,' Richards said in the statement. Found: Lana Leigh Bailey was found on Saturday after an extensive search . Lana Leigh Bailey: 150 people were working to try to find the little girl . 'I want the family of Lana, and all the victims, to know that this investigation will continue until we are confident we have collected as much evidence as we can to ensure justice is served on behalf of all four victims,' he added. Richards said the body was discovered by an Osage County sheriff's deputy who was searching an area for items that could be connected to the deaths reported May 6 at a farm home in nearby Franklin County. The evidence collected Saturday when the body was recovered led investigators to believe it was the infant's body, his statement said without elaboration. 'We hope that a forensic examination will make a final identification,' Richards added. 'Until the identity is confirmed investigators will continue following up on all tips, leads and information connected to this crime.' Murdered: Kaylie Bailey (right) was found dead on Monday at the Ottawa, Kansas-area farm where she had gone to drop off her daughter Lana (left) Major search: At times up to 150 ¿ used dive teams, police dogs, mounted patrols, planes, boats and all-terrain vehicles to scour fields, farms, ponds and creeks between Ottawa and Emporia, Kansas looking for the girl . On alert: Riders on horseback searched culverts and drainage ditches along a Kansas Highway 68 for 18-month-old Lana-Leigh Bailey. She was found dead on Saturday . The statement did not provide any details of where the body was discovered or how the infant had died. But his statement said a crime scene unit was called to the area 'to process this new crime scene.' 'It is not the outcome we'd hoped for but we knew we couldn't stop searching until Lana was home,' the statement said. Richards told The AP by telephone early on Sunday that he would not have any further details beyond the statement. The Franklin County sheriff's office said its next scheduled statement on the investigation would be Sunday afternoon. On Saturday, search crews had deployed using boats and sonar equipment in search of the child. Earlier authorities had said investigators were scouring ponds and other waterways in the area looking for the body of Lana Leigh Bailey. Charged: Kyle Flack, 27, has been charged in the deaths of Lana and Kaylie Bailey as well as two men whose bodies were found at an eastern Kansas farm home earlier this week . Heading to jail: Officers escort murder suspect Kyle Flack from the Franklin County Courthouse to the Franklin Detention Center . Kyle Flack was charged Friday with capital murder as officials investigated the deaths of Lana Bailey's 21-year-old mother, Kaylie Bailey, and 30-year-old Andrew Stout. The 27-year-old convicted felon also was charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder in those deaths as well as that of 31-year-old Steven White, authorities have said. The investigation had included searching the farm and other rural areas in the 50-mile stretch between Ottawa and Emporia, where Kaylie Bailey's car was found Tuesday. Franklin County Attorney Stephen Hunting said Friday that a firearm was used against the victims at the farm, but didn't elaborate on whether that meant they were fatally shot. Authorities have not commented on a motive. Richards said earlier that the extensive investigation of what he called a 'horrific crime' had taken a toll and that members of the investigative team have required medical attention after searching in difficult areas. Others sought counsel from a chaplain.","The remains of 18-month-old Lana Bailey, a victim of a quadruple murder have been found .

"By . Sam Greenhill and Paul Revoir . PUBLISHED: . 21:10 EST, 2 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:49 EST, 3 March 2013 . The BBC was accused of 'corporate bullying' last night after spending licence-payers' cash to buy the silence of up to 20 alleged harassment victims. The gagging orders threaten to make a mockery of an inquiry set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal to uncover the depths of sexual harassment at the corporation. Up to 20 former staff – all of whom claim to have been victims of bullying or sexual harassment – believed they had effectively been banned from giving evidence to the internal review. Redundancy discussions: Newsnight reporter Liz MacKean is one person the BBC is said to have tried to silence during discussions over voluntary redundancy . Each had been paid off and made to sign contracts to stop them turning whistleblower. The absurd situation could mean . licence-payers funding an expensive inquiry on the one hand, only for . potential witnesses to think they cannot give evidence. Refusal: Miriam O'Reilly took the BBC to a tribunal . The inquiry, overseen by human rights lawyer Dinah Rose QC, is expected to report next month. In another twist, a lawyer last night . claimed a further 'two dozen' BBC women – some of them famous names – . have come forward in the past week complaining of sexual discrimination, . bullying or harassment. Ann Olivarius, said there was 'a . culture full of male bias at the BBC'. Following a talk she gave to 150 . women in the arts, two dozen 'talked about sexual discrimination and . about bullying and inappropriate sexual advances'. The Rose review was launched in . October following a wave of damaging claims from female presenters . including Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig, who said they were routinely . groped while working for the BBC. Gagging clauses are typically part of . 'compromise agreements' signed when an employee agrees to drop an . employment tribunal claim in return for a pay-off. Around 20 of the 850 people who came . forward to the inquiry at first believed they were unable to speak . because they had signed gagging agreements. It is understood that, . following negotiations, their evidence was eventually allowed to go . forward. The BBC insists no one has been barred from giving evidence, despite any previous agreements which may have been signed. One person the BBC is said to have . tried to silence is believed to be Liz MacKean, the Newsnight reporter . whose Savile investigation was shelved in 2011. A gagging agreement was suggested during discussions over voluntary redundancy, it is understood. Yesterday Miss MacKean said she had not and would not sign any such clause, but declined to comment further. The use of gagging clauses by the BBC . to hush up potentially embarrassing sex and bullying claims has become . 'insidious', according to Miriam O'Reilly, the Countryfile presenter who . won an ageism employment tribunal. The BBC are accused of using taxpayers' money to gag female members of staff who made complaints about sexual harassment and bullying . Miss O'Reilly, who refused to sign a gagging order when she left the BBC, said: 'It's corporate bullying of the worst kind. 'I am hoping the new director-general sorts this out, this nasty subversive underbelly.' A BBC spokesman said: 'No staff past . or present have been prevented from contributing to the review, . including those who have signed compromise agreements ... When . approached by individuals who had signed a compromise agreement, the BBC . has made it clear we welcomed their input to this review.' One of the women said her gag was still active even though she left over 10 years after witnessing bullying. 'I would physically shield my staff from the shouting and intimidation,' she told the Sunday Times. 'When I followed the proper procedures to say staff were being bullied, the BBC ended my contract and the bully was allowed to continue to work there for a number of years.' Another woman told of how taxpayers' money was being used to silence women who made sex complaints. She said: 'This is taxpayers' money being spent to stop me talking about discrimination against women in the BBC.' The Respect at Work review was launched by the former director general George Entwistle last October after news emerged that many of Savile's alleged offences took place on BBC premises. The complainants have branded the BBC as 'hypocrites' for imposing the gags whilst proclaiming to be in the process of 'cleaning up' the culture which enabled Jimmy Savile to commit sex crimes without being exposed . The news comes in the same week veteran BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall, 83, made his first court appearance for 18 separate charges of sexual abuse spanning almost two decades. Hall faces one charge of raping a young woman and 14 counts of indecent assault against children as young as nine. He is alleged to have raped a 22-year-old woman in 1976 and 14 other alleged sexual assaults relate to 10 girls aged between nine and 16, between 1967 and 1986. He denies any wrongdoing.","Up to 20 former staff made to sign contracts to stop them whistleblowing .

"PUBLISHED: . 05:33 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:40 EST, 9 May 2013 . Ali Haider Gilani (pictured), son of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani,  was kidnapped today during campaign rally by gunmen . Gunmen attacked an election rally in Pakistan's southern Punjab province on Thursday and abducted the son of a former prime minister, intensifying what has already been a violent run-up to Saturday's nationwide elections. Ali Haider Gilani, the son of ex-premier Yousuf Raza Gilani, is running for a provincial assembly seat in the district of Multan. He was attending an election event in the town of Multan on Thursday - the last day of campaigning across Pakistan - when the gunmen pulled up, started shooting, grabbed and threw him into a vehicle and drove off, officials and witnesses said. A resident of Multan who attended the rally told a local TV station that the attackers first pulled up in a car and motorcycle outside the venue where the younger Gilani was meeting with a few hundred supporters. When he came out of the building, two gunmen opened fire, killing one of the people in Gilani's entourage. 'One of the gunmen grabbed Haider who had blood splashed on his trousers,"" said Shehryar Ali in comments aired by Pakistani television broadcaster Geo News. A Punjab government official, Rao Iftikhar Ahmad, said one of Gilani's guards was killed and five people were wounded in the attack. It was not immediately known who abducted Gilani or why. Saturday's election marks a historic milestone for Pakistan as one civilian government completes its term and prepares to hand off to another. But the race has been marred by a string of violent attacks against candidates and election events. Much of the violence has been at the hands of the Taliban, which has mainly targeted political parties that have supported military operations against the militants in northwestern Pakistan. Gilani is running as a candidate for the Pakistan People's Party, one of the three parties the Taliban has said it is focusing on. Gilani's father served for roughly four years as prime minister but was forced out of office last summer by the Supreme Court after refusing to pursue a corruption case against President Asif Ali Zardari. Pakistan's Taliban plan to carry out suicide bombings during Saturday's election in a bid to undermine the poll, according to a letter from the leader of the militant group. Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, in a message to the group's spokesman, outlined plans for attacks, including suicide blasts, in all four of the country's provinces. Ali Haider Gilani (wearing garland) talking with supporters prior to his abduction by unknown gunmen, in Multan earlier today. One of Gilani's guards was killed and five people were wounded in the attack . 'We don't accept the system of infidels which is called democracy,"" Mehsud said in the letter, dated May 1, and obtained by Reuters on Thursday. Since April, the al Qaeda-linked Pakistani Taliban have killed more than 100 people in attacks on candidates and rallies, particularly those of secular-leaning parties, in a bid to undermine elections they regard as un-Islamic. The attacks have prevented candidates from the three main parties in the ruling coalition from holding big rallies. Instead, they have relied on door-to-door campaigning or small meetings in homes or on street corners. Pakistan's former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani (pictured), the father of kidnapped Ali Haider Gilani . Pakistan's military said on Thursday it would send tens of thousands of troops to polling stations and counting centres to prevent the Taliban from disrupting the election. The polls, already Pakistan's most . violent, marks the first time that a civilian government will complete a . full term and hand over to another administration. The Taliban are blamed for many of the suicide bombings across Pakistan, a nuclear-armed strategic ally. Army . spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa said 300,000 security officials, . including 32,000 troops, had been deployed in Punjab, the most populous . province. 'Definitely . they have reports and obviously they have made a plan to counter that,"" newspapers quoted him as saying, referring to security agencies getting . threats of violence from the Taliban. Another 96,000 security forces would be deployed in the northwest of Pakistan, where the Taliban operate from strongholds. Sharif's . Pakistan Muslim League (PMLN) has capitalised on widespread . frustrations with the outgoing government led by the Pakistan People's . Party (PPP). The military has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 66-year history, either through coups or from behind the scenes.","Ali Haider Gilani is running for provincial assembly seat in district of Multan .

A millionaire property developer is embroiled in a planning row with his council after he was ordered to remove two £15,000 lion-topped gate posts from his castle. Edward Packer, 73, is furious after officials ruled that the . 12ft high Bath stone pillars outside his seven-bedroom £1.7million property are 'out . of keeping' with the local area. The gateposts, which were modelled on the entrance to Chepstow Racecourse, were built without planning permission just before Christmas. Country pile: Edward Packer has been ordered to pull down these £15,000 lion-topped pillars outside his castle because he doesn't have planning permission . Order: Mr Packer, 73, received a council enforcement notice over the 12ft Bath stone pillars he had built just before Christmas . The builder, who moved into his 1840s property around 15 years ago, has been handed an enforcement notice and told to remove them. But Mr Packer says the posts have been . well-received by local residents and has vowed to fight the 'unelected . officials' who are demanding their removal. The property magnate, who lives in the . exclusive Sneyd Park area of Bristol, said: 'An Englishman's home is . supposed to be his castle. 'Well, I live in a castle but it . doesn't feel that way after seeing these officials come up here and tell . me to take my pillars down.' His property is one of the most . exclusive addresses in Bristol and has around ten acres of land backing . onto the stunning Avon Gorge. Mr Packer has instructed his lawyers to challenge the enforcement notice, a process he expects to cost him £3,000. He criticised Bristol's general . attitude towards planning policy, adding: 'You can't get anything done . in this city. We haven't got a decent football stadium and no concert . venue either.' A letter from the council states the . new pillars are 'out of keeping' with the listed house and have 'no . substantial public benefit'. But Mr Packer disputes the council's claim and says the posts are an asset, which enhance the road. He said: 'They say it is out of . context with the area, but it's the area which is out of context with . our house, with all the modern developments which were allowed to be . built around here. Exclusive home: Mr Packer's seven-bedroom house built in the style of a castle. He modelled the pillars topped with lions on the entrance to Chepstow Racecourse . Ornate: The stone lion which builder Edward Packer put up on top of his gate posts . 'I see the posts as an asset, which enhances the folly. I haven't met one person who doesn't like them. 'It seems that in the hands of these unelected officials who come up here it must be pulled down.' The builder, who grew up on a Bristol council estate, said he was unaware his new gate posts would need planning permission. The businessman criticised the 'draconian' council which, he claims, will not even allow him to apply for consent retrospectively. He said: 'I didn't realise we needed planning permission for the pillars. 'I found out afterwards that anything above 3ft needed permission so I applied for retrospective planning and they wouldn't have it. 'They won't even let me speak to a conservation officer. The council is so draconian, trees have more rights than people here. 'It is not like it is a block of flats I've just built, they are pillars at the front of a home in a quiet cul-de-sac. What harm will they do? Not one person has complained to me. 'I've lived at the home for 15 years and we've spent thousands restoring it. 'The councillors are a waste of time, they just rubber stamp what unelected planners say. The planners and politicians in Bristol are too busy fighting each other to help the people. Castle: The seven-bedroom home of builder Edward Packer, 73, which has been designed to look like a castle . Model: The South Gate to Chepstow racecourse, featuring a pair of stone lions, which Mr Packer built the gates outside his home to look like . 'We've now got to wait for an officer from the Department of Environment to make an independent decision.' Mr Packer, who still works six days a . week despite being 73, says nobody has contacted him personally other . than to say they didn't like the colour. He added: 'The council said the . pillars are out of context with the home, but the whole area is out of . context with the home so that point is a load of rubbish. 'Apparently there have been five . complaints but no one has told me they don't like the gates. One person . said they didn't like the colour. 'Some people have been talking about me like I'm some toff. 'My father was a prisoner of war in . Japan and he died in 1950 because of it. My mother bought me up in a . council house in Bristol. I'm just a working class, hard working . builder.' The council has defended the decision, . claiming the authority's planning department had received five . complaints about the pillars. Spokesman Peter Wood said: . 'Enforcement officers met with colleagues in the Heritage and . Conservation Team and assessed the pillars to be harmful to the setting . of the listed building and this part of the Sneyd Park Conservation . Area.

A four-year-old boy has to drink more than 20 litres of water every day because of a rare kidney disorder. Dominic Webster suffers from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition that affects just one in 25,000 people. The rare disorder means his body's water regulating system is disrupted, causing him to suffer from extreme thirst. Not only does Dominic drink gallons . of water each day, he must also maintain a low salt diet and could need a . kidney transplant when he is older. Mother Katie Webster, 28, from Bolton, Manchester, knew just after Dominic was born that something was wrong. She . said: 'Dominic was under a paediatrician since birth and they checked . for everything and said they would have to discharge him, but because I . persisted they sent him for one last scan where they found he had . problems. 'I felt . relieved that they found something because I felt like I was being a . worrying, hypochondriac mother but I also felt sad that he will be able . to lead a normal but very limited life.' According to NHS Choices, the condition affects one in 25,000 people, including adults, across the UK. It is usually caused by injury or infection and people of all ages and ethnicities can be affected. Medics do not yet know how Dominic's . condition will affect him as he grows up, but Mrs Webster, and her . husband, Dominic's father, Neil, aged 44, have already been told that he . has just 10 per cent function in his left kidney. Dominic (centre) eats the same meals as his older sister Isabel, 5, (left) but they are prepared differently by mother, Katie (right) to be lower in salt and sugar to protect his already fragile kidneys . Not only does Dominic drink gallons of water each day, he must also maintain a low salt diet and could need a kidney transplant when he is older . DI is a condition caused by too little antidiuretic hormone (ADH) being produced by the body. ADH is made in the a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. A deficiency causes a patient to pass too much urine - in the most severe cases a person can pass up to 20 litres a day. Because of this, fluid levels in the body can drop dangerously low, causing severe dehydration. The condition places stress on the kidneys. The kidneys play a vital role in a many different bodily functions. They are responsible for filtering toxic waste and extra fluid from the body, maintaining blood pressure and producing red blood cells. Treatment involves staying hydrated and taking medication to control symptoms. When he was a baby, Dominic suffered from unexplained fevers, vomiting, was irritable, had headaches and was constantly tired. He was finally diagnosed with the rare condition in January. Mrs Webster said: 'He is very clever for is age and he is aware of his problems. He will say to people he has a kidney problem.' She added: 'We have to be very careful with his diet. He has to have a low salt and sugar diet and low protein diet with few processed meats. 'He drinks excessively - it can be up to 20 litres a day and will go to the toilet 20 to 30 times a day. 'When everybody at nursery is having cake and fruit drinks he can't have them. He absolutely loves chocolate and sweets too.' Mrs Webster said Dominic is able to eat most of the same meals as his brothers and sisters - Jordan, aged 11, Abigail, aged 10 and five-year-old Isabel, as she cooks his food in a different pan and does not use salt. Dominic is not on any medication but has undergone several operations while under the care of three specialists at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, and he has appointments every six weeks.","Dominic Webster has nephrogenic diabetes insipidus - affects 1 in 25,000 .

A rare white tiger that has appeared at rallies during Pakistan's election season has died of dehydration. The tiger, a mascot of the conservative Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party, often appeared at events led by the party chief's daughter Maryam Nawaz. It fell unconscious and was taken to the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Lahore on Tuesday night. The white tiger has been a frequent sight at rallies for the political party Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz - but died following 30C heat . But vets could not save the animal, which belonged to a party worker, and it died yesterday morning. Live tigers and lions are a familiar sight to those at PML-N's rallies. Last week a complaint was made to the Election Commission but it said the matter did not fall under its remit, reports Dawn. The World Wide Fund for Nature said white tigers are extremely sensitive to heat and noise and that the animal could not cope with Lahore's 30C heat and the noise of the rallies. The WWF said it is supporting a petition by actor and conservationist Faryal Gohar at the Lahore High Court against the illegal use of wild animals at rallies.

Scandal-hit security firm G4S is to be responsible for protecting the world’s most powerful men and women after to winning a contract to stand guard at next month’s G8 summit. The much-criticised firm made such a mess of providing security of the London Olympics last year that the army had to be drafted in to keep the event safe. But today ministers insisted the company had learned the lessons of last summer’s fiasco and could cope with preventing an attack on the leaders of the world's eight wealthiest countries at the summit in Northern Ireland. G4S security staff have been drafted in by the government to protect the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, despite last year's fiasco where it failed to provide enough guards for the London Olympics . The scandal-hit firm will be tasked with securing the site when it plays host to world leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper . The company is to supply 450 employees to guard the G8 event at Lough Erne golf resort in June. The leaders of the G8 include US President Barack Obama,  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, French President François Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, Russian President Vladimir Putin and UK Minister David Cameron, who plays host this year. After the Olympics debacle, G4S’s chief executive Nick Buckles was hauled before MPs, where he admitted it was a ‘humiliating shambles for the company’ Failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave . A guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive' In 2011, staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher Lowcock's artificial limb . Despite claims at the time that the company would struggle to win government contracts again after putting the world’s biggest sporting event in jeopardy, it landed the deal to provide security to the G8. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers insisted the government was confident that G8 could cope this time, despite police warnings of thousands of protestors descending on the site. ‘The G8 is considerably less than the numbers that were required for the mammoth operation at the Olympics,' she said. However Ms Villiers declined to say . how many extra troops would be deployed to Co Fermanagh for the two-day . summit next month but said military assistance would be used to back up . the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Army helicopters will be used to fly world leaders and their entourages to and from the event outside Enniskillen. Northern Ireland-based company Event Sec will also be used to secure perimeters and to carry out searches. Ms Villiers added: 'Of course in relation to the Olympics very serious concern was expressed about the failings of G4S. 'Lessons have been learned and the contracts awarded by the Foreign Office take into account those lessons. 'In fact one of the reasons why we have two firms in this instance, not just G4S but Event Sec as well, was to build in further resilience.' A total of 3,600 police officers from forces in England, Scotland and Wales are being drafted into Northern Ireland to bolster the 7,500 from the PSNI. The UK government chose the Lough Erne Resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland to host the gathering of the world's most powerful leaders . However, the Secretary of State refused to be drawn on further details of the Army's role. The leaders of the world's eight wealthiest countries are expected in Fermanagh on June 17 and 18. Meanwhile, PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott said he expected thousands of protesters to descend on Northern Ireland during the G8 Summit. He said: ‘We are expecting demonstrations in Belfast and we are expecting some in Enniskillen as well. I would anticipate thousands. There are many routes into Northern Ireland.’ The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games . With just weeks before the London . Olympics opened in July last year, G4S admitted it would not be able to . provide the thousands of guards it had promised. Its reputation was severely damaged when 3,500 troops were called in to provide security at the biggest events. GFS chief Nick Buckles admitted the Olympics fiasco had been a 'humiliating shambles' G4S was left nursing losses of £88 million after it failed to provide all of its 10,400 contracted employees last year. The fiasco wiped millions of the value of the firm, which has an annual turnover of some £7.5billion. The company provides security at 14 UK . airports and four ports, and also runs six prisons, four children's . homes and two immigration centres, and tags 14,000 offenders. It has also made major in-roads in to carrying out police work, providing security at 500 police stations and 30 custody suites. And last month it emerged staff from the company were being hired by police forces to run murder and rape inquiries. Senior investigators from the firm – ridiculed for the Olympics security fiasco – are even helping overworked officers on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse case. Retired detectives are earning more than £60,000 a year in their new roles, on top of lucrative gold-plated public sector pensions. For the G8, the company said its staff will provide stewarding, monitoring of site perimeters and securing access to venues. The company has previously provided support to a number of international summits on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, including the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles and the G20 Summit in London. Eric Alexander, managing director of G4S Events, said: ‘We are delighted to have been awarded this contract and be given the opportunity to use our proven expertise to help the PSNI secure this extremely high profile event.’","Security company hired by UK government to guard G8 summit .

The man who once shared a sprawling Las Vegas mansion with his lover Liberace and was lavished with jewels and furs and plastic surgery, is now broke and behind bars for theft. Scott Thorson was rescued from a miserable home life by the over-the-top entertainer when he was just 16. The two became lovers, according to Thorson, and possibly something more. ‘It was strange,’ the 54-year-old told ET in April. ‘It was kind of like a father/son relationship. But we had sex.’ Then: Scott Thorson once lived a lavish life as the young lover of showman Liberace but says the pianist forced him to get plastic surgery to look like his son . Interviewing from a Nevada jail, Thorson recently sat for a lengthy New York Times profile about his roller coaster of a life. For instance, Thorson revealed not long ago that Liberace convinced him to get extensive facial plastic surgery to make him look like Liberace’s own offspring. ‘He had a doctor fly from Beverly Hills,’ Thorson told ET. ‘And he had a big portrait on the wall of himself. He said, “I want you to make him look like he's my son.”’ With his now pointier nose and cheek bones, the former hunky on-stage chauffeur for Liberace bemoaned his inability to make $15,000 bail. Better days: On stage with Liberace, Thorson played the hunky chauffeur . ‘All these people are getting rich from my story, and here I sit,’ he complained to the Times from detention in Washoe County, Nevada. Though he received a reported $100,000 for the film rights to his autobiographical book,  ‘Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace,’  he pled guilty to stealing and using someone else’s credit cards. Directed by auteur Steven Soderbergh, the film adaptation of Behind the Candelabra stars Matt Damon and Michael Douglas. Now: Thorson seems to have fallen far, having recently pleaded guilty to stealing a credit card and using it to buy a Reno hotel room . The movie has created a lot of buzz in recent months, likely because it does just what the title implies. While alive, Liberace was fiercely private about his homosexuality. But Thorson’s life appears just as interesting, at least the parts that one is able to believe. In 1982, Thorson says he and Liberace abruptly parted ways when the extravagant star kicked him out of their Los Angeles penthouse, in part because of the younger man’s drug use. Tell all: Thorson penned a book, 'Behind the Candelabra,' in 1988 which has become a soon-to-air HBO film . Big names: The film is directed by Steven Soderbergh and stars Matt Damon as Thorson and Michael Douglas as Liberace . Thorson would later embroil his old lover in a high-profile palimony suit. He asked for over $100 million but ultimately received $95,000. Thorson bounced around the country and claims he was even once in a high-profile Hollywood murder trial that forced him into the witness protection program. Accounts of what went on since then vary. Old friends of Thorson’s often seem to remember things differently from him. But what is certain is that he wasn’t busy making a lot of money. Thorson now says treatments for advanced colon cancer have left him penniless. None of this, of course, is in the HBO film. Nonetheless, you can catch its premier May 26 at 9pm. Fallen: Thorson does a jailhouse interview with Entertainment Tonight.

Bangladeshi authorities have ordered the shut down of 18 clothes factories for safety reasons, as the death toll from the factory collapse last month passed 800. Dozens of bodies recovered today from collapsed Rana Plaza near Dhaka, which housed five garment factories, were so decomposed they were being sent to a lab for DNA identification, police said. The workers there made clothes for familiar High Street brands including Primark and Matalan in the UK, and Spanish label Mango. The grim work goes on: Excavators clear debris . as Bangladeshi rescue and army personnel continue recovery operations at . the site of the eight-storey building collapse in Savar on the . outskirts of Dhaka earlier today. Dozens of bodies recovered today were so badly decomposed they have been sent for DNA identification, police said . Masked rescue workers retrieve a dead body from . the rubble: The workers at the factories made clothes for familiar High . Street brands including Primark and Matalan in the UK, and Spanish label . Mango. This afternoon police in Bangladesh said the bodies of 803 garment factory workers have been recovered so far . Following protests, authorities also began disbursing salaries and other benefits to survivors of the collapse and ordered the shut down of a string of factories over further safety concerns. The latter move came days after Bangladesh agreed with the International Labor Organisation to give safety 'the highest consideration', despite fears Western bargain retailers might source goods elsewhere. 'Sixteen factories have been closed down in Dhaka and two in Chittagong,' said textile minister Abdul Latif Siddique, adding that more could be shut if they do not meet strict new safety measures. He added: 'We have seen that those who claim to be the best compliant factories in Bangladesh have not fully abided by building regulations.' Police said 803 bodies had been recovered from the wreckage of the eight-story Rana Plaza building by late afternoon. More were expected as salvage work continued two weeks after the April 24 collapse. The owner of the building only had permission for a five storey structure and there is speculation that his exceeding that was the cause of the collapse. Heartbroken: A woman cries as she looks for her missing sister next to covered dead bodies laid out near the site of the collapsed Rana Plaza . No time for dignityL Bangladeshis stand near stacks of coffins at a makeshift morgue where hundreds of the bodies of those killed in the disaster are being kept . Men cry after discovering the body of a relative at the makeshift morgue: There is no clear indication of how many bodies still remain trapped in the debris . Memories: Women hold photos of their relatives missing since the disaster as they scour the morgues trying to find their lost loved ones . Now for the task of living: Vogobati, a garment worker who survived the building collapse, comes to collect salaries given by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier today . There is no clear indication of how many bodies still remain trapped in the debris because the exact number of people inside the building at the time of the incident is unknown. More than 2,500 people were pulled from the rubble alive in the days following the disaster. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier said 3,122 workers were employed at the five factories housed in the building, but it was not clear how many were there during the packed morning shift. Mass burial: The bodies of 34 unidentified garment workers killed when the Rana Plaza building collapsed in Bangaladesh have been interred in a mass burial a week after the disaster . Tragedy: Several hundred people attended the mass burial in Dhaka today, which took place amid calls for the owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, to face the death penalty . Major General Chowdhury Hasan . Suhrawardy, a top military official in the area, said the operation to . recover bodies from the tangle of wreckage could continue for two to . three more days. His men had . to send 36 decomposing bodies to Dhaka Medical College Hospital to . collect DNA samples because they were beyond identification, he said. With . temperatures at the site exceeding 30C and rain pouring down almost . constantly, authorities expect to send many more rotting corpses for DNA . identification in the coming days. The . disaster is the worst ever in the garment sector, far surpassing fires . last year that killed about 260 people in Pakistan and 112 in . Bangladesh, as well as the 1911 garment disaster in New York's Triangle . Shirtwaist factory that killed 146 workers. A country in mourning: A crowd gathered in front of the row of graves at the traditional Muslim funeral today, following the horrific collapse that exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry . Death toll: Dozens of unclaimed bodies were buried in Dhaka today in the wake of the horrific accident, which claimed the lives of more than 400 workers . Anger: The building collapse, in which at least 410 people died and 2,500 were injured, was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history . Sorrow: The European Union is considering trade action against Bangladesh, which has preferential access to EU markets for its garments, in order to pressure Dhaka to improve safety standards after the building collapse killed hundreds of factory workers . Consequences: Rescue workers fear the death toll could rise even further after the collapse, which reduced the building filled with workers to an estimated 600 tons of rubble . After . hundreds of garment workers protested for compensation yesterday, . authorities started disbursing salaries and other benefits. General . Suhrawardy said some 400 workers gathered last night to receive dues . and benefits. Rafiqul Islam, a BGMEA official, said the disbursement . would continue in phases. Mr . Islam said they planned to meet with workers' representatives later . today to discuss how to reach out to victims for proper disbursement of . compensation and other financial aid. The . workers, many of whom made little more than the national minimum wage . of about $38 per month, are demanding at least four months' salary. They . had set yesterday as a deadline for the payment of wages and other . benefits. 'Their blood will not be valueless': The owner of the building is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work - which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail . Fury: The owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was seen wearing a police-issue helmet and body armour as he was escorted from a hearing at the High Court in Bangladesh . Local government . administrator Yousuf Harun has said no salary remained unpaid except for . the month of April and there was an agreement for the workers to . receive an additional three months of pay. The . BGMEA said Monday that it was preparing a complete list of workers . employed in the Rana Plaza factories and the process would take a few . more days. Bangladesh earns nearly $20 billion a year from exports of garment products, mainly to the United States and Europe. Officials . say the building's owner illegally added three floors and allowed the . garment factories to install heavy machines and generators, even though . the structure was not designed to support such equipment.

The Church of England was mired in a sex abuse scandal yesterday after a former choirboy alleged he was groomed and drawn into a sexual relationship by a senior cleric. Eli Ward said he was first singled out by the Dean of Manchester, the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, at the age of 11 and was then a close companion of his over a five-year period. The allegations made in public by Mr Ward for the first time yesterday led to suggestions of a cover-up over the Church’s response following complaints to bishops in 2003. Victim: Eli Ward was repeatedly molested by David Waddington while a choirboy at Manchester Cathedral . But the former Archbishop of York, . Lord Hope of Thornes, who at the time oversaw the Manchester diocese, . said he did not tell police and social services because Church rules . then did not require it and because the Dean was dying of cancer. Mr Ward, now 40, said he was sleeping . in the Dean’s bed by the time he was 13 and by his mid-teens was . spending almost every weekend and many nights at the cleric’s house. He . went with him on holidays to Cornwall, the Lake District, Paris and the . South of France. The abuse started when Mr Waddington . began the grooming process in 1984 and ended after suspicions were . raised in the Manchester diocese in 1989, Mr Ward told the Times . newspaper. In 2004, Dean Waddington, who had by then retired, was . stripped of his right to lead Church services by Lord Hope but no . information was passed on to police or social services. The Dean died in . 2007. Yesterday Lord Hope said: ‘I . strenuously deny, and am obviously disappointed at, the suggestion that . myself or my team at the time would have acted negligently in this or . any other safeguarding matter. ‘There is no automatic legal obligation on the Church to refer allegations by adults to the police or social services. Scandal: Former Archbishop of York Lord Hope, left, was told of child sex abuse allegations against Dean of Manchester Robert Waddington, right, but did not report them to the police . ‘In considering whether children would . be at risk from Robert Waddington I decided under these guidelines that . this would not be the case given his serious ill health following . cancer surgery. The following year I revoked Robert Waddington’s . permission to officiate.’ Lord Hope added: ‘I am deeply aware of . the pain caused to any victim of child abuse, especially at the hands . of a trustworthy person within the Church.’ Mr Ward’s lawyers have now made a personal injury compensation claim against the Dean and Chapter of Manchester. He said that until last year he . thought he could deal with the memories but then he felt ‘there’s . something drastically wrong with me and I then started to scream very . loudly that I needed help.’ Mr Ward said he came from a poor background in Salford and joined the cathedral choir in Manchester at the age of seven. Four years later Dean Waddington, a . former headmaster and then the most senior education official working . for the Church’s parliament, the General Synod, arrived in the city. He . said the Dean showed him special favour, helping him with his homework, . picking him up in his car to take him to choir practice, asking him out . to tea and taking him for days out. He asked Mr Ward’s mother if the boy . could stay with him overnight. The room in which the boy slept had a . large poster of a horrifying painting by 16th century artist Hieronymus . Bosch, which gave him nightmares. Cathedral: Waddington targeted Manchester choirboys as well as pupils at an Australian boarding school . Mr Ward said: ‘He turned round to me . one day and said, “Would you rather stay in my room? Is that painting . too scary for you?” and of course I said yes.’ Mr Ward began sleeping in the Dean’s bed, where eventually hugs became kissing. He said that sexual contact began . after he was distressed over a break-up with a girlfriend. He said he . felt obliged to perform sexual acts when the Dean asked: ‘Do you love me . this much?’ Mr Ward told the Times he had now . broken off contact with his own family. He said: ‘I have no relationship . with my family now because I asked severe, strong questions of my . family: why did you let it happen? I was the boyfriend of a monster – so . what does that make me?’ Mr Ward said that he was told by the Dean that if questioned by the Press he should lie about what was going on. After a senior cathedral official did . begin to inquire about the relationship, the Dean told Mr Ward to quit . the choir in 1989 and he did so. He last saw the Dean on his wedding . day, when the Dean conducted the ceremony. Mr Ward later told his wife . about the abuse. ‘As soon as I told her, our relationship split like an . axe,’ he added. The Right Reverend Paul Butler, the . head of the Churches National Safeguarding Committee, said: ‘As a Church . we will always apologise for past systems that let down the vulnerable . and offer support to anyone whose life has been affected. Today we have . robust safeguarding policies in place.’","Robert Waddington, former Dean of Manchester, attacked several boys .

Curbs on immigrants’ access to benefits, the NHS and housing unveiled in the Queen’s Speech prompted a storm of controversy last night. David Cameron said a crowd-pleasing package of measures would ‘attract people who will contribute’ but ‘deter those who will not’, and hailed other moves to help ordinary families as evidence that the Government is ‘standing up for hard-working people’. But Labour suggested one proposal – to require landlords to check the immigration status of tenants – risked encouraging racism, while others insisted doctors and property owners should not be made to do the work of immigration officials. SCROLL DOWN FOR QUEEN'S SPEECH HIGHLIGHTS . Regal: Queen Elizabeth accompanied by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall at the State Opening of Parliament at the Palace of Westminster . Support: Prince Charles sits next to the Queen in the Lords as she announces 20 bills which her Government hopes to pass in the coming year . Concentration: As his mother reads her speech . today, Charles and his second wife listen intently to the proposed . legislation she announced . Loyal: Her Majesty was accompanied as usual by Prince Philip, but the Queen is understood to be concerned not to put too much strain on her husband, who will be 92 next month . The Royal College of General Practitioners said GPs were not prepared to act as a new ‘border agency’ policing access to healthcare. Some of the measures, including a six-month time limit on benefit claims, a local residency test for council house access and a residency requirement before accessing civil legal aid, will be in place within months. But those requiring full-scale legislation, including measures to ensure temporary migrants or their governments are made to pay for using the NHS and requirements on landlords and employers to check the status of tenants and employees, are unlikely to be in place in time for January. That is when controls on Romanian and Bulgarian incomers will be lifted. Regal: A smiling Queen Elizabeth II leaves through the Norman Porch of the Palace of Westminster having given her speech to the assembled Lords and MPs today . Departure: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are then led away as the head back to the Palace this afternoon . Exit: The grinning monarch looks pleased that her speech over, as a pleased Charles and Camilla are taken home by carriage . Iconic: The famous outline of the Queen after she announced the Government would impose a fresh clampdown on immigration . Yesterday's Queen’s Speech was billed as an attempt by the Government finally to get tough on immigration. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the intention was to remove the ‘pull factors’ to Britain. Here, our Home Affairs Editor examines the planned legislation. DETER ILLEGALS . Plan: Blitz on firms who use illegal labour. Current fines of £10,000 per worker ‘substantially’ increased. Law changed to ban illegals from holding a driving licence. Will it work? Only if businesses think they will be caught. The number of employers prosecuted was only 1,215 last year – down from 2,092 in 2010. Does nothing to deter the supposed target of David Cameron’s crackdown – the Romanians and Bulgarians who gain free access to the labour market in January. At best, it will reduce net migration by convincing people currently working in the black economy to go home. NHS . Plan: Force temporary migrants to make a contribution to the cost of their healthcare. Ask non-EU nationals to pay a bond before travelling to Britain. Ask health staff to check a migrant is here legally. Will it work? Nurses and doctors are livid at the idea of being asked to conduct immigration checks. GP leaders said they ‘have a duty of care to all people’. Identifying migrants who should pay for care is very different from being able to recover the money, once they have received emergency treatment. Critics say the only way to solve the problem is to introduce an entitlement card. PRIVATE LANDLORDS . Plan: Force private landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants or risk huge fines. Will it work? Was already descending into a shambles last night with ministers unable to explain how it would work. There are two million buy-to-let landlords in the private sector. Expecting them to guess who might be an illegal migrant on sight is fraught with difficulty. Civil liberties groups claim the plan could amount to discrimination – with legal challenges expected. Large numbers of forged documents in circulation could quickly render the checks meaningless. And some critics say the measures will be limited in effectiveness as illegal migrants could be living in sub-let social housing, sleeping on friends’ floors or in garden sheds. HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE . Plan: Restrict appeals in immigration cases. Change law to stop foreign criminals using article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the right to a family life – to thwart deportation attempts in the UK courts. Will it work? The simplest and potentially most effective aspect of the crackdown. The danger, however, is that Strasbourg – which has shown limited interest in article 8 – will itself begin intervening on family-life grounds. Solving this problem would require withdrawing from the European Court of Human Rights. RESTRICT ACCESS TO BENEFITS . Plan: Strip migrants of out-of-work benefits after six months if they are not on the verge of getting a job . Will it work? Not in Queen’s Speech but will be introduced at a later stage. Labour say it is a con as existing DWP guidelines state migrants must be ‘genuinely seeking work, and have a reasonable chance of being engaged’ if they wish to continue receiving State handouts. EU regulations say the same thing. So, while it sounds tough, the impact is likely to be limited.Although the Queen’s Speech, which . included 15 Bills and signalled four others, was finalised before UKIP’s . surge in last week’s council elections, the focus on immigration is . seen as a response to public concerns which the Eurosceptic party has . successfully exploited. The Queen told MPs and peers that her Government’s top priority remained the economy. But she said an Immigration Bill will . aim to ‘ensure that this country attracts people  who will contribute . and deter those who  will not’. Measures will regulate migrant access . to the NHS, with incomers expected to be given temporary rather than . permanent NHS numbers and charged for access to all but emergency . treatment. There will also be steps to  prevent . illegal immigrants from obtaining driving licences, bigger fines for . businesses using illegal labour and a requirement on private landlords . to check the immigration status of tenants. The Bill will make it easier to remove . people from the UK, limiting rights to appeal against deportation. Access to benefits will also be limited, and clearer priority given to . long-term local residents in social housing queues. Pageantry: Two boys help with the the Queen's parliamentary robe as she prepares to take a seat and give her annual address . Audience: Peers watch Her Majesty as she prepares to give her 2013 Queen's speech . In the Commons, Mr Cameron said: ‘Put . simply, our Immigration Bill will back aspiration and end the legacy of . the last government where people could come here and expect something . for nothing.’ He said the legislation was vital as . Labour had left a system  which was ‘out of control’, with around a . third of the ‘skilled’ migrants who came to the UK under Labour having . ended up ‘in low-skilled roles working  in takeaways or as security . guards’. The Prime Minister added: ‘Our . determination to end the last government’s something- for-nothing . culture is also why  we continue to pursue our  welfare reforms – every . one of them is about making sure  work pays.’ He pointed out that Labour leader Ed . Miliband had ordered his MPs to vote against the £26,000 benefit cap and . the one per cent freeze on annual benefits increases. ‘We are standing . up for hard-working people,’ he said. ‘This is a Queen’s Speech that . will back aspiration and those who want to get on.’ The Imperial State Crown is carried on a cushion as it arrives for the State Opening of Parliament .

Dramatic: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh walk up the stairs towards the House of Lords flanked by the Armed Forces .

Mr Miliband insisted the  Coalition . was doing nothing to boost growth, cut youth unemployment or tackle . rising living costs and was a ‘tired and failing government’. ‘Out of touch, out of ideas, standing up for the wrong people and unable to bring the change the country needs,’ he added. Attacking Mr Cameron’s attempt to win . back some of those who voted UKIP in last week’s elections, Mr Miliband . said: ‘They used to call them clowns. Now they want to join the circus.’ Labour’s housing spokesman Jack Dromey said: ‘Tackling illegal . immigration must not take us back to the days when my Irish father was . turned away from boarding houses displaying “no dogs, no Irish” signs.’ Dr Clare Gerada, head of the Royal . College of GPs, said: ‘Whilst the health system must not be abused and . we must bring an end to health tourism, it is important that we do not . overestimate the problem and that GPs are not placed in the invidious . position of being the new border agency.’ Jeremy Raj, of the London law firm .

A new analysis of more than 33,000 cases of foodborne illness in the U.S. shows that ground beef and chicken have caused more hospital visits than other meats. The report by the Center for Science in Public Interest says chicken nuggets, ham and sausage pose the lowest risk of foodborne illness. Something fowl: A new analysis of more than 33,000 cases of foodborne illness in the U.S. shows that ground beef and chicken have caused more hospital visits than other meats . The group used government data on 1,700 outbreaks over 12 years to analyze salmonella, E. coli, listeria and other pathogens that were definitively linked to a certain meat. To calculate which meats were riskiest, CSPI ranked the foods in which contamination was most likely to cause hospitalizations. Some meats may have had more illnesses but were less likely to cause severe illness. After ground beef and chicken, CSPI categorized turkey and steak as 'high risk' and deli meat, pork, roast beef and beef or pork barbeque as 'medium risk.' Salmonella and E. coli, pathogens that contaminate meat and poultry during slaughter and processing, accounted for a third of the illnesses surveyed. Clostridium perfringens, a lesser-known pathogen that usually grows after processing when foods are left at improper temperatures for too long by consumers or food establishments, accounted for another third. Brisket business: Ground beef and chicken pose the highest threat for food-borne illness, while sausage, ham, and chicken nuggets have the least . While a large number of chicken illnesses were due to clostridium perfringens, chicken led to many hospitalizations partly because of the high incidence of salmonella in chicken that isn't properly cooked. Most of the ground beef illnesses were from E. coli, which is found in the intestinal tracts of cattle and can transfer to the carcass if the meat isn't handled properly during slaughter. Ground beef can be riskier than steak and other beef products because pathogens are spread during the grinding process. According to the report, listeria, salmonella and E. coli required the most hospitalizations. Somebody bring me some ham: Ham, sausage, and chicken nuggets had the lowest instances of illness outbreaks . The group noted that the data is incomplete because so many foodborne illnesses are not reported or tracked. The CDC estimates that as many as 48 million Americans get sick from food poisoning each year. To reduce foodborne illnesses from meat, CSPI recommends what they call 'defensive eating' - assuming that meat can be unsafe. Safe handling includes not letting meat juices drip onto other food or counters, cleaning cutting boards and plates that have held raw meat, wearing gloves when preparing meat and washing hands often. Cooks should also make sure meat is heated to the proper temperature before eating it.","Ground beef and poultry found to be most common meats to transmit pathogens .

David Cameron last night allowed ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech as he struggled to contain a growing Tory mutiny on the issue of Europe. In an extraordinary development, Downing Street sources said Tory MPs would be given a free vote next week on a backbench amendment to the Speech that expresses ‘regret’ about the lack of legislation for a referendum on Europe. The move came as senior Tories ignored the Prime Minister’s pleas to pipe down on the issue in the wake of last week’s elections, when UKIP gave the Tories a bloody nose. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron today took aim at 'pessimists' about his Europe strategy . Speaking in London yesterday, Mr . Cameron hit out at the ‘pessimists’ in his own party who warn it will be . impossible for him to claw back powers from Brussels and negotiate a . better deal for Britain in Europe. He said Tory grandees such as former . chancellor Nigel Lawson and one-time leadership contender Michael . Portillo were ‘wrong’ to say Britain should leave the EU now. Former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont . also suggested Britain would be better off out, saying the economic . advantages of EU membership were ‘vastly over-stated’. Today London Mayor Boris Johnson said it would not be 'cataclysmic' if Britain left the EU. 'We should be prepared to pull out. That goes without saying. You can’t go into a negotiation like that without being willing to walk away,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'And I don’t think, by the way, that it would be anything like as cataclysmic as is sometimes pretended. I don’t think it would lose millions of jobs, far from it. I think the economic benefits and dis-benefits are now much more balanced.' But he backed Mr Cameron's renegotiation strategy: 'What we need to do is to say to our friends and partners: ""Listen chums this thing isn’t working for either of us. Your eurozone is causing all sorts of misery, plus the on-costs, the none wage costs, the way that the European Union has been running, has legislated, has regulated over the last 20, 30 years are making our continent, making the whole area completely uncompetitive"".' And a third former chancellor, Labour’s Denis Healey said he now believed the ‘case for leaving is stronger than staying in’. Tory rebels last night revealed they . had tabled an amendment to the Queen’s Speech criticising the lack of . legislation to hold an in/out referendum. Margaret Thatcher changed her view about Britain's EU membership after the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, her biographer claimed . Mr Cameron has told his MPs he is . unable to bring forward government legislation to enact his pledge to . hold a referendum in 2017 because of opposition from the LibDems. But Number 10 last night said he was . ‘relaxed’ about the amendment and suggested Tory MPs and ministers would . be free to vote for it. If Commons Speaker John Bercow agrees . to the vote it will be held next Tuesday. Mr Cameron will be on an . official visit to the US, but other Cabinet ministers are expected to . vote in what would be a criticism of their own Queen’s Speech and a . clear sign of dissatisfaction with the Coalition. The amendment is purely symbolic but . its supporters claim it will help build an unstoppable momentum for a . referendum to be held. Backers include Eurosceptics John Baron, Peter Bone and John Redwood, and maverick Nadine Dorries. The amendment does not demand . legislation on a referendum but ‘respectfully regrets’ that no bill was . included in Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech, which set out the Government’s . legislative agenda for the coming year. Mr Baron said its purpose was to send a clear message that the demand for a bill was ‘not going away’. It underlines the pressure Mr Cameron is facing to sanction backbench legislation on a referendum. The Prime Minister’s official . spokesman said he had ‘always said he is very happy to look at all ways . of strengthening his commitment to an in/out referendum in the next . Parliament’. David Cameron is under pressure to bring forward legislation on his promise to stage an EU referendum . Former defence secretary Michael Portillo said he would vote to quit Brussels while London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured yesterday, argued Britain could survive outside the EU . Yesterday Mr Cameron told a conference . he was right to try to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU . before putting the new deal to a referendum after the next election. He said: ‘I think it is possible to change and reform this organisation and change and reform Britain’s relationship with it.’ But speaking at the same conference . later in the day, Mr Johnson, the London Mayor, suggested Britain would . benefit from leaving the EU. He said that if Mr Cameron’s bid to renegotiate membership of the EU failed ‘then obviously we should be ready to walk away’. He said: ‘I think it would be a shot in the arm because people would suddenly feel, yes, we are running our own destiny again.’ Mr Johnson said he was ‘broadly in favour of the single market’ but said its benefits had been overstated. Lib Dem sources said it would be ‘extraordinary’ for Tory ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech. A source said: ‘The Conservatives seem . to want to talk about Europe when we should be talking about the . positive things in the Queen’s Speech like the reforms on pensions and . social care.’","Queen's Speech vote to be hijacked by Tories demanding referendum .

The Rapide S can reach a top speed of 190mph and accelerate from 0-60mph in 4.7 seconds, however the exact performance on hydrogen only, will be tested to the full in Germany. However, with the extra weight of the hydrogen canisters - two will be towards the rear of the car and two next to the driver, it is unlikely such performance levels will be reached using hydrogen only. It is also unknown whether the car will complete any more than the one lap and then revert to it's hydrogen/gasoline combination capabilities. But regardless of final position in the race, the company will pleased and proud of their efforts - providing they manage to complete a full lap. The car may well be a hybrid, but if the automobile experts can achieve a hybrid of performance match with positive PR, they could be onto a winner.","The Nürburgring, Germany, will be the setting for hopefully history being made .

Homeowners who live within a mile of proposed wind turbines could be offered a 20 per cent discount on their electricity bills in an attempt to reduce opposition to the green technology. Residents could also get university fee bursaries, village halls and even free home improvements as part of attempts to allow communities to ‘see the windfarms and the windfall’. They are part of a package of measures planned by Energy Secretary Ed Davey after he was impressed by a ‘local tariff’ scheme pioneered in Cornwall. Green energy bribe: Homeowners could be offered cut bills and university fee bursaries in return for having wind turbines nearby . Those living within 1.2 miles of the Delabole wind farm now qualify for a fifth off bills – saving the average customer about £100 a year. The Government hopes asking firms to provide community benefits will stifle planning objections for new developments, despite critics calling them ‘bribes for blight’. ‘Onshore wind has an important role to play in a diverse energy mix that is secure, low carbon and affordable,’ said Mr Davey. ‘We know that two-thirds of people support the growth of onshore wind. ‘But far too often, host communities have . seen the wind farms but not the windfall. We are sensitive to the . controversy around onshore wind and we want to ensure that people . benefit from having wind farms sited near to them. In the next few weeks . we will be publishing the results of our call for evidence, which has . looked at ways to reward host communities and ensure that wider . investment, employment and social benefits are felt locally.’ Scheme: Homeowners could also be bribed with smaller bills if they agree to have a new generation of nuclear power station in their area. Picture shows Sizewell B . Millions of households could miss out on energy savings of more than £100 after ministers delayed the roll-out of so-called smart meters by more than a year. The £11.7billion scheme to install the devices in 30million homes from next summer has been hit by technical issues. Families are paying higher power bills in order to finance the project, but now many  will have to wait longer to reap the benefits. The technology ends estimated bills by supplying precise gas and electricity readings over the mobile phone network. Families could also be helped to cut spending on power as they see meter readings in pounds and pence. Some estimates put average savings at £65 per year based on a 5 per cent reduction in energy usage, while others have calculated savings as high as £130 on a 10 per cent cut in domestic usage. Tom Lyon, of uSwitch.com, called it a ‘blow’ to consumers, but Energy and Climate Change Minister Baroness Verma said the industry had to ‘get it right’ before introducing the meters. Ministers also plan to adopt a similar approach to the development of new nuclear power stations and ‘fracking’ rigs that extract underground reserves of shale gas.Mr Davey is understood to be particularly attracted to the idea of discounted electricity bills as a way of neutralising the political backlash against developments after the expansion of onshore wind power has become a major source of tension in the coalition. The Government has set a target of increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind farms to 13 gigawatts by 2020, with about 3,800 turbines currently constructed. But although approvals for onshore windfarms have reached record levels and the 2020 target is on course, ministers have announced a 10 per cent cut to subsidies following a shift in policy. Meanwhile, wind farm developers are being urged by ministers to increase the amount of community benefits to win over locals because there have been so many complaints about the impact on the landscape. Along with lower energy bills, each household close to the Delabole wind farm also gets a ‘windfall’ credit of up to £50 every year that the turbines exceed their expected performance. Power company Good Energy now runs what was Britain’s first commercial wind farm when it opened in 1991. Company boss Juliet Davenport said: ‘Wind power has a huge role to play in meeting the UK’s future energy needs, and we think that it’s only right that our local communities should be recognised for their contribution to tackling climate change and reducing the UK’s reliance on expensive imported fossil fuels.’ At the recently-opened Kelburn wind farm, near Largs, Scotland, the community is paid £1,600 per installed megawatt – or £44,000 a year. Caroline Flint, shadow secretary for energy and climate change, said the community benefits scheme was a form of ‘bribery’ that would reinforce the dominance of big energy companies. Labour favours a German model that allows local communities to own renewable energy developments and keep all the benefits.","Free home improvements could be offered in return for wind farms .

Hundreds of ultra-wealthy Britons are being investigated for tax evasion following the exposure of their secret offshore accounts. International spy agencies are thought to have helped obtain a 'goldmine' of data that names high-profile multi-millionaires and their financial advisers. The files show how the rich have hidden billions in Singapore, the British Virgin Islands and the Caymans. Ultra-wealthy Britons are being investigated over claims they are hiding cash in secret offshore accounts in places like the Cayman Islands (pictured) More than 100 individuals have been identified so far – and have already been sent warning letters by HM Revenue & Customs. 'You're talking about super-rich people,' said one source, who added that many of the names on the list were well known. Offenders face paying the tax they have dodged along with massive fines. Officials are unsure what sums are at stake but pointed out that a crackdown on millionaires who hid money in Liechtenstein is expected to raise £3billion. Last night George Osborne said: 'The message is simple: if you evade tax we're coming after you. This data is another weapon in HMRC's arsenal.' The Chancellor has previously expressed shock at the extent to which the wealthy were exploiting tax loopholes. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said he was shocked by the extent to which the wealthy were exploiting tax loopholes . Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs have already sent warning letters to more than 100 individuals . It emerged last year that one scheme, . used by comedian Jimmy Carr and more than a thousand others, enabled . them to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax. The scheme was said to shelter . £168million a year from the taxman in Jersey. Carr said he had made a . terrible error of judgement and was no longer involved. 'The message is simple: if you evade tax we're coming after you. This data is another weapon in HMRC's arsenal.' George Osborne . HMRC and the Treasury refused to comment on the source of the secret files which arrived at tax authorities in the UK, US and Australia in two chunks. But Whitehall sources suggested intelligence agencies, including the CIA, may have been involved in the operation to obtain the information. It is understood the files were handed to tax authorities three years ago but were kept a closely guarded secret until the unstructured data was put in usable form. Phil Berwick, a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons, said those with doubts about the legitimacy of their overseas tax arrangements would be 'spooked' by news of the secret files. 'This is a clear warning shot against accountants and other advisers that HMRC is going to come after them if they are involved in establishing offshore structures,' he added. 'HMRC is keen to clamp down on accountants and other advisers who they feel have overstepped the mark.' The Government's tax crackdown has seen several British territories sign bank account disclosure agreements. It is also behind a globally coordinated drive against tax evasion.","Spy agencies find 'goldmine' of data naming high-profile figures .

In court: Tim Lambesis, lead singer of heavy metal band As I Lay Dying, appeared in court yesterday charged with hiring a hitman to kill his wife . A heavy metal singer has appeared in court charged with hiring a hitman to murder his estranged wife. Frontman of the Christian-inspired group As I Lay Dying, Tim Lambesis, 32, is accused of handing over an envelope containing $1,000 in cash to an undercover police officer to pay for his wife Meggan Lambesis to be killed. A court heard how he also handed the fake hitman a photograph of his wife with her address and the security gate code. Lambesis also allegedly gave a list of dates he would be with their children to give him an alibi. The singer yesterday pleaded not guilty to solicitation of murder at his first court appearance at San Diego North County court in Vista. A judge set bail at $3 million and said if he is released, he must wear a GPS monitoring device and face strict travel restrictions. Claudia Grasso, a San Diego County . deputy district attorney, told the court the singer had emailed . his wife while on tour in August that he didn't love her, he wanted to . end the relationship, and he no longer believed in God. Meggan Lambesis . later learned her husband was having an affair and had been involved . with 'a string of women'. The prosecutor said the undercover operation was staged after Lambesis told a man at his gym that he wanted his wife killed, . complaining that she was making it difficult for him to see their . children and impossible to complete their divorce. The court was told how Lambesis met with an undercover agent, who went by the alias 'Red', on May 7 and was recorded saying he wanted his wife killed. Sting operation: San Diego North County court in Vista heard how Lambesis handed over $1,000 in cash along with a photograph of his wife Meggan and her address to an undercover police officer . Defence case: Tim Lambesis pleaded not guilty to solicitation to murder his wife Meggan and his lawyer has told reporters he was set up . Lambesis was then arrested on Tuesday at a store in Oceanside, north of San Diego. If convicted, he faces up to nine years in prison. Grasso asked Superior Court Judge . Martin Staven to set bail at $20 million, saying Meggan Lambesis was . terrified and living 'in seclusion' with their three children - aged four, eight and 10 - who they adopted from Ethiopia. 'He is substantially motivated to kill his wife,' she said. Bail conditions prohibit Lambesis from . contacting his wife or children. He cannot leave the San Diego area . except to see his attorney in Los Angeles. Defense attorney Anthony Salerno told reporters that Lambesis did not intend to harm anybody and was apparently set up by the man at the gym. In action: As I Lay Dying frontman Tim Lambesis pictured performing at the second annual Revolver Golden Gods Awards in Los Angeles in 2010 . Rock star: As I Lay Dying has released six albums and was nominated for a Grammy in 2007 . 'Law enforcement was being fed something by someone that I strongly believe was a snitch, was out to save his own skin and was trumping things up, exaggerating things,' Salerno said. The lawyer declined to address specific allegations. In court, Lambesis yesterday stared straight . ahead from behind a glass partition in a courtroom packed with his . supporters. Salerno said they included his parents, Little League coach . and some band members. Big plans: Lambesis and his As I Lay Dying bandmates, including Josh Gilbert (left), have recently returned from a tour in Asia and were planning to embark on another tour in the US . Motive: The court heard singer Tim Lambesis, pictured performing live during a concert at the Huxleys in Berlin, Germany, last year, had affairs with a 'string of women' and was 'substantially motivated' to kill his wife . Salerno said he expected Lambesis to . make bail, but prospects for a 30-city U.S. tour that begins May 30 in . Oklahoma City appeared uncertain. The attorney said he would ask the . judge for permission to travel if the band wants to go ahead with the . concerts. As I Lay Dying formed in San Diego in . 2000 and has released six albums, including 2007's 'An Ocean Between . Us,' which reached No. 8 on Billboard's charts. A single from the album, 'Nothing Left,' was nominated for a Grammy for top metal performance.

But a horse is hardly the average household animal. Yet Mr P, a 28in-high American miniature, is right at home in owner Katy Smith’s one-bedroom flat. And there is nothing the three-year-old likes more than settling down to afternoon tea with playmates Lilly Potter, five, and her sister, Lacey, two, the daughters of Mrs Smith’s business partner Laura Potter. Cheeky: Miniature horse, 'Mr P' spends so much time with people that he thinks he is human . Loyal: Mr P follows owner Katy Smith, 52, everywhere.

Mrs Smith, 52, says her real-life My Little Pony spends so much time indoors he thinks he is a human. ‘He’s even taken on human characteristics.

Ever since I have given him tea and cake as a treat.’ Mrs Smith says house-trained Mr P has never made a mess of her flat in Middleton St George, near Darlington.

Although Mr P spends the day with Mrs Smith, he has his own stable on a farm with other horses and sleeps indoors with her only when it is cold outside. Mrs Smith and Mrs Potter run a business that provides ponies for community events. Mrs Smith, a mother of two grown-up children, also takes Mr P into care homes for the elderly as a form of therapy.

Nick Clegg was accused of ‘treachery’ by senior Conservatives last night after pulling the rug from under the Government’s flagship childcare reforms. The Deputy Prime Minister plunged Coalition relations to a new low after publicly attacking proposals to help cut costs for working families by relaxing rules on the number of toddlers that nurseries and childminders can supervise. The Conservatives said Mr Clegg had signed off the plans before they were announced earlier this year and pointed out the changes would be optional for pre-school providers, increasing choice for parents. Scroll down for video . Conservatives have said Nick Clegg (left) signed off the plans of Childcare Minister Liz Truss (right) before they were announced . The BBC was last night leaked an exchange of letters between Childcare Minister Liz Truss and Mr Clegg from last December. It makes clear that Miss Truss flagged up the change in ratios of carers to children as ‘the most high-profile of my proposals’. In his reply, Mr Clegg gives her clearance to press ahead. Angry Tory backbenchers urged David Cameron to ignore Mr Clegg’s last-minute objections and press ahead. In an article today for MailOnline, Sir Martin Narey, the former head of the children’s charity Barnardo’s, also dismissed the ‘noise’ from Mr Clegg and praised the ‘brave reform’. He said many nurseries would welcome new flexibilities, which were ‘widespread in France, Denmark and Sweden, all widely recognised as having excellent childcare systems and all of which have minimum ratios larger than ours’. Mr Clegg told his weekly phone-in show on the radio station LBC 97.3: 'I think four [children] is already quite a handful, just imagine if they go up to six' ‘We need better staff and we need to allow them more professional discretion in determining how many children for whom they can safely care,’ he added. Miss Truss, the architect of the reforms, was dragged to the Commons after Mr Clegg’s office confirmed he had had second thoughts about backing them. Miss Truss insisted the current system of childcare was ‘not working for parents’, who faced some of the highest costs in the world. Under the Government’s proposals, in September the minimum staff-child ratio for children aged one and under will ease from 1:3 to 1:4 and those for two-year-olds from 1:4 to 1:6, where staff are better qualified. In Ireland and Germany, the ratio for two-year-olds is one adult to six children, in France it is 1:8, while in Denmark and in Sweden there are no national staff ratios at all, Miss Truss said. ‘At present we have the tightest ratios in Europe for children under three and we also have the lowest staff salaries. Nursery staff here earn £6.60 on average, barely above the minimum wage. Our proposals will allow nurseries who hire high-quality staff to be able to exercise professional judgment.’ But Mr Clegg insisted he had reservations about changing the ratio. ‘When we as a government consulted on changing the number of little toddlers that each adult can look after, the response from experts, from parents from nurseries was overwhelmingly negative,’ he said. ‘They felt that the risks outweighed the benefits and it wouldn’t necessarily reduce costs.’ Mr Clegg told his weekly phone-in show on the radio station LBC 97.3: ‘I think four [children] is already quite a handful, just imagine if they go up to six. This is not a great ideological thing, this is just about getting it right for parents up and down the country.’ Sir Martin Narey, the former head of the children's charity Barnardo's, has dismissed the 'noise' from Mr Clegg and praised the 'brave reform' In the Commons, Tory MPs lined up to support Miss Truss, who is tipped as a potential party leader, and urged her to go ahead with the changes. Wellingborough MP Peter Bone described giving nurseries more choice over child-to-adult ratios as ‘a good Tory policy’. He added: ‘The Deputy Prime Minister, if he wants to comment on this, if he doesn’t want to run away from something he has agreed on, he should be in this House, not on a radio programme. I suggest we press on with this policy and ignore the Liberal Democrats.’ Senior Conservatives were scathing about the Lib Dems’ change of heart, with one accusing Mr Clegg of ‘appalling treachery’. Another accused him of ‘running scared after the usual whinges from the trade unions and lefties on Mumsnet’. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said David Cameron ‘very much shares’ Miss Truss’s views on the need for reform. But Professor Cathy Nutbrown, who was commissioned by former Lib Dem children’s minister Sarah Teather to review childcare qualifications last year, said: ‘There really is a need to slow down this policy to ensure that well-qualified people are available.’ Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: ‘David Cameron and Nick Clegg are creating chaos and confusion on childcare.’","Nick Clegg publicly attacks Government's flagship childcare reforms .

He said the refusal of the lobby group to entertain a compromise on the issue may also mean that a ‘recognition body’ for the Press is set up but ‘nobody comes along and asks for recognition’. British newspapers came up with their own Royal Charter proposal for an independent regulator after rejecting a plan drawn up by politicians and the Hacked Off lobby group. Mr Whittingdale said of the Press’s proposed charter that he would ‘nearly sign it tomorrow’ but that a way forward was proving difficult because of Labour and Hacked off. Speaking at a Broadcasting Press Guild event, he said: ‘We are either very close to a happy outcome or a total shambles. ‘The Labour Party are still very much tied to Hacked off. If the Labour Party refuse to even talk about any amendment to the Government’s version then it looks as if it’s going to be impossible to reach an agreement.’ The Conservative MP added: ‘Hacked Off have very clearly rejected the industry’s version [of  a watchdog] and said Parliament has spoken and you have got to stick to Parliament. Executive director of Hacked Off Professor Brian Cathcart with Jacqui Hames and Charlotte Church . ‘But if the consequence of that is at best we do get a recognition body but nobody comes along and asks for recognition, or at worst we don’t get a Royal Charter at all – that is a disaster.’ He said Hacked Off had run a ‘clever campaign’ but ‘it is not helping the debate now if it is Hacked Off that is basically preventing discussion from reopening’. A spokesman for Hacked Off said: ‘The Royal Charter approved by Parliament has the support of all parties, victims of Press abuse and the vast majority of the public. ‘Sadly some in the Press have learned nothing from recent years and are still resisting change, and the draft charter now proposed by some newspaper groups reflects this.’ But as Lord Wakeham, a former president of the Privy Council, wrote earlier this week: ‘The charter put forward on March 18 was never voted on in Parliament, which merely  had before it a motion that day to “consider… the Prime Minister’s intention to submit the charter to the Privy Council”.’","MP critcises campaign's refusal to negotiate over new watchdog .

Complaints: More than 107 outraged viewers have complained after Have I got News For You made joking remarks about Margaret Thatcher's death . The BBC has received more than a hundred complaints after satirical quiz show Have I Got News For You joked about the death of Baroness Thatcher. The show - broadcast on Friday - included a number of remarks and quips about the former prime minister with a lengthy section discussing her death. Yesterday the BBC, through its complaints website, defended the programme saying it would have been impossible to ignore the story and claimed the panellists did not directly make fun of Baroness Thatcher. In a posting on the BBC’s complaints website, the corporation said it had heard from viewers who were ‘disappointed’ by the comments made about her. The BBC1 show has drawn 107 complaints so far. During the show guest Ken Livingstone joked about how during her time in office she had axed the Greater London Council, of which he had been the leader. He said: ‘I haven’t had my invite to the funeral yet so I haven’t been able to decline it. ‘It would be a tad hypocritical given she abolished me, to turn up to her funeral.’ A number of other gags were aimed at her cabinet and her son Mark. Responding to the complaints, the BBC said: ‘Given the enormous amount of TV and newspaper comment on the life and achievements of Lady Thatcher, it was impossible to ignore the story. Smirking: Ken Livingstone and host Ian Hislop took part in Friday's controversial episode of Have I got News for You . Sick joke: The show was peppered with references to Baroness Thatcher's family and former cabinet . Part of the pack: Bridget Christie and Paul Merton also took part in the show which provoked anger among viewers . ‘The very fact that the programme covered the death of Lady Thatcher was always going to infuriate some viewers, however they should know what to expect from the show after 23 years. ‘If you look closely at the content of the show you will see that at no point did we make fun of Lady Thatcher herself or put forward a critique of her record - everything was based around the reaction to her death by other politicians and public figures, and the row over the cost of the funeral.' However this is not the first time the BBC satirical show has landed in hot water.","The BBC1 show has drawn 107 complaints since it was broadcast Friday .

Concerns: Child welfare campaigners yesterday questioned whether Jordan Nash could give 'informed consent' to the attention that comes with appearing on Britain's Got Talent . Britain's Got Talent has come under fire for allowing a five-year-old dancer on to the show and putting him through to the  next round. Child welfare campaigners yesterday questioned whether Jordan Nash could give 'informed consent' to the attention that comes with appearing on the programme. While the youngster, from London, received positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he is too young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages of the competition. The five-year-old, dressed in a black baseball cap and a t-shirt with his name on it, performed an impressive dance routine and was given a 'yes' by all four judges. But viewers branded the decision 'inappropriate' and called on ITV to bring in new rules to 'stop this happening'. Fears for Jordan renewed the controversy surrounding child performers on the programme, which drew hundreds of complaints in 2009 when two child singers, Hollie Steel and Natalie Okri, cried due to the pressure of performing live. Last year Britain's Got Talent was again forced to defend its lack of an age limit when nine-year-old Malaki Paul broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of nerves. In Saturday's show Simon Cowell joked about Jordan's youth, asking: 'How old are you – 20? 21?'After the youngster revealed his age Alesha Dixon added: 'Your mum and dad must be so proud of you.' The boy is one of the youngest solo performers to have appeared on the show. Unlike The X Factor and The Voice, which insist contestants are 16 and over, Britain's Got Talent is open to performers of any age. One viewer wrote on Twitter: 'A five-year-old on Britain's got Talent. Inappropriate! There should be some rules to stop this happening.' Joker: On Saturday's show, Simon Cowell joked about five-year-old Jordan Nash's age . Another, writing on Facebook, added: 'It's a shame for them, they will always be let down and have no chance of winning. He is only 5!' One simply added: 'He was good but he's going to get his heart broken.' There was also criticism of parents who allow their young children to go on to the programme. Claude Knights, director of anti-bullying and child protection charity Kidscape, said: 'We have in the past been concerned by a trend in some of  these reality shows to have much younger children … the main concern being that a young child can't give informed consent to the consequences of the attention and exposure, to that degree. 'The programme makers of course say there are lots of safeguards in place … but when it does go wrong, who knows how and when the child could break down and not cope.' A spokesman for Britain's Got Talent said  welfare of contestants was the show's 'number one priority'. Alfie, Jordan's father, said: 'It would be a shame to deny any individual the opportunity to display their talent publicly whatever their age.'

BBC plans to force freelance presenters back on to the employment books to end suspicions of tax avoidance have descended into chaos, it emerged last night, . Stars are being made to sign short-term contracts because the BBC has been unable to thrash out an acceptable way of paying them on a full time basis. The corporation decided to act following concerns from MPs about the corporation’s use of so-called personal service companies as a way of channelling stars’ earnings. Stars are being made to sign short-term contracts because the BBC has been unable to thrash out an acceptable way of paying them on a full time basis . In November, the BBC said it had identified 131 employees - either paid through service companies or on freelance deals - who would be asked to become staff members. But the corporation is struggling to come up with a way of enforcing its new rules. It is understood that the diverse and complicated ways many performers earn their money has made it incredibly difficult to come up with a single system that is fair. As a result, the corporation has ‘extended’ and ‘continued’ contracts, or in some cases issued new deals with clauses which admit it may have to be ‘torn up’ . But even once the BBC has come up with a plan it then faces a battle with high profile stars who are likely to resist attempts to make them members of staff. Last year after weeks of controversy the BBC admitted that the personal service company deals gave individuals a ‘greater opportunity’ to reduce their tax liability. Stars such as Jeremy Paxman, left, and Fiona Bruce, right, could be asked to become BBC employees . Speaking of the current problems in deciding who should go back on the BBC payroll, one influential agent described it as a ‘complete debacle’. They claimed the BBC was still trying to ‘thrash out’ by what criteria people should be put back on staff. Presenter John Humphrys has signed a nine month extension to his contract . In November the BBC said a new ‘employment test’, which determines whether a staff contract was appropriate, would be in place by April 2013. Stars such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman, who said they were told to set up personal service companies by the BBC to get their salaries, could be among those asked to become employees. Today programme presenter John Humphrys, who is not paid through a service company but is a freelancer, has signed a nine-month extension to his contract. The short-length of the extension to his contract is thought to be linked to the deadlock over how the BBC pays its presenters. In future, BBC contracts will also contain clauses requiring employees to demonstrate that they are paying the appropriate level of tax. Last year’s review found that at least 124 top names earn £150,000 or more via the companies. A further 54 freelance stars got a similar amount. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Following a review last year, the BBC is changing the way it contracts with a small number of presenting and on air talent. While these changes are being finalised we need to extend some contracts that are due to be renewed for a short period of time.’","Jeremy Paxman and Fiona Bruce could become employees .

David Cameron issued a stinging rebuke to Tory MP Zac Goldsmith when he forced a Government U-turn on new planning laws. The Prime Minister vented his fury after being given no choice but to climb down over proposals aiming to make it easier to build home extensions without planning permission. ‘Who does that man think he’s accountable to?’ Mr Cameron raged when Mr Goldsmith went back on a pledge to Ministers and led a Tory revolt in the Commons. Anti plan: Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP, voted against the law which would have doubled the length of extensions that people can build in their gardens without planning permission . It is the latest in a series of increasingly acrimonious rows between the two Old Etonians who were once close allies and friends. Last year, Mr Goldsmith accused Mr Cameron of capitulating to big business over genetically modified crops. Speaking after the Prime Minister urged the EU to allow more GM crops in Britain, Mr Goldsmith said: ‘The PM could have studied GM and changed his view, but it looks more like political deception.’ Last summer, The Mail on Sunday revealed how Mr Goldsmith, a  multi-millionaire, offered to give up his Commons seat of Richmond Park & North Kingston, Surrey, to allow Boris Johnson to make a Parliamentary comeback. Mr Goldsmith had also said Tory plans to do a U-turn on building a third runway at Heathrow would be an ‘unbearable betrayal’ for his  constituents under the flight path. Angry: David Cameron has hit out at Tory MP Zac Goldsmith . The latest row blew up after Mr Goldsmith led the fight against Coalition plans to let homeowners build 26ft extensions in their gardens without needing planning permission. Ministers yesterday bowed to the protests and unveiled a revised scheme whereby property owners will still have to notify their local council about extensions that size. Tory sources claim before the key Commons vote earlier last week, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles had told Mr Goldsmith that he would compromise on the plans and received a promise from the MP that he would therefore not vote against the Government. One source said: ‘Despite that, Zac went ahead and voted against us. It’s outrageous.’ It is a far cry from before the Election when Mr Goldsmith, 38, won a place on the Tories’ coveted ‘A-list’ of elite parliamentary candidates. A former editor of the Ecologist magazine, he also served as Mr Cameron’s green adviser. Mr Goldsmith is said to have inherited up to £300 million from his late father Sir James Goldsmith. The Tory source added: ‘Before the Election, Cameron put him on the A-list and fast-tracked him into the Commons. 'This is how he repays him but then, I suppose if you’re worth as much as he is, he feels he can do what he wants.’ The MP was unavailable for comment but a friend said: ‘Zac is accountable to his constituents. 'They matter to him more than anything else. 'He never promised not to vote against the Government.'","Tory MP Zac Goldsmith warned reforms will guarantee neighbour disputes .

So the show’s fans were a little miffed when the best this country had to offer turned out to be, well … the best another country had to offer. Some viewers complained that the ITV programme was not living up to its name after its latest stand-out act turned out to be a professional dance duo from Holland. Dutch pair Martin van Bentem, 32, and Marielle Constancia, 36, impressed judges with a gravity-defying acrobatic routine on Saturday night. Some viewers complained that the ITV programme was not living up to its name after its latest stand-out act turned out to be a professional dance duo from Holland . Mr van Bentem, who regularly appears in musicals, spun his partner around  effortlessly and at the end they received a standing ovation.  All four judges voted them through to the next round. Amanda Holden described the pair as ‘sexy and exciting’, adding: ‘You threw her around like my daughter throws her Barbies around the bedroom.’ Fellow judge Alesha Dixon added: ‘It was dangerous, it was thrilling, it was exciting, and from beginning to end it was so entertaining and you are just mesmerising to watch. I’m so glad you entered the competition.’ But many viewers complained that allowing foreign acts to compete with home-grown talent defeated the object of the show. Jordan Garraway tweeted: ‘I’m sorry, they’re good acts and that, but why do they let foreign acts on Britain’s Got Talent?’ Sophie added: ‘Quite often it’s the foreign acts that are the best but it is BRITAIN’S Got Talent! Polly Freestone said: ‘All of the best acts on Britain’s got talent are foreign, so basically Britain doesn’t  have talent.’ After their performance, Simon Cowell asked the pair why they had decided to enter the British show. Holland has its own version of the successful global franchise. Mr van Bentem replied: ‘Britain’s Got Talent is the biggest talent show in the world.

Last year German Dennis Egel reached the semi-finals with a routine that involved singing Nessun Dorma in giant gold wings. A Britain’s Got Talent spokesman said: ‘We want to showcase the best variety talent that will entertain our audiences and it’s a testament to the success of the series that, following the global success of the likes of Susan Boyle, people from all over Europe want to appear on our show.’ Anyone with the right to live and work in the UK is allowed to enter the contest, meaning it is open to all EU citizens. And Cowell has previously said he hopes foreign talent will help spur on British competitors. He added: ‘I think it’s quite flattering that they fly all that way to enter this show because they see it as the flagship show, but it means our Brits have got to step it up now.’","Dutch pair Martin van Bentem, 32, Marielle Constancia, 36, on show .

When the BBC refurbished its London HQ at a cost of £1billion, its staff looked forward to settling into their new office space. But a draconian directive from bosses has made sure they don't make themselves too comfortable. They have been urged not to bring in plants, kettles, microwaves, fridges or coat-stands. 'Territorial': BBC bosses have banned pot plants from the office (file photo) The memo said foliage could be used as a form of 'desk-grab' to mark out . territory and 'form un-collaborative barriers' with colleagues. It said:  'Plants give a strong sense of . ownership of a particular desk or area when we would like staff to feel . much more mobile and flexible across the open plan floor plates. 'They have been used to form un-collaborative barriers between teams and individuals.' The email also warned: 'Some people are allergic to certain plants and they also attract insects which we don't want sharing our workplace.' Order: Staff at New Broadcasting House were sent the memo from bosses . Coat-stands have been banned 'to keep the line of vision clear' while waste paper baskets have been jettisoned in favour of 'recycling hubs'. Many electrical appliances – such as fans, kettles and microwaves – have also been barred in case they set off fire alarms. Yesterday one angry BBC worker said: 'It is totally . unnecessary.

She said: 'Research for the past 30 years has shown that plants are really beneficial to the occupants of offices and workspaces. 'A recent study showed that lean or bare office spaces are not conducive to getting the best from employees.

Veteran arts broadcaster Melvyn Bragg has revealed that he plans to kill himself if he ever discovers he has dementia. The 73-year-old presenter of BBC Radio 4’s In Our Time said he would go ahead with his plans whether or not the law banning assisted suicide in this country has been changed. He will ask a close friend to alert him to any signs of dementia when he reaches 80. If he displays any symptoms, he will tell his three children of his plans, spend three months arranging his affairs, then seek help to end his life. Bragg watched his mother struggle with dementia until her death last year . Speaking to the Sunday Times, Lord Bragg said: ‘Legal or illegal, I will do it.’ The TV and radio star - who presented the South Bank Show on ITV until 2010 - watched his mother struggle with dementia until her death last year in a nursing home aged 95. He defended the right to die, saying: ‘We can’t keep sending people to Switzerland or the Netherlands. I think we should say, given certain conditions, it’s fine. ‘It’s happening to my generation - they see what happens when people get close to death, and we’re saying, “We don’t want that”.’ Speaking about his mother Mary, Lord Bragg said: ‘She was attentive, but she didn’t kiss you and never said, “I love you”. I miss her terribly. I used to phone her every day. I will always be close to her’ Lord Bragg’s first wife, Lisa Roche, killed herself in 1971. Bragg said that he would ask a close friend to alert him to any signs of dementia after the age of 80, and will then start the process of ending his life . He later said: ‘I could have done things which helped and I did things which harmed. So yes, I feel guilt, I feel remorse.’ Assisted suicide is outlawed in all European countries apart from Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Under the 1961 Suicide Act in the UK, anyone guilty of aiding or abetting a suicide can be imprisoned for up to 14 years. Several terminally ill and desperately disabled Britons have journeyed to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to gain help in ending their lives, and there is growing pressure for similar actions to be allowed in the UK. As well as presenting, Lord Bragg has found fame as a novelist. The presenter has also criticised Richard Dawkins (pictured) for the way in which he has attacked religion . His latest, Gracy and Mary, is based on his mother and grandmother. Another, Remember Me..., was inspired by Miss Roche’s suicide. Lord Bragg said her death left him unable to write fiction for a while. He said: ‘I scribbled lots of ideas, but they never turned into anything. I must have been depressed. ‘I think the business of Remember Me..., all the business about these things being therapeutic, wasn’t the case for me. ‘It was the opposite, it just stirred everything up again. I think sometimes the best thing is to cover it up, forget about it. It’s risky letting everything erupt.’ Lord Bragg - who was made a Labour peer in 1998 - had one daughter with Miss Roche. He has a son and a daughter with his second wife, Catherine Haste. The presenter also criticised atheistic scientist Richard Dawkins for the way in which he has attacked religion. He said: ‘The intellectual slackness and terrorism of these atheists, people who I otherwise respected - Richard Dawkins as an explainer of zoology is peerless, and AC Grayling is a great explainer of philosophy. ‘But when they start discussing religion, it’s disgraceful. Religion is basically a great body of knowledge, and we don’t have many bodies of knowledge. ‘It has sustained people for 1,500 or 2,000 years. You’ve got to be interested in it. Their arguments become really offensive when Dawkins says teaching children religion in schools is child abuse. It took your breath away.’","Bragg will ask a friend to alert him to signs of dementia when he reaches 80 .

A huge turnout of voters was reported all over Libya yesterday in the country’s first free national elections for more than 40 years. Jubilant crowds in the capital Tripoli formed long queues at  polling stations, with many voters dressed in the green, black and red of post-Gaddafi Libya. Some carried flags and balloons, while others were in tears as they spoke of the bloody price the country had paid to achieve liberation. ‘This is the best moment of my life,’ said student Esra El-Ani, 18. ‘But my brothers died to get us  to this day. Now it is our duty to start building Libya into the greatest country in the world.’ Change: Women queue to cast their vote in Tripoli yesterday . Old men in their Sunday best talked of the historic meaning of a day when they could choose their next government. One candidate standing as an independent, Dr Mustufa Abourkhis, said: ‘This is unbelievable, just to stand here and be able to cast a vote for the people we want to run our country. I don’t even care if I win a place or not.’ An impressive 80 per cent of those eligible to vote had registered – 2.8 million out of Libya’s 6.5 million population. But the orderliness of Tripoli’s 30 polling stations and an eerie calm in the city as it sweltered in 38C heat, gave the lie to chaos elsewhere in the country. Fears of threats from illegal militias and calls for an election boycott marred the process by which a 200-seat General National Congress will elect a prime minister and cabinet and form a body to draft a new constitution. In the restive east of Libya,  a growing number of armed  militias have set up fortified compounds where they operate outside of the law, several of them declaring themselves martyrs and followers of religious fundamentalists. Hope: A young Benghazi boy wears the red, black and green of post-Gaddafi Libya . In the event of election results displeasing them, they are capable of destabilising the region. Yesterday, gunshots were reported in city streets. Fundamentalists have been blamed for several recent attacks on foreign targets. British Ambassador Dominic Asquith’s convoy of vehicles was ambushed by a rocket attack near the Embassy’s office in Benghazi four weeks ago and the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross were another target. Deeply held suspicions that the east will continue to be marginalised in government fund allocation has led to the formation of the Cyrenaica Council by tribal leaders and former rebel commanders who demand semi-autonomy. They blockaded the main coastal highway last week in protest at the elections, while other factions took over oil installations in Ras Lanuf and Brega, and saboteurs burned down election offices in Ajdabiya. Turning point: An impressive 80 per cent of those eligible to vote had registered - 2.8¿million out of Libya¿s 6.5¿million population . In the south, election observers  were unable to reach the tribal areas around Kufra due to infighting between the Tebu and Tuareg people, while militia clashes in the Nafusa Mountains killed dozens. Fears are also being expressed for the resolution of the east-west divide dating back to Gaddafi’s rule, and the power struggle between secularists and Islamists. Four main parties have emerged as frontrunners, with the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood expected to make huge gains as they have recently done in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt. The Nation Party, Al-Wattan, is backed by Islamist cleric Ali Salabi with controversial former Gaddafi prisoner and Jihadist Abdul Hakim Belhadj as its best-known candidate. The National Forces Alliance,  a coalition of 58 political parties headed by Mahmoud Jibril, prime minister in the aftermath of Libya’s revolution last year, is seen as being the most liberal of the frontrunners. The National Front Party is putting up 45 candidates, and is popular for its consistent campaign against Gaddafi. But political observer George Grant, writing in the Tripoli Herald, warned: ‘The only certainty about this election is that nothing at all is certain. Libya is taking a plunge into the unknown.’","Crowds form long queues at polling stations in Tripoli .

Mr Hamilton, a Christian and regular churchgoer, also has the image of an angel etched into his right forearm and a picture of Mary and Jesus on his upper arm. Above the cross on his back are the words ‘Still I Rise’. The phrase is the title of a celebrated poem by African-American poet Maya Angelou. However, Mr Hamilton may be more familiar with a rap song of the same name by his favourite musician Tupac Shakur. The racing driver has a cross on his back, echoing the one he wears round his neck, and the words 'Still I Rise' on his back . Lewis Hamilton has three tattoos on his arm. One of Mary and Jesus on his shoulder, one of a heart and cross on his elbow and another of an angel on his forearm . Tupac’s song Keep Ya Head Up was inspired by Angelou’s poem. A posthumous album of his rap songs was called Still I Rise when it was released in 1999, three years after his death. The song’s message of individual resilience over difficult circumstances no doubt appealed to Mr Hamilton, who has struggled with his form since becoming the youngest ever Formula One world champion in 2008. Following a series of crashes in 2011, Mr Hamilton quoted the phrase in a press conference. He said: ‘Obviously I’d like to be winning and doing a better job. Am I in the best place in my life?

It was a call for road safety - but pleas for a speed-limit may have damaged one of Germany's political parties in their fight to challenge chancellor Angela Merkel. The opposition centre-left Social Democratic Party have hit a bump in their campaign trail after its national chairman Sigmar Gabriel called for a national speed limit. But his suggestion - based on his belief that a 75mph limit would reduce accidents and fatalities - has caused outrage. Germany treasures its unrestricted autobahns that cover the country. Now the SPD's candidate for German Chancellor, Peer Steinbrueck, is trying to quash the debate, as it could be a potential turnoff for voters. Mr Gabriel was quoted last Wednesday as saying that a 75 mph (120 kph) autobahn limit would make sense because statistics suggest it would reduce serious accidents. Mr Steinbrueck, whose party trails in the polls, told WDR television there already are limits on most of autobahns. He said 'it's not the time to reignite this debate,' - perhaps in response to many voters enjoying the unrestricted limit, the Financial Times reported. Mr Gabriel's only support for the suggestion came from the Green party, which backs a national limit, and the Traffic Club of Germany (VCD), which claims that 70 per cent of fatal road accidents occur on unrestricted sections of the autobahns. On the road: Some autobahns are unrestricted - and treasured by German motorists . Most European countries would welcome a speed limit. The German's gaffe came after one of Britain's police and crime commissioner apologised after saying speed limits on motorways and main roads should be scrapped and skilled drivers allowed to drive as fast they like. Stephen Bett who is independent PCC for Norfolk, was criticised in April after saying: ‘We ought to drive to road conditions rather than set limits. 'The problem is there’s so many signs. 'You are driving along and you get mesmerised by them and you get situations where you get a 50 [limit], to 40, to 30 and it goes to 20 and back up again. 'If we're going to do something about speed and villages, we ought to just take all the signs down and say all villages are 30mph, or whatever it’s going to be, and you drive on roads – like they do in Germany and Italy – as road conditions say.'","Sigmar Gabriel says speed limit will reduce accidents .

He apparently hanged himself, but his family claims he was murdered . A U.S. software engineer found hanging in his Singapore apartment was unhappy at work and had written suicide notes before he died last year in what his parents are still insisting was a murder. An inquiry opened today into the death of software engineer Shane Truman Todd, 31, who was found dead at his apartment last June. Police found no signs of forced entry into the apartment and he had no visible signs of injury on his body except redness on his forearms and legs. But police did find links to suicide websites on his laptop and suicide letters written to Todd's family members and loved ones. Parents Rick and Mary Todd, who attended the inquest, told The Associated Press in March they consider the evidence to be fake. They believe he may have been murdered over his research in the U.S. into material used to make heat-resistant semiconductors, a technology with both civilian and military applications. Rick Todd said his son in early 2012 had expressed concerns to his parents that he was being asked to compromise U.S. security. But he said Shane Todd wasn't specific. His parents traveled from their home in the U.S. state of Montana to Singapore days after his death last June and found his belongings packed as if he intended to leave for good and saw no signs of a hanging, such as marks on the door. Mary Todd also said the alleged suicide note was obviously fake because it thanked the Institute of Microelectronics, the former employer he had grown to hate, and had other false details. Todd's parents had sought for the FBI to lead the investigation into the scientist's death, though the status of any assistance it has provided is classified. Scroll down for video . Hearing: Rick and Mary Todd arrive for the coroner's inquiry on the death of their son Shane Todd, a U.S. engineer, at the subordinate court in Singapore today . Shane Todd's patents Mary, right, and Rick Todd, left, believe that their 31-year-old son was murdered over research he did, possibly involving technology transfers with China, while working for the Institute of Microelectronics (IME) in Singapore . Witness: Shane Todd's former girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento, pictured centre, gave evidence at the public inquiry into his death today . The first witness at the coroner's inquest was Todd's girlfriend, a Filipino nurse working in Singapore who discovered his body. Shirly Sarmiento testified Mr Todd had often confided in her about his suspected depression and that he had mounting unhappiness with the 'dishonest environment' in his workplace. She also mentioned he feared 'heavy hands coming after him'. Todd's parents were somber throughout the proceedings, occasionally getting up to speak with their lawyers. At least 36 witnesses will be called to testify during the coroner's inquest, including personal friends, IME colleagues and forensic doctors. Questions: Todd's parents, Rick (left) and Mary (right) are calling for a congressional investigation into their son's death . Family matters: Mary and Rick Todd, center, went to Singapore with sons John, back left, and Dylan, far right, to look into the death of Shane, back right; Chet Todd and his wife . Tragedy: Todd was found hanging from his bathroom wall just two days after his final day of work in June 2012 . The inquest is expected to last 12 days, and its conclusions cannot be appealed. While his parents were in Singapore, they found a hard drive missed by investigators that contained thousands of documents Todd had backed up from his work computer. After having it analyzed by a computer forensics expert, they found a draft of a project outline between IME and the Chinese telecom giant Huawei on the development of an amplifier device that utilized gallium nitride. The heat-resistant material has civilian uses in products like LED screens and cellphone towers and military applications in things like radar and satellite systems. Mr Todd had been trained in the U.S. on proprietary equipment that produces the material but is restricted for export because of the potential military applications. Huawei has said it had no cooperation with IME related to gallium nitride. Chemicals: Dr Todd was working with Gallium Nitrate (GaN), a synthetic material used in many high-tech objects like Blu-ray players and hybrid electric cars . Trimming the tree: The Todd brothers at Christmas, decorating the family tree from their parents' home in Montana .

The company reportedly offered him that astounding sum just so we wouldn't take a job at Silicon Valley rival Twitter. The deal, reportedly paid in stock options that would fully vest in three years, made the Google vice president higher paid than most American sports star. It's also a figure that exceeds the compensation of most tech CEOs and founders. It shows that Google is willing to go the distance when it comes to retaining top talent - even mid-level executives, Business Insider has revealed. By comparison, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt received $101million in 2011 alone. Mr Mohan, 39, is the man in charge of display ads for Google. He launched and developed the company's approach and execution for that side of Google's business. It will bring in an estimated $7billion for Google this year, according to Business Insider. 'He is the quiet assassin. He's not a big show-boater,' one client told the news site. Now, he lives in the upscale San Fransico suburb of Atherton, California. He . and his wife Heema Sareem Mohan own a $5.2million home. He also rents a . modest apartment near the Google complex in Mountain View. Mr Mahon is seen with his young son in Shanghai.

His wife, a New York native, is a district director and spokesperson for Democratic State Senator Joe Simitian. In 2012, he donated $750 to President Barack Obama's reelection campaign. The news-making pay raise came when . Twitter began looking in April 2011 for a Chief Production Officer to . revamp the site's ad sales strategy. TechCrunch . reported that Google responded by preempting Twitter by offering Mohan . $100million and Sundar Pichai, another key product employee, $50million . to keep them from leaving.

Home sweet home: Mr Mohan owns a $5.2million house in the upscale San Francisco suburb of Atherton, California. He also rents a modest apartment outside the Google complex . Neal Mohan's reported $100million offer, spread over three years, makes him one of the highest paid employees at Google. Only billionaire CEO Eric Schmidt makes more money than Mohan is slated to receive under the deal. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both worth more than $20billion, now receive just $1 a year from the company. Here is a list of top executives and their 2011 pay: . Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of the board and former CEO - $100.1million . Larry Page, CEO - $1 . Patrick Pichette, senior vice president and Chief Financial Officer - $18.3million . Nikesh Arora, senior vice president and Chief Business Officer - $23.1million . David Drummond, senior vice president for corporate development, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary - $18.3million . Sergey Brin, co-founder - $1 . Friends and colleagues say Mr Mohan is the best in the business. He began his career as a glorified technical support worker at a tech company making $60,000 a year. DoubleClick was a tech pioneer that aimed to sell targeted advertising space to businesses across the world. However, it ran into financial trouble after the dotcom bubble burst. A private equity firm bought the company for $1.1billion and the CEO hired Mr Mohan to help rehabilitation. About 18 months later, after Mr Mohan implemented an aggressive plan to streamline and focus the business, Google bought it for $3.1billion. Since then, he has overseen Google's acquisition of start-up companies to help bolster Google's ad market. According to Business Insider, Mr Mohan has free rein to develop the display ad business as he needs. And the company income is growing rapidly as a result.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:27 EST, 13 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:27 EST, 13 May 2013 . The family of former New York  Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard has filed a lawsuit against the National Hockey League, charging that it is responsible for his 2011 death. Boogaard, who played six seasons in the league, was found dead on May 13, 2011 after accidentally overdosing on prescription painkillers and alcohol. He was 28 years old. After his death, he was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head. Fighter: Derek Boogaard, puts up his fists as he takes on the New York Islanders' Trevor Gillies in this 2010 photo . The NHL forward, who also played for the Minnesota Wild, was placed on a path to destruction by the league, his surviving family members claim in the lawsuit. The Boogaards' lawyer, William Gibbs, told The New York Times: 'To distill this to one sentence, you take a young man, you subject him to trauma, you give him pills for that trauma, he becomes addicted to those pills, you promise to treat him for that addiction, and you fail.' NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told The Associated Press in an email Sunday night that league has not received the lawsuit and generally does not comment on pending litigation. The Times reports the suit was filed . late Friday by the Chicago law firm of Corboy & Demetrio, in the . Circuit Court of Cook County. Trauma: It is believed that Boogaard acquired CTE after numerous blows to the head he suffered while on the ice . Injured: Boogaard, seen here with the Minnesota Wild, sustained a concussion during his final NHL game on December 9, 2010 - five months before his death . Boogaard was under contract with the New York Rangers at the time of his death. He played his first five NHL seasons . with the Minnesota Wild and one season with the Rangers after signing a . four-year, $6.5million contract with New York in July 2010. Derek Boogaard was found to have suffered from the brain condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy after his death. Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or even decades later. It can eventually cause dementia. In recent years a number of sportsmen's suicides have been linked to the condition, including hockey player Wade Belak, and football stars Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling. It can only be diagnosed after death when the brain can be properly examined. Boogaard's brain was one of 50 donated to Boston University’s Center for the Study of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Boogaard sustained a concussion during his last game on December 9, 2010. Known as one of the league's toughest fighters, the 6-foot-7, 255-pound Boogaard played 277 NHL games, scored three goals and racked up 589 penalty minutes. Boogaard's family filed a lawsuit against the NHL Players Association last September, seeking $9.8million, but it was dismissed this spring. The family said the union, after expressing interest in helping pursue a case against the league, missed a deadline for filing a grievance. A judge ruled the family waited too long to act and dismissed the case. The Times reports the family used a different lawyer in that case. The Times reports the latest lawsuit details the treatment Boogaard received from team doctors of the Rangers and Minnesota Wild, and the officials from the league's Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program, which oversaw Boogaard's care after he entered rehabilitation while playing for the Wild in 2009. CTE has also been linked to the death of former Nashville Predator Wade Belak, who committed suicide in a Toronto hotel room in 2011, four months after Boogaard. That same year, Winnipeg Jets rising star Rick Rypien was killed himself after a battle with depression.","Derek Boogaard was found dead on May 13, 2011 after accidentally ingesting a lethal combination of alcohol and prescription painkillers .

The father of a 12-year-old boy accused of fatally stabbing his eight-year-old sister said on Monday he believes his son is innocent until he sees evidence that proves otherwise. Barney Fowler said the family is backing the boy, who was arrested on Saturday after a crime that terrified the Central California foothill community. Mr Fowler said: 'Until they have the proper evidence to show it's my son, we're standing behind him. 'If they have the evidence, well that's another story. We're an honest family.' The boy told investigators on April 27 that he encountered a random attacker in the family home while his father was attending a Little League game. He described the man as tall with long gray hair. The boy said the man fled on foot and he found his sister, Leila Fowler, bleeding. Leila's death set off an intense manhunt in the rural community where some residents had moved to escape big city crime. The Calaveras County Sheriff's Office spent more than 2,000 man-hours amassing evidence and searching door-to-door. Residents of the rural community began locking their doors and calling authorities when they thought they saw men who fit the description. They also held fundraisers for the Fowler family and turned out by the thousands for a candlelight vigil in Leila's honor. 'We're thankful to the community and all they've done for my daughter,' Barney Fowler said. He echoed comments made earlier on Monday by his son, Justin Fowler, 19, who said the family was in shock and extremely sad about the boy's arrest. Scroll down for video .

'I've never seen him be mean to her,' the mother said. Less . than a day later, police delivered the stunning news: The 12-year-old . boy had been arrested and will be charged with homicide. For a community still reeling from the killing, the news was another blow. 'It's bad enough to lose a child. I can't imagine losing a child by one of my own children,' Patti Campbell, a longtime area resident told The Associated Press. Ms Campbell, a resident of the area for 33 years, said she had served Leila and her family in her restaurant. ‘It's just shocking. I don't know what else to say,’ Campbell said. Other residents in the community of about 7,400 people expressed similar feelings of disbelief. ‘I . did not want to believe it.

Lawyers for Colorado theater shooting suspect James Holmes have changed his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity, and a judge won't decide on whether to allow it until later this month. Attorney Daniel King made the request in court today, saying that the defense now has a diagnosis for Holmes, though he didn't specify what it was. The judge said that he finds 'good cause' to allow the change in plea, will not make his decision until May 28 - three days before a new hearing begins. Holmes had bushy hair and beard at Monday's hearing. He didn't speak at all and entered the courtroom with his eyes downcast. Back in court: Accused movie theater gunman James Holmes, is led into the courtroom in this sketch . Mom: James Holmes' mother Arlene Holmes, left, is escorted by a member of the defense team as she arrives for Monday's court hearing . Insanity plea: Holmes' attorney Daniel King speaks as Holmes looks on in this court sketch . The not guilty by reason of insanity plea is widely seen as Holmes' best - and perhaps his only - hope of avoiding the death penalty. But his lawyers have held off until now, fearing a wrinkle in the law could cripple their ability to raise his mental health as a mitigating factor during the sentencing phase. Two judges have refused to rule on the constitutionality of the law, saying the attorneys' objections were hypothetical because Holmes had not pleaded insanity. The defense had little choice but to have Holmes enter the plea and then challenge the law. Holmes' lawyers announced last week that he would ask to change his plea at Monday's hearing. Defense: Attorney Daniel King made the request in court today, saying that Holmes' lawyers now have a diagnosis for Holmes, though he didn't specify what it was . Judge: Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour Jr will rule on the plea change on May 28 . Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Holmes, who faces more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder charges. They say Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, spent months acquiring weapons and ammunition, scouting a theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora and booby-trapping his apartment. Then on July 20, dressed in a police-style helmet and body armor, he opened fire during a packed midnight showing of the Batman film 'The Dark Knight Rises,' prosecutors say. Twelve people were killed and another 70 were injured. Arrest: Much of his actions have hinted that an insanity plea might be in the cards, especially after his first court appearance where he seemed out of it . No motive has emerged in nearly 10 months of hearings, but Holmes' attorneys have repeatedly said their client is mentally ill. He was being treated by a psychiatrist before the attack. The insanity plea carries risks for both sides. Holmes will have to submit to a mental evaluation by state-employed doctors, and prosecutors could use the findings against him. 'It's literally a life-and-death situation with the government seeking to execute him and the government, the same government, evaluating him with regard to whether he was sane or insane at the time he was in that movie theater,' said attorney Dan Recht, a past president of the Colorado Criminal Defense Bar. Among the risks for prosecutors: They must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Holmes was sane. If they don't, state law requires the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. 'That's a significant burden on the prosecution,' Recht said. If acquitted, Holmes would be committed to the state mental hospital indefinitely. A judge entered a standard not guilty plea on Holmes' behalf in March, and he needs court permission to change it. Recht said it's a foregone conclusion the judge will accept the new plea to preclude appeals later. The mental evaluation could take weeks or months. Changing their stance: James Holmes, pictured during a March court hearing, has now entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity . Tragic: The shooting at the multiplex left 12 people dead and injured 70 in July 2012 . Evaluators will interview Holmes, his friends and family, and if Holmes permits it, they'll also speak with mental health professionals who treated him in the past, said Dr Howard Zonana, a professor of psychiatry and adjunct professor of law at Yale University. Evaluators may give Holmes standardized personality tests and compare his results to those of people with documented mental illness. They will also look for any physical brain problems. Zonana estimates he has conducted around 200 mental evaluations of criminal defendants, including some death penalty cases. 'All cases are tough,' he said. Meticulous planning, as in the scenario prosecutors laid out against Holmes, doesn't necessarily mean a defendant is sane, Zonana said. Zonana said he helped evaluate Stephen Morgan, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2009 shooting death of Johanna Justin-Jinich in Middletown, Connecticut, where she was attending college. Evidence showed Morgan planned the shooting, Zonana said, 'but he was delusional as hell.'","Judge will rule on whether to accept insanity plea on May 28 .

All the pimps busted in a huge sex-trafficking ring in New York are from the same impoverished town in Mexico. The latest alleged pimps to be indicted are brothers Isaias and Bonifacio Flores-Mendez who are from Tenancingo, the ‘world capital of sex trafficking,’ according by U.S. government officials. Since October last year, immigration officials have made 33 sex trafficking arrests in New York - all from the town of 10,000 people about 80 miles from Mexico City. Sex trafficking ring raided: Immigration officials raided brothels in Newburgh, Poughkeepsie and Yonkers on April 30 and since October last year have made 33 sex trafficking arrests - all from impoverished town Tenancingo in Mexico . The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided brothels in Newburgh, Poughkeepsie and Yonkers, all in the wider-New York area, on April 30, arresting 13 indicating that the Queens-based gangs may have expanded their sex trafficking ring. Dozens of women, mostly from Mexico, had been exploited, many forced to engage in prostitution with 20 to 30 customers a day. ICE Special agent in charge James Hayes said on the day of the arrests: 'The arrests today move the United States closer to blockading the repugnant sex trafficking corridor that organisations like the one allegedly operated by Isaias Flores-Mendez and his cohorts use to smuggle innocent victims between Tenancingo, Mexico and New York City. He told The Daily News: ‘We see here that they have moved (farther) out. ‘It seems like the word is getting out that we’re cracking down in the New York City area.’ The town has been notorious for pimps . who dupe women, some only teenagers, into trafficking by promising love, marriage and employment or by using threats and abuse. All from impoverished town: U.S. government officials have dubbed the town the 'world capital of sex trafficking' because it is notorious for pimps duping women, some only teenagers, into trafficking . Driven to the brothels: Women are often driven from Queens to spend a week at a time in the brothels so customers have 'variety' (file photo) The April 30 raid at a house in Poughkeepsie revealed a secret second-floor brothel while in Yonkers, a brothel operating in a dilapidated apartment building was exposed. Women are driven from Queens to spend a week at a time in the brothels so customers have ‘variety’. The doormen, also called ‘steerers,’ charge $30 for 15 minutes. Lori Cohen, a lawyer with charity . Sanctuary for Families, which represents trafficking survivors, said: . ‘It is dangerous when they are trafficked out of town — we’ve had . clients beaten up by buyers, raped by buyers — and they are in an . unknown location. So they are isolated.’ Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said of the April 30 arrests: 'With promises of a better life, the members of this alleged sex trafficking and prostitution ring lured their unsuspecting victims to the United States and then consigned them to a living hell – forcing them to become sex slaves living in abhorrent conditions, and using threats, verbal abuse, and violence – sexual and otherwise – when they resisted and even sometimes when they didn’t. 'With their arrests today, the barbaric conduct in which these defendants allegedly engaged in order to make a profit has now been put to a stop, and they will be prosecuted for their alleged crimes and the women they enslaved will be able to put their lives back together.'

Notorious town: A striking number of sex trafficking arrests have been made in New York - all from Tenancingo (pictured), a town of 10,000 just 80 miles from Mexico City . One woman who was trafficked by her husband from Tenancingo said at the trips to residential brothels, she was regularly beaten and insulted. Her husband would send her to farms and brothels in Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey and even as far as Maryland. ‘Sometimes on a weekend it would be 30, 40 a night,’ the woman said. ‘I would say, “I can’t anymore, it hurts,” but they’d say, “Oh this is the last one.” But after that last one, there’d be another.

A woman who was rescued after 17 days from under the rubble of a collapsed garments factory in Bangladesh has told how she survived on biscuits and bottles of water. Reshma Begum stunned her country and the world when she was pulled out of the rubble without any serious injuries. Miss Begum, 19, said that on the day of the building’s collapse, she had rushed to work and did not have any breakfast. Instead, she bought four small packets of biscuits on her way into work. It was a decision that would save her life – as she then rationed her scarce supply over the next two weeks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Miracle: Reshma Begum was pulled from the rubble alive 17 days after the garment factory collapsed . Tragedy: At least 1,100 people died when the garment factory in Savar, near Dhaka in Bangladesh collapsed . Her rescue – which was shown live on national television – brought the country’s capital, Dhaka, to a standstill as people stopped work and gathered around TV sets. Yesterday, Miss Begum told hospital staff and her rescuers that she lived on the biscuits and bottles of water for the first 15 days – as she lay holed-up inside a cavity in the wreckage of the Rana Plaza building in the Savar area of Dhaka. It is believed the lifesaving bottles of water reached her after they were thrown down a hole by rescue workers. The rescuers had been told to push the bottles down every hole and cavity they stumbled across – in the hope those trapped underneath would receive them. Miss Begum – who lived alone in a rented room in Savar – said that when the eight-storey building collapsed, she was on the third floor. She managed to run down to the second floor but became trapped in a cavity. The cavity was big enough for her to move about in and there was enough air to breathe. But her hair had become stuck under a boulder, so she had to pull off strands to set herself free. Recovering at the Combined Military Hospital in Savar, Miss Begum said: ‘No one heard me. It was so frightening. I never dreamed I’d see the daylight again.’ The seamstress now has trouble sleeping at night, and occasionally grips a nurse’s hand in apparent panic attacks. Exhausted: Miss Begum was dehydrated and panicked after her ordeal . Trauma: Doctors say she has had trouble sleeping and panic attacks . In safe hands: Miss Begum is recovering at a military hospital . Colonel Azizur Rahman, a military doctor at the hospital, said: ‘We don’t want those memories to haunt her now, so we are not allowing anybody to ask her anything. ‘She is now being provided semi-liquid food.’ It has emerged that Miss Begum’s family learned that she was alive after watching the rescue on TV. Her mother Zobeida Begum, who is in her 60s, said: ‘I just could not believe it when I saw her alive in  the hospital.’ Her sister Asma said: ‘We got her back when we had just lost all hope of finding her alive.’ They said they had kept a vigil for the seamstress, who is from the rural Dinajpur district, 170 miles north of Dhaka. Doctors said last night that Miss Begum is suffering from dehydration but will make a full recovery. The death toll in the worst industrial accident in the country’s history has now reached 1,100 – and the government is facing criticism for not imposing better checks on buildings run by the garments industry. Miss Begum was filmed by Somoy TV in her hospital bed, as doctors and nurses milled about, giving her saline and checking her condition. Survivor: Miss Begum was uninjured save for her hair getting trapped under a boulder . Missed breakfast: The 19-year-old survived on packs of biscuits she had bought as she was late for work . Joy: The factory worker's rescue was shown live on national television and the crowd cheered as she was released . She said: 'I heard voices of the rescue workers . for the past several days. I kept hitting the wreckage with sticks and . rods just to attract their attention. 'No one heard me. It was so bad for me. I never dreamed I'd see the daylight again,' she said. 'There was some dried food around me. I ate the dried food for 15 days. 'The . last two days I had nothing but water. I used to drink only a limited . quantity of water to save it. I had some bottles of water around me,' she said. Once she finally got their attention, the crews ordered the cranes and bulldozers . to immediately stop work and used handsaws and welding and drilling . equipment to cut through the iron rod and debris still trapping her. They gave her water, oxygen and saline as they worked to free her. When Miss Begum was freed after 40 minutes, the crowd erupted in wild cheers. She was rushed to a military hospital in an ambulance, but her rescuers said she was in surprisingly good condition, despite her ordeal. She told her rescuers there were no more survivors in her area but workers began tearing through the nearby rubble anyway, hoping to find another person alive. 'Reshma told me there were three others with her. They died. She did not see anybody else alive there,' said Major General Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, the head of the local military units. Bodies were eventually recovered from another nearby section of the building, he said. Destruction: Workers are continuing to clear the rubble at the scene of the building collapse . Bodies: Rescuers have been working to remove corpses which are decomposing quickly in the 30C heat . Workers at the site had been clearing the rubble since the collapse April 24. More than 2,500 people were rescued in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. However, no survivors had been found in the wreckage since April 28, when Shahin Akter was found amid the wreckage. As workers tried to free her, a fire broke out and she died of smoke inhalation. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called Miss Begum in the hospital and she began crying on the phone as she told him: 'I am fine, please pray for me,' Suhrawardy said. Hasina, whose government has come under criticism for failing to tackle the powerful garment industry, raced to the hospital by helicopter to meet her and congratulate the rescuers, officials said. 'This is an unbelievable feat,' Hasina was quoted as saying by her assistant, Mahbubul Haque Shakil. The . Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier said . 3,122 workers were employed at the five factories housed in the . building, but it was not clear how many were there during the packed . morning shift. Duty-free access offered by Western . countries and low wages have helped turn Bangladesh's garment exports . into a $19billion-a-year industry, with 60 percent of clothes going to . Europe. Vigil: Relatives continue to wait outside the collapsed building hoping for news of loved ones . Grief: The collapse was the country's worst industrial accident to date . The European Union, which gives . preferential access to Bangladeshi garments, had threatened punitive . measures in order to press Dhaka to improve worker safety standards . after the collapse of the illegally built factory on April 24. About 4million people work in Bangladesh's garment industry, making it the world's second-largest clothing exporter after China. Following protests, authorities also . began dispersing salaries and other benefits to survivors of the . collapse and ordered the shut down of a string of factories over further . safety concerns. The move came days after . Bangladesh agreed with the International Labor Organisation to give . safety 'the highest consideration', despite fears Western bargain . retailers might source goods elsewhere. 'Sixteen . factories have been closed down in Dhaka and two in Chittagong,' said . textile minister Abdul Latif Siddique, adding that more could be shut if . they do not meet strict new safety measures. He . added: 'We have seen that those who claim to be the best compliant . factories in Bangladesh have not fully abided by building regulations.' The . disaster is the worst ever in the garment sector, surpassing fires . last year that killed about 260 people in Pakistan and 112 in . Bangladesh, as well as the 1911 garment disaster in New York's Triangle . Shirtwaist factory that killed 146 workers. Evans Monsignac survived 27 days buried underneath earthquake rubble, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti . Reshma Begum is believed to have spent 17 days trapped beneath the wreckage of the Bangladesh factory. The longest-survivor of a natural disaster is Evans Monsignac, who spent 27 days buried beneath rubble following the Haiti earthquake. The father-of-two was pulled from wreckage in the capital of Port-au-Prince and said he had survived by sipping sewage underneath the rubble of the marketplace where he was buried. 'I thought I was dead. I was in shock. On the second day, maybe the third day, I realised I seemed to be alive and I saw this water. 'I was hungry and thirsty and I tried to drink something but it was making me sick in my belly. I would take my little finger and wet my lips and swallow it, but the sicker I got as time went on,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. Evans said being entombed in the rubble for nearly a month took a heavy mental toll - when he first arrived in Florida for treatment he was extremely disturbed and suffering hallucinations. He weighed just 40kgs (88lbs) when he was admitted, having shed 27kgs (60lbs) during his ordeal. Despite being severely dehydrated when he was found, doctors were astounded he did not have any damage to his kidneys, although he did suffer from post-traumatic shock, screaming loudly and burying his head into his pillow. Other incredible feats of human endurance include:Japan 2004: A two-year-old was pulled alive from a car that he had been buried under for four days.Iran 2004: A woman in her 90s was rescued after nine days buried in the rubble of her home after the Bam earthquake.South Korea 1995: A woman was pulled from the wreckage of a collapsed supermarket 16 days after it collapsed.","Reshma Begum nibbled dry biscuits in her 17 days trapped underground .

Ian McGreevy, 8, was stealing third base during a New Jersey baseball game Saturday when the pitcher threw the ball to stop him. Instead of making it to the baseman, the ball struck Ian directly in the chest. ‘He stood up and then his whole body just collapsed to the ground,’ Maureen Renaghan told ABC News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Hero: Maureen Renaghan rescued Ian McGreevy, 8, by reviving him with CPR after a baseball to the chest stopped his heart . Renaghan was at the game watching her son on the opposing team when she witnessed the terrifying sight. McGreevy’s heart had stopped beating, he was on the ground in cardiac arrest.

Thankfully, Renaghan’s CPR training, though 20 years old, immediately kicked in. While other parent’s rushed to call 911, Renaghan searched for a pulse.

The inside of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's undergound Bunga Bunga room has been revealed as his trial for having sex with an underage prostitute resumes. The infamous room was allegedly used to hold erotic parties at which women performed stripteases and were paid for sex, though Berlusconi denies that it was used for anything so risque. Berlusconi, 76, is said to have slept with belly dancer Karima El Mahroug and given her cash and jewellery, after she attended his now infamous Bunga Bunga parties which he hosted at his Villa San Martino mansion outside Milan. At the time Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, was just 17 and technically a minor. Bunga Bunga time: The underground room in Silvio Berlusconi's villa where he held his infamous parties . Decadent: The dining room at Berlusconi's ostentatious villa, where he regularly entertained TV showgirls and wannabe starlets . In Italy the age of consent is 14, but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as a criminal offence. The trial in Milan tomorrow is nearing the closing stages and resumes after a break in which Berlusconi's legal team unsuccessfully tried to have the case moved out of the city and to Brescia claiming judges were biased against their client. Berlusconi and Miss El Mahroug have always insisted nothing untoward happened at the parties and he has also stressed they were nothing more than elegant dinners - a claim he returned to in his TV interview given to Canale 5 one of the channels the media tycoon owns. 'Nothing to hide': Berlusconi has been on TV to protest his innocence over allegations he had sex with an underage prostitute . He said: 'At the dinners nothing that could be defined incorrect or embarrassing took place. 'There was a large table, and I would attract everybody's attention, we would talk about everything, football, politics, anything. 'No-one was ever asked to leave their mobile telephones, anyone could photograph anything they wanted or talk about what happened because there was nothing that couldn't be spoken about. 'I have nothing to hide.' The interview will be broadcast on Sunday night as part of an hour-long documentary charting Berlusconi's legal battles since he entered politics in the early 1990s and is called 'The 20 Years War.' He has always insisted he is the the victim of left leaning prosecutors and judges who are politically motivated and out to get him in the various trials he has faced, which have cost him millions of Euros in legal fees. At the last count there had been more than 2,500 court hearings against him in which he was accused of crimes ranging from Mafia collusion, false accounting, tax fraud, bribery, corruption and perverting the course of justice. So far none have actually ended with him being convicted indefinitely - in Italy a verdict is not final until it has reached the third and final stage at the Supreme Court in Rome. Earlier this month a conviction for tax fraud was upheld against him and this now passes to the Supreme Court which will rule if the four year jail sentence should be enforced. Party girl: Austrian entrepreneur Richard Lugner dancing with Ruby at the traditional Vienna Opera Ball in 2011 . In the Milan trial he is currently involved in, Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with a minor and abuse of office, as prosecutors claim he told police Miss El Mahroug was related to former Egyptian president Hosni Mubrak and should be released after she was arrested on a theft charge. He told the programme: 'I absolutely never had an intimate relationship with Ruby, a girl who introduced herself with a terrible story and who deserved nothing but commiseration. 'She came one evening to a dinner and told a very dramatic story. 'She said she was the daughter of a rich Egyptian family, that her parents had thrown her out because she wanted to embrace the Catholic faith. 'She showed us scars caused by burning oil and spoke of her enormous difficulty, of how she had been in care. 'She said she had arrived in Milan to work as a waitress in a restaurant. It was a story that moved everyone who was there.' Exotic dancer: Bunga Bunga party girl Ruby the Heartstealer aka Karima El Mahroug . The story is similar to that Miss El Mahroug gave in a emotional and tear-filled interview to the same TV station two years ago, when details of the bunga bunga parties and her involvement first emerged. Prosecutors say that Miss El Mahroug was one of dozens of TV showgirls and wannabe starlets who were paid with cash, jewellery and cars to attend the parties and perform erotic dances and strip teases for Berlusconi. Photographs have been published in Italian newspapers and magazines of women dressed a nuns and police officers dancing provocatively at the parties which Berlusconi hosted at his villa at Arcore near Milan. If convicted of the sex charge, he faces three years in jail and for the public office he could be given 12 years. The two-hour documentary special also interviewed prosecutors, police officers and political associates of Berlusconi. Programme officials have denied that it is an attempt to influence the trial insisting: 'We have simply spoken to the main protagonists. Silvio Berlusconi and Ruby.' Supporters of Berlusconi had planned to hold a protest outside the court building in Milan, but have now decided to cancel that following an 'Everyone for Silvio' rally in Brescia at the weekend. Berlusconi himself attended the protest and once again told the hundreds gathered that magistrates were 'prejudiced and blinded by hatred' against him. Police kept rival factions apart but two of his supporters were injured in minor scuffles. Berlusconi stepped down as PM two years ago as Italy verged on the brink of a financial crisis, but mounted a spirited campaign in the recent general election which saw him come second to the centre left. His People of Freedom party is now part of the ruling coalition.

A man charged with killing three adults and a toddler on an eastern Kansas farm made a brief appearance in a packed courtroom Monday, but showed little emotion while a judge set a new court date. Kyle Flack, 27, has been held on $10 million bond in the Franklin County jail since he was charged Friday with capital murder in the deaths of 18-month-old Lana Leigh Bailey; her mother, Kaylie Bailey, 21; and Andrew Stout, 30. Flack is also charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder in those deaths, as well as that of Steven White, 31. The adults' bodies were found early last week at an Ottawa area farm home. A body believed to be the toddler's was found Saturday in nearby Osage County. Cold-blooded: Kyle Flack sits in court as its announced he's being held in lieu of $10 million bond on the quadruple homicide charges . Shackled: Flack was picked up for questioning about 50 miles from where Kaylie Bailey was found . Flack was picked up for questioning last week about 50 miles southwest of Ottawa in Emporia, where officers also found the car that Kaylie Bailey had been driving when she was last seen. She and her child were reported missing from Olathe on May 3. In court Monday, four armed officers stood between Flack and the small courtroom, which was overflowing with family and friends of the victims. Flack was shackled at the wrists and ankles, and appeared with his lawyer, Ronald Evans. He waived having an initial preliminary hearing set in 15 days, and Judge Thomas Sachse set it for July 8 instead. Evans declined additional comment after the hearing. Found: Lana Leigh Bailey was found on Saturday after an extensive search . Lana Leigh Bailey: 150 people were working to try to find the little girl . Authorities said in the complaint filed Friday against Flack that a firearm was used in the four deaths. Franklin County Attorney Stephen Hunting, however, has declined to say if the four had been shot. Authorities haven't said what the motive for the killings may have been. Sheriff Jeff Richards, who also attended the hearing, said afterward that forensic work was continuing on what authorities believed to be the child's remains. Andrew Helm, 27, of Gardner, was a friend of the victims' and was one of Flack's co-workers at the Ottawa Sanitation Department a couple years ago. Helm said he attended the hearing to support Stout's family. Helm said Stout, Flack, Bailey and her daughter attended a barbecue at Helm's home on April 28 and that he noticed nothing unusual. The criminal complaint filed in the case said Lana and Kaylie Bailey and Stout were killed 'on or about or between' April 28 to May 6, and that White was killed 'on or about or between' April 20 and April 28. Surrounded: Officials said forensic work remains to be done after finding the body believed to be of 18-month-old Lana . Vicki Engstrom, of Ottawa, said she was a longtime friend of Stout's family and attended Flack's hearing so she 'could see his expression.' 'I didn't see any remorse in him at all,' she said. Earlier, when the body of Lana was recovered, officials said the investigation would continue. 'I want the family of Lana, and all the victims, to know that this investigation will continue until we are confident we have collected as much evidence as we can to ensure justice is served on behalf of all four victims,' Franklin County Sheriff Jeff Richards said Sunday. Richards said the body was discovered by an Osage County sheriff's deputy who was searching an area for items that could be connected to the deaths reported May 6 at a farm home in nearby Franklin County. The evidence collected Saturday when the body was recovered led investigators to believe it was the infant's body, his statement said without elaboration. 'We hope that a forensic examination will make a final identification,' Richards added. 'Until the identity is confirmed investigators will continue following up on all tips, leads and information connected to this crime.' Murdered: Kaylie Bailey (right) was found dead on Monday at the Ottawa, Kansas-area farm where she had gone to drop off her daughter Lana (left) Major search: At times up to 150 police used dive teams, police dogs, mounted patrols, planes, boats and all-terrain vehicles to scour fields, farms, ponds and creeks between Ottawa and Emporia, Kansas looking for the girl . On alert: Riders on horseback searched culverts and drainage ditches along a Kansas Highway 68 for 18-month-old Lana-Leigh Bailey. She was found dead on Saturday . The statement did not provide any details of where the body was discovered or how the infant had died. But his statement said a crime scene unit was called to the area 'to process this new crime scene.' 'It is not the outcome we'd hoped for but we knew we couldn't stop searching until Lana was home,' the statement said. Richards told The AP by telephone early on Sunday that he would not have any further details beyond the statement. The Franklin County sheriff's office said its next scheduled statement on the investigation would be Sunday afternoon. On Saturday, search crews had deployed using boats and sonar equipment in search of the child. Earlier authorities had said investigators were scouring ponds and other waterways in the area looking for the body of Lana Leigh Bailey. Charged: Kyle Flack, 27, has been charged in the deaths of Lana and Kaylie Bailey as well as two men whose bodies were found at an eastern Kansas farm home earlier this week . Heading to jail: Officers escort murder suspect Kyle Flack from the Franklin County Courthouse to the Franklin Detention Center . Kyle Flack was charged Friday with capital murder as officials investigated the deaths of Lana Bailey's 21-year-old mother, Kaylie Bailey, and 30-year-old Andrew Stout. The 27-year-old convicted felon also was charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder in those deaths as well as that of 31-year-old Steven White, authorities have said. The investigation had included searching the farm and other rural areas in the 50-mile stretch between Ottawa and Emporia, where Kaylie Bailey's car was found Tuesday. Franklin County Attorney Stephen Hunting said Friday that a firearm was used against the victims at the farm, but didn't elaborate on whether that meant they were fatally shot. Authorities have not commented on a motive. Richards said earlier that the extensive investigation of what he called a 'horrific crime' had taken a toll and that members of the investigative team have required medical attention after searching in difficult areas. Others sought counsel from a chaplain.","Kyle Flack faces death penalty for the quadruple homicide .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:55 EST, 12 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:15 EST, 12 May 2013 . Pope Francis today proclaimed hundreds of 15th-century martyrs beheaded for refusing to convert to Islam as saints of the Catholic Church, as he led his first canonization ceremony in a packed St. Peter's Square. The 'Martyrs of Otranto' were 813 Italians who were slain in the southern Italian city in 1480 for defying demands to renounce Christianity by Turkish invaders who overran the citadel. Their approval for sainthood was decided upon by Francis' predecessor, Benedict XVI, in a decree read at the ceremony in February where the former pontiff announced his retirement. Pope Francis delivers his speech during a canonization ceremony giving the Catholic Church hundreds of new saints in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican . Ceremony: Pope Francis, middle, kisses the altar as he arrives to celebrate his first canonization ceremony in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican today . It is estimated around 60,000 Catholics gathered in St. Peter's Square during Pope Francis' canonization mass at the Vatican . The Vatican seemed at pains not to allow the first canonisations of Francis' two-month-old papacy to be interpreted as anti-Islamic, saying the deaths of the 'Otranto Martyrs' must be understood in their historical context. Shortly after his election in March, Francis called for more dialogue with Muslims but it is unclear how the granting of sainthood to the martyrs will be received. The first pontiff from South America also gave Colombia its first saint - a nun who toiled as a teacher and spiritual guide to indigenous people in the 20th century. With Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos among the VIPS, the Argentine pope held out Laura of St. Catherine of Siena Montoya y Upegui as a potential source of inspiration to the country's peace process, attempted after decades-long conflict between rebels and government forces. Francis prayed that 'Colombia's beloved children continue to work for peace and just development of the country'. Nuns place relics of the new saints on the altar during a canonization ceremony led by Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican .

Faithful Catholics spray around a poster of Mother Laura Montoya in her hometown of Jerico, Colombia, today as Pope Francis canonizes her during a ceremony in Rome . He also canonized another Latin American woman. Maria Guadalupe Garcia Zavala, a Mexican who dedicated herself to nursing the sick, helped Catholics avoid persecution during a government crackdown on the faith in the 1920s. The 'Martyrs of Otranto' were 813 Italians who were slain in the southern Italian city in 1480 for defying demands to renounce Christianity by Turkish invaders who overran the citadel. They were killed during the year-long siege of Otranto, on the southeastern Adriatic, by Ottoman Turks who sacked the city, killed its archbishop and told the citizens to surrender and convert. When they refused, the Ottoman commanding officer ordered the execution of all men aged 15 or older, most by beheading. Roman Catholic sainthood requires that two miracles be attributed to those who are being made saints - one before beatification, and another before canonisation. In the case of the 813 Italians, the requirement for the first miracle was waived because they were killed 'in hatred of the faith'. The miracle approved for their canonisation was that of a nun who had cancer which, according to the Church, was healed after she prayed at a memorial to the martyrs in Otranto. Also known as Mother Lupita, she hid the Guadalajara archbishop in an eye clinic for more than a year after fearful local Catholic families refused to shelter him. Francis prayed that the new Mexican saint's intercession could help the nation 'eradicate all the violence and insecurity,' an apparent reference to years of bloodshed and other crime largely linked to powerful drug trafficking clans. Francis told the crowd that the martyrs are a source of inspiration, especially for 'so many Christians, who, right in these times and in so many parts of the world, still suffer violence.' He prayed that they receive 'the courage of loyalty and to respond to evil with good.' The pope didn't single out any country. But Christian churches have been attacked in Nigeria and Iraq, and Catholics in China loyal to the Vatican have been subject to harassment and sometimes jail over the last decades. Christians in Saudi Arabia must . worship out of the public eye because the ultraconservative kingdom does . not officially permit churches and non-Muslim religious sites. Francis, the first pope from the . Jesuit order, which is known for its missionary zeal, praised the . Colombian saint for 'instilling hope' in the indigenous people. He said . she taught them in a way that 'respected their culture'. Many . Catholic missionaries over the centuries have been criticized for . demanding natives renounce local traditions the outsiders viewed as . primitive. The pope . also hailed the Mexican saint for renouncing a comfortable life to work . with the sick and poor, even kneeling on the bare floor of the hospital . before the patients to serve them with 'tenderness and compassion'.

Pope Francis waves to pilgrims in St. Peter's Square at Vatican today after canonising some 800 Italian martyrs who refused to convert to Islam in the 15th century . Mother Lupita's example, said Francis, should encourage people not to 'get wrapped up in themselves, their own problems, their own ideas, their own interests, but to go out and meet those who need attention, comprehension, help' and other assistance. After shaking hands with the prelates and VIPS in the front rows at the end of the Mass, Francis shed his ceremonial vestments. Wearing a plain white cassock, he climbed into an open white popemobile to ride up and down the security paths surrounding the crowd of more than 60,000. He stopped to pat children on the head, kiss babies and bantered in his native Spanish with some at the edge of the crowd. Francis noted that the crowd included participants in an anti-abortion march of several thousand people, who walked a few kilometers (miles) from the Colosseum, crossing a bridge over the Tiber river to end near the Vatican while Mass was being celebrated in St. Peter's Square. He drew attention to a signature-gathering drive in many Italian churches to push for a European initiative to 'guarantee legal protection for embryos, protecting every human being from the first instant of existence'.

No warning signs: Choreographer Stacy Walker said Michael Jackson showed no clues that he was ill during tour rehearsals . An associate choreographer who worked on Michael Jackson's planned comeback concerts testified on Monday that she didn't see any signs that the pop superstar was ill or might die in the final days of his life. 'I just never in a million years thought he would leave us, or pass away,' Stacy Walker told jurors hearing a lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother against concert promoter AEG Live LLC. 'It just never crossed my mind.' Walker, who is testifying for AEG, said Jackson appeared thinner than he had been in previous years and wore multiple layers of clothes while rehearsing for his This Is It shows planned for London's O2 arena. She said despite Jackson missing . multiple rehearsals, she was convinced based on his performances the . last two days of his life that he was ready for the series of shows. Her testimony was supported by Travis Payne, an associate director on the This Is It concerts . Payne, who rehearsed one-on-one with Jackson and helped craft the . creative vision for the show, said he never saw signs that Jackson was . ill or impaired in early preparations. 'I thought he was thinner than he was in the past, but I didn't have any reason to be alarmed,' Payne said. He . briefly discussed Jackson missing rehearsals, but has not yet addressed . Jackson's appearance in his final days. Payne resumes testifying on . Tuesday. Walker said she attributed Jackson's . multi-layered wardrobe to a personal preference. She said she recalled . one incident in which Jackson may have appeared groggy or drugged, but . she said she couldn't remember whether she witnessed or heard about it . from others on the show. Walker was the first witness called by AEG in a trial filed by Jackson's mother, Katherine, against the concert promoter. Comeback: Michael Jackson was in the middle of rehearsals for his This Is It tour when he died from a drug overdose . Her suit claims AEG didn't properly investigate the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death and that its executives missed signs that the singer was unprepared for the comeback shows. AEG denies all wrongdoing, and contends Jackson hid his struggles with prescription drug addiction. Jackson died in June 2009 from an overdose of the anesthetic propofol, which he had been using as a sleep aid. Tragedy: Jackson struggled with prescription drug addiction leading up to his death . Previous witnesses have testified that Jackson was shivering, had to be fed by others and appeared unprepared during rehearsals for the This Is It shows. Walker said she never saw any of that behavior, although she acknowledged that her job was to work with other dancers and not Jackson directly. 'I wasn't looking for things at the time,' she said. 'I wish I was.' Payne, however, worked with Jackson individually almost every day for the last three months of the singer's life. He ate lunches with Jackson, saying the star's appetite varied daily. The Thriller singer was able to perform many of his familiar dance moves, although they had to be modified because the singer was 50 years old and not as limber as he had been decades earlier. He said Jackson was tired for some of the sessions and that 'some days would be better than others'. A medical examiner who conducted Jackson's autopsy testified on Tuesday that Jackson was not underweight when he died and appeared to be in excellent health. Despite testimony from some witnesses that Jackson appeared emaciated, Dr. Christopher Rogers said the singer did not bear the signs of someone who was starving when he died. Walker and Payne, who have worked with Jackson since the 1990s, were called Monday because they are slated to leave the country for work. The trial is expected to last several more weeks.",Stacy Jackson was working on the superstar's This Is It comeback tour in 2009 .
"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 11:24 EST, 12 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:23 EST, 13 May 2013 . The brothers of the Cleveland kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro spoke of how they had no idea why they were being arrested for keeping the girls in captivity for nearly a decade. They also revealed that they saw the daughter that Ariel fathered with Amanda Berry during her captivity, saying that on two different occasions they saw Ariel bring the young girl to fast food restaurants- one time at McDonald's and another at Burger King. Each time, he said that the girl was his girlfriend's daughter. Onil Castro was in the car with his brother Ariel when police pulled them over in a McDonalds parking lot and his first thought was that Ariel had run a red light. Pedro Castro was woken up at his home by police, and he thought that they were arresting him for an outstanding open container warrant. They were both far off base, as they only learned when they arrived at the police station and were questioned separately about the three young women that Ariel had secretly kept in his house. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Onil Castro, pictured center, and Pedro Castro, right, sat down with CNN's Martin Savidge, left, in their first interview since they were accused of being involved in the Cleveland kidnappings case . Released: The brothers were accused of being involved in the abductions, but have since been released after authorities concluded they had nothing to do with it . WATCH MORE AT CNN.COM. Pedro said that once at the station, he asked what he was being charged with and a police officer wrote the word 'kidnapping' down on a piece of paper and handed it to him. 'I didn't have my reading glasses, I looked and I said, ""Oh, open containers."" She said 2No, read it again."" And I said ""Oh!  Kidnapping!  What's this?  Kidnapping? I'm thinking kidnapping. Who did I kidnap?""' he told CNN. Pedro was similarly confused, and the only one to have a clue of what was going on was Ariel, who remains behind bars after his bail was set at $8million. 'He goes ""Onil, I'm sorry. You didn't know nothing about this, Onil. I'm sorry, Onil."" And that was it. And then that's when I broke down on my way over there. I said, ""What did my brother do? What did he do?""' Onil told CNN. Set up: Onil Castro (seen at his arrest at left and during the interview at right) was with his brother Ariel when police pulled them over in a McDonalds parking lot, and he said that maybe Ariel wanted to be caught . 'When he walked past me, he goes, ""Onil, you're never going to see me again. I love you bro."" And that was it. And he put his fist up for a bump.' They consider their brother to be a 'monster' and said that one of the worst moments for them came when they realized that Gina DeJesus was one of the kidnapping victims since they are friends with her father, Felix. 'I knew him for a long time and when I found out that Arial had Gina, I  just broke down its just shocking. Ariel, we know this guy for a long time and you got his daughter and you go round like nothing, you even went to the vigils, you had posters, you give his mama  a hug and you got his daughters captive?' Pedro said in disbelief in the interview that aired Monday morning. Pedro told of how one time he saw Ariel bring a young girl to the local McDonalds- the girl that is now known to be Jocelyn who the 52-year-old fathered with his kidnapping victim Amanda Berry. 'I seen Ariel with a little girl at McDonald's and I asked him who's that and he said ""This is a girlfriend's of mine,""' Pedro Castro told CNN. In the dark: Pedro Castro described how on the few occasions they went to their brother Ariel's house, he would keep them in the kitchen or outside on the steps . When he saw the . same young girl at Burger King with Ariel on a different occasion, he . asked where the mother was but Ariel just said she was busy. The brothers said . that they had no inkling about the years of abuse that went on at their . brother's house because they never had a thorough tour of his home on . Seymour Avenue. On . the rare occasions that they did visit his home, they stayed in the . kitchen and could not see into the other areas because Ariel had put up . curtains blocking the other rooms. He explained that it was a energy . saving technique. 'The . reason why we would go in the kitchen, because he had alcohol. And he . would take me in the kitchen, give me a shot,' Pedro said. Signs: In a photograph taken in 2001, suspect Ariel Castro stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door, which led to the basement, at his home on Seymore Avenue, Cleveland . 'House of horrors': Anthony Castro and his father stand in front of the door to the basement in 2001 . Other ways that he would keep his guests from suspecting any criminal activity was to constantly have a radio or TV on so that it would drown out any background noise, and they would never spend much time actually indoors, opting to eat out on the steps instead. The brothers, who were arrested along with Ariel Castro but later released due to a lack of evidence, say that since their release from prison, they have been faced with online death threats, a break-in at one of their homes, and vandalism. Busted: Ariel Castro is facing kidnapping and rape charges, and his brothers say they would have turned him in sooner had they known . When asked by CNN reporter Martin Savidge if the public would always suspect they had a role in the kidnappings, they answered 'yes' in unison. Onil Castro said: 'The people out there who know me, they know that Onil Castro is not that person, has nothing to do with that - would never even think of something like that. I was a very liked person [before the arrest], never had any enemies. '[There is] no . reason for anybody to think that I would ever do something like that. It . was a shock to all my friends. They couldn’t believe it.' Pedro Castro . added: 'I couldn’t never think of doing anything like that. If I knew . that my brother was doing this, in a minute I would have called the . cops; cause that ain’t right. But yeah, it’s going to haunt me down. Cause people are going to think Pedro had something to do with this and . pedro don’t have anything to  do this. They said that even though Castro is their brother, they would have had no choice but to turn him in - had they known. 'If I knew, I would have reported it, brother or no brother.' The brothers spoke amid new revelations of odd behavior at the Castro house in the days prior to the women's escape. Mark Sanchez, who lives in the neighborhood and shares Castro's affinity for the bass guitar, told The Daily Telegraph that he was at Castro's home on May 2 when he heard weird thudding sounds coming from the floor above. Mr Sanchez also saw a little girl at one point whom he claimed he had never seen before. Castro explained that the child was his granddaughter. Free: A neighbor got a picture of Amanda Berry as she escaped the home last Monday with her six-year-old daughter, who the kidnapper's brothers previously saw with Ariel on trips to McDonalds . Freed: Amanda Berry (center), Gina DeJesus . (left) and Michelle Knight (right) were held captive for ten years after . being abducting from the street between 2002 and 2004 . Escape route: The women escaped through the front door of Castro's home after a neighbor helped them . Days later, he was horrified to learn about what had been going on in the house for more than a decade. Mr Sanchez told the paper that he would always have to arrange plans to hang out with Castro in advance - because he never answered the door if he showed up without letting Castro know first. He told the Telegraph: 'I have to say the guy was a demon but he played it real cool. It was the first time that I heard any noise.' Ariel Castro is suspected of holding the women captive in his home for a decade. Authorities say he kidnapped all three women - Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, raped them and fathered a child with one. The women were found May 6 after one escaped and called 911. The brothers were initially taken into custody but released Thursday after investigators said there was no evidence against them.
