He was on the arm of a supermodel who had claimed one of the biggest fashion accolades of the evening. But it was Sir Tom Jones rather than Kate Moss who emitted a golden glow. The Welsh singer chaperoned the model as she left the British Fashion Awards on Monday evening and headed to The Playboy Club in Mayfair, London, where she was hosting a late night soiree for the 60th anniversary of the magazine. Curious Orange: Tom Jones and Kate Moss leaving the British Fashion Awards . And Sir Tom’s perma-tan left 39-year-old Miss Moss looking wintery pale in comparison. The well weathered 73-year-old who spends most of his time in Los Angeles was in London for a flying visit to attend the fashion event and found himself in the position of being Miss Moss’s companion for the evening. Have fun? Moss leaves the Playboy party . Sir Tom looked to be positively glowing as his skin appeared tangerine against his white goatee and curly white hair. Wearing a pair of black trousers, a dark t-shirt and a grey suit jacket the dull outfit did nothing to dull down the singer’s sunned face. Host Miss Moss – who was in the mood to for a joint celebration to mark accepting the Special Recognition Award for more than 20 years of sustained success on the catwalk and to celebrate her cover-shoot for Playboy magazine’s 60th anniversary – stood out in a silver evening dress and knee-length fur coat. Sir Tom conducted an interview with the prize winner to accompany her recent Playboy shoot, which also coincides with her 40th birthday. In the flirty chat the singer asked Miss Moss who her dream dinner party guests would be. She replied: ‘Well I would like to have dinner with naughty people who have a story to tell –like you. ‘Jack Nicholson, David Bailey, Stevie Nicks, Catherine Deneuve, Joan Collins. And Hugh Hefner, obviously.’ The pair were joined at the late night bash by many showbiz guests, including M&S model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, One Direction band member Harry Styles, and TopShop owner Sir Philip Green. Sir Tom will return to our screens with the third BBC1 series of The Voice in January, along with Will.I.Am and new hosts Kylie Minogue and Ricky Wilson, from the Kaiser Chiefs.","Welsh singer looks radioactive as he leaves top fashion show .

They gave more than 20 boxes of clothes, bags and shoes to a charity shop in an attempt to raise money for survivors of the Philippines disaster last month. But many of David and Victoria Beckham’s donations have ended up in far less honourable hands. When the sale opened 11 days ago at a British Red Cross charity shop in Chelsea, hundreds of fans queued around the block in a bid to get their hands on the famous couple’s rare designer items. However, several shameless shoppers went straight home to sell their bargains online, with some making more than twenty times the sale price in profit. A tuxedo jacket that was once owned by David Beckham went up on eBay has a minimum £300 bid attached . Jordan Silverstone queued for one and a half hours to get the suit - which Beckham wore to the Sun¿s Military Awards in 2011 . Economics student, Jordan Silverstone, is one of many who has been criticised for cashing in on the stars’ good nature. He bought David’s tailored Saville Row tuxedo for just £125 which he has now sold for £2,600 on auction website, eBay. The unique item was hand-fitted for football star and worth at least £4,000 – but David had deliberately decided to sell it on for an affordable price so that normal people could afford it. The 22-year-old queued for one and a half hours to get the suit - which Beckham wore to the Sun’s Military Awards in 2011, where he was pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge. Destined for eBay: A shopper inspects a pair of Dolce & Gabbana shoes later spotted on the auction website . On sale: This pair of Dolce & Gabbana shoes that once belonged to Victoria Beckham are already listed on eBay . He claims he originally bought the William Hunt tuxedo for his father Matthew’s 53rd birthday, but when he got it home he realised his father would be ‘too fat’ for it. So he decided he would sell it on, keeping three quarters of the profit – for a day out with his father and to put towards paying off his student loan. The rest, he said, he will give to charity. But the Nottingham University student has received abuse through social media sites and on eBay accusing him of cashing in on a charitable gesture. Nazaneen Ghaffer, a Sky News weather presenter, said on Twitter that if an item doesn’t fit, people should ‘just sell them for what he/she paid’ – not make a profit. But Mr Silverstone responded, saying: ‘It is absolute nonsense. If I keep the suit and leave it in my Dad’s wardrobe never to be worn then that is okay, but if I sell it on to a buyer who really wants it that isn’t?' Choice: The shoes, in a rainbow of colourful shades, line the shelves of the Kensington Red Cross shop . He added: ‘Where is the logic behind that? It’s rich of anyone to knock someone else’s charitable donations. Nazaneen Ghaffer poses pictures of her exotic holidays in Dubai on Twitter – is someone having a go at her for not giving this money to starving children? No.’ He said: ‘From an economics point of view, it makes complete sense. ‘It doesn’t fit my dad, so we want to sell it to someone who can get value out of it as that’s better than it being unused. ‘This way I can raise more money for charity than I already have by buying the tux and make a profit to do something nice with my dad.’ Performance: These gold boots included in the sale were first worn for a 2000 Spice Girls show at the Astoria . Throng: Shoppers eager to get their hands on a piece of fashion history scramble to the till at the charity shop . Battle of the black dress: Although it caught the shopper on the left's eye, the blonde lady took the piece home . Excited: This Beckham fan appears utterly overjoyed to be allowed into the shop when it opened at 11am . But Mr Silverstone isn’t the only one making a profit. Among other items that have been in online auctions are Victoria’s white platform trainers that she wore at the Dodgers Mets game on 7th June 2007. Despite the new owner paying less than £50 for them, bids started at £1,000. And another eBay user is selling a pair of Victoria’s Gianni Versace black heels for £330. Only 150 shoppers were allowed in to the charity shop near Kings Road in Chelsea on November 22, then it was one-in-one out as men and women lined up for hours waiting for their chance to grab a bargain. More than 500 donated items went on sale, incuding designs by Dolce & Gabbana, Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo, which started at just £25. The couple also donated their famous matching Dickensian outfits worn at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. Posting photos of her piles of discarded clothes ahead of the giveaway on her Twitter page, Victoria wrote: ‘Proud to support @BritishRedCross #ShopDrop Donating clothes for #Haiyan survivors.’ Victoria, who spent the weekend before last sorting through her wardrobe, has been urging others to follow her example and donate their old clothes.","Some of the pieces sold have already been listed on eBay .

A Utah woman who’s blog essay about living in poverty went viral proved her story to doubting critics Tuesday by taking out her false teeth. She got to the root of the matter in a YouTube video aimed at writers who’ve attempted to debunk her claims that included having rotting teeth and living in roach motels. While some of the claims she made in the essay ‘Poverty Thoughts’ have yet to be proven or disproven, her told-ya-so act is sure to shut at least a few mouths. Scroll down for video... 'I don't give a f*** anymore': Linda Tirado addressed critics of her essay on poverty by revealing her missing teeth . Symptom of pvoerty? Tirado, 31, says she was in a car accident at 19 that damaged her teeth and without money to fix it they decayed in the years since . ¿You don't get hired for a job if you look like this¿: Tirado now lives with partial dentures and says she struggles constantly with how her missing teeth change her appearance . ‘You don't get hired for a job if you look like this,’ Tirado tells the camera after revealing her missing teeth. ‘Maybe you get hired at the corner store for the graveyard shift, but nobody's putting you out in front, buddy. Nobody wants to hire somebody like this because it will reflect poorly on them.’ The 31-year-old mother of two bemoans her missing teeth as caused by her poverty and a cause of her poverty. She says her teeth were initially damaged in a car accident when she was 19 and that she must now use partial dentures because many of her teeth fell out in the intervening year since. All the while, she says she couldn’t afford dental work and chose to support herself and her family instead of shelling out for steep dental bills.

However, writers like Angelica Leicht with the Houston Free Press have denounced Tirado as a liar at best and a scam artist at worst. Since winning over hundreds of thousands with her Gawker essay, Tirado has been sent donations amounting to over $60,000 via a GoFundMe page meant to go toward an entire book of her writings. Poor for how long? Critics point to Tirado's occupation as a political consultant, her private education, and middle class upbringing . ‘She doesn't need you to pay her dental bill,’ writes Leicht. ‘She wants you to pay her dental bill. There's a difference. And it appears that may not even be necessary; those ""rotten"" teeth? They appear just fine in a 2004 political blog where her head shot is used,’ Leicht points to several things she says prove Tirado a liar: her marriage to a U.S. Marine (which affords her dental insurance), Tirado’s past as a political consultant and writer, and her childhood in boarding school. And, of course, to her teeth. ‘Her recent appearance on HuffPo Live,’ Leicht writes, ‘seems to confirm that suspicion. Rotten teeth they are not.’ Tirado addressed the foul calls by Leicht and others by defiantly removing her false teeth on camera and explaining just how they got that way. She’s also addressed her past as a boarding school girl and present—seemingly comfortable—life. As an addendum to her GoFundMe donation request and in clarification of her original viral essay, Tirado writes: . ‘You have to understand that the piece you read was taken out of context, that I never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now, or that I was still quite so abject. I am not. I am reasonably normally lower working class. I am exhausted and poor and can't make all my bills all the.’ Backpedaling? ¿You have to understand that the piece you read was taken out of context, that I never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now, or that I was still quite so abject,' Tirado now claims .","Linda Tirado wrote an on a Gawker forum describing struggle's she's had with poverty .

Tributes have been paid to a football-mad college student who was stabbed to death in the early hours of today outside a London bedsit. The 17-year-old became the second knife murder victim in London in the space of 14 hours after he was stabbed to death outside a bedsit in Palmers Green, north London. The boy, named locally as Joshua Folkes, or 'Money J', as he was known to his friends, was pronounced dead at the scene after the emergency services were called at 12.45am. A college student, named locally as Joshua Folkes, has been stabbed to death in the early hours of today . Police, the London Ambulance Service and the capital's air ambulance attended the scene, a force spokesman said. He said the teenager's family have been informed. Formal identification is yet to take place and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course, the spokesman added. Grieving friends broke down in tears as they paid tribute to Arsenal fan Mr Folkes, 17, when they visited the spot where he was murdered. Reshe Hall, 17, said: 'He was such a nice guy. His name was Josh, but he loved money so we called him ""Money J"". 'He always said he wanted to do a lot of things, we never thought he would end here. His mother will be more than heartbroken. He was a really nice, charismatic guy. Mr Folkes, or Money J as he was known to his friends, was pronounced dead at the scene in north London . A forensic tent today covered the spot where Mr Folkes died, while uniformed police officers stood outside the property . 'He was into football, his team was Arsenal. It is just so sad. He was never in a gang and never got into any big trouble.' Mr Folkes is believed to have gone to Friern Barnet Secondary School, but had recently moved to Southgate Community College where he was studying to be a car mechanic. Friends said the victim’s friend Marvin Henry, 17, was shot dead during a gang fight on an estate in Mill Hill, north London, in October 2010. Investigations were being carried out at the scene in north London today following the incident . Kelsey Fashoni, 17, a close friend, broke down in tears as she visited the spot where he was stabbed. Laying a bunch of red roses and white flowers and a card, she said: 'He was lovely, we all grew up together and he was the nicest boy. 'He was a friendly bloke, you couldn’t meet a nicer guy. He rapped and loved his football. 'The same thing happened three years ago. His friend Marvin Henry, who was known as Spooky, was stabbed to death. It is just another number to people. Its just so sad.' One of the victim's close friends, who did not want to be named, laid a pair of trainers and a jumper belonging to Mr Folkes at the scene. He said: 'I ain't feeling good at all, I ain't feeling good at all. He was my best friend. He got stabbed. He lived with me here a little bit, he stayed with me here a couple of times. 'I miss my friend, man, I miss my boy. That's all he was, man, I miss my boy. 'He was a good youth. He was a good youth at heart. He loved music, loved rapping. He loved to rap, that was his life. 'I miss my brethren, man. No doubt about it, I miss my boy. I miss my friend, we partied together, he slept in my house day and night.' He went on to say: 'I miss my dawg, that's my right hand. I love my dawg, I miss my dawg. 'This made me realise what life is seriously really about. I lost someone close to me. 'He had a lot of friends around here. Josh has got a lot of friends, this is what people don't know. 'He lives in Brunswick with his mum, he loves his mum and he chilled with me in Palmers Green on like a daily basis. 'This is too much. He ain't got no brothers and no sisters, he was her only child that got taken.' Floral tributes have been left near the scene of the murder in Palmers Green, north London . Police, the London Ambulance Service and the capital's air ambulance attended the scene, a force spokesman said . A neighbour of Mr Folkes has told how he arrived home in the early hours to see the teenager lying on the ground as a friend desperately begged him to get up. Ali Bawan, 31, said Mr Folkes's eyes were closed, he didn't move and 'it was obvious he was dead'. Mr Bawan said: 'I was coming home from work when I saw him lying on the pavement outside. Teenager Joshua Folkes is the twelfth teenager to be murdered in the capital this year, but the first since September. Seven of the teenage murder victims have been stabbed. Eight teenagers were murdered in London in the whole of 2012. The latest incident was the second knife murder in north London in the space of 14 hours. A separate murder inquiry was launched after a man in his twenties was fatally stabbed in north London yesterday morning. Police were called shortly after 11.30am to reports of a man with stab wounds in Stoke Newington. The victim was taken to an east London hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Officers from the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command are appealing for witnesses. No-one has been arrested. 'I couldn't believe it. It was around 12.20am. 'There was another guy standing over him, his friend. He just kept shouting ""Let's go! Let's go! Run! Let's go!"" But he wasn't moving. 'He was sprawled out on his back with his eyes shut, although I didn't see any blood. 'The friend stayed until the police came.' Mr Bawan said Mr Folkes had been staying in the upstairs flat of the run-down bedsit outside which he was stabbed. He said there had been a lot of arguments and comings and goings from the flat. He paid tribute to Mr Folkes who he said was 'a really nice guy'. He said: 'He seemed absolutely a really nice guy. He's a very nice guy.' Friend Vivian Fernando, 20, said: 'At about 12.45am the police and ambulance were all here. 'The paramedics had him open on the floor. I think it was internal bleeding. It was horrible. 'He was like a brother to me. 'Whoever it was, they need to do time because Josh wouldn't hurt anyone. He never carried a knife.' Other mourning friends have left cards and flowers at the crime scene. One card read: 'Rest in perfect peace and you be happy. I hope you're all right up there. Never forgotten'. Another simply said: 'RIP Josh'. There has also been an outpouring of grief on social media, with many of the victim's friends struggling to come to terms with their loss. 'I'm speechless, I'm shocked, devastated, confused?! how can this happen? WHY him?! R.I.P Money J,' one, identifying herself as Subliminal Dancer, posted to Twitter. Flowers, a card and a bottle of Ribena were left at the scene of the incident today . Meanwhile Azra Valentino, 18, said: 'He was such a good boy, he wasn't like that. He had the cutest smile.' He went on to say: 'He wasn't meant to go like this. We're all just shocked. When I see this, I can't believe it really. I'm just shaken up. I don't know what to do. 'Josh was the last person who you'd think would be on the news for a death or something, he wasn't like that. He got caught up in it.' Saffron Davis, 17, said: 'I've known him for 15 years. I still can't believe it. He went to Christ College. He introduced me to rap music, he listened to everything. I'm going to start crying. 'He was an only child. He had an uncle though, who he was really close to. I just feel for his mum. 'I think he was staying here with his girlfriends, his girlfriend was living here or something.' A female neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: 'I heard a commotion outside the flat next to me, and then it went quiet. 'I looked outside the window and Money J was on the floor and he wasn’t moving. 'There was someone standing over him. They started doing CPR, they had to open his chest up.' The neighbour went on to say: 'Then about eight or nine police cars turned up. They tried to do everything possible, but he was pronounced dead there and then. 'We knew him from around the area. He was staying with a friend. 'He was a good boy. His mum is going through the mill. She was tucked up in bed and then she gets a phone call saying her child is dead.'

But in this case it was the burglar himself who decided that justice had not been done. James Greenwood, 43, had accidentally made off with a mahogany casket containing the ashes of a Second World War veteran as part of his haul, and dumped them in a wheelie bin in a panic. Acknowledging the anguish this had caused the family of the deceased, he decided the 20-month jail sentence the court gave him was not enough – and wrote to them saying he would let them give him ‘a good beating’ when he got out of prison.

The grieving man compared the heart-breaking experience of losing a child to an amputation. Mr Heslin, pictured in March during a pro-gun control event in New York, said he could not bring himself to take down last year's tree that he and his son (right) had set up just before the school shooting .

The woman said that when she saw an early news report about the school shooting on TV, she thought to herself, 'Oh no, not another one,' not knowing at the time the identity of the killer. When she learned that it was her nephew who murdered 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself, Marsha Lanza said she was shocked and immediately called her husband. In the candid conversation about the tragedy, Adam Lanza's aunt said she is no stranger to loss and knows all too well how the victims' families feel. ‘My heart goes out to each and every family that has lost a child,’ she said. ‘Personally, I have lost two sons.

Popular: Ford, right, posing with a fan during the first half of an NFL football game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Buffalo Bills, will be part of the show called 'Sports Junkies' The programme, broadcast on '106.7 FM The Fan' is expected to feature phone in sections where he will talk with callers about some of the country's major leagues, including the NFL. Mayor Ford's segment will be on Thursdays at 8:40 a.m. and starts this week. Ford has had his political wings clipped by Toronto City Council after he admitted smoking the banned substance in a drunken stupor'. Standing firm: The Mayor has refused to walk away from his post despite admitting he smoked crack while drunk . Although still holding office many of his powers have been stripped. While the Mayor has refused to stand down over the affair, more allegations have since been levelled at him over his drug use.

Elsewhere in the recordings the men spoke about delivering drugs to Ford and having pictures of him using drugs. On one wiretap on April 20, an alleged gang member is heard saying, 'Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today' and that he would post a picture on Instagram. On another wiretap, one man says he has many pictures of Ford 'doing the hezza,' which police say is known to be slang for heroin. Dennis Morris, Ford's lawyer, said the wiretaps are snippets of alleged gangsters who are talking among themselves.

'Gangster's moll': Gemma Harvieu is accused of money laundering and assisting an offender . A Selfridges beautician enjoyed a jet-set lifestyle with a fugitive armed robber after he escaped from his own trial and set up base on the Costa Del Sol, a court heard yesterday. Gemma Harvieu, 29, became a 'gangster's moll' to Andrew Moran, who was on trial for robbing a Royal Mail van at gunpoint when he vaulted over the dock and managed to give police the slip. The court heard that during his four years on the run, Harvieu would join him at a string of exotic locations, before he was dramatically arrested by Spanish police while sunbathing at his villa. In the space of just one year she made 23 visits to Alicante, jurors heard. She also took trips to Paris, Vienna, Pisa, skied in the Alps and would shop on London's Bond Street. All the while she was earning a modest wage on the cosmetics counter of Selfridges at the Trafford Centre, Manchester, Preston Crown Court heard. Harvieu, who is accused of assisting an offender and money laundering, was allegedly involved in a scheme where she would wire money to Spain via Western Union, where Moran, 31, collected it using an assortment of false identities. Before Moran escaped she was depositing only £7,000 a year in her personal account, but police investigations showed that she banked more than £22,000 - allegedly to help fund his life on the run. Harvieu, from Chorlton, Manchester, was with Moran at this exclusive Villa on May 10 this year when Moran and Harvieu were caught when police swooped on an exclusive villa in Alicante. Armed officers found firearms, live ammunition, mobile phones and evidence of false identities. 'This just wasn’t some rich boyfriend she had picked up in Spain who was treating her to a celebrity lifestyle In the Costa Del Sol away from her life back in Manchester,' said prosecutor Tim Brennand prosecuting. 'There was much much more to this. Moran was very much living the clichéd lifestyle of a resident of the so-called Costa Del Crime, and the inference is she was living out a life effectively as a gangster’s moll. 'The couple were spending time with one another. It is inconceivable that she was ignorant of the life she had chosen for herself with Moran. She was inextricably linked to his flight from justice and criminal lifestyle.' Moran had gone on the run in March 2009 as he was standing trial over a £25,000 gunpoint raid on a Royal Mail delivery van. Scroll down for video . Together: Gemma Harvieu with Andre Moran. The court heard that she denied knowing he was a fugitive or criminal . Realising he was about to be remanded in custody at Burnley Crown Court, he vaulted over the dock and ran out into the street before officer had the time to take hold of him. He later fled the UK after he used a false passport to buy a ticket for a Monarch Airlines flight to Alicante. But whilst police were hunting Moran, from December 2009 to May 2011 Harvieu flew 22 times with Monarch from Manchester to Alicante- sometimes twice a month - allegedly to see him. In 2010 she flew to Alicante 23 times with some of the flights paid for by Moran, his sister and his friends. She would arrive back in the UK after trips only to return shortly after by Eurostar. Dayjob: Harvieu sold cosmetics at Selfridges in Manchester, pictured . Classy: Jurors heard Havrieu would shop on Bond Street . A European arrest warrant was issued for Moran in 2010 and in November 2012 Spanish police set a road block to trap him. But Moran spotted the officers in uniform, rammed his 4x4 car through the police cordon and drove off in the wrong direction away from the trap set for him. Police searched his flat and found firearms, cash, drugs and false identities were seized but the trail went cold until he was tracked down to the villa in Alicane with Harvieu. Captured: Andrew Moran, pictured, was arrested by police in Spain earlier this year . Mr Brennand added: 'He was using a variety of false passports, and mobile phones and they were enjoying the high life. Photos showed a variety of cars and motorcycles and Andrew Moran posing with weapons. 'It demonstrates more about the brazen personality of Andrew Moran and a fascination for ammunition and drugs and that he had done very well for himself after leaving the dock at Burnley Crown Court.' Police analysed Harvieu’s Halifax Ultimate Reward Current Account and spoke to work colleagues who said she had no longer wanted to work at Selfridges after meeting a man in Spain. Between March 2009 and November 2012 a total of £38,930 in cash deposits were made including cash payments totalling £22,335 in 2010. She was entrusted to send money to allocated names in five transactions totalling £4,000 between November 2010 and 7 December 2010 all being collected in Spain. Mr Brennand said: 'The cash lodgements were the sort that would not trigger money-laundering alarm bells. It was deposit after deposit after deposit. 'The location was consistent, we can see spending in shops, establishments in Manchester, Bond Street in London and locations in Spain and Europe where money is going in and out of the UK. Escape: Andrew Moran flees a trial at Burnley Crown Court in 2009 . The court heard Harvieu denies ever knowing Moran was a fugitive or a criminal - even though his escape was reported in newspapers and on BBC’s Crimewatch programme. Mr Brennand said: ’The television is a funny thing, when it touches you the natural thing we do is tell friends, family, you tell anybody and everybody you possibly can. 'Looking at their relationship, it is simply inconceivable that she was not aware of who he was or what he was. Applying commonsense she would have discovered the truth.' Harvieu denies assisting an offender and money laundering. The trial continues.","Gemma Harvieu, 29, allegedly funnelled money to Andrew Moran, 31 .

Emil Metodiev was allowed into the UK despite having a string of convictions for theft and burglary . A Bulgarian with a string of convictions in his homeland has been jailed for breaking into a home just nine days after coming to the UK. Emil Metodiev was caught after being chased by a homeowner who found him stealing a handbag, cash, war  medals, mobile phones and jewellery. It is thought the 32-year-old, jailed for theft at least four times in Bulgaria,  came to Britain with the sole intention of committing crime. Metodiev arrived here on October 22 after leaving his wife and the clothes shop they ran in the capital city, Sofia. Nine days later, Denise Toms, 55, woke up to find the downstairs of her home in Southend, Essex, had been ransacked. Her son Adam, 19, saw Metodiev fleeing through the back garden and chased after him wearing  just his underpants, before police officers were able to arrest the Bulgarian. Appearing at Basildon Crown Court, Metodiev, who had pleaded guilty to one count of burglary at an earlier hearing, was sentenced to 16 months in prison. He will be deported at the end of his sentence. Richard Kelly, prosecuting, told how Metodiev had arrived in the UK from his home country by train. He said: ‘He had only been in the UK for a few days and had no independent means of income. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the reason he came to the UK was to commit crime.’ The court heard a partial record of Metodiev’s offences in Bulgaria, which included seven separate convictions for theft and larceny between 2002 and 2007. The home (pictured), which he targeted at 7am on October 31, is owned by Trevor Toms, 62 . He was jailed at least four times for . theft, fined once and also given a three-year prevention order. Despite . these convictions, Metodiev was allowed to enter the UK because EU law . states that previous criminal convictions do not constitute automatic . grounds for restricting the right to move freely within the bloc. Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa-free travel to the UK . in 2007, when their countries joined the EU. Metodiev . told the court he had caught the 11pm train to Southend on the night of . the burglary because he wanted to be by the seaside. He had earlier . been staying at a hotel in London, but claimed he had run out of money . because a business associate had failed to repay a debt. After walking around for several hours he decided to burgle the £325,000 detached home owned by Mrs Toms and her husband Trevor. The Bulgarian burglar was caught after being pursued by homeowner Trevor Toms (right), 62, and his 19-year-old son, Adam (left), who chased the crook across gardens in only his underwear . Recorder . Matthew Lowe praised Adam Toms for his bravery in  pursuing Metodiev. He said: ‘It is unlikely that without the brave actions of Mr Toms you . would ever had been caught.’ Last night council worker Mr Toms, 62, who . works for the council, revealed the family’s surprise at hearing . Metodiev’s long list of previous convictions. He . told the Mail: ‘We fear we may have been targeted as I do not believe . his story that he came to Southend because he wanted to be by the . seaside. ‘If people want to . come to Britain to earn a living then I think that is great – . unfortunately there will always be a handful who want to exploit the . system.’ He added: ‘It does seem like he came over with the express intention of taking people’s property.’ There . are a number of reasons why UK Border Agency staff can reject a . convicted criminal’s entry into the country, according to official . guidance. One of the given reasons is if the person is a ‘persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for the law’. In addition, a criminal who has been sentenced to four years or more in prison can always be turned away. Meanwhile, . those who have been convicted to a spell of imprisonment lasting . between 12 months and four years can be rejected entry unless a period . of ten years has passed since the end of their sentence. People . who have been convicted to a period of less than a year can be turned . away unless a period of five years has passed since the end of the . sentence.","Emil Metodiev, 32, was caught with items from burglary in Essex .

A 13-year-old white girl was taken by Houston police Saturday from her two black, male guardians and placed in Child Protective Services without being given so much as a reason. Landry Thompson was visiting the city from Tulsa, Oklahoma over the weekend with her dance in . structor  Emmanuel Hurd, 29, and her dance partner, 22-year-old Josiah Kelly,  when cops hauled her away and held her for 11 hours. Landry's mother, Destiny, has accused the police officers of racial profiling. She said: Are you aware your daughter is with two black men?’ When I said ‘Yes, I’m aware of that,’ he called into questioning our parenting,” After several phone calls from Destiny, police let the young blonde go. Racism? Landry Thompson (left), 13, was with her black male dance instructors in Houston on Saturday when she was taken into protective custody by police without being told why . ‘They just pulled us out of the car. Put our hands behind our backs like we were criminals,’ Thompson’s instructor told KHOU. They were in town to take dance classes and were stopped at a gas station to check their GPS for directions to the hotel at 3am on Sunday. They had traveled from Tulsa to Houston to record a video with some hip-hop artists at Planet Funk Academy. That's when police spotted the three and put them all in handcuffs and into the back of separate patrol cars. Thompson dozed off and the next thing she knew she was being handcuffed. ‘It really scared me,’ said Landry.  ‘They were convinced I was a runaway and they put me in the back of a cop car and I was terrified.’ Thompson's parents say they understand why their daughter and her guardians were questioned, because they made an unlikely trio to be out so late at night. However, aware of this fact they took significant precautions and packed a range of documents to prove all was above board. The guardians had a letter signed by Thompson's parents, her insurance card, her original birth certificate and a sheet with numerous contact numbers on it. The Thompson's then scanned their drivers' licenses and sent them to the police during the incident, but were still not immediately believed. Innocent visit: The group, including dance teacher Emmanuel Hurd (right) was in Houston from Oklahoma to take dance classes . Scary ordeal: They were at this Houston gas station checking their GPS for directions to the hotel when police took Landry . Hurd tried pleading with the police, but it was no use. ‘The officer asked me “who’s the girl?” and I said ”she’s my student…I told him I had a notarized letter from her parents stating that we have full guardianship over her while we’re here.’” He says police ignored the explanation. ‘They still put handcuffs on me,’ Landry said. 'It really scared me,' said Landry, who was hauled away in cuffs and 'put our hands behind our backs like we were criminals,' said Hurd . On the phone with Child Protective Services, Destiny Thompson says she was told she’d have to come all the way to Houston to pick up her daughter. ‘I was horrified,’ said Thompson.  ‘She was with the people I wanted her to be with.  She was with people I trusted.  And now she was taken away from those people and in a shelter with people I didn’t know.’ Thompson was let go hours later, at 11.30am, and after her mother repeatedly called Child Protective Services. Hurd and Kelly had followed Thompson to the CPS center but were told to leave the reception area and were forced to wait for six hours in their car until she was released. By Monday, the dancers were planning to leave Houston. They would do so without learning why Landry was taken from her guardians. ‘I would love an apology,’ said Destiny said. ‘They owe her an apology.’ In a statement, the Houston Police Department defended the actions of their officers, claiming they had exercised appropriate 'caution'. It read: 'Given the age discrepancies...and the child had no relatives in the area, officers in an abundance of caution, did their utmost to ensure her safety and sent her to CPS.' Hurd and Kelly are considering taking legal action. 'I was horrified': Landry's mother Destiny says she had to call repeatedly to get her daughter turned over to her guardians and that she was initially told she'd have to fly to Houston to get her out of custody .","Landry Thompson, 13, was visiting Texas from Oklahoma with her two male, African American dance instructors .

A hidden-camera video showing late Internet freedom activist and programmer Aaron Swartz sneaking into an MIT computer closet to siphon scientific papers from an academic library has been made public nearly three years after its recording. The 2011 footage was used by the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue a federal case against the Reddit co-founder, who eventually took his own life. The notorious clip was released this week by the U.S. Secret Service in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Wired reporter Kevin Poulsen. Scroll down for video . Candid camera: A hidden-camera video has been released showing Internet freedom activist Swartz entering a wiring closet at the MIT . Sneaky: The coder is seen opening his backpack and removing a box containing a portable hard drive . The minute-long clip shot with a small camera that had been concealed inside a wiring closet at the MIT begins with then-24-year-old Swartz entering the cramped chamber with a bike helmet shielding his face like a mask. The coder is seen opening his backpack and removing a box containing a portable hard drive. He then kneels out of the frame, only to reappear five minutes later - presumably after switching out a hard drive from a laptop he had connected to MITâ€™s network. Swartz then replaces the hard drive into his bag, switches off the light in the closet and slips out. The camera had been placed inside the small room in the basement of Building 16 after MIT staff noticed that someone had been downloading millions of articles from JSTOR there. JSTOR  is an archive of scholarly journals to which universities, including MIT, pay large amounts of money for access. Sting operation: The camera had been placed inside the closet in the basement of Building 16 after MIT staff noticed that someone had been downloading millions of articles . Tying loose ends: Swartz went to the wiring closet to remove his Acer laptop that he had connected to MIT's network weeks earlier . Swartz, who had advocated for Internet freedom, sought to download academic papers and than put them up on a file-sharing site so that  anyone could read them for free, according to his indictment. In an ironic twist, just two days before Swartz killed himself, JSTOR announced that it will be releasing more than 4.5 million articles to the public. On January 4, 2011, college personnel discovered an Acer laptop hooked up to MIT's grid and called police, who suggested they stage a sting operation in order to catch the perpetrator in the act. Two days after the secret recording was made, Aaron Swartz was taken into custody and hit with computer and wire fraud charges. Activist: Swartz's goal was to offer scholarly journals stored in an online library that required a subscription free of charge to anyone . Prosecutors had previously released shots from the video showing Swartz entering the wiring closet as evidence of his alleged guilt. The activist faced between seven and 35 years in prison, as well as massive fines, if convicted. This past January, Swartz was just weeks away from the beginning of his jury trial when he ended his life inside his Brooklyn apartment at the age of 26. Swartz's family and supporters around the world, including the hacking collective Anonymous, accused the MIT and the federal prosecutors of driving the young man to suicide. It is believed that the stress of the looming federal trial contributed to the depression, which is being blamed for Swartz's suicide. In a statement, his family claimed the Boston attorney's office pursed an 'exceptionally harsh array of charges' for a supposed crime that had no victims, and MIT refused to stand up for Swartz or it's own 'cherished principles.' According to officials, Swartz had spent three months covertly hoovering up scholarly papers from JSTOR before he was caught. A Cambridge Police report stated that his total haul was 4.8million articles valued at $50,000. He registered as a guest under the fictitious name, Gary Host - a hacking in-joke in which the first initial and last name spell 'ghost.' Busted: Swartz was arrested two days after appearing on the wiring-closet recording and charged with computer and wire fraud . Tragic end: The 26-year-old coder committed suicide this past January - just weeks away from the beginning of his federal trial . He then used a software program to 'rapidly download an extraordinary volume of articles from JSTOR,' according to the indictment. MIT and JSTOR tried to block the recurring and massive downloads, on occasion denying all MIT users access to JSTOR. But Swartz allegedly got around it, in part, by disguising the computer source of the demands for data. In November and December 2010, Swartz is said to have made 2 million downloads from JSTOR, 100 times the number made during the same period by all legitimate JSTOR users at MIT. Big business: Swartz co-founded Reddit, which was later sold to the publishing giant Conde Nast . It is alleged that on January 6, Swartz went to the wiring closet to remove the laptop, attempting to shield his identity by holding a bike helmet in front of his face and seeing his way through its ventilation holes. Swartz was a gifted programmer who helped develop the RSS at the age of 14. He then went on to start a company that would eventually merge with Reddit, as well as Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against internet censorship.","Internet activist Swartz, 26, committed suicide January 11, 2013 as he faced up to 30 years in prison .

The head of the Republican National Committee has urged GOP officials to avoid appearances on MSNBC because the network posted a Tweet saying that conservatives would be upset by a commercial featuring a biracial family. The commercial in question is an ad for Cheerios which will run during the Super Bowl, and it will star the same biracial family that was used in one of the company's previous ads. MSNBC posted a message to Twitter late on Wednesday night that read: 'Maybe the rightwing will hate it, but everyone else will go awww: the adorable new #Cheerios ad w/ biracial family' and then added a link to their story with an embeded version of the ad. Controversy: The Cheerios ad will air during the Super Bowl and features a white mother, black father, and their daughter. The same cast of actors were featured in a previous ad for the company . Offensive: MSNBC deleted this tweet a short while after posting it late Wednesday night . They quickly took down the Tweet and issued an apology saying that they 'deeply regret it' and that 'it does not reflect the position of msnbc'. That wasn't enough for RNC chair Reince Priebus, who said that he will no longer be appearing on the network after the tweet, which he said 'is one action in a pattern of noxious behavior'. He wrote that the message was just the latest in a 'petty and demeaning attacks on conservatives'. Priebus has urged other Republicans to avoid the network, where the shows usually lean left. His boycott caught the attention of network president Phil Griffin who released a statement announcing that they fired a staffer as a result. 'The tweet last night was outrageous and unacceptable. We immediately acknowledged that it was offensive and wrong, apologized, and deleted it,' Griffin said in the statement. 'We have dismissed the person responsible for the tweet. 'I personally apologize to Mr. Priebus and to everyone offended. At MSNBC we believe in passionate, strong debate about the issues and we invite voices from all sides to participate. That will never change.' Apology: The network followed up with these tweets . Not enough: Reince Priebus is calling for a Republican boycott of the network until they get a public apology from Phil Griffin, MSNBC president . This comes the same day as an interview with Griffin was released on The Daily Beast wherein he defends MSNBC against calls of being too liberal-leaning in their coverage. 'I think we’ve never had an ideology. An ideology is a single thought across all programs. We’ve never had that,' he said. 'Obviously I hire people who fit the sensibility... We do stay true to facts. You have to build your argument. That’s why I call it a sensibility.' As an example, he said that MSNBC is not a safe haven of sorts for 'troubled' Democrats who may be looking for a cable news show to help rehabilitate their brand. That said, he said that the same could not be said for Republican rival Fox News. 'I think they do have an ideology, because every Republican who’s in trouble goes on that network to be taken care of....They’re owned by News Corp., which is Rupert Murdoch. Roger Ailes runs it, and he comes out of the Republican Party,' Griffin said. Priebus isn't the first Republican to question MSNBC's motives in recent weeks, as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie launched a tirade against the channel when they released a report alleging that he threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy funds if a development deal didn't go through. 'MSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him, even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three-minute attack ad against him this week,' his team said in a statement.","Reince Priebus urges Republicans to boycott MSNBC after their latest 'petty and demeaning attack on conservatives'

A father-to-be tormented by his fear of noise may  have thrown himself under  a Tube train, an inquest  heard yesterday. Neil Carter, 37, ‘felt like there was no way out’ due to his phobia of certain sounds, the hearing  was told. The IT consultant suffered from misophonia, a rare and incurable neurological disease that gave him a heightened sensitivity to noise. Neil Carter (left, with his wife Lucy in Australia in 2010) died after he was hit by a tube train, an inquest has heard . Misofonia, literally 'hatred of sound', is a newly diagnosed condition which usually sets in between 10 and 12 years old. The sounds trigger a 'flight or flight' style response in the sufferer, provoking either extreme anger or fear, most commonly anger. The closer a sufferer is to the person making the trigger sound, the stronger the response. The illness means specific sounds – . such as other people walking, chewing or breathing – can trigger rage, . panic and even the urge to be violent towards those making the sound. Mr . Carter’s psychiatrist, Dr Elise Stephen, said she had referred him to . The Priory clinic in Roehampton, South-West London, less than a . fortnight before his death in November last year. He became a voluntary . inpatient after being made redundant. Dr . Stephen told West London Coroner’s Court: ‘I was concerned at the . frequency and intensity of his suicidal thoughts the last time I saw him . on November 7. ‘He told . me that he had been at his brother’s party recently and the noise had . been too much. He felt like there was no way out and feared he could not . be a provider for his family because of his illness. He said he . struggled to cope.’ Mr . Carter, of East Ewell in Surrey, died when he was hit by a train at . Turnham Green Underground station on November 20 last year, after going . missing from The Priory. IT consultant Neil Carter 'felt like there was no way out' due to his fear of certain sounds, the inquest was told . A . report by Dr Stephen described the patient’s ‘very low mood’ and said: . ‘We discussed his mental  state with his depressive symptoms. We . discussed how he had thought about jumping in front of a train, but he . said he definitely would not do it.’ She added: ‘We had discussed getting new headphones for him as his other ones were hurting his ears.’ Dr . Niall Campbell, a psychiatrist from The Priory, said no formal risk . assessment had been carried out as to whether Mr Carter was a suicide . risk. The inquest heard he used a cash machine at 1.30pm on the day he . died, but was not officially recorded as missing until 5.30pm. Mr Carter suffered from a rare and incurable neurological disease called Misophonia, which means 'hatred of sound' Mr Carter died when he was hit by a tube train in west London on November 20 last year . A . Priory report on the patient’s state of mind written in October last . year said: ‘He felt like there was no way out. The noise and fear of . noise is an intrusion into his life. He has suicidal thoughts, but no . plan to carry it out.’ Dr . Campbell said he thought Mr Carter’s situation may improve with the . right treatment, ‘but Neil said he was not so optimistic’. The . psychiatrist added: ‘The anti-depressants had not been working for him, . but it was still early days.’ The . inquest heard Mr Carter had the painkiller Tramadol in his system when . he died, but he had not been prescribed it by The Priory.

A married 18-year-old prostitute has been branded the second 'Craigslist killer' after she allegedly used the website to lure a man into her car before stabbing him 20 times and dumping his body. According to a police report, Miranda Barbour butchered Troy LaFerrara, 42,  after arranging to meet him in the parking lot of a mall for a seedy sex rendezvous. Prosecutors say she then dumped his body in an alley before driving off to her husband's birthday dinner party later on the same day. Admission: Miranda Barbour, left, is led into a police station after telling officers she stabbed Troy LaFerrara, who she met on Craigslist . Sex worker: The teen-mom's husband said he knew about her habit of meeting men on the internet and sleeping with them for money . The arrest comes after Richard Beasley was given the death penalty in April this year after luring three men to an Ohio farm by using Craigslist job posts before killing them in cold blood. Police arrested Barbour after LeFerrara's mutilated body was found in a side street in Sunbury, Pennsylvania. After a three-week investigation, officers traced the dead man's cell phone call history, they found the teenager was the last person to have spoken him before his death. Upon agreeing to be interviewed, Barbour admitted that she had met LaFerrara on Nov 11 after setting up the encounter online. She told prosecutors that she would regularly use Craigslist to meet men for 'companionship', often being paid for the meetings. But in her first interview, the mom of one insisted that, despite setting up the meeting at the Susquehanna Valley Mall, Hummels Wharf, she didn't go through with it because she was too scared. Later Barbour’s husband and friend were then interviewed and told officers they knew Barbour she met men who she had encountered online, and that she carried a knife for her own protection. But just a day  after her first questioning, Barbour voluntarily attended Selinsgrove state police barracks, asked to speak with investigators with an attorney present. In her second version of events, she said she met LaFerrara on Craigslist and after emailing back and forth, the two decided to meet at the mall, police said. LaFerrara entered Barbour’s vehicle, and once they arrived in Sunbury, LaFerrara told Barbour to pull over, police said. Original sinner: The first 'Craigslist killer' Richard Beasley, above, was convicted in April after posting job vacancies on the site which used the promise of work on an Ohio farm to lure three men to their deaths . Beasley, 53, was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to use the promise of jobs on a southeast Ohio farm to lure the men to their deaths. A self-proclaimed street preacher, he killed three men, all of who answered a Craigslist ad for a non-existent job. The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon. All were looking for a fresh start in life, prosecutors said repeatedly during the trial. The murderer was sentenced to death in April this year, after hearing the details of his crime, Judge Lynne Callahan said 'I think I'm going to be sick. Victims: David Pauley (left) was found buried in a shallow grave in 2011. Police later unearthed the body of Timothy Kern (centre) and Ralph Geiger (right) was the Beasley's third victim . Barbour told police that she parked and LaFerrara began to grope her, touch her private areas and put his hands around her throat.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 11:38 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:47 EST, 3 December 2013 . Prison officers were warned that Raoul Moat was a 'lunatic' and potential murderer shortly before he killed his ex-girlfriend's new lover, an inquest heard today. A fellow inmate claimed that Moat was intent on 'some sort of revenge' against his ex Samantha Stobbart and her boyfriend, karate instructor Chris Brown. The revelation came to light during an inquest into Mr Brown's death in July 2010. Warning: Raoul Moat, left, was a 'lunatic' who was likely to kill when he was released from prison, an inmate told the inquest into the death of his victim Chris Brown, right . Grief: Mr Brown's mother Sally, pictured outside court today, told of the 'hell' endured by his mourning family . Moat hunted down Ms Stobbart and Mr Brown, 29, and shot them in cold blood using a shotgun two days after he was released from HMP Durham. Ms Stobbart survived the attack, while her ex-boyfriend went on the run and the next day shot and blinded PC David Rathband. The inquest opened today at Newcastle Crown Court with the evidence of a man who was in prison with Moat and is known as N1 because he cannot be named for legal reasons. He told the hearing that he said to a prison officer he believed Moat would end up killing someone after his release. 'It was sort of an off-the-cuff comment, but I believe I said, ""He's a lunatic and will end up killing someone,""' he said. Killing: The scene where Moat gunned down Mr Brown, the new partner of his ex-girlfriend, in July 2010 . N1 also told the court that Moat was unbalanced and would get angry when talking about Ms Stobbart and the police. 'He indicated that he was going to take some sort of revenge against her and her partner,' he said. The court heard that Moat had made it clear that he would never return to prison, and that he had also boasted about having access to a shotgun and explosives. It was also told the killer had indicated he intended to commit 'suicide by cop', which meant he would put himself in a position where he was shot by the police. Evidence was given that in prison he had described the outside of his ex-partner's house in detail, and said a large green verge would make spying on her difficult. N1 said Moat had told him that he would 'shoot to kill' five people - Ms Stobbart, her mother, her new partner, a psychiatrist and a social worker. Shot: Moat also fired on his ex Samantha Stobbart, left, and PC David Rathband, right, who was blinded . At the start of proceedings a statement was read out by Mr Brown's mother, Sally, which described the torment suffered by the family since his death. 'His friends said he was like Marmite - either you loved him or you hated him,' she said. 'But if you loved him you had a friend for life. He was very loyal, happy-go-lucky and never sat still. 'As soon as he tried karate he said he loved it and was good at it. He enjoyed teaching it and especially teaching children.' She said in the days leading up to his death he had been in good spirits and they had spoken regularly on the phone. 'It has been horrendous for the whole family, I cannot think of anything worse than burying your own child,' she said. 'I can only think of one word to describe it - hell.' Moat was hunted down by police and found in Rothbury, Northumberland, where he shot himself after a week on the run. The Independent Police Complaints Commission and an internal prison inquiry have looked at details of Moat's release from Durham Prison. PC Rathband was hailed a hero after his ordeal, but he was apparently unable to cope with the trauma of being blinded, and was found hanged at his home last year.","Prisoner tells inquest into death of Moat's victim that gunman was 'lunatic'

A Texas woman who claims her military husband's deployment overseas left her too stressed to care for their three young children, one of whom starved to death, is now standing trial. The trial for Tiffany Klapheke, now 23, who is charged with injury to a child in the August 2012 death of Tamryn Klapheke, started Wednesday. The child was found dead of malnutrition and dehydration, as well as covered in chemical burns, in Klapheke's Abilene home and witnesses have now testifying to the unthinkably squalid conditions in Klapheke's Abiline home.

'I just got tired of always changing the sheets': Tamryn Klapheke (right), aged just 22-months, suffered from dehydration and malnutrition and weighed only 17.5 pounds when she died. Her mother Tiffany (left) said it was depression over her military husband's deployment that made her do it . Prosecutors said Klapheke had kept the child locked in a room for four days before she found her dead in her crib and called 911. Investigators told the Taylor County jury of a stench of urine and feces that prevailed in the Klapheke home when they arrived. And Abilene police Detective Earnest Moscarelli said some rooms in the house were covered in feces. Matthew Jones, a retired Air Force master sergeant, was a Dyess Air Force Base security officer in August 2012 and the first investigator to arrive at the Klapheke home after the woman had called 911. He said the smell of urine and feces in the house 'hit you in the face like a tennis racket.' Jones said he could not wash the stench from his uniform afterward and had to discard it.

Klapheke had told investigators that the overseas deployment of her husband, an airman at the nearby Air Force base, left her too stressed to care for their three children.

Millions of elderly people could be denied vital care under a Government shake-up of the funding system, a leading charity has warned. There are fears older patients too frail to get out of bed by themselves will be denied home help on the state because they are not deemed dependent enough. Age UK also warns that further cuts to the social care budget will lead to many more elderly having to rely on ‘flying’ 15-minute home visits. Warning: Elderly people could be denied vital care under a Government shake-up, Age UK has warned . Recently it emerged that older people were having to choose between a carer making them a cup of tea or helping them to the toilet because visits were so ‘disgracefully’ short. Ministers are currently drawing up plans for a national system to decide how much state-funded care is given to each older person based on their needs and assets. At present, the funding is decided by individual councils - but this has been widely condemned as unfair and has led to many elderly people selling their homes to pay for care. The Department of Health has just finished consulting on its new system and the first draft of plans are likely to be published next May. Opposing: Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb, left, said the Government's current system sees people 'exhaust their savings', while Age UK's Caroline Abrahams, right, worries the new system will be inadequate . But in a report today, Age UK says it is ‘deeply worried’ that the Government will set the bar ‘too high’. Under the system expected to be brought in, the state would only pay for care for the elderly and disabled with ‘critical’ or ‘substantial’ needs - who need help with eating, drinking and most other daily tasks. Those only deemed to have moderate needs - who have assistance getting out of bed and washing -would have to pay themselves. The charity adds: ‘If this happens too many older people will remain shut out of the system, unable to access the help they need.’ it states. It also says that even if the elderly are deemed eligible for state-funded care, it is often ‘inadequate’ due to severe cuts to the budget. Recently it emerged that more than half of councils are only granting elderly and disabled 15 minute carer visits. Home help: Under the system expected to be brought in, the state would only pay for care for the elderly and disabled with 'critical' or 'substantial' needs . The Leonard Cheshire Disability charity - which compiled the data - said such ‘disgracefully’ short visits meant vulnerable patients were forced to choose between having a cup of tea and going to the toilet. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘The Government deserves credit for bringing forward long overdue reforms to the social care system that could make a real difference if properly implemented, but we are worried that the social care ‘coat’ being designed for 2016 is being cut to the inadequate ‘cloth’ that the Treasury is allocating. ‘A great new system on paper is pointless unless there is sufficient funding in place.' Neil Duncan-Jordan, of the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘Patients who cant get out of bed by themselves in the morning wont qualify for the cap. ‘That’s definitely true. We’re lobbying at the moment to put a number of concerns to the Government. ‘Most people really aren’t aware that their care isn’t free. They assume its like the NHS, it will come as a shock.’ The national system is likely to be similar to that used in many councils where the elderly or adults with learning disabilities deemed dependent enough would pay £72,000 of their care annually, and the state pays for the rest. But these rules would only apply to those whose needs are deemed ‘critical’ or ‘substantial’, everyone else will have to pay for most of the care themselves. But Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘We want to create a fairer society, that’s why we are putting an end to the current system which sees people exhausting almost all their savings or selling their homes in a time of crisis to pay for care.’","Millions of elderly people could be denied home help, Age UK warns .

A senior North Korean diplomat has revealed new details about why Kim Jong-Un's uncle was executed. North Korea's ambassador to the UK, Hyun Hak-Bong, said the dictator's former political confidant and close relative Jang Song Thaek had been guilty of 'tremendous crimes against the country'. Speaking for the first time about the purge which sent shockwaves around the globe, the diplomat revealed Jang had been killed by firing squad but his family and political supporters may have survived the crackdown. Purged: Jang Song-Thaek, in the blue boiler suit, is escorted from the court to be executed for treachery . Kim had described his uncle  – . who was married to his father’s sister – as a traitor, a womaniser and a . ‘despicable human scum – worse than a dog’. Jang, 67, was executed in December, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime, the state broadcaster claimed. But very few other detail had emerged from the secretive nuclear state. Today Mr Hal-Bong told Sky News: 'He made anti-party, anti-government crimes, and as well he abused his power in hindering the national economy and hindering the efforts of the national economy and for improving people's living standards. Tyrant: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, pictured, had his uncle executed by firing squad for his 'tremendous crimes against the country', the country's ambassador revealed . He claimed Jang had stolen €4.6million from the people in 2009 alone and been repeatedly pardoned by the party and Kim. But . he said that the party's patience had run out with Jang, adding: 'He . made tremendous crimes against the government, against the people, . against the country.' The ambassador also tried to dismiss reports that the Jang - unceremoniously marched out of a Central Committee of the Workers' Party in Pyongyang in December, last year, and quickly executed - had been fed to a pack of wild dogs and members of his family and political supporters had been killed during a bloody purge. Mr Hak-bong told Sky News these rumours were propaganda put about by North Korea's enemies. More than 100 members of Jang's family were reported to have been killed or arrested following Jang's swift punishment. Denial: Reports that Jang Song Thaek, left, had been fed to a pack of wild dogs on the instructions of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, right, were 'propaganda' by the country's enemies . Execution: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's uncle Jang Song-thaek, centre, is arrested during a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party in Pyongyang, North Korea, in December, last year . A news website for North Korean defectors, Daily NK, reported that members of Jang's family were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest and subsequent death. Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren were condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea. Among those allegedly executed were Jang's sister Jang Kye-Sun, her husband and Ambassador to Cuba Jon Yong-Jin and Jang's nephew and Ambassador to Malaysia Jang Yong-Chol, as well as his two sons. The children and grandchildren of Jang's two brothers are also said to have been killed. Mr Hal-bong said he could not be sure, but he thought they were probably not executed. He also used the interview with a British news organisation to demand South Korea to cancel an upcoming joint military exercise with the U.S. as a way of calming nuclear tensions in the region.","Ambassador to UK gave details of Jang Song Thaek's 'anti-party crimes'

Experienced skydiver James Lee, 25, was hit from behind by another skydiver and knocked out. He was left hurtling towards British countryside just after jumping out of the plane at the Skydive ground in Netheravon, Wiltshire. Speaking on Good Morning America he told how he was saved from certain death by two other skydivers who, having seen what had happened, managed to grab hold of him and deploy his own parachute . Pictures taken on Mr Lee's head-camera also show the other skydivers made signs to check he was okay before realizing that something had gone terribly wrong, and taking action that ultimately saved his life. Scroll down for video... Saved: James Lee, 25, from Gloucestershire, was making his 1,050th jump at Netheravon, Wiltshire, when the terrifying accident happened. He was knocked unconscious by another skydiver . 'I've been skydiving for five years and . this was my 1,050th jump.  There were 12 people in this skydive, with . others leaving the plane just after we jump off,' he said. 'One of the skydivers who left the plane through the door came out unstable and went into a spin. 'They were falling faster than I was and their shin impacted the back of my helmet with a lot of force, knocking me out and leaving me unconscious. From then, I've no real recollection of what happened,' Mr Lee said. It's hard to imagine a more heart stopping moment having jumped more than 1,000 times, he was left helpless after he blacked out, plummeting towards the earth at 120 mph. He went on: 'I am now tumbling through the air uncontrollably and two other skydivers realized something was wrong.' What happened next was incredible.

Drunk: Sherri Wilkins had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit when she struck Philip Moreno and drove 2.3 miles with his body stuck in her windshield . A woman who drove two miles through a Los Angeles suburb with a dying man on her windshield says she can't remember hitting him. Sherry Lynn Wilkins testified Wednesday that he seemed to fly onto her car in the 2012 incident in Torrance, but the events were a surreal blur. Prosecutors say 31-year-old Phillip Moreno was struck so hard that he flipped onto Wilkins' car and punched a hole in the windshield. ‘It was a flash, ‘Wilkins said. ‘I pretty much felt him landing on my window. To me, it felt like he came from the sky.’ Asked by her attorney how she felt in that moment, she said, ‘Very confused, like it wasn't real. It took me a while to figure out there was a body on the windshield.’ ‘I didn't feel like I had hit him with my car,’ she said. ‘I felt like he fell into my windshield from up high.’ Wilkins said she panicked and kept driving until other motorists told her to pull over. ‘I was very scared,’ she said. ‘I kind of froze.’ On trial: Wilkins is charged with one count each of murder, DUI causing injury, driving with a 0.08 percent or higher blood-alcohol content causing injury and leaving the scene of an accident . Full force: Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield . Freed: Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield . Victim: Moreno was pronounced dead at the hospital . Wilkins, a former addict who became a drug and alcohol counselor, wept and said she'd been drinking that night but wasn't drunk. She said she had been ‘self-medicating’ while waiting for knee-replacement surgery and had consumed three airplane-size bottles of vodka and a can of Budweiser beer and Clamato before starting to drive. Prosecutors say her blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit. Under questioning by her lawyer, Nan Whitfield, the 52-year-old defendant told jurors her story of addiction, which began when she was in a car accident at the age of 15 and suffered a broken back and shattered bones in her ankles and legs. Wilkins said she became addicted to pain killers and then heroin. ‘When did you begin to use heroin?’ asked Whitfield. ‘When it became cheaper than going to the doctor,’ she said. On trial: Sherri Wilkins, a substance abuse counselor, appears in Los Angeles Superior Court. She was allegedly driving under the influence, has been accused of striking a pedestrian and then driving for more than two miles with the dying victim lodged in the windshield and on the hood of her car . Wilkins acknowledged having served time for residential burglaries over the years, said she kicked the heroin habit with the help of methadone and more recently had been using medical marijuana. She told of obtaining a degree in addiction counseling and going to work at a treatment center. ‘Were you happy in November of 2012?’ asked Whitfield. ‘For the first time I was,’ she whispered and began to cry. Superior Court Judge Henry Hall cut off further exploration of her personal history. Wilkins is being brought to the courtroom in a wheel chair. She was leaving the treatment center on the night of Nov. 24, 2012, when the crash occurred. Wilkins has pleaded not guilty to murder, DUI and hit-and-run. On cross-examination, Deputy District Attorney John Harlan asked if Wilkins thought that night she should call her husband to pick her up since she had been drinking. ‘No,’ she said. ‘I wasn't drunk.’ Asked what she was thinking, Wilkins said, ‘I was thinking I'd better hurry up and get home before the effects hit me.’ Asked about her lack of response afterward, she said, ‘I was freaking out. It was not like I knew what was happening ... I still can't believe what happened.’ Attorneys were scheduled to present final arguments later today.","Sherri Wilkins, 51, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in 2012 .

A disturbing satellite image has revealed a vast toxic spill off the coast of China that is so large it can be seen from space. A plume of waste water the size of 50 Olympic-sized swimming pools has been photographed close to the coastline of Shishi, in China’s south. The city, which has a population of 300,000, is one of the country’s key producers of garments and textiles. Toxic plume: Waste water dumped off the coast of China is caught on satellite camera. It is believed to be the result of factories flushing water used in the dyeing of clothes directly into the ocean . The toxic sludge seems to have come from a submerged pipe that belongs to the Haitian Environmental Engineering Co Ltd (Haitian WWTP), which processes waste water from the 19 fabric-dyeing facilities in the area. Last year, the Haitian WWTP was fined 100,000RMB (just under £10,000) for discharging untreated waste water directly into the ocean. There are 435 discharge points like this one along China’s coast, which release a combined total of 32.2 billion tonnes of waste water every year, according to Greenpeace. The incident is similar to the chemical spill last year that contaminated the Longjigang River in the southern Chinese Guangxi Province, threatening the water supply of millions of people. Closer look: There are 435 discharge points like this one along China¿s coast, which release a combined total of 32.2 billion tonnes of waste water every year, according to Greenpeace. The discovery of 80 times the official limit of cadmium in the river, a chemical used to manufacture batteries and paints, sparked calls by environmental activists for more corporate and government accountability over industrial waste. The photos of the toxic waste water have emerged at a time when the world is focused on China’s dangerous pollution levels. Large parts of eastern China have suffered such dense smog this winter that officials, metereologists, and environmental activists have called for a ban on fireworks during Chinese New Year. Fireworks are a traditional part of Chinese New Year celebrations, the noise and colours are believed to scare off evil spirits and bring good luck for the coming year. But they also release particulates into the atmosphere. The LA Times reported that several cities have restricted the number of days residents are allowed to use fireworks, such as the city of Hangzhou, which is only allowing fireworks on three days during the holiday, compared to 18 days last year.

'We have been choking on the smog': A newspaper editorial encouraged Chinese residents to forgo fireworks to reduce air pollution . An article in the state-run China Daily newspaper urged individuals to do their part during the holiday season to reduce air pollution. It said: ‘Some may argue that burning firecrackers is a traditional part of Chinese culture. But culture derives from life and changes with the times. ‘Since we have been choking on the smog that at times makes people only yards in front of us almost invisible, it should be common sense that we express our joy and wishes at the new year without coughing and spluttering on the after-effects of fireworks. ‘We hope by setting off fewer fireworks the city can breathe easier in the Chinese New Year.'","50 Olympic swimming pools of waste water dumped off coast of China .

A college professor who paints Osama bin Laden as a freedom fighter and the U.S. as a 'neocolonial power' in a textbook he co-authored has listed it as required reading for his students. Emmit Evans requires students at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo to read the book entitled 'The Other World'. 'The Al Qaeda movement of Osama bin Laden . is one example of an attempt to free a country (in this case, Saudi . Arabia) from a corrupt and repressive regime propped up by a neocolonial . power (in this case, the United States),' the book says. While he requires students taking his . World Food Systems class to read the book, he does not make them pay for . it and instead provides them with a free copy online. Teachings: Dr Emmit Evans, left, a political science professor at Cal Poly requires his students to read his textbook, in which he describes Osama bin Laden, right, as a freedom fighter . But one of his students, Aaron Bandler, who calls himself a proud conservative, was shocked by what he has called 'indoctrination'. 'It totally blew my mind that a professor would essentially call Al Qaeda a bunch of freedom fighters in required reading for class,' Bandler, a junior who took the class in the fall semester, told Fox News. But when asked about the sentence about bin Laden, Evans said that he simply presents facts and doesn't make a value judgment on them. 'With respect to my writings, they are empirical, not normative,' he told Fox. Bandler said the class leaned to the left for the entire semester, which he thought was irresponsible. 'He . was encouraging us to be activists,' Bandler said. 'The whole last part . of the course was about how to cause ""positive change""... but his . examples of positive change were all stuff like Occupy Wall Street, the . Arab Spring, and raising the minimum wage. Anger: Student Aaron Bandler, who took the class last semester, complained that the class was too left-leaning and focused on sustainability, which he claimed did a disservice to the students . 'He would say things like, ""I know you guys can go out there and make things more sustainable"",' Bandler said, citing this as a problem. Book: He co-wrote the book, The Other World, which he provides to students for free . In an opinion piece for The College Fix, he added that Evans brought a Covered California representative talk to the class about the Affordable Care Act, convincing students to sign up. 'His slant does a disservice to Cal Poly students,' he wrote. 'And in my mind it rises to the level of academic malfeasance.' After he had secured his grade, he reached out to his professor about his concerns with the class. Evans responded that he had listed his intentions for the class in the course description. 'Course evaluations sometimes include . comments similar to yours, which encourage us to make the goals and . focus of the course as explicit as possible,' Evans wrote. 'I'm sorry if I didn't . accomplish that as well as I could have in your case, but am pleased you . didnâ€™t un-enjoy the class!' Evans said his one bias is towards sustainability. He said he outlines this in the course description. 'World Food Systems has a built-in . slant:on sustainability,' Evans said. 'We do not focus on ""the other . side"" - how we might build more unsustainable food systems.' Bandler said his political views didn't affect his grade, and called Evans 'a funny . professor with a lot of interesting things to say', in an opinion piece . for The College Fix. Classroom: Evans teaches in San Luis Obispo and says he explains what the class covers in its description . 'I . found the course to be very thought-provoking,' he said. 'These issues should be . discussed in a college class. But Evans only showed the liberal side of . each issue. While I enjoyed the class, I would have liked to have heard . counter arguments.' Other reviews about Dr Evans posted online by students are far more flattering and thanked the professor for challenging their views and opening their minds. 'The most powerful, insightful, eye opening class ever taken at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,' one student wrote. 'If you are not open minded do not take this class. You do not deserve to be lectured on ways to change this world. People with strong moral and ethical character take this class. You will understand the way the world truly is and how you can deal with it or change it.' Another added: 'World Food Systems is a class that everyone should take...it will change your life!'","Dr Emmit Evans requires his students at Cal Poly to read his book, in which he calls the U.S. a 'neocolonial power'

Chinese women are going under the knife to obtain a nose with a sweeping curve like the one seen on the Eiffel Tower . Just when you thought there could be no more bizarre trends left in plastic surgery, young people in China are going under the knife to have their noses reshaped... like the Eiffel Tower. Apparently driven by the incredible levels of competition in the Chinese job market, young students and graduates believe that a curved, Western style nose will give them that je ne sais quoi needed to secure a career. Hundreds of advertisements are currently displayed across the south-western city of Chongqing, with posters promoting surgeon Wang Xuming's 'Eiffel Tower' procedure, AFP reports. The poster shows a pale Western-looking woman showing off her slender, sloping nose in profile against a silhouette of the famous French landmark. Despite the 7,400 euro (about £6,100) cost of the operation - and the rather unpalatable fact that the nose is made larger using tissue from the forehead - demand is apparently high. Surgeon Wang Xuming said of his procedure: 'We are influenced by the beauty of Eiffel Tower, we are not content to just add something to the nose, we reconstruct it. 'Some students face a lot of employment pressure after graduation, if their facial features are good, they'll have more chance of finding a job. ‘We've had students getting the Eiffel Towernose, it's helped them a lot.' Official statistics show that more students than ever graduated in 2013, with over seven million spilling out into the job market which has been hit by the recent economic downturn. More graduates and fewer jobs means that up to 10 per cent of those with degrees are unemployed, and employers feel able to be extremely discerning when selecting new staff, with some job adverts specifying certain physical characteristics an applicant must have, such as a minimum height. The poster advertising an 'Eiffel Tower' nose operation at a clinic in the southwest Chinese city of Chongqing . The popularity of surgery in Asia, particularly among the young, has been blamed by some on a desire to look more 'western' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture. South Korea is the world's largest market for plastic surgery, with one in five Seoul women having gone under the knife. Recently a procedure similar in its extreme nature to the ‘Eiffel Tower nose’ has hit headlines when an unnamed woman, allegedly a reporter on a South Korean TV channel, underwent jaw surgery in order to achieve the dainty heart-shaped face desired by many east Asian women. Graduates in China feel that looking a certain way will help them get ahead in the increasingly competitive job market . Before and after: The South Korean woman looks drastically different after undergoing plastic surgery to make her jaw more heart shaped . It is usually a last resort solution to correct facial deformities where people have been unable to chew properly due to an excessive over or underbite, but has become popular in South Korea.

People across the world, regardless of their religion or culture, believe that humans are immortal, according to research. A new study has shed some light on people’s beliefs that a person's soul or essence transcends the physical body’s death. Scientists think the belief that part of us is eternal emerges early in life and is part of our human nature, rather than something that is imposed on a person by a culture or religion. People across the world, regardless of their religion or culture, believe that humans are immortal and scientists think the idea of the soul existing without the body emerges very early in life. This is an illustration by William Blake and Louis Schiavonetti showing the soul hovering over the body . Researchers from Boston University, led by Natalie Emmons, examined children’s ideas about the time before conception and interviewed 283 children from two very different cultures in Ecuador. Her research suggests that we often think the part of us that is eternal is not our ability to reason, but our desires and emotions - so we are what we feel. The study, published in the journal Child Development, fits into a growing body of work examining the cognitive roots of religion. Deborah Kelemen, an Associate Professor of Psychology at Boston University and co-author of the paper, said: ‘This work shows that it's possible for science to study religious belief.’ ‘At the same time, it helps us understand some universal aspects of human cognition and the structure of the mind.’ Most studies into the possibility of an afterlife have found that both children and adults commonly believe that bodily needs such as hunger end when people die and emotions continue in some form, but they do not question where such beliefs come from. Professor Emmons showed children drawings of a baby, a young woman, and the same woman while pregnant, (pictured) then asked a series of questions about the child's abilities, thoughts and emotions during each period . Researchers have long suspected that people develop ideas about the afterlife through cultural exposure or religious instruction, but Professor Emmons said ideas of immortality emerge from our intuition. She interviewed children from an indigenous Shuar village in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador, which she chose because they have no cultural pre-life beliefs and she suspected that children who have regular exposure to birth and death through hunting and farming, would have a more rational, biologically-based view of the time before they were conceived. For comparison, she also interviewed Roman Catholic children from an urban area near Quito, Ecuador, who have been taught that life begins only at conception. If cultural influences were fundamental to the belief in immortality, both urban and indigenous children should reject the idea of life before birth, she reasoned. Professor Emmons showed the children drawings of a baby, a young woman, and the same woman while pregnant, then asked a series of questions about the child's abilities, thoughts and emotions during each period. The results were surprising as both groups gave remarkably similar answers. The children reasoned that their bodies didn't exist before birth and that they didn't have the ability to think or remember. Children who took part in the study from two distinct cultures in Ecuador reasoned that their bodies didn't exist before birth and that they didn't have the ability to think or remember. However, both groups said that their emotions and desires existed before they were born (illustrated) However, both groups also said that their emotions and desires existed before they were born. While the children generally reported that they didn't have eyes and couldn't see things before birth, they often reported being happy that they would soon meet their mother, or sad that they were apart from their family. ‘Even kids who had biological knowledge about reproduction still seemed to think that they had existed in some sort of eternal form and that form really seemed to be about emotions and desires,’ said Professor Emmons. She thinks that this human trait might be a by-product of our highly developed social reasoning as humans tend to see others as the sum of their mental states – and desires and emotions are particularly helpful when predicting behaviour. Because this ability is so useful, it flows over into other parts of our thinking and humans sometimes see connections where potentially none exist, she explained. This idea of the soul surviving outside the body, while non-scientific, is natural and deep-seated. ‘I study these things for a living but even find myself defaulting to them. I know that my mind is a product of my brain but I still like to think of myself as something independent of my body,’ she said.","Researchers from Boston University examined children’s ideas about the time before conception .

Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, has recalled donkey meat sold at some outlets in China after tests showed the product contained the DNA of other animals, the U.S. company said. Wal-Mart will reimburse customers who bought the tainted 'Five Spice' donkey meat and is helping local food and industry agencies in eastern Shandong province investigate its Chinese supplier, it said late on Wednesday in official posts on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The Shandong Food and Drug Administration earlier said the product contained fox meat. The scandal could dent Wal-Mart's reputation for quality in China's $1 trillion food and grocery market where it plans to open 110 new stores in the next few years. China is the largest grocery market in the world and is set to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2016, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution. Employees stand in front of the gate to a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Chongqing municipality two weeks after being shut down by local authorities for violating food and product standards . Customers choose pieces of meat at a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Chongqing municipality . 'This is another hit on Wal-Mart's brand, meaning wealthy shoppers will start to lose the trust they had before,' said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research (CMR) Group. CMR estimates Wal-Mart's market share fell from 7.5 percent to 5.2 percent over the last three years. Donkey meat is a popular snack in some areas of China, although it only accounts for a tiny fraction of overall meat consumption. In 2011 China slaughtered 2.4 million donkeys, according to country's livestock industry yearbook. Wal-Mart, French grocer Carrefour SA, McDonald's Corp and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc among others, have come under fire before in China over food safety issues, a sensitive topic in a country riddled with scares from a fatal tainted milk scandal to recycled ""gutter oil"" used for cooking.Wal-Mart said it had set up an investigation team to look into the incident, would strengthen food safety rules and take legal action against the product supplier. It added the person in charge at the supplier factory had already been detained.'We are deeply sorry for this whole affair,' said Wal-Mart's China president and CEO, Greg Foran. 'It is a deep lesson (for us) that we need to continue to increase investment in supplier management.' Donkey meat is a popular snack in some parts of China while fox meat is not . Walmart is also a major shopping center in the United States . The U.S. retailer has had a troubled past in China. In 2011, China fined Wal-Mart, along with Carrefour, a combined 9.5 million yuan ($1.57 million) for manipulating product prices. Wal-Mart was also fined that year in China for selling duck meat past its expiry date. Food safety scandals can have a significant impact in China. Yum has struggled to recover sales in China more than a year after a chicken supplier to KFC in the country was found to have used excess levels of antibiotics. Analysts, though, said the impact of the current scare would be far more subdued. Wal-Mart, which operates more than 400 facilities in China, competes with market leaders Sun Art Retail Group Ltd and China Resources Enterprise Ltd, which in August teamed up with British retailer Tesco Plc.Consumers on popular microblogging site Sina Weibo were at a loss whether to criticize Wal-Mart or support it. Online sentiment can spread quickly in China where there is a high proportion of social media users.

A 19-year-old up-and-coming kicker from Oregon's Williamette University has become the first active college football player to come out as gay. Conner Mertens, a redshirt freshman kicker at Division III Willamette announced Tuesday that he's bisexual at a news conference on Tuesday. Mertens announced his sexual orientation to his teammates during a meeting on Monday. 'It got to a point where I just got tired . of it, trying to hide who I was and trying to pretend I was something I . was not,' he said. Brave decision: Willamette University football player Conner Mertens holds a press conference announcing he came out as bisexual to his team . He approached his coach Glen Fowles after requesting a meeting. Fowles was fearful the talented player would announce he was transferring to another college. Instead, he asked Fowles if he believes Merten is a good kicker. Fowles said yes. 'He then asked if his role on the team would be affected by things he did off the field, or if he’d be judged by his performance. All that mattered to Fowles was whether he could kick that ball through those two goal posts. That was reassuring, Mertens said, because he had something very personal to share with his coach,' reports Outsports.com. 'I’m bisexual,' Mertens told Fowles. 'I like dudes. I have a boyfriend. And next week, I’m going to tell the world.' Support: Conner Mertens (second left) is flanked by defensive captain Jack Nelson (left) coach Glen Fowles, (center) and others from his team . Ending stigma: Mertens announced Tuesday that he is bisexual, saying he was tired of pretending he was something he wasn't and that he also wants to help dispel the stereotypes and stigmas associated with bisexual athletes . Speaking on campus later Tuesday afternoon, Mertens said he hopes his announcement helps dispel the stereotypes and stigmas associated with bisexual athletes - and in turn let other LGBT athletes know they are not alone. 'You can be real and you can be yourself,' Mertens said. 'That only starts when you can love yourself and let others love you. That's kind of where I was going with this.' Bearcats coach Glen Fowles said the players were overwhelmingly supportive of his decision. 'It's been great to see the way our guys have rallied around,' Fowles said. 'For our guys, Conner is just a kicker.' Team captain and junior inside linebacker Jack Nelson said: 'It wasn't a big deal and we were glad he felt comfortable to tell us.' Response: 'Death threats and people telling me to kill myself? Dang...guess I'm doing something right,' tweeted Mertens Wednesday . While several LGBT athletes have come out, including former NBA player Jason Collins, WNBA star Brittney Griner and Major League Soccer player Robbie Rogers, it's believed that Mertens is the first active college football player at any level to publicly announce his bisexuality. Willamette issued a statement supporting Mertens' decision, saying the university 'respects his contribution to a more humane and just world.' Fowles joked about how Mertens first approached him: 'He says, ""Coach, I'm really going to utilize this open door policy.""' Mertens, who told his family just after Christmas, said he was humbled by the response. 'They thought I got a speeding ticket,' Mertens said reports Outsports.com. 'They were originally pretty shocked but have since showed me so much love and support.' Truth: The popular player dated girls throughout high school, keeping his attracting to other men hidden until now . 'It sounds corny, but I legitimately feel there's a weight off my shoulders. It's tiring to pretend your something else for 24-seven, for 18 or 19 years of your life,' he said. 'So finally to be able to joke about it, to be honest about it, not have to put on this mask, I'm finally able to take a deep breath.' The Bearcats play in the Northwest Conference. The team went 7-2 overall last season and finished third in the league at 4-2. Mertens did not play his freshman season because he hurt his left knee while playing soccer. He will compete with two other kickers on the Bearcats' roster. The response to Mertens' revelation has been overwhelmingly positive, but predicably, detractors and internet trolls have contributed their opinions. Grace: Mertens has responded to detractors with kindness and forgiveness, despite the vitriol directed at him . 'Westboro Baptist Church will picket @willamette_u next time we’re in the area. You’re going to hell, Merts! #RepentOrPerish,' tweeted the notoriously bigoted Westboro Baptist Church. Mertens responded with grace, tweeting, 'I'm sorry to hear you feel that way. Wish you all the best. God is love my friends.' Mertens, who comes from the conservative town of Kennewick, Washington, aims to help others struggling with the same issue. On Monday evening, he tweeted a letter he wrote to his hometown. An excerpt reads: . 'Throughout my life, I have been told who I can and cannot be. A few months ago I realized that I am only limited as a person by the limitations I have placed on myself. That being said, it is important to me to tell you all that I, Conner Mertens, am bisexual.

Our teenage years are among the most awkward and self-conscious of our lives, and now scientists may have discovered why. Researchers from Harvard used MRI scans to establish that feelings of embarrassment, awkwardness, and self-awareness are linked to a specific brain response that develops, and peaks, during adolescence. This region directly connects to the part of the brain that influences actions and behaviours, and could also explain why teenagers are so strongly influenced by peer pressure. Researchers from Harvard used MRI scans to establish that feelings of embarrassment, awkwardness, and self-awareness are linked to a specific brain response that develops, and peaks, during adolescence, stock image of teenagers pictured. This explains why adolescent years can be so difficult . Teenagers are more likely to take risks and are naturally inclined to heightened aggression, casual sex and binge-drinking, according to an American study. The report, carried out by psychologist Laurence Steinberg, of Temple University in Philadelphia, supports other research which describes adolescent behaviour as a way for teenagers to cope in a harsh environment. Professor Steinberg: 'Heightened risk-taking during adolescence is likely to be normal, biologically-driven, and, to some extent, inevitable. There is probably very little we can or ought to do.' The researchers made the discovery while studying the affect social evaluation has on brain activity and emotions. Social evaluation is the process of evaluating people based on how they look, act and so on, and being aware of how others evaluate you. Researchers claim that regions of the brain that develop later in life, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), could play a unique role in the way teens, in particular, monitor this type of social evaluation. Specifically, the researchers wanted to discover whether something as simple as being watched, or looked at, played a role in social evaluation among young people. They were also particularly interested to see how the MPFC area of the brain in adolescents connected to the striatum - an area of the brain involved with controlling behaviours and action. The study involved 69 participants, ranging in age from eight to almost 22 years old. Each participant was asked to complete tests that gauged emotional, physiological, and neural responses to social evaluation. The brain region that affects these emotions directly connects to the part of the brain that influences actions and behaviours. Researchers claim this could also explain why teenagers are influenced by peer pressure and rely so heavily on social evaluation and approval from their friends, stock image of teenagers pictured . Researchers told the participants they would be testing a new video camera embedded in to the head coil of a functional MRI scanner, however the camera wasn’t real. The participants watched a screen that told them whether the camera was on, off, or warming up.

They were also told that a same-sex peer of approximately the same age would be watching them via a video feed. The MRI scans revealed that when adolescents thought they were being watched, there was an increase in activity between the MPFC and striatum. Adolescents also reported a heightened state of embarrassment and physiological arousal when asked to self-evaluate how the experiment made them feel. Leah Somerville, lead researcher and assistant professor of psychology at the university, said: ‘Our study identifies adolescence as a unique period of the lifespan in which self-conscious emotion, physiological reactivity, and activity in specific brain areas converge and peak in response to being evaluated by others. ‘We were concerned about whether simply being looked at was a strong enough ‘social evaluation’ to evoke emotional, physiological and neural responses. ‘Our findings suggest that being watched, and to some extent anticipating being watched, were sufficient to elicit self-conscious emotional responses at each level of measurement.’ The findings were published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. Professor Somerville and colleagues speculated that the MPFC-striatum pathway may be a route by which social evaluative contexts influence behaviour. The link may provide an initial clue as to why teenagers often engage in riskier behaviours when they’re with their peers.","Researchers assessed the impact social evaluation has on the brain .

Ranea Crabtree Wants To Legally Change Name To 'Sexy' or to her second choice, 'Sparkle' Crabtree plans to go before Judge Robert Hoover in Licking County Probate Court and pay the $87 fee to change her name. She says of her birth name: 'I absolutely hate it.' 'I think it's really ugly, ' she continued. She added:'I wear Victoria's Secret clothes all the time. I was like, Shoot, I'll just go for Sexy.' According to the Columbus Dispatch newspaper, Crabtree could face some opposition from the judge. He once denied a man's request to change his name to Tasmanian Devil, but did allow the first name Taz. He also denied the request of a young woman who wanted to be known as Winnie Pooh. Last year, he allowed a woman to change her last name to StoneKeepTalkingTree. Judge Robert Hoover will turn down name changes if he feels as though people are mentally unsound . Five years ago he denied the request of a woman who rode a horse to the courthouse and walked in wearing a bathrobe. She said something about conducting the Last Supper and poisoning her husband afterward. She wanted to be known as Jesus Christ Lord & Savior. 'I denied that because I wasn't certain she was fully competent,' Hoover told the paper. Crabtree, who is from Pataskala, Ohio, refused to give the paper her age, said she hated her first name Shelia so much that she only used her middle name, Renea. She refers to the name as ugly and has been counting down the days until she can appear in the court to get it officially changed.

From doing the school run to cleaning up after the children, most parents simply don’t have time for spontaneous romance. So much so that six in ten of them say they have to pre-arrange those intimate moments between the sheets. A third only managed to have sex once a week, while a quarter of shattered parents do it once a month or less. A new survey by Netmums has revealed six in ten parents say they have to pre-arrange time to have sex with their partner. File picture . ‘Scheduled sex’ is one of the top parenting trends of this year, according to Netmums. A poll by the website found a third of British parents managed to make love only  once a week, while a quarter did it once a month or less. Netmums co-founder Siobhan Freegard  said: ‘Spontaneity is lovely when you have time for it, but people are realising that actually if you wait for the moment, it  will probably never come. 'The general  consensus is that it is worth making the effort even if you don’t feel like it.’ Top of the list of new parenting trends is ‘cake-smashing’, in which mothers and fathers ditch photos of their newborns in favour of professional shots of the child tucking into his or her first birthday cake. Also featured were labour playlists, with 16 per cent of mothers-to-be taking their own tunes into the delivery room to help soothe the pain of childbirth. Tech-savvy mums are also sharing the . playlists online, with top relaxing tracks including 19 by Adele and . Beautiful Day by Elbow. With eight in ten mothers breastfeeding their child, there has also been a boom in wacky mementos – with some even having their milk solidified and made into a ring. On a more traditional note, the poll found three quarters of new mothers had been given jewellery by their partners, who shell out an average of £100 a time. For many parents doing the school run and cleaning up after the children gets in the way of intimate moments, putting a stop to spontaneous romance. File picture . As storms have battered Britain recently, cautious parents have gone back to the Seventies and prepared power cut kits (one in eight) filled with blankets, tea lights and torches, while a further one in ten have created a list of games if the telly cuts out. And with energy costs more than doubling over the last decade, a thrifty one in ten families now use candles to cut back on their bills. But while finances may be tight, a whopping 95 per cent of mums are going without clothes, make up or even food to make sure their little ones are taken care of. The pricey trend has led to an expansion in sales of children’s clothes, apps and days out dubbed the ‘KiddyConomy’, Netmums say. As technology advances, parents are actually ditching Facebook this year, with 62 per cent reducing the time they spend on the social networking site and seven per cent logged off completely. Another trend for the new year is extreme tutoring, with parents heaping more pressure on their kids to study as competition for the top state school places rises. Half of parents have considered private tuition and 15 per cent are already paying for it, while shockingly 16 per cent get their kids tutoured before they even begin school. Round up the top ten trends is sibling birthday gifts, where more than a quarter of mums splash out on presents for the whole family on a child’s special day to stop everyone feeling left out - and to teach kids not every event is about them. Ms Freegard said: 'Every family wants the best for their child - but there are very different views on what this means and how to achieve it. 'As this year’s top parenting trends show, mums and dads are doing their best to give their kids a great childhood despite a lack of time and money.'","Poll by Netmums shows six in ten say they have to pre-arrange intimacy .

Ellen and Jonathan Mather have two children thanks to IVF treatment, but having children nearly cost Mrs Mather her life. Mrs Mather had two rounds of IVF in 2008 the first of which failed and the second resulted in an ectopic pregnancy. Ellen and Jonathan Mather endured six rounds of IVF to have their two daughters - Katie (right) and Emily (left) She had to have her fallopian tubes removed following the ectopic pregnancy. In 2009 Mrs Mather, from Barrow in Cumbria, conceived again after more IVF but the pregnancy proved difficult. Despite having had her fallopian tubes removed, Mrs Mather was convinced she was suffering a second ectopic pregnancy. ‘I asked “what’s the chance of it happening again?”’ said Mr Mather, 31, a support worker. ‘We were told there was more chance of winning the lottery three times in a week.’ Mrs Mather, 33, was pregnant with twins but unbeknown to medical staff, one of the embryos was growing in the scar tissue of one of the removed fallopian tubes. Before Katie was conceived, Mrs Mather had a failed cycle of IVF and another that resulted in an ectopic pregnancy - this meant she had to have her fallopian tubes removed . ‘Deep down I knew I was having an ectopic pregnancy,’ said Mrs Mather. It is known that the chance of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly higher after IVF treatment than after a natural conception. She was admitted to A&E when she was nine weeks pregnant and started to suffer intense pain. An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. This means the egg will not develop into a baby. Most women suffering an ectopic pregnancy start to show symptoms between week five and week 14 of the pregnancy. These symptoms can include abnormal bleeding and abdominal pain. If the ectopic pregnancy is detected at an early stage, the pregnancy can be terminated using medication. If it is detected at a more advanced stage, surgery may be required to remove the egg. Without treatment, there is a risk that the egg could continue to grow and cause the fallopian tube to rupture. This can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. Signs of a ruptured fallopian tube are a sudden pain, feeling faint, feeling or being sick and shoulder pain. About one in 90 pregnancies in the UK are ectopic pregnancies. Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Mather was bleeding internally and by the time she reached theatre she was dangerously ill, despite having received blood transfusions. She said: ‘At that time I was given a one in 50,000 chance of being alive.’ She was in theatre for five hours, with Mr Mather facing the agonising prospect of losing his wife and unborn children. ‘When they opened her up they could see the membrane with Katie inside and they were going to take everything out,’ recalled Mr Mather. ‘[The consultant] said he wouldn’t have given a million to one chance of the baby surviving, let alone Ellen. He didn’t tell us about that until much further along when we found out we were having a girl.’ Instead of removing the womb in theatre, the consultant, Mr Vincent Bambigboye, managed to save both Mrs Mather and one of the twins, Katie – he had to remove the one who was growing outside the womb. ‘The consultant said he had never seen anything like it in his whole career,’ said Mr Mather. Baby Katie, the surviving twin, was born prematurely at 35 weeks by Caesarean section. She arrived on January 19, 2010, weighing 6lbs 1oz. But Mrs Mather’s hopes for her family didn’t end there. When Katie was two the couple started IVF treatment again in the hope of having a second child. They had two failed attempts before Mrs Mather became pregnant with their second daughter, Emily. Mrs Mather was carefully monitored throughout her pregnancy again under the care of Mr Bambigboye. The . pregnancy went well until 37 weeks when Mrs Mather developed . pre-eclampsia and Emily was born by emergency Caesarean on March 8, . 2013. Katie was one of twins but her twin developed outside the womb and caused Mrs Mather to suffer internal bleeding. As a result, the twin had to be removed to save Mrs Mather and Katie . ‘It’s all been worth it,’ said Mrs Mather. ‘It was tough at the time. Jonathan took some persuading after the second time round but he did say that if it wasn’t for me we wouldn’t have Emily. I’ve got a few nice scars but a couple of trophies to go with it.’ The couple are indebted to Mr Bambigboye and the staff at Furness General Hospital. Mr Bambigboye said: ‘I only played a small role so it is the hard work and dedication of all the nurses, doctors, midwives, and others that led to such a positive outcome for Ellen and her family. ‘On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I’d like to thank Ellen for her kind words, and wish her, Katie, and the rest of the family, all the very best for the future.’","Ellen Mather's first cycle of IVF failed and the second one resulted in an ectopic pregnancy - Mrs Mather had to have her fallopian tubes removed .

Scrawl: Lucian Freud's letter to a girl doing . her A-levels reveals that the revered artist did not take as much . care over his calligraphy as his portraiture . His prowess with the paintbrush helped him become one of the world’s most revered artists. But it appears that Lucian Freud didn’t possess quite the same talent when it came to the pen. The . celebrated painter, who died in 2011 at the age of 88, had surprisingly . childlike handwriting – revealed in a letter he wrote to a young art . student almost two decades ago. The . note was sent to Katie Wilson in 1996 when he was 73, in response to a . letter she wrote asking for help with her A-level art project about the . life of the celebrated painter. She contacted Freud, who is most well known for his nude portraits, to ask why he was so fascinated by the human figure. He replied in scrawled writing: ‘So you’re studying Painting and Dancing – I think they are the two best subjects. ‘You ask why I’m fascinated by the human figure? As a human animal I am interested in some of my fellow animals, in their minds and bodies. I never think about my style but just try and make the pictures look believable. Lucian Freud.’ Miss Wilson, who is now in her thirties, is selling the letter at auction house Bonhams on March 19. News of the sale has been greeted with excitement by experts, as Freud rarely talked about his work publicly or gave interviews. It is believed the letter, still mounted in the 21-page school art project, will fetch around £3,000. Claire Wilkins from Bonhams’ book department, which is handling the sale, said: ‘As a succinct statement of Freud’s artistic aims this could hardly be bettered. By 1996 Freud had attained international fame as a modern master - a status he never lost - and yet found the time to send a very personal and considered reply to an unknown student.’ Graphologist Barbara Weaver, who is a handwriting analyst at the Cambridge School of Graphology, said that Freud’s disconnected writing was evidence of a man who was patient in his work, but who ‘put two fingers up to the establishment’. She said: ‘The writing appears childish and immature. It could almost pass for the writing of a child of seven or eight, a novice in handwriting rather than belonging to an acclaimed artist. ‘Freud uses displaced capitals where they do not belong (for instance beLievabLe). This generally indicates a writer who is not one to follow the usual or the traditional. He is someone who wants to make his own way in the world without much input from outside sources. ‘His lowercase letters such as ‘a’ and ‘d’ are made in two separate movements. The circle is separated from the downstroke. He was a law unto himself and put two fingers up to the establishment. ‘His signature is legible and bears his complete name. He is comfortable with himself. ‘However, it is quite modest in size – it reveals his public face. It shows he was more comfortable working on his own. Since his signature sags somewhat, he may have been tiring of the effort involved in being who he was. ‘His writing is disconnected. The address, note and signature are written in printscript. The speed is slow and this means he was patient and painstaking in his work. ‘Margins can act as a visible or invisible border demarcating the amount of space the writer perceives he occupies in real life. Freud fills the page with his writing – he wants to be centre stage. ‘The size of the number 3 for instance in the address is larger than the neighbouring capitals. This suggests a preoccupation at the time with monetary matters.’ A recent biography of the artist . suggested he loved cash, often keeping wads inside wine coolers at his . home, while he was also frequently owed gambling debts. Dear Kate: Handwriting analyst  Barbara Weaver, . of the Cambridge School of Graphology, said Freud's writing . was evidence of a man who was patient in his work, but who 'put two . fingers up to the establishment' Freud, the grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, was widely regarded as the greatest painter of the human form during the late 20th and early 21st century. He is revered for his nudes and portraits and was hailed as the heir of Rembrandt and Hals. In 2007, he became Europe’s most expensive living artist when his full-length portrait of his friend Bruce Bernard sold for £7.86m. Less than six months later, a large double portrait of his daughter Isabel Boyt and her husband, fetched over £9m. And in 2008 Freud’s 1995 painting, Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, a portrait of his model ‘Big Sue’ Tilley, set another record for a living artist when it was sold for over £17m to Roman Abramovich. He is almost as well-known for his turbulent love-life as he is for his artwork. The Greek sculptor Vassilakis Takis, who knew him well, estimated that Lucian had up to 500 lovers and he was known to have fathered at least 14 children during his life. Three daughters were born in the same year, while two were given the same name. His marriage to Kathleen Garman lasted four years and the pair divorced in 1952. They had two daughters together, Annie and Annabel. His second marriage, to Caroline Blackwood in 1953, ended in 1957. He never married again, but Freud went on to have numerous love affairs, including with Suzy Boyt, a former student of his at the Slade art school in London, who was the subject of his painting Woman Smiling. Suzy gave birth to a son, Alexander, in 1957, followed by four more children, novelist Rose Boyt, Isobel, author Susie Boyt and Kai. He also had fathered fashion designer Bella Freud, 52, and novelist Esther Freud, 50, by the writer and gardener Bernardine Coverley, and a son, Frank, now aged 28, with the painter Celia Paul. Benefits Supervisor Sleeping: In 2008 Freud's 1995 painting, a portrait of his model 'Big Sue' Tilley, set another fresh sales record for a living artist when it was sold for over £17m to Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich . In 2001, at the age of 79, Freud set up house with Emily Bearn, a young journalist 52 years his junior. He also struck up an unlikely friendship with model Kate Moss, which blossomed after he painted an almost life-size nude of her while she was pregnant with her daughter, Lila Grace, in 2003. In a biography of the artist, Geordie Greig described Freud as ‘an odd mix of vanity with a touch of the vagrant’, a man who ‘had a sense of his own destiny,’ with a towering ambition to be an artist’.","Note was sent to A-level student Katie Wilson in 1996 .

Changes: While she was once derided for her glamorous looks, it is clear from the no-nonsense haircut and glasses that Knox is trying to adapt to being back to a low-key life in Seattle . The new hairstyle comes in clear contrast to the hairstyle she has had for the past six years when the world was first introduced to her following the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher, who she lived with while studying abroad in Perugia, Italy in 2007. Her hair used to fall past her shoulder, but when she walked out of the downtown branch of Gene Juarez salons on Wednesday, her hair was up to six inches shorter. Haircuts at the salon, which boasts of being 'a slice of heaven', start at $50 and prices range depending on the experience level of the stylist. The salon is not far from Knox's apartment in the International District of the city, but she may need some time to adjust to the new look as she quickly put on a hat once she left the salon. Some getting used to: Knox quickly covered up with a knit cap though it did not appear to be for warmth as she kept her brown leather coat open and chest bare without a scarf . Dressed casually in faded jeans, blue clogs a striped sweater and brown leather jacket, it was clear that Knox was trying to blend into her new low-key life in Seattle. 'Face of an angel': Amanda looked very different in 2008 when her trial first gained an international audience . She looked like ever-the-student, wearing glasses and toting a large bag, that could have been headed to do work for her University of Washington classes that she enrolled in after returning to the U.S. in the spring of last year. It has been a tense few weeks for Knox and she will surely be waiting on pins and needles until the verdict is handed down later this week about the latest round of appeals that the Kercher trial has gone through. Whatever is decided this week, the protracted legal battle that has grabbed global headlines and polarized trial-watchers in three nations probably won't end in Florence. The first two trials produced flip-flop verdicts of guilty then innocent for Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, and the case has produced harshly clashing versions of events. A Florence appeals panel designated by Italy's supreme court to address issues it raised about the acquittal is set to deliberate Thursday, with a verdict expected later in the day. Much of the attention has focused on Knox, 26, who has remained in Seattle during this trial, citing her fear of 'the universal problem of wrongful conviction,' according to her statement emailed to the Florence court. Her representatives say she is concentrating on her studies at the University of Washington. Return: Knox returned to the U.S. in March 2013 after her verdict was overturned, and now she may be sentenced again if the Italian court finds her guilty in the latest appeals case going on now .

'But history being our guide, we know Amanda can be convicted and it is very disconcerting to her and her family. The logical position is that there is no evidence.' Knox was arrested four days after Kercher's half-naked body was discovered November 2, 2007 in the Briton's bedroom in the university town of Perugia. Knox has been portrayed both as a she-devil bent on sexual adventure and as a naif caught up in Italy's Byzantine justice system.","Knox, 26, was photographed leaving a hair salon in Seattle on Wednesday .

Mowing the lawn can be tedious, but that could change if an eco-friendly prototype robot is widely adopted. U.S. students have created an autonomous machine that not only cuts grass in a specified area, but uses the waste cuttings to power itself – saving you both time and money. The E-Mow is built upon the body of an electric toy car, but the clever vehicle is able to convert grass pellets into fuel, using a small biomass gasifier - a type of furnace that converts organic matter into gas. Is this the future of gardening?  U.S. students have created a prototype autonomous machine (pictured) that not only cuts grass in a specified area, but uses the waste cuttings to power itself - potentially saving gardeners both time and money . Engineers from George Mason University, Washington D.C. believe their invention could revolutionise the garden chore and more importantly be used as an efficient way to create animal feed. The machine trims grass using a low-power electrical bar cutter, unlike many mowers that use a rotating blade. This allows the mower to operate without the need to maintain the kinetic energy required in a rotary blade system. It then collects the grass snippets, which are funnelled into an area where they are turned into dry grass pellets in a manner similar to a meat grinder except that higher pressures and temperatures are used, the engineers explained.

The machine trims grass using a low-power electrical bar cutter (pictured) unlike many mowers that use a rotating blade . The dry squashed cuttings then pass into a collection bin where they are dried with hot air from the gasifier and are then converted into fuel gas in the gasifier itself. This biomass fuel is then cooled, filtered and mixed with air so that it can be used to power the robotic lawnmower’s engine. The grass pellets pass into a small gasifier (illustrated) where they are converted to gas and the resulting fuel is cooled, filtered and mixed with air . The dried pellets can also be used for other applications, such as livestock fodder and can be periodically off-loaded to a storage unit. 'The drone harvester processes biomass directly to product form in a single pass without human labour,' said Jason Force, Chief Design Engineer of the project. He explained that conventional methods for deriving biomass pellets from grassy sources areinefficient. Multiple passes are required to harvest and raw biomass must then be trucked to a facility to process into products, but the new invention does all this in one step, he explained. Users of the lawnmower will not have to push it around their garden, as the useful robot is autonomous thanks to onboard GPS and proximity sensors. In the future they will be able to program the machine by selecting an area to mow using Google Maps – and tell the mower to avoid certain obstacles so flowerbeds are not cut down too. The machine will also use its GPS system to watch out for roads and other boundaries, as well as to navigate itself efficiently around a garden. Mr Force and his team are currently looking to raise investment to bring their lawnmower to market and there is no price for the machine yet. 'We will be designing and operating or own harvesting platforms to produce a range of pellet biomass products. Primary target markets are pellet fuel and livestock fodder. 'Future plans include both commercial and consumer turf-mowing units for sale and licensing pellet fuel system technology for uses in vehicles, heating, and plant power,' he said. Mr Force also said that E-Mow harvesters 'represent a revolutionary micro-grid solution in developing countries.' 'We plan to use this technology to provide a breakthrough in producing pelletised biomass products,' he added. The team plans on having a working fuel reactor integrated with an engine in order to demonstrate a complete fuel system by March.

A man who claims to have captured and killed Bigfoot after luring it with pork ribs now says he is planning to take the corpse on an international tour. Rick Dyer, who describes himself as 'best Bigfoot tracker in the world' and claims to have shot the beast near San Antonio in Texas in September 2012, says the world tour will begin on February 6 in Flagstaff, Arizona, with further locations to be revealed over the coming weeks. Although he also released a second photograph supposedly showing the dead Bigfoot, there is a great deal of scepticism over their authenticity, not least because Dyer was previously involved in a Bigfoot hoax in 2008 when a 'corpse' he put on public display turned out to be a rubber suit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On display: Rick Dyer released this new image, supposedly showing the Bigfoot he killed lying dead on the floor of his tent. He now plans to take the corpse on an international tour . Body of the beast: Rick Dyer claims that this is a photo of legendary creature Bigfoot, which he shot near San Antonio and now plans to take on tour . Mr Dyer claims that he lured the beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from Walmart to a tree in San Antonio, Texas in September 2012. He initially released a grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature's face, but has now released a second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent. Speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill, 36-year-old Dyer told New York Daily News that he doesn't regret his 2008 hoax, as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full-time Bigfoot operations ever since. He claims that without the previous publicity stunt, he would never have been able to 'really' capture a Bigfoot. Speaking of killing the animal, he said: 'I nailed... pork ribs from the Walmart down the street to the side of the tree, and lo and behold, he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree.' Mr Dyer claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal before going to get his gun and 'with tears in my eyes' shooting it dead. On the Bigfoot trail: Rick Dyer says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at Walmart to a tree. While the creature was eating, Mr Dyer allegedly shot it . The excitement surrounding Mr Dyer's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax back in 2008. Back then, as now, he claimed he had the body of Bigfoot. But The National Geographic reported that, once the frozen body began to thaw, the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit. This time Mr Dyer is adamant that his Bigfoot is 'for real'. He said: 'From DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world.' Mr Dyer has yet to produce the results of the DNA tests and optical scans, but he says he will be holding a press conference soon to answer any questions. Bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world, but physical evidence - such as a partial or complete body of the creature - has so far proven elusive. Video by Rick Dyer .

Researchers have created the ultimate beer taster - a robot tongue so sensitive it can distinguish between different varieties and even check alcohol content. The Spanish team say their 'robo-tongue' is the first to be able to spot its favourite tipple - and could find a job in the quality control areas of brewers. The team used 21 sensors in their robo-tongue, and trained it to distinguish between Schwarzbier, lager, double malt, Pilsen, Alsatian and low-alcohol. The end of the bad pint: The robo-tongue can tell if a pint tastes as it should, and has the right alcohol content . Some scientists claim beer - not bread - is the reason early man adopted a society based on farming around 10,000 years ago, a key moment in our evolution. The cultivation of grain saw the transition away from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and a widely-accepted theory is that the crops were used to bake bread, but experts claim it was the prospect of a brew that drove the desire to settle down and start a farm. Researchers say beer has a number of advantages beyond the intoxicating effects and taste, such as a high B vitamin content, the essential amino acid lysine and the fact it was safer to drink than water as the brewing process killed off bacteria and viruses. The discovery, published in the journal 'Food Chemistry', is accurate in almost 82% of cases. Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink in the world. Now, scientists at the Autonomous University of Barcelona have led a study which analysed several brands of beer by applying a new concept in analysis systems, known as an electronic tongue, the idea for which is based on the human sense of taste. 'The concept of the electronic tongue consists in using a generic array of sensors, in other words with generic response to the various chemical compounds involved, which generate a varied spectrum of information with advanced tools for processing, pattern recognition and even artificial neural networks,' said Manel del Valle, the main author of the study. The array of sensors was formed of 21 ion-selective electrodes, including some with response to cations (ammonium, sodium), others with response to anions (nitrate, chloride, etc.), as well as electrodes with generic (unspecified) response to the varieties considered. The electronic beer tester: Spanish researchers have managed to distinguish between different varieties of beer using an electronic tongue. The discovery, published in the journal 'Food Chemistry', is accurate in almost 82 percent of cases. The machine then 'learnt' to taste the different varieties. 'Using more powerful tools â€“ supervised learning â€“ and linear discriminant analysis did enable us to distinguish between the main categories of beer we studied: Schwarzbier, lager, double malt, Pilsen, Alsatian and low-alcohol,' Del Valle said. The study concluded that these tools could one day give robots a sense of taste, and even supplant panels of tasters in the food industry to improve the quality and reliability of products for consumption. The breakthrough is expected to be used by the brewing industry to supplement human beer tasters .","System uses 21 sensors to analyse different liquids .

The cuttlefish can change the colour and pattern of its skin to stay hidden from predators. And now U.S. scientists are looking to the fish’s camouflage mechanisms in order to develop futuristic uniforms for soldiers, which could help them to blend in with their surroundings in realtime. They have discovered new details about neural organs called chromatophores, which enable the ‘chameleon of the sea’ to virtually disappear. Scientists are looking to the cuttlefish's (pictured)camouflage mechanisms in order to develop futuristic uniforms for soldiers, which could help them to blend in with their surroundings as well as the cephalopod . Cuttlefish skin is unique for its dynamic patterning and speed of change. The cephalopod has neurally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues. To regulate its colour, the cuttlefish relies on a vertically arranged assembly of three optical components: the leucophore, which is a near-perfect light scatterer that reflects it uniformly over the entire visible spectrum, the iridophore, which is a reflector containing a stack of thin films and the chromatophore. This layering enables the skin of the animal to selectively absorb or reflect light of different colours. Chromatophores contain luminescent protein nanostructures that enable the cuttlefish to make quick and elaborate changes in its skin pigmentation. When the cuttlefish switches on its coloration system, each chromatophore expands. The surface area can change as much as 500 per cent. Scientists at Harvard University and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) believe their findings could also lead to new types of paint, cosmetics and consumer electronics – as well as smart uniforms for soldiers that can react to surroundings in realtime. ‘Nature solved the riddle of adaptive camouflage a long time ago,' Kevin Parker, Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) told the Harvard Gazette. ‘Now, the challenge is to reverse-engineer this system in a cost-efficient, synthetic system that is amenable to mass manufacturing.’ The cuttlefish has neurally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues, but scientists have had an incomplete understanding of the biological, chemical and optical functions that make this adaptive coloration possible.

Researchers are trying to reverse-engineer the cuttlefish's chromatophore system in a cost-efficient, synthetic system that is amenable to mass manufacturing so that it can be used as a new type of camouflage uniform for soldiers (stock image) This layering enables the skin of the animal to selectively absorb or reflect light of different colours, co-author Leila Deravi, a Research Associate in bioengineering at SEAS explained. ‘Chromatophores were previously considered to be pigmentary organs that acted simply as selective colour filters,’ she said. ‘But our results suggest that they play a more complex role - they contain luminescent protein nanostructures that enable the cuttlefish to make quick and elaborate changes in its skin pigmentation.’ When the cuttlefish switches on its coloration system, each chromatophore expands. The surface area can change as much as 500 per cent, the scientists explained in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. The team of researchers showed that within the chromatophore, tethered pigment granules regulate light through absorbance, reflection, and fluorescence - in effect functioning as tiny light-sensitive elements, even as the chromatophore changes in size. ‘The cuttlefish uses an ingenious approach to materials composition and structure - one that we have never employed in our engineered displays,’ said co-author Evelyn Hu, Tarr-Coyne Professor of Applied Physics and of Electrical Engineering at SEAS. ‘It is extremely challenging for us to replicate the mechanisms that the cuttlefish uses. The cuttlefish (pictured) has neutrally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues and blend in with its surroundings . ‘For example, we cannot yet engineer materials that have the elasticity to expand 500 times in surface area and were we able to do that, the richness of colour of the expanded and unexpanded material would be dramatically different. She explained: ‘The cuttlefish may have found a way to compensate for this change in richness of colour by being an ""active"" light emitter not simply modulating light through passive reflection.’ Scientists from the MBL have examined adaptive colouration in the cuttlefish and other invertebrates for many years. MBL's Roger Hanlon said: ‘Cuttlefish skin is unique for its dynamic patterning and speed of change.' ‘Deciphering the relative roles of pigments and reflectors in soft, flexible skin is a key step to translating the principles of actuation to materials science and engineering. ‘This collaborative project expanded our breadth of inquiry and uncovered several useful surprises, such as the tether system that connects the individual pigment granules.’ Professor Parker is an army reservist who completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan, so using the cuttlefish to find a biologically inspired design for new types of military camouflage carries special meaning for him as poor camouflage patterns can cost lives on the battlefield. ‘Throughout history, people have dreamed of having an invisible suit,’ he said. ‘Nature solved that problem and now it’s up to us to replicate this genius, so, like the cuttlefish, we can avoid our predators.’","Scientists at Harvard University and the Marine Biological Laboratory have discovered new details about the cuttlefish's neural organs .

Our solar system has an unruly past in which giant planets nearly wiped out the asteroid belt and turned it into cosmic ‘snow globe’. This is according to researchers in Massachusetts who claim that the solar system was once a riotous place in which Jupiter may have been as close to the sun as Mars is now. As the planet moved through the main asteroid belt, they believe it tossed interplanetary flotsam far and wide. In this artist's conception, Jupiter's migration through the solar system has swept asteroids out of stable orbits, sending them careening into one another. As the gas giant planets migrated, they stirred the contents of the solar system . The researchers noted that objects from as close to the sun as Mercury and as far out as Neptune all congregated in the asteroid belt at this time. ‘The asteroid belt is a melting pot of objects arriving from diverse locations and backgrounds,’ said Francesca DeMeo, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics. Astronomers have long recognised the asteroid belt’s diversity, but a new analysis of the asteroids within the belt has revealed that it is more diverse than previously thought. Astronomers have theorised that long-ago asteroid impacts delivered much of the water now filling Earth's oceans, as shown in this artist's conception. If true, the stirring provided by migrating planets may have been essential to bringing those asteroids . The asteroid belt is a region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where most of the asteroids in our solar system are found. Traditionally, . asteroids were viewed as the pieces of a failed planet that was . prevented from forming by the influence of Jupiter's powerful gravity. The asteroids in the belt come in a variety of sizes. Some are very small (less than a mile across), while others are quite large. The largest asteroid is called Ceres. It is about one-quarter the size of our moon. It is a dwarf planet. Most asteroids in the Asteroid Belt have an orbital period of about three to six Earth years. The findings have interesting implications for the history of Earth. Astronomers have theorised that long-ago asteroid impacts delivered much of the water now filling Earth's oceans. If true, the stirring provided by migrating planets may have been essential to bringing those asteroids. Traditionally, asteroids were viewed as the pieces of a failed planet that was prevented from forming by the influence of Jupiter's powerful gravity. Their compositions seemed to vary methodically from drier to wetter, due to the drop in temperature as you move away from the sun. That traditional view changed as astronomers recognised that the current residents of the main asteroid belt weren't all there from the start. In the early history of our solar system the giant planets ran amok, migrating inward and outward substantially. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Dr DeMeo and co-author Benoit Carry examined the compositions of thousands of asteroids within the main belt. Their findings raises a number of questions. For instance, will other Earth-like exoplanet require a similar pattern of asteroids fall-out to make it habitable? If so, then Earth-like planets may be rarer than first thought.","Researchers say Jupiter may have been as close to the sun as Mars is now .

Soaring above a weight of history, the Dambusters squadron has flown its final mission before being disbanded for only the third time in its existence. The RAF set up 617 Squadron in 1943 for only one purpose - to carry out Operation Chastise, breaching dams near German factories in the dead of night by using experimental 'bouncing bombs'. But 71 years, five new fleets of planes and thousands of missions later, the squadron is still at the forefront of British military operations. Historic: Jets from the famous 617 Squadron fly from Khandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, for the final time before it is disbanded for only the third time in its history . Sunset on an era: Wing Commander David Athurton, 617's current leader, told British Forces News: 'There's a degree of sadness. It's quite a poignant time' Saying farewell: Squadron Leader Mark Jackson carries out pre-flight checks before his final flight aboard the aircraft in Afghanistan. They will soon return to Scotland . Based at RAF Lossiemouth near Inverness, Scotland, the squadron is about to receive its sixth new fleet of planes, replacing its aging Tornado GR4s with the Lightning II stealth fighter which is due to be introduced in 2016. Until then 617 Squadron will be no more. Yesterday crew members took their last flight aboard 617's current fleet - from Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan. The air force's most famous squadron took over aerial reconnaissance there in November and has flown more than 400 missions. Now its crew members will disperse to join other squadrons or become flight instructors. Wing Commander David Athurton told British Forces News: 'There's a degree of sadness; it's quite a poignant time. 'I'm glad we're able to draw this chapter of this squadron's history to a close on operations. I think that's fitting.' Despite the very modern nature of the . task in hand, the crew could not forget their past - the image of water . pouring from a broken dam is inscribed on their badge. Weight of history: It is hard for the crew to forget the significance of their squadron number. The image of a burst dam is inscribed on their badges . In their footsteps: From left, crew members Flt Lt James Mander, Flt Lt Alex Lock, Wg Cdr David Arthurton, Flt Lt Chris Harding and Sqn Ldr Mark Jackson . The Tornado jets will be returned to RAF Lossiemouth near Inverness, and 617 Squadron will reform in 2016 with a new fleet of Lightning II stealth fighters . Pride: 617 Squadron now uses Tornado jets (left), a leap in technology from the famous bouncing bombs designed by Barnes Wallis (right), who was later knighted . Born into battle at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, with just a few weeks' notice of its star mission, the unit has been through several transformations to keep up with the times. It began with Lancaster bombers and received Lincolns the year after the war ended. In 1952 defence chiefs provided Canberras, the first jet-powered light bomber to enter mass production in Britain. The Squadron then disbanded in 1955, re-entering service two and a half years later with a new fleet of Vulcans which lasted almost 30 years. In 1981 it disbanded again to replace the Vulcan bombers with a fleet of Tornado GR1 jets, which were later upgraded to GR4s. Although no mission would match the notoriety of the Dambusters, 617 Squadron saw service for many high-profile tasks. It made the first use of the RAF's cruise missile Storm Shadow during the invasion of Iraq in April 2003. Vital: The huge dams on the German River Ruhr protected industrial heartlands for the Nazi war effort. Breaching the dams in May 1943 was a crucial blow . Rushed: Dr Barnes Wallis (right) had very little time to test his bouncing bomb, which skimmed the surface of the water before impacting low on the dams. It was tested off the British coast in top secret conditions, so confidential that even Wing Commander Gibson was not told the full nature of his mission until shortly before . The Squadron was formed on March 21, 1943, with Wing Commander Guy Gibson tasked to recruit top fliers from other squadrons. For weeks not even he was told of the task - only that it was essential to be able to fly low over water. They trained by flying over the dams and reservoirs of Derbyshire while the bouncing bombs, designed by Barnes Wallis, were tested off the Kent coast. The crews were tasked with breaching four huge dams on the river Ruhr, the heart of German industry and crucial to the Nazi war effort. In just a few precious weeks, top-secret tests had shown the bomb had to be dropped at exactly 220mph, 60ft above the water in order to skim across the surface. Appeal: Part of 617 Squadron's fame can be put down to the 1955 blockbuster The Dam Busters, which immortalised the raid with the help of the polished glamour of the silver screen. Right, the squadron's badge depicting a breached dam with water pouring from it was approved by King George VI in 1944, and has remained ever since . Nineteen modified Lancaster bombers flew into enemy territory on the night of May 16, with Gibson deliberately using his own plane to draw away German aircraft while his team undertook their task. Eight of the aircraft and their crews were lost, and two of the four dams - Mohne and Eder - were breached. Upon their return, the crew were honoured for the danger they had faced, the short time they had to prepare and the audacity of what they had done.

A photograph of Castle Howard, the 18th-century stately home which was immortalised in the television adaptation of Brideshead Revisited, dominates the web site of the local Thirsk and Malton Conservative Association. Evelyn Waugh’s tale of middle-class Charles Ryder and the aristocratic Marchmain family is a classic of 20th-century literature. But today a real-life drama is being fought out in the shadow of the imposing mansion, and it has the potential to cause severe embarrassment to David Cameron. Battle: Anne McIntosh, left, could be ousted at the next election and replaced with Edward Legard, right . The sitting MP Anne McIntosh, 59, who has been fighting a year-long battle against deselection, will learn today whether she has seen off the local party bigwigs who want to get rid of her. If she loses, she will be the first female Tory MP in modern history to be sacked by her local party. McIntosh has one of the few safe Conservative seats in the north of England, with a majority of 11,000. She is also one of only three women Tory MPs in the North. But she has had to fight members of her own party to keep her seat on no fewer than three occasions. She survived her first deselection vote in 2006, as well as in 2009 and again in 2013. Now the 2013 ballot is being rerun and the outcome this time is far less certain. McIntosh’s supporters claim she is the target of dirty tricks from old-guard diehards in the constituency association, who resent having a woman as their MP. They say she was the victim of a vote-rigging row like the one in Falkirk in Scotland, which tore the Labour Party apart last year — when the Unite trade union was accused of boosting membership of the local Labour Party by paying people’s subscription without their knowledge, and using their votes to try to fix their own candidate’s victory. Life imitating art: The events are as dramatic as those of Brideshead Revisited, set at nearby Castle Howard . On the face of it, the McIntosh supporters have a point. A leaked report of an inquiry into the affair revealed that the Thirsk Conservative association flagrantly broke the rules when it tried to deselect her last January. Just before holding the vote, the association’s executive committee had taken on a significant number of new members — and it was these who ensured she was deselected. The stench of misogyny also engulfed the process when one unnamed local activist told the Yorkshire Post their MP was a ‘silly girl’ who should be replaced by London Mayor Boris Johnson or Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Long service: Anne McIntosh was elected in 1997 and is unafraid to criticise the government . The decision to force out McIntosh caused uproar. Her supporters demanded an inquiry by Conservative Central Office in London. Central Office set aside the vote and ordered that the executive committee should be reformed in accordance with the party’s rules. Now, the local association is trying once again to get rid of its MP. And her critics believe it will be third time lucky. Meanwhile, in a twist which could have come from the pen of Evelyn Waugh, a dashing former officer in the Light Dragoons called Edward Legard, an Old Etonian school chum of David Cameron, appears to be the choice of the party high command to replace Anne McIntosh. So what is the truth? Do McIntosh’s critics have a genuine grievance against their MP? Or is this truly the Conservative Party’s Falkirk, in which unscrupulous chauvinists of the old guard are determined to see off a female foe at any cost — with Cameron supporters eyeing the chance to replace her with one of their own? Whatever the case, there is no doubt that this episode has been deeply damaging to the Tories. A report by the party’s disciplinary committee warned that the situation in the ‘divided and fractious’ association had ‘spiralled out of control’ and was ‘potentially damaging to the party’. This time, all 560 members of the local party will vote on McIntosh’s future — as opposed to a cabal of just 30, which is what happened last January. And in a sign of the mutual distrust and loathing in the constituency, the ballot is being counted at Tory Party HQ in London, which will announce the result today. What has created the crisis, according to local sources, is that McIntosh is a woman with a strong personality who has a knack for telling it as it is — and rubbing people up the wrong way. Rebels: Anne McIntosh and David Davis, pictured, regularly speak against the party leadership in Westminster . None of her critics questions her work rate at Westminster, where she has missed fewer than 17 per cent of votes and spoken more than 100 times in the past 12 months — way above average. But with the ballot result too close to call, even friends concede McIntosh can be ‘awkward’ and ‘difficult’ — which explains why she faces an unprecedented third no-confidence vote since first being elected in 1997 to what was the Vale of York seat before it became Thirsk and Malton. Two former constituency agents in the Vale of York fell out with McIntosh. One of them, Diane Clarke, who is a now a regional director for the Tories, was said to have been reduced to tears more than once by the MP. With the ballot result too close to . call, even friends concede McIntosh can be ‘awkward’ and ‘difficult’ — . which explains why she faces an unprecedented third no-confidence vote . since first being elected in 1997 . Her enemies also claim she has fallen out with 11 of her 12 association chairmen in the two constituencies in which she has served — a statistic denied by her allies. And if Ms McIntosh wins, it will be without the backing of some of the party’s biggest hitters, including Chancellor George Osborne and Education Secretary Michael Gove. Such Cabinet heavyweights have come to the aid of the former minister Tim Yeo, 68, who is facing a similar challenge in his Suffolk South constituency. McIntosh’s supporters are in no doubt as to why there is a distinct lack of support from the Cabinet — although Foreign Secretary and neighbouring MP William Hague is a rare supporter. They believe the Tory high command is keen for the Prime Minister’s suave Eton chum Edward Legard to take over. Legard, 47, a barrister and judge, is heir to a baronetcy created in 1660. After Eton with Cameron,  he went to St Andrews University and then Sandhurst, followed by UN peace-keeping duties in Bosnia. A well-connected local councillor for ten years, he is married with three children and looks and sounds like a future Cabinet minister. It is all strikingly different from McIntosh who was born in Edinburgh, studied law at the city’s university, and worked in the EU before becoming an MEP in 1989. Happily married for 21 years to John Harvey, a business executive, she has  no children. The fallout has led the small town of Thirsk to be dubbed the Tory equivalent of Falkirk, Labour's scandal seat . Despite her 17 years as an MP, she has been overlooked for ministerial office. She is chairman of the Environment and Rural Affairs select committee and only this week was criticising the Government’s handling of flooding in the West Country. Legard, who lives in the constituency, insists he has not made any move against Ms McIntosh. Yet his name appeared — mistakenly, he says — on an email from two of her leading opponents attacking her record as an MP, which went to every member of the association. ‘It’s no secret I’m on the candidates list, but I don’t know what action I will take if Anne does not win,’ he says. Spot the difference: The leadership has been keener to help Tim Yeo, who is in a similar predicament . Few Tories believe him. ‘Of course he’s going to run,’ said one supporter of Ms McIntosh. ‘He’s ambitious and we are convinced No 10 is behind him.’ If Mr Legard prevails it will reinforce the view that Mr Cameron’s Tory Party is dominated by a public-school-educated clique of white middle aged men. Whatever happens, the bitterness will linger in the association for years to come. In picturesque Thirsk, home of James Herriott, author of the vet series All Creatures Great and Small, the feud in the Conservative party is a talking point in the bars and cafes dotted around the market square. One of the most frequent gripes is that locals rarely see McIntosh in the constituency. A visit to her isolated property on an estate on the outskirts of Thirsk bears out that criticism — there is still Christmas tinsel on the window sill next to last year’s Christmas cards. However, at Johnsons the butchers they were backing her. Andrew Truman, 44, the owner said: ‘She regularly calls in here and you see her at the cattle market doing her surgery. She’s a good MP and I would be sorry to see her go.’ Ronnie Duckett, who used to own a shop on the square, said: ‘I can’t understand what she’s done to upset them. She’s a good MP who fights our corner at Westminster.’ But Andrew  Newton, 40, a prominent local health campaigner whose six-year-old daughter has cerebral palsy, said: ‘I am heavily involved in the re-organisation of children’s hospitals and she will not talk to me. I’m a Conservative but if she is still the candidate next time I will stand as an independent. I’m serious. She has to go.’ Damp reception: The MP has poured disapproval on the government's response to floods in Somerset . A letter in the Darlington & Stockton Times from Ruth Robinson, a retired hotelier and well-known figure in Thirsk, goes to the nub of the argument: ‘As a consequence of her re-selection [last year], and possibly disenchantment with the present government, many loyal members cancelled their subscriptions. 'I am wondering what lessons Anne has learned from the fact that 11 chairmen have been unable to work with her and what it is that is driving her to attempt to cling on as MP in the teeth of opposition.’ In a statement, McIntosh accepted she had her detractors, but added: ‘I believe I have the support of the overwhelming majority of party members.’ She will find out soon enough — once this unedifying selection process which is tearing the Tories apart is finally decided.","A vote in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, will decide Anne McIntosh's fate today .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:08 EST, 30 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:46 EST, 30 January 2014 . George Osborne today claimed the small print of Labour's economic plan, including an extra £25billion in borrowing, poses the 'single biggest risk to the economic recovery'. The Chancellor today challenged Labour's Ed Balls over the careful wording of his promise to run a surplus which only applies to day-to-day spending. In a letter to Mr Balls, seen by MailOnline, Mr Osborne demanded to know how higher spending and more borrowing forever can be described as 'fiscal discipline'. Clash: Ed Balls has been challenged by Chancellor George Osborne over his plans to borrow more money if Labour wins the next election . In a major speech at the weekend, Mr Balls insisted he would ‘’make sure the sums add up’ and warned Labour ‘cannot and will not duck the hard choices ahead’. He declared: ‘The next Labour government will balance the books and deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt in the next Parliament.’ By contrast, Tory Chancellor George Osborne has promised to balance the books on the ‘overall budget’, ensuring that money raised from taxes exceeds all government spending. Mr Osborne said in September: ‘We will have a surplus in good times as insurance against difficult times ahead. ‘Provided the recovery is sustained, our goal is to achieve that surplus in the next Parliament. That will bear down on our debts and prepare us for the next rainy day.’ Analysis by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank says the subtle difference means Mr Balls’ promise only covers day-to-day spending, and would allow Labour to make fewer spending cuts and borrow almost £25billion more. It clears the way for billions more . spending on infrastructure and housing projects, which the Tories . seized on as proof Labour is not serious about getting a grip on the . nation’s finances. In his letter, Mr Osborne writes: 'As with all your announcements, the small print tells a very different story.' He said that it is 'vital that our political debate is based on the facts' and demanded to called on him to 'confirm that you plan to borrow at least £25 billion a year indefinitely'. Mr Osborne added: 'In what way does a policy of ‘significantly higher spending’ and budget deficits forever constitute fiscal discipline? 'Our long term economic plan is delivering growth and economic security for hardworking people. Despite your recent attempts to rebuild a reputation for fiscal responsibility, the truth that was buried in the small print is now clear: the Labour Party is the single biggest risk to the economic recovery.' The Office for Budget Responsibility . predicts that a future Conservative government would need to cut an . extra £37.6 billion between 2016 and 2019 to balance the books on the . overall budget. However Labour would only need to cut £13billion to stick to its new rules – a difference of £24.6billion. The Tories said the revelation was rppof that Mr Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband would order 'more spending, more borrowing and more taxes' Ed Balls has been accused of being 'in denial' after claiming levels of public spending before the financial crisis were not a problem. David Cameron has seized on the remarks as proof Labour has failed to learn the lessons of running a large deficit before the crash. In an interview on Sunday, Mr Balls said: 'Do I think the level of public spending going into the crisis was a problem for Britain? No, I don’t, nor our deficit, nor our national debt – what happened was a global financial crisis which pushed up the deficit.' In the Commons Mr Cameron said Labour just wanted to go back to spending more money. 'We were talking earlier about our children. When our children in future turn to the dictionary and look up the definition of denial it'll be right there - Balls, Ed,' the PM said. Gemma Tetlow, of the IFS, told The . Times: ‘While Ed Balls and George Osborne have made rather similar . sounding commitments to achieving a surplus in the next Parliament, . their targets are actually very different. ‘Ed . Balls’s commitment to achieve a surplus on the current budget would . allow significantly higher spending on both investment and day-to-day . items than would George Osborne’s plan. ‘The . difference is that George Osborne plans for tax revenues to be . sufficient to cover both day-to-day and investment spending, rather than . just day-to-day spending as Ed Balls wants.’ Tory MP Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘It’s no surprise that Ed Balls has a credibility problem on the economy when an announcement designed to convince the public they can trust him uses a sleight of hand to give himself a £25 billion leeway.’ A Conservative spokesman said: ‘Labour spent, borrowed and taxed our country into a mess. ‘And now Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are proposing yet more spending, more borrowing and more taxes. ‘Nothing has changed. It's the same old Labour. They have no long-term economic plan. And that would mean a less secure future for our country and for hardworking people and their families.’ A Labour spokesperson said: ‘As we said last week Labour will deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt as soon as possible in the next Parliament. This will require spending cuts, action to deliver stronger growth and fairer choices including reversing David Cameron's huge tax cut for millionaires. ‘The Tories are criticising the same measure of the deficit that George Osborne is himself targeting in this Parliament. But George Osborne has failed to balance the books as he promised because he choked off the recovery and flatlined our economy for 3 years.’ Prime Minister David Cameron refused to rule out cutting the top rate of tax from 45p . David Cameron has refused to rule out reducing the top rate of tax to 40p. Labour leader Ed Miliband asked three times about whether a planned cut of the 45p rate is being lined up by the Government, as he probed the Prime Minister on his proposals for workers who earn more than £150,000 a year. But Mr Cameron chose to focus on the Government's existing policies, adding that the richest people would pay more in income tax in every year under the coalition Government when compared with the previous Labour administration. Labour has promised to return the rate to 50p if it wins the election, even though experts say it will raise hardly any extra money to tackle the deficit. In the Commons Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron used to claim 'that the 50p tax rate was a symbol of us all being in it together and now it's gone'. The Labour leader added: 'Now could you tell us whether you rule out cutting the top rate further to 40p?' But Mr Cameron side-stepped the question, insisting Chancellor George Osborne had set out the Government's priorities yesterday, adding: 'We want to cut taxes for the lowest paid and for middle-income people.'","Shadow chancellor's pledge only covers day-to-day spending .

You had no idea it . was going on and your emotions are in turmoil. But what if you could have stopped it from happening? While we can't look into the future of our relationships, one author thinks he can help women spot a love rat before it's too late. Psychologist and author Martyn Stewart has set about helping women worldwide with his new book, Why Men Really Cheat. Is he having an affair? A new book by a psychologist sets about helping women identify the classic cheating types . Using brain analysis, anonymous case studies and maths, he has calculated the personality types most likely to cheat, and assesses and explains the reasoning behind their actions. 'Our society is built on ease. It aims to satiate selfish needs,' he writes. Stewart, who has over 15 years of experience in the field of psychology - focusing especially on human relationships and cognitive psychology - cites men's top reasons for cheating as: fear of missing out, seeking recognition that they are a certain 'somebody', and seeking gratification via compulsive drives. So, which five types of men should you avoid to save having your heart broken? Tricks of the trade: Martyn uses brain analysis, anonymous case studies and maths to calculate the personality types most likely to cheat and assesses and explains their reasoning . First up is The Lad's Lad, the type of man who loves getting drunk and is easily influenced by his friends in the pub: he is the most likely to do the dirty on you. There's also The Manipulator - who's calculating, secretive and rather sneaky: to watch out for. Then there's The Stupid Mistake, the man who acts first and thinks later, as well as The Opportunist, whose carefree attitude means he will take the chance to cheat as and when it comes along. Finally, there's The Disdainer - one of the worst kinds. He is a classic misogynist, lacking any form of empathy with his girlfriend but will happily sympathise with the other girl he's texting. Stewart spoke to 547 men from all walks of life in their natural habitat - whether that was in a pub or the gym changing room - for the book. There are 27 types in total, and each one has been calculated according to their brain type, thought process and environment (a complex formula called BET). The book's synopsis reads: 'For the first time, discover the traits and characteristics of every type of man you have ever met. No matter what your opinion of men is, you will never look at them the same way again! 'Addressing the number one relationship killer that has tormented women for centuries. It has even baffled some men about their own behaviour.' Stewart's book, Â£8.99, has been such a hit he's now looking into why women really cheat (by popular demand, apparently).

A football fan has used a grant from social services to pay for Manchester United season tickets. The 33-year-old woman is believed to have used a £550 grant paid out by Bury Council in Greater Manchester twice since 2011. Money is normally awarded to customers who are assessed as having specific care needs. A football fan has used a grant from social services to pay for Manchester United season tickets . A season ticket to see all of Manchester United's games at Old Trafford costs between £500 and £950. The woman has been allocated £550 twice and used most of it each time towards season tickets. A source told The Sun: 'It's incredible that a council, at a time of cuts to public services didn't keep a closer eye on its money.' A Bury Council spokesman said people assessed as needing social care receive a budget to pay for their needs under a system called Self Directed Support. The money is thought to have helped to pay for the majority of the woman's season tickets since 2011 . The personal budget is money that the council gives to a person who then spends the money to meet their needs. You can only have a personal budget if you have been assessed by Adult Care Services as needing support to help live independently. An assessment has to be completed by a care manager and staff from the council's finance team looks at what money is coming in and out. The personal budget is made up from money from Adult Care Services. Once an application has been completed Adult Care Services will tell the person how much money they are likely to have to buy care and support.

Sasha Bell-Newman, age 13 from Burntisland, a pupil at Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy, bullied because she is English . An English-born schoolgirl was left in tears when she became the victim of vicious anti-English abuse in her Scottish secondary school. Sasha Bell-Newman, 13, was told to ‘f*** off back to your own country’ by a fellow pupil. According to Sasha’s mother, Teresa, the pupils have recently been taught about the forthcoming independence referendum and had been encouraged to think about a Scottish national anthem. The distressing incident has sparked fears that internet abuse which has already soured the debate over Scotland’s future is now spreading into everyday life. Yesterday former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the family’s local MP, contacted Mrs Bell-Newman to offer his sympathies. He also said he would contact the local education authority to discuss what happened. Sasha was born in Dorset, but the family moved to Scotland when she was just ten months old after falling in love with the country on holiday. She lives with her 44-year-old mother, 40-year-old father Robert Newman, and four-year old brother Ollie in Burntisland on the Firth of Forth. Mrs Bell-Newman said Sasha, a pupil at Balwearie High in Kirkcaldy, was reduced to tears on Wednesday following the abuse by a fellow classmate.

'Discussion has taken place with the parents of both children involved to ensure that no repeat of this behaviour occurs and the matter is resolved in a restorative manner.  As with all schools we deal robustly with incidents which may be motivated by prejudice as they occur, on a case by case basis, in line with Fife Council policy.' A Fife Council spokesman said all local authority schools have a ‘clear line of impartiality that they adhere to’ ahead of this year’s referendum.","Bullied girl has lived in Scotland since she was ten months old .

Mr Key said he was planning to discuss the matter with senior ministers adding he would personally like to see a new flag using a symbol drawn from New Zealand's native flora.

The current New Zealand flag, left, and the silver fern symbol of the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team, right . 'It has international recognition and cachet.

The alleged ringleaders of one of Britain’s most notorious street crime gangs were arrested in a nationwide crackdown yesterday. Up to 700 officers swooped on addresses from London to Edinburgh in co-ordinated dawn raids which were aimed at ‘decapitating’ their suspected underworld empire. The operation targeted the GAS  – Guns and Shanks – gang which runs a multi-million pound crack cocaine ring and is linked to a string of murders. Senior officers said the gang, which has its roots in South London, was increasingly stretching its ‘tentacles’ to new markets in other cities, the Home Counties and affluent suburbs. They warned that its leaders were . willing to use extreme violence, often sparking bloody turf wars as they . kicked out weaker rivals. Victim: Thusha Kamaleswaran was left paralysed after being gunned down in a gang-related shooting carried out by the Guns and Shanks crew . The GAS gang was behind at least six killings in recent years, many fuelled by tit-for-tat rows over territory and ‘respect’. It . was also responsible for the callous shooting that paralysed . five-year-old Thusha Kamaleswaran as she played in her uncle’s shop in . Stockwell, South London, in 2011. Yesterday . police teams swooped on more than 20 addresses thought to belong to the . ‘top tier’ of the criminal network, described as ‘the most . senior-ranking high-harm members’. A . total of 29 suspects, aged between 18 and 47, were arrested at . properties in Edinburgh, Bedfordshire, Barking in East London, Reading . and Bracknell in Berkshire. Raids also took place on estates controlled . by the gang in Brixton and Stockwell, as well as across Lambeth, . Southwark, Brent and Hackney. Search teams recovered thousands of pounds in cash and a huge amount of crack cocaine –  the gang’s main source of income. Scotland . Yard, which was behind the operation, has enjoyed great success in . targeting street gangs in recent years, recording substantial falls in . associated crime. But one top officer said in some cases their activities have simply been displaced to other areas, including the Home Counties. Commander . Steve Rodhouse said: ‘This particular gang have identified drug markets . across the country which they see as fruitful and have moved into them. The money comes back to London – these are London gangsters – but we . are willing to follow them wherever they go.’ The raids were the latest phase in the crackdown, which has racked . up a total of 88 arrests since it began in December.

Overseas investment in France fell by 77 per cent last year as Britain retained its position as the most attractive country in Europe for foreign business. A report by the United Nations showed just £3.5billion of foreign money went into France in 2013 – the lowest amount for 27 years. By comparison, foreign investors spent £32billion in Britain. This will inevitably add further fuel to ongoing accusations that the French economy has been woefully mismanaged by Socialist President Francois Hollande. 'Dislikes the rich': Socialist President Francois Hollande's economic policies appear to have led to a staggering 77 per cent reduction in the amount of foreign investment in France, the eurozone's second-largest economy . The UN Conference on Trade and Development, who released the estimated figures on the eve of a trip by Mr Hollande to the UK, said that this vast reduction came as foreign investment in the European Union as a whole increased. The United Kingdom was the ninth most popular destination for foreign investment last year – and the best in Europe. Investment in Germany soared 392 per cent to £19.6billion in 2013, while in Spain it rose by 37 per cent to £22.4billion. The increasingly dire performance by France, which is the Eurozone’s second largest economy, is a cause of huge concern for neighbours including Britain. Other new figures released this week show France’s unemployment and poverty rates soaring to new highs. Despite the Mr Hollande’s highly publicised ‘promise’ that he would get the jobless figures down in 2013, the number rose by 10,200 in December. It now stands at 11.1 per cent, or  well over 3.3 million  – a figure which rises to almost 5 million if those in part-time temporary jobs are taken into consideration. Love split: Mr Hollande has just effectively 'fired' his first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, after being caught out travelling to a Paris love nest on the back of a moped to meet his lover, the actress Julie Gayet . Meanwhile, a damning new survey shows that the poverty rate in France is at 14 per cent – the highest for 17 years. Researchers from social policy consultants COMPAS found that 8.7 million French people live below the poverty line. The figures are particularly embarrassing for Mr Hollande becomes he claims to be a radical left winger who ‘dislikes the rich’ and is committed to helping the poor. The Socialist’s disastrous economic policies have been accompanied by regular polls which prove he is the most unpopular president in the recent history of France. He has offered a ‘Responsibility Pact’ to businesses, offering tax cuts in return for firms creating more jobs. But Mr Hollande, who will meet Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday, is rapidly losing credibility among voters, not just because of his policies but because of his hugely embarrassing personal life. He has just effectively ‘fired’ his first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, after being caught out travelling to a Paris love nest on the back of a moped to meet his lover, the actress Julie Gayet. Many believe Mr Hollande should be devoting more time to sorting out France’s  massive economic problems.","Staggering fall came as foreign investment in the EU as a whole increased .

Support for a cashless society is greatest in London, where 30 per cent of residents said they were ready to say goodbye to cash. Toby Clark, director of research at Mintel, said this was because London already had the infrastructure, and added: â€˜A major shift is on the horizon, and the integration of mobiles into payments has only just begun. Over a third (38 per cent) were interested in making mobile payments -  and an enthusiastic 8 per cent said they would apply right away . 'As mobile payment and wallet services become more widely available, and more intuitive and efficient to use, it will be difficult for consumers to resist adopting them. 'While just eight per cent of Brits claim they would apply for a mobile payment system straight away, across an adult population of around 50 million adults, that still represents a potential user base of four million people: there is a huge market out there if providers are able to come up with a product that represents a tangible upgrade to existing technology.' Support for a cashless society is greatest in London where 30 per cent of residents would be happy to stop using cash altogether. However, the figure declines to just 13 per cent of those living in the South West and Wales and 14 per cent of those living in the North and Scotland. Mr Clark said: 'The fact that Londoners are most comfortable with a cashless society reflects the region's head start on the rest of the country in terms of payment system infrastructure and that new payment technologies, such as contactless cards, tend be launched in London first. 'However, there are huge swathes of the population which remain attached to cash, and the reality is that cash still has a long life ahead of it.' Cash remains the most widely and frequently used payment method in Britain. Researchers found 99 per cent of Brits use cash, and only debit cards come close to rivalling it. However, one in 50 Brits (two per cent) say they have never used a plastic card. Mr Clark added: 'It is not about any one payment method. 'People use multiple payment technologies, and if they can see a clear reason for changing their habits then they are willing to incorporate new ones, such as PayPal. 'Use of a particular payment method is largely determined by context. Cash dominates for small transactions on the high street, but for online and for high value transactions, debit and plastic cards are the payment methods of choice.'","Support greatest in London - 30% of residents ready .

Drink-driver: Paul Hastings, 45, was so drunk that he tried to pay for fuel at a petrol station despite not having filled up, a court has heard . A company director was so drunk that he tried to pay for fuel at a petrol station despite not having filled up, a court has heard. Paul Hastings, 45, was almost four times over the legal drink-drive limit when he drove into a garage in Hebburn, near Newcastle. He stumbled across the forecourt before attempting to pay for petrol - even though he hadn’t put any in his car. He then climbed back into his vehicle and swerved toward a pump, nearly crashing into other motorists. Hastings, who runs Hastings Metal Finishers in Hebburn with his brother Alan, recorded a breath test reading of 136mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath when tested by police - well above the legal limit of 35mcg. He has been handed a nine-week suspended jail sentence after admitting drink-driving at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court. Hastings, who has three children, had argued with his brother just hours before the incident on December 10, the court heard. This caused him to 'drink to excess', before he climbed into his car and drove to the Jet garage in Victoria Road at about 6.30pm. Glenda . Beck, prosecuting, said: 'Police were called about a possible drink . driver at a garage after the cashier said a man had entered and asked to . pay for some fuel.

Appearance: Hastings (pictured, right, arriving at court with a companion) had parked at a pump (pictured on the left) but the petrol station's till showed no fuel had been drawn when he went to pay . 'When he was told he had not taken any fuel, he left the station store and went back to his Volkswagen Golf vehicle. 'He . was walking back and forth and was unsteady on his feet.

An infant school has launched a new crackdown on parents who pick up their children late from school - by fining them £6 if they turn up more than 15 minutes late. Germander Park School in Milton Keynes wants to discourage parents from treating it as a 'childcare provider' by charging whenever it has to look after pupils outside school hours. But many parents are furious about the fining regime, saying it is unfair to families with multiple children and could prove ruinous to less wealthy people. Tough: Germander Park School in Milton Keynes is fining parents £6 an hour for collecting their children late . The school, which is located in the Conniburrow area and whose pupils go up to Year Two, told parents in a letter last week that they would have to pay £6 for every hour they were late after 3.15pm. The announcement came soon after another Milton Keynes school revealed that it would charge parents £60 if their children turned up late in the morning. Emerson Valley School imposed the fine in a tough new disciplinary drive, but parents spoke out against the move. One mother at Germander Park today spoke of her anger at the policy, saying: 'I found the letter in my four-year-old son's bag. I'm not sure that was the best way to inform parents. 'Conniburrow is not a rich place. People on benefits might not be able to pay the fines and then what are they going to do? 'I have children in three different schools across Milton Keynes, I can't be in all those places at the same time and sometimes I'll be delayed.' Letter: A copy of the note sent to all parents by the school last week outlining the policy . Interim headmistress Sonia Hunt said that parents could be fined even if they arrived just five minutes later than the designated time, but insisted that no one would be penalised if they had a valid reason for their delay. In a statement, the school said: 'The letter which we sent out is not new. It has been in place since 2011. 'All parents have seen it in the school prospectus and it is on our website. 'In September the previous headteacher . reminded parents of the policy in her newsletter which was sent home in . book bags - this is our standard practice. 'Unfortunately it is becoming increasingly frequent that some parents are collecting children late from school. 'May we remind you that school finish time is 3pm daily and you should be at school prompt to collect your child at this time. 'We understand that occasionally emergencies do arise and appreciate this can lead to the late collection of children. 'If you have a genuine emergency and know you will be late collecting your child, it is ESSENTIAL you let the school know. 'However, . for those parents who collect their child late from school without . giving a valid reason, we will be introducing a childcare charge in line . with other childcare providers, of £6 per hour if your child remains in . school after 3.15pm. 'This charge will be collected by the school office on the day.' 'In January a reminder of this was sent out. We are always sympathetic to our families and will support them in any way we can if we are notified of any pick-up problem. Obviously in these cases no charges would be raised. 'However, there have been occasions where parents have been exceptionally late with no reason given and we have been unable to contact them.' Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said fining parents was the wrong way to address the issue. He said: 'The fines for taking children out of school for holidays - that's fine. But the idea of fining parents £6 at the end of the day is completely new to me. 'Fines should only be issued in very, very extreme circumstances and as a total last resort. 'Schools are communities of families and this will break the relationship between the school and the parents. This undermines that sense of community that the school needs. 'I have been in that situation when you're waiting at the end of the day for parents to collect their children. I got very annoyed, but if it's a persistent thing you should contact social services.' Germander Park may even find that the plan to curb tardiness could backfire - in one well-known case, detailed in the 2005 best-seller Freakonomics, it was found that fining parents for being late only encouraged them to be later. The counter-intuitive result came because parents no longer felt guilty about being late picking their children up if they were able to 'buy off' their guilt with a small fine.","Germander Park School in Milton Keynes has imposed tough regime .

But, Bowen, who had worked for the supermarket giant since she was 16 years old, was only given community service and a suspended prison sentence when she appeared at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court in Pembrokeshire. Prosecutor Ellie Morgan said: 'Bowen was an acting manager which gave her access to an office where lottery slips were kept. 'The slips showed how much money had been paid out on winning tickets each day. 'Bowen altered the figures to make it look as if the machine had paid out more than it actually had - then pocketed the difference.' Tesco called in police after Bowen admitted the theft at a disciplinary hearing, where she was subsequently sacked. During an interview, Bowen told police she 'panicked' after receiving letters from bailiffs relating to unpaid bills and a loan from when she was living with a former partner. James Subbiani, defending, said: 'To a greater or lesser degree she has ruined her life - good employment in the future will be difficult to achieve.' Debts: Haverfordwest Magistrates Court in Pembrokeshire heard how she 'panicked' when she started receiving letters from baliffs . Store: Bowen went through with her secret scam in Pembroke Dock, West Wales . Bowen, of Pembroke Dock, admitted nine charges of theft and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for two years. She . was also ordered to complete 200 hours unpaid work, and pay £6996 . compensation, £80 towards prosecution costs and an £85 victim surcharge. The chair of the magistrates’ bench said: 'We could have imposed custodial sentence but we are suspending that today.' Caught: Bowen was forced to face a disciplinary hearing after supermarket bosses noticed they were losing money on the lottery . Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court heard Bowen was able to take the money by altering slips printed out from the store’s National Lottery machine. The slips showed how much money had been paid out on winning tickets each day. Bowen altered the figures to make it look as if the machine had paid out more than it actually had. This means customers were still able to take home their winnings, but Bowen pocketed the additional value. Amounts ranging from £415 to £997.90 were taken from the branch’s cash office.","Jenna Bowen, 21, pocketed winnings at the store in Pembroke Dock, Wales .

Michael Lawton, 54, went on the rampage after he was plagued by local youths who pulled pranks on him that pushed him over the edge, making him attempt to explode a local Morrisons petrol station . A homeowner has been jailed for trying to blow up his street by setting fire to a petrol station with a candle after 'flipping' over years of abuse from his neighbours. Michael Lawton, 54, took the drastic action after he was plagued by local yobs who made his life 'a misery'. A court heard he flipped after having his windows smashed, his car tyres let down and eggs thrown at his house in Milehouse, Staffordshire. In a bid to deal with the nuisance neighbours 'once and for all' Lawton planned to destroy the entire street by blowing up a local petrol station in a drastic act of revenge. On July 9 last year he went to a nearby Morrisons supermarket armed with just a candle and a bucket where he cut five different hoses in an attempt to set a monster blaze. But because it was 1.45am the petrol pumps had been shut down and he only succeeded in lighting a small fire at the base of one pump. After returning back to his home following his botched attempt Lawton decided to hand himself into police four days later. He told police he had taken matters into his own hands because they had done nothing to help him since neighbours started picking on him two years ago. At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Wednesday Lawton pleaded guilty to attempted arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Lawton tried to blow up this Morrisons petrol station in Milehouse, Staffordshire, in a bid to kill himself and destroy the road where those making his life a misery by constantly pulling pranks on him lived, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard . He was jailed for two-and-a-half years by Judge Paul Glenn who told him the consequences of his actions could have been 'catastrophic'. He added: 'Your actions were highly dangerous. It is a matter of pure good fortune that you did not cause a significant fire. 'You do not suffer from a mental disorder. 'The problems that you detail... do not begin to justify what you did. 'Your actions could have been catastrophic.' Lawton called police on July 12 to admit to his crime - adding that he had intended to blow himself up and take the drive where he lived 'with him.' Prosecutor David Bennett told the court that staff returned to the station the next morning to find £1,250 worth of damage to the forecourt. Mr Bennett said that CCTV footage later revealed Lawton 'messing around' by the pumps in the early hours and using a bucket as a wind breaker as he attempted to set the fire. Stuart Clarks, defending, said that if his client had not called police he would never have been caught. The 54-year-old, was fed-up with yobs on his drive smashing his windows, letting his car tyres down and throwing eggs at his house on Wilmot Drive (shown here) in Milehouse, Staffordshire . He said: 'He was the victim of a number of crimes. 'His car tyres were targeted on a number of occasions, his windows had been smashed in the house and eggs had been thrown at the house. 'His face did not fit. 'He contacted the police and local authority about the problem with youths in the area and nothing happened.' One resident on the street said he felt sorry for his neighbour who had become the target of local youths. The father-of-three, who did not wish be named, said: 'They’ve been picking on him for a couple of years and I know he had complained about them. 'It’s terrifying to think he wanted to take such drastic action. 'Everyone has been saying it’s like that Michael Douglas film Falling Down - he just had enough and flipped. 'But it’s no laughing matter really. We could all have been blown to high heaven.'","Michael Lawton, 54, went on rampage after he was plagued by local yobs .

"By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 09:26 EST, 30 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:45 EST, 30 January 2014 . He was the 14-year-old boy who beat his mother to death in a hammer attack so violent, it left her skull smashed to pieces. Now the former partner of victim Jacqueline Bartlam, 47, mother of 'Coronation Street killer' Daniel, has told of some of the bizarre behaviour he displayed in the run-up to the violent murder on Easter Sunday, two years ago. Speaking in new documentary, Kids Who Kill, Simon Matters, 48, from Nottingham, revealed that the troubled boy concealed bags of his mother's underwear in his bedroom and would write gruesome stories before showing them to his family. Troubling: Simon Matters, 48, the former partner of Jacqueline Bartlam has told of life with killer teen Daniel . 'It would be about 7pm on a weekday night . and he'd come down and show me a story he'd written,' remembers Mr Matters. 'And it would be . quite gory; it would include someone getting killed and fighting, and . this kid had hurt someone at school and that kid would go back and kill . him... 'I would read it and give it back to him and then he would go and show his . mother and she was the same as me. She'd give it back to him . and be like ""Daniel, what are you writing that for?""' Daniel had also, as police would . later find, had written a soap which included a elaborate plot featuring . a character called Daniel Bartlam who killed his mother. 'The only place he couldn't get away with his bad deeds was with his mother Jacqui,' the script read. 'So one night, he staged a break-in and murdered her with a hammer and then set her and the family home alight.' Tragic: Daniel was just 14 when he beat his mother Jacqueline, 48, to death with a claw hammer . Warning signs: Mr Matters says Daniel displayed odd behaviour in the weeks before the killing . 'Daniel Bartlam was the character that . done this but it was a soap plot,' remembers Mr Matters. 'As the character in the soap, he'd got . away with it, got away with it in court and then gone on to become a . famous soap star. Longest soap star in history, I think he'd finished it . off with.' Tragically for Jacqueline and her family, Daniel, who was jailed for life with a minimum 16 year term last year, wasn't just writing his fantasies down - he was planning to carry them out. Late at night one Easter Sunday, Daniel crept into his mother's room and attacked her with a lump hammer, hitting her seven times on the head and jaw. To conceal his crime, he wrapped her body in newspaper before dousing it in petrol and setting it on fire. His mother's body was so badly burned, it could only be identified using dental records. Later, Bartlam told police that a burglar had killed his mother but just two days after the killing, he was charged with his mother's murder. But a penchant for writing his gruesome fantasies down wasn't the only indication that Daniel wasn't quite the normal boy that he seemed. According to Mr Matters, he would also smash up Star Wars figurines and developed a habit of urinating and defecating inside his bedroom. 'He had many expensive figurines of Star . Wars characters and Dr Who characters,' remembered Mr Matters. 'They would be all ruined. He'd . have plastic boxes full of figures but he'd just urinate in the boxes. He also defecated all over the bedroom and in the boxes and hid towels . and stuff that he'd wiped himself with. Ablaze: After killing his mother, Daniel set fire to the modest family home in a bid to conceal her body . 'One of the things I found that . disturbed me, but actually Jacqui laughed about it, was a bag of her . underwear. Obviously, I mentioned it to Jacqui and she was like ""Oh my God"" but she just brushed over it and said he was just having a prank, . just messing around. 'It . was brushed over at the time but later on it became a bit more . sinister.' Criminal psychologist Dr David Canter comments: 'In this private room that Daniel created . for himself, as well as destroying the Star Wars figures and . defecating, as a 14-year-old boy, he was probably masturbating a lot and . taking things that would feed his masturbatory fantasies. 'The underwear . from his mother that he stole could well have been part of that whole . process and part of his internal fantasy life that became more than a . fantasy in terms of what he planned to do.' Dreadful: The remains of Jacqueline Bartlam's bedroom following the blaze caused by her son . Murder weapon: The lump hammer recovered from the Bartlam family home and used by killer Daniel . Despite his bizarre behaviour at home, outwardly, Daniel appeared to be nothing more than a normal boy. 'He was just the boy next door,' says Mr Matters. 'If you saw him in the street, you wouldn't look at him twice. Normal guy.' He adds: 'It makes it more scary than anything else . really. The fact he'd been speaking to . people, going to school and all along, he was planning, he knew he was going to murder his mum.'

Manchester United footballer Ashley Young was given a six month driving ban for his latest speeding offence . Manchester United and England footballer Ashley Young has been banned from driving for six months. The 28-year-old was handed four penalty points today, having pleaded guilty through a solicitor to speeding at 71mph in his £60,000 Range Rover Vogue on a 50mph section of the M6 Toll in Warwickshire in March last year. Magistrates sitting in Leamington Spa heard that the winger already has nine points on his driving licence, having previously been convicted of speeding at 100mph on the M62 in West Yorkshire, making him liable for a ban under the rules on 'totting-up' points. Young had been given six points for an earlier offence in January last year and three points for another unspecified incident in 2011. Wearing a black suit and tie, the winger, who reportedly earns £90,000 a week, sat silently in the dock throughout today’s hearing. Speaking before sentencing, in mitigation, his defence solicitor, Frances Coles-Harrington, said that at the time Young’s Range Rover Vogue was clocked by a speed camera near the M6 Toll’s junction with the M42 at 10am on March 7, the road was 'quiet'. 'He was driving on the toll road, it was quiet, and the speed was normally 70mph but had been reduced but not for anything in relation to an accident or any matter like that,' she said. Ms Coles-Harrington also criticised the Crown Prosecution Service’s application for £405 costs, claiming that, had the winger been 'another member of the public', he would be looking at lesser costs. 'In relation to the financial penalties I would ask for 28 days for Mr Young to make payment,' she said. 'Just because Mr Young is who he is, £405 for an indication of a guilty plea - if it was another member of the public here today, they’d be hit with the usual application for £85 costs for a guilty plea, not £405.' Naila Iqbal, for the prosecution, said: 'In relation to the court costs, those were calculated for an indicated guilty plea a day before trial so preparation for that trial had already been carried out - costs awarded after trial would be £625. 'So, whether it is Mr Young of Manchester United or a member of the public, the costs would have been the same.' The father-of-two was ushered into a waiting car by security after the sentencing at the Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa . Ms Coles-Harrington also urged the magistrates’ bench to impose the minimum disqualification period, 'because of his need for visiting his young children'. 'Mr Young has family and two young children living in the South and his career takes him into the North of England,' she said. 'To see and visit his children he needs a licence to be able to drive.' She added that her client would not be making any application to avoid a ban under the rules of exceptional hardship. The Manchester United winger, pictured playing against Cardiff City on Tuesday night, reportedly earns £90,000 a week . In front of a packed public gallery, magistrates fined Young £3,000 for the offence and ordered him to pay £405 costs and £120 victim surcharge. The player, who told Wakefield Magistrates’ Court last July that he was 'deeply sorry' for speeding on the M62, spoke only to tell the magistrates he understood the charge, and to confirm his name, age and address. Paul Tasker, chairman of the bench, told Young: 'If you drive while disqualified you will be committing a serious offence and you may be sent to prison and disqualified again.' The footballer was also told he must now apply to the DVLA for a new licence, once the period of his ban has been served. Young was caught in a speed camera on the M6 Toll in March last year.

Sandra D’Auriol, 53, a jeweller who had worked for the Royal Family’s supplier Asprey, was apparently recovering from a facelift when she threw off her clothing, ran to the building's 15th storey roof and jumped to her death. Now investigators are reportedly trying to establish whether the Beverly Hill clinic owned by 'surgeon to the stars' Dr Brian Novack was in any way negligent in its care of the mother-of-two. Tragedy: The woman who jumped to her death from a 15-storey building in Beverly Hills has been identified as British socialite Sandra D’Auriol, who used to work for Royal jeweller Asprey . Distressed: Sandra D'Auriol was seen sitting on the roof of the sleek black building, pictured, before jumping . Police spent three hours unsuccessfully attempting to talk the Hong Kong-based mother-of-two down as she sat naked with her legs dangling over a ledge (pictured) Police spent three hours trying to talk the mother-of-two down as she sat naked with her legs dangling over a ledge. Mrs . D’Auriol, who lived in Hong Kong, was known for making one-of-a-kind . jewellery and often donated profits from her business to charity. There are a number of rare but serious physical complications resulting from general and local anesthetics, including increased risk of respiratory depression and heart attacks. But the true effect of anesthesia on the human mind remains somewhat unclear. One worrying symptom is emergence delirium - a temporary mental condition affecting around 5 per cent of patients that can result in a state of heightened emotion or excitement in the hours or days after anesthesia. Patients suffering emergence delirium may also experience temporary psychomotor agitation, the symptoms of which include seemingly odd behaviour such as pacing around a room, removing clothing and in more extreme cases self-harming. Other patients reports extreme long and short-term changes in personality following anesthesia, including developing bouts of depression and anxiety. In 2006, talented 21-year-old student James Wentworth-Stanley committed suicide just 10 days after a minor operation. He had told his mother he 'didn't feel right' after the surgery, and sunk into a deep depression that saw him desperately contacting doctors for help before eventually committing suicide. It has since emerged that the anesthetics James was administered have all been linked to depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts. Since his death, James' mother Clare Milford Haven claims to have compiled a large amount of evidence that suggests many clinicians and pharmacologists believe there is a small but definite link between the drugs used in anaesthetics and suicidal behaviour.

An internationally acclaimed opera singer died at the age of 38 after doctors failed to find a grapefruit sized tumour in her chest, an inquest heard. Cecilia Smiga graced some of opera’s finest concert halls and had sung at leading sporting events. For several months she had been complained of shortness of breath and tiredness. Cecilia Smiga, 38, died after doctors failed to spot a grapefruit sized tumour growing behind her heart . In December 2012 she went to her GP who prescribed antibiotics and, when these failed to improve her condition, eventually referred her for a CT scan at Frimley Park Hospital, in Surrey, in February 2013. Her condition worsened but the tumour, which measured 10cm by 7cm and was forming behind her heart, was not spotted on the CT scan. It was only picked up by doctors five days before she died on April 9, 2013. Ms Smiga was admitted to the Royal Brompton Hospital when the tumour was discovered but nothing could be done to save her. Her father, Michael Smiga, told Westminster Coroner’s Court his daughter had been ill since August 2012. ‘The first time I was aware there was a problem was August 2012 when she referred herself to a chiropractor,’ said Mr Smiga. Miss Smiga, an opera singer, was initially given antibiotics but these failed to improve her symptoms so she was referred for a CT scan but doctors failed to spot the tumour on the scan . ‘She had a complaint of pain in her shoulder and a tight chest and a stooping posture. ‘In November 2012 we attended the Wales vs New Zealand rugby match and went home afterwards. ‘We were walking up a steep hill and she was lagging far behind me - I had never noticed that before. ‘There was another instance when I took her back to Ascot - she was walking up the stairs to her flat and she began violently vomiting - I had never seen anything quite so bizarre.’ The inquest into her death heard that the tumour could have been spotted sooner but that there was no guarantee that this would have enabled doctors to save her life. Dr Shirley Radcliffe claimed doctors probably should have realised there was a tumour behind her heart long before it was eventually found just five days before Ms Smiga’s death. But she said there was no evidence to suggest doctors would have found a way to save her life. Tributes flooded in for Miss Smiga, of Ascot, Berkshire, after her death. Family friend, Mary Edwards, said: ‘Cecilia’s family has received messages from all over the world, which shows how much she meant to so many people. ‘Cecilia brought joy into people’s lives. She was a beautiful woman with a beautiful personality. ‘Cecilia devoted a great deal of time to help charity and believed in encouraging young people.’ Owen Roberts, conductor of the Cefn Mawr-based choir Choral Variations, for whom Cecilia performed in a number of concerts, said: ‘News of her death is a huge loss. She was a lovely young lady and very talented.’ The coroner, Dr Radcliffe, recorded a narrative verdict meaning she did not believe any individual could be held responsible for the death. She said: ‘She (Smiga) was referred to as a delightful lady and obviously well-loved by her family. ‘She was a successful professional in her music and was a fit and healthy young woman with the rest of her life to look forward to. Miss Smiga would have been diagnosed sooner if doctors at Frimley Park Hospital had spotted the tumour on her CT scan results but the coroner accepted that this might not have allowed them to save her life . ‘This was a highly unusual tumour and a very rapid deterioration in her condition. ‘She strikes me as the sort of person who did not wish to make a fuss to the point it was detrimental to her and she was a brave soul who did not want to trouble anyone.’ She added: ‘Doctors had difficulty in understanding the underlying condition and she had a lack of response to conventional treatment. December 2012: Miss Smiga visits her GP suffering from tiredness and shortness of breath. She is given antibiotics. The antibiotics failed to work so she was referred for a CT scan. March 21, 2013: Miss Smiga has a CT scan at Frimley Park Hospital but doctors fail to spot the tumour. April 4, 2013: Miss Smiga's tumour is finally detected. April 9, 2013: Miss Smiga dies at the Royal Brompton Hospital. ‘GP enquiries as to who the best person to send her to ended up with her being sent to the hospital to review this unusual condition. ‘Events took a turn for the worse - she was quite clearly unwell and doctors felt she required a CT scan but it was not entirely clear as to how quickly that should be done. ‘She was discharged and in the meantime became yet more unwell and again ended up in hospital this time in Wrexham. ‘She was seen in A&E and the following morning was seen by a doctor who felt her condition could be dealt with by waiting for her planned CT scan that was coming up at Frimley Park hospital on March 21. ‘She became severely ill on 9 April and went to Frimley Park where her symptoms had worsened - in view of her discomfort doctors thought it was a pulmonary embolism but the scan revealed a tumour.’ The coroner explained that abnormalities were visible on the CT scan, which took place on March 21 and that an independent expert believed the tumour should have been spotted at this point. However, the expert accepted that the tumour was hard to see because of its position. Dr Radcliffe concluded: ‘This was a very complex situation but one could only think that an earlier diagnosis would give a possibility of a better outcome but it is not possible to say for sure in her case.’","Cecilia Smiga went to her GP suffering tiredness and shortness of breath .

Adonis Ortiz has been beating the odds since before his birth, and now thanks to a ground-breaking multi-organ transplant, the Florida miracle toddler has a good chance of leading a normal, healthy life. Little Adonis, age three, underwent the multivisceral transplant in October at the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Medical Center, receiving a new liver, pancreas, stomach and small and large intestines. On Tuesday, the smiling toddler, his mother, Aracelis, and his doctors held a press conference to discuss for the first time Adonis’ life-saving surgery and astounding recovery. Scroll down for video . Tiny survivor: Adonis Ortiz, 3, is on his way to recovery two months after undergoing a life-saving multi-organ transplant . Gut-wrenching news: While still in his mother's womb, the boy was diagnosed with a condition in which the intestines protrude through a hole in the abdominal wall . Four months into her pregnancy, Aracelis Ortiz received the devastating news that her unborn baby boy was developing with a birth defect called gastroschisis – a condition in which the intestines protrude through a hole in the abdominal wall, according to a press release from Jackson Health System. Miss Ortiz, a certified nursing assistant, had a choice to terminate her pregnancy, but decided to deliver the baby anyway. ‘I have strong faith in God. I had no doubt in my mind about having the baby,’ she said. Adonis Ortiz was welcomed into the world December 7, 2010, in Tampa and underwent his first surgery to repair the birth defect. Five days later, doctors discovered the intestines that had formed outside his abdomen were damaged and the intestines inside never fully developed. According to his doctors, the child had only 28 centimeters of intestines, whereas a normally formed baby has 250. Courageous move: Aracelis Ortiz, Adonis' mother pictured with her son and husband, had a choice to abort him, but decided to carry the boy to term . Two more operations followed, but the infant’s condition only worsened. This past August, the Ortiz family got more bad news when little Adonis was diagnosed with stage 2 liver fibrosis – scarring of the liver. When word came in October that a transplant match has been found for Adonis, the family rushed him to Holtz Children’s Hospital at the UM/Jackson Memorial Medical Center with just a few hours' notice. Second chance: Adonis has been in and out of hospitals since birth, and in October he finally received a new liver, pancreas, stomach and small and large intestines . Adonis’ multivisceral transplant made him . the first child in the world to undergo such a procedure without making . an opening that connects the colon to the surface of the abdomen, known . as colostomy. ‘We’ve gone through some ups and down, but I never lost faith,’ his mother said. ‘I’m happy and excited with his progress.’ The smiling baby boy, a budding Yankees fan, is now expected to make a full recovery. His mother hopes to enrol him in a baseball camp in a year. ‘He is really strong,’ said Aracelis Ortiz of her son during Tuesday’s press conference. ‘After all his surgeries, he comes out with a smile. I’m like how do you come out with a smile? They just chopped you up.’ Dr. Rodrigo Vianna, who performed the transplant, said that his 3-year-old patient has a very good chance to have a normal life, Miami Herald reported. Adonis’ small body bears the scars of his many surgeries, including one that runs from the length of his torso. He is currently being fed through a tube that runs from his upper abdomen to his nose, but doctors are hoping that after a few months of therapy he will begin consuming food the old-fashioned way. Birthday boy: Adonis, pictured with his parents celebrating his third birthday last week, now has a good chance of growing up . Baby steps: Adonis will remain under medical observation through February to make sure that his body is not rejecting the new organs, and he will have to be taught how to eat on his own and speak . The toddler is expected to remain at the hospital until February, allowing doctors to closely monitor his recovery and be on the lookout for any signs of his body rejecting the new organs. Aracelis Ortiz expressed her gratitude to the parents who donated their dead children's organs so that her boy would have a second chance, and said that she would love to meet them.","Adonis Ortiz was diagnosed before his birth with gastroschisis – a condition in which the intestines protrude through a hole in the abdominal wall .

Coach Pep Guardiola had flirted with the idea of bringing in Thiago Silva from Paris Saint-Germain but accepts there are too many obstacles in the way of that particular deal. He has been impressed with Luiz's adoption of a more serious outlook to his game under Rafa Benitez last season and believes he could implement his ideals of utilising the ball better from central defensive positions at Bayern. Hair apparent: Chelsea star David Luiz is a summer transfer target for Bayern Munich . The cull: Jose Mourinho is not afraid to get rid of fan favourites as he proved with the sale of Juan Mata . Click here to read Part II of the Transfer Column . At this stage of his thinking, it would be at the expense of Jerome Boateng, who could revert either to full back or be dropped to the bench. As Sportsmail revealed last summer, despite the protestations, Jose Mourinho has been willing to examine offers for Juan Mata and Luiz, with the Spaniard signing for Manchester United . Mourinho wants to continue rebuilding at Chelsea with a top striker and defender such as Kurt Zouma of St Etienne. Balancing this out against the implications of Financial Fair Play means they will listen to offers around £35m for Luiz, which would leave them able to sign Zouma for around £10m and leave space for Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa at £36m plus. The pursuit of Southampton’s Luke Shaw may prompt another departure though. Future blues: Chelsea are lining up moves for Saints full-back Luke Shaw (left) and Atletico striker Diego Costa . Chelsea sent French scout Guy Hillion to Monaco’s Stade Louis II on Sunday to watch Marseille starlet Florian Thauvin but he failed to get a ringing endorsement from former Chelsea defender Frank Leboeuf, who was commentating for RMC Sport. Marseille lost 2-0 to Monaco and forward Thauvin, 21, who is a former target of Newcastle and Arsenal, was replaced after an hour by Dimitri Payet. Leboeuf said: ‘Thauvin didn’t exist for an hour. There was one moment where he had the ball and he tried to knock it past the defender and go round the other side, and you wonder where he’s going. 'Wait for your team-mates to arrive, keep the ball. Football isn’t played with 11 balls.’ Speaking from experience: Marseille defender Florian Thauvin didn't impress Chelsea legend Frank Lebouef . Meanwhile, Gael Kakuta has returned to Chelsea from his loan at Vitesse Arnhem and is looking for a fresh move to kickstart his career at 22. Talking to L’Equipe, scout Hillion said: ‘It’s a huge waste, because I’ve already said it and I’ll repeat it: he was the most talented one of his generation. He could be exceptional. But talent is not enough. There comes a time, when you accumulate failures, that there are problems at every club you go to, you have to ask yourself the right questions and question yourself. 'Because before Arnhem, there was Bolton, Fulham and Dijon. You can’t manage everything in a player’s career. You can’t manage what is on his mind, his entourage or his family.’ Manchester United scouts were at Carlisle on Tuesday night as they watched MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli. The 6ft 2in teenage powerhouse has been studied by Arsenal and Liverpool this season with Brendan Rodgers watching for himself at the recent FA Cup tie between Wigan and MK Dons.

Child porn: Pundit Ross McFarlane, pictured, downloaded the images four months after he was convicted . A Sky Sports commentator has been spared jail after he viewed child pornography for a second time just four months after he was last in court. Former professional golfer Ross McFarlane, 52, was an occasional pundit for the TV channel - where chiefs, unaware he had any convictions at all, have said he will never appear again. He used two computers to search for images of children as young as seven, despite a court ordering his internet use to be restricted . Police were alerted by the tracking software installed after his previous offence, which found he was viewing photos of adults having sex with children. He had been convicted of making indecent images of children in March 2012 and was handed a two-year community order and a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. A fixture on Sky viewers’ screens . since 2001, McFarlane initially denied he had been looking for child . porn and said he had accessed legal porn websites. But in . a second interview he admitted accessing the images and . said he was very down and depressed as he was going through a divorce. 'The searches he had made included pre-teen models and drunk teens,' said Graham Smith, prosecuting. When police searched his home late last year, they found another, untracked laptop with more pornographic images. Graham Smith, prosecuting, said: 'In July 2012 officers became alarmed due to the nature of the websites he was accessing. 'In October whoever was using the . computer was searching out indecent images and in November they (the . officers) seized his laptop.' Aylesbury Crown Court heard the websites included references to teens and young girls. Most of the photos were of girls as young as seven who were scantily-clad but not nude, but some were of child sex, the court heard. Mr Smith said of the 162 images found on the monitored HP laptop, 132 were at level one, the least severe, with one at level two, 17 at level three and 12 at level four. Sentence: Mr McFarlane pleaded guilty to two offences at Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire (pictured) On the second laptop were 23 images at level one and two at level three. McFarlane became a professional golfer in 1979 and won the Deutsche Bank Open of Europe in 1997, his only European Tour tournament win. That year he achieved his highest ranking of 26th on the tour. His father Noel played for Manchester United’s youth side in the mid-1950s which featured many members of the Busby Babes side, killed in the Munich air crash in 1958. Mitigation: McFarlane told police he had been depressed about going through a divorce . In mitigation, Helen Warren told the court: 'He is horrified to find himself here and is extremely upset, not just for himself but for those that know him.' She said McFarlane, dressed in a beige Hugo Boss jacket, black trousers and a white shirt, had sought rehabilitation and counselling since his arrest. 'He is very ashamed of himself and what he has put his family through,' she added. 'His employer was previously unaware of these proceedings so he does not think he will have a job for much longer.' Judge Johanna Cutts told McFarlane: 'This is not a victimless crime. They are children Mr McFarlane, children. They are abused and photographed to gratify men like you. 'You have children. How would you like it if they had been treated like this?' McFarlane, of Stoke Poges, . Buckinghamshire, admitted making indecent images and breaching his . five-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order. Watched by his ex-wife, he was handed 10 months' jail, suspended for two years, given a 10-year order banning him from contact with children under 16 without parental permission and monitoring and limiting his internet use. He was ordered to sign onto the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years. He was also ordered to pay £340 costs. A spokesman for Sky Sports said it had been unaware of either of McFarlane’s convictions and added that he had been used 'sporadically', around 10 times per year. 'Ross was an occasional, freelance golf expert and, of course, he will not be appearing again,' he said.","Former pro golfer Ross McFarlane, from Buckinghamshire, was TV pundit .

Manchester City are in talks over a £35million deal to sign Porto centre back Eliaquim Mangala and his team-mate Fernando. They may struggle to pull off the double transfer before Friday’s 11pm deadline  but City are determined to seal the deals no later than this summer. They have been encouraged by a significant shift in Porto’s position over the last 48 hours after the cash-strapped  Portuguese club indicated they are willing to reduce the asking price if it means having the money in the bank now. Top targets: Fernando (left) and Eliaquim Mangala (right) could join City before the transfer deadline . Hitting the heights: Frenchman Mangala has been tracked by City for some time . City have been tracking Mangala, 22, for some time knowing the buyout clause in the Frenchman’s contract is £37.8m. Porto value Fernando, 26, at £7m even though the defensive midfielder from Brazil will be a free agent in the summer. However, it is understood that a joint figure of £35m could be agreed if City are prepared to do business before Friday's deadline. That would be another remarkable statement of intent by Manuel Pellegrini’s side, who have taken the Barclays  Premier League by storm after spending more than £100m on new signings last summer. Mangala has interested a number of top clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, but Pellegrini identified the former Standard Liege defender as his top target some time ago. The City manager has been in the hunt for a new centre back since last summer, when he failed to sign Pepe from Real Madrid and then compromised by bringing in Martin Demichelis from neighbours Atletico. The uncertainty over the Mangala deal is believed to be the reason why Joleon Lescott’s future at City has been left in the balance. A deal is in place for Lescott to join West Ham, with the England defender desperate for regular first-team football to safeguard his World Cup hopes. Equally, the bid for Fernando will cast further doubt over the City futures of Jack Rodwell and Javi Garcia, neither of whom has impressed since arriving in 2012. Wanted: Mangala has shown his talents this season with the Portuguese giants . In tow? Fernando (right) could be on his way to the Etihad for £7million . Strengthening: Manuel Pellegrini (left) is hoping to bolster his defensive options at City . Future partner? Vincent Kompany may be lining up alongside Mangala in the City back line . Meanwhile, Pellegrini is set to be without top scorer Sergio Aguero for Monday’s match with Chelsea at the Etihad after the Argentina striker limped out of Wednesday’s 5-1 win at Tottenham with a hamstring injury. Aguero could face a race to be fit for the Champions League showdown with Barcelona next month. Uncertainty: Joleon Lescott (right) could be on his way out if the pair join from Porto . The competition: Martin Demichelis (left) and Matija Nastasic (right) have been rotated this season . At £28million, Eliaquim Mangala seems rather pricey for an unknown centre half currently playing in Portugal? Maybe, but believe it or not, City are getting him on the cheap. The 22-year-old’s buy-out clause at Porto is £37.8m, and only the attraction of up-front cash from Manchester is persuading them to let him go for less. He began his career with Standard Liege in Belgium  — is Vincent Kompany set to welcome a fellow countryman to the Etihad? No, Mangala is actually French. Born in the Parisian suburb of Colombes, his family moved to Belgium when he was five to live in the French-speaking town of Namur. Mangala qualified for a Belgian passport, but elected to answer a call-up from France’s Under 21 squad after making his name at Liege, and won his first full cap in a friendly against Uruguay last June, two years after his £6.5m move to Porto. He’s used to moving around then? Yes, off and on the pitch. He began life as a striker growing up in Belgium, but switched to left back when he joined Liege. He then shone as a deep-lying midfielder, but eventually ended up as a stylish central defender. Does he have any previous experience of English football? He certainly does. At the age of just 18, Mangala scored Standard Liege’s first ever Champions League goal, in September 2009, against Arsenal. He’s been on the radar of the Premier  League’s big boys ever since.

A mother of two who vowed not to be ‘fat and 40’ has lost half her bodyweight - and finally feels confident enough to wear a dress for the first time in 20 years. Lisa Kirkham, 42, tipped the scales at more than 18st at her heaviest, but after ditching a calorific diet of crisps, chocolate, and fizzy drinks in favour of green tea and fresh fruit and vegetables, she now weighs in at a svelte 9st 10lb. Lisa hadn’t worn a dress since her wedding day in 1993 when she married husband Philip, 51, but she’s now become a shadow of her former self after dropping an incredible eight dress sizes. Lisa dropped from 18 stone and a size 26 (right) to 9 stone 10lbs and a trim size 10 (left) Desperate Lisa joined Weight Watchers with her sister, and soon began to shed the pounds, dropping 8 dress sizes . Lisa, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'I had to do something because I didn’t want to be fat and 40 and I wanted to be well for my children as they grew up. 'My eating habits have changed completely, and it’s all about mind over matter. 'When I look back at pictures, I feel like a different person. 'I still don’t think of myself as skinny, but my seven-year-old niece doesn’t recognise the old me, and that makes me feel skinny.' It took an appointment with a skin consultant for it to hit home with Lisa that she needed to do something about her weight. Lisa pictured in the summer 2013, during her battle to lose half of her body weight . Lisa and her husband Philip on their wedding day in 1993, then a size 16 . She said: 'I was under investigation for a skin problem and I had to take my top off to show him my skin. 'That’s what sparked it, and I knew I had to do something. The hospital was sorting my skin out and my health was starting to suffer. 'I was wearing anything black or dark-coloured and elasticated, and there was no way you would catch me in anything where my legs were on show. 'I had weight problems from being a teenager but after I had my children the weight piled on over about a year or so and there was no incentive to lose it because I was stuck at home.' Despite being a size 16 when she got married more than two decades ago, Lisa’s weight gradually increased until she was buying size 26 clothes. She tried numerous shock diets and in a matter of months lost four stone, but it was a quick fix so within months she put the weight straight back on. Lisa, here with her son Michael, then 15, on her 40th birthday.Lisa promised herself she would ditch her  unhealthy habits and excess weight to avoid being 'fat at 40' Desperate to tackle her excess bulge, . Lisa joined Weight Watchers with her sister, and soon began to shed the . pounds through the ProPoints plan . 'I was losing on average about four pounds a week,' she said. 'I’d set myself little goals so I had something to aim for and I started doing things for charity as a way to start keeping fit. 'I . stopped eating so much fatty food and started eating fresher meals and . cutting down on my portion sizes, and my stomach shrunk.' Her success quickly showed, and Lisa, an administrator, started receiving compliments on her slim new figure. Petite . 5ft 3in Lisa said: 'Before I started losing weight, I didn’t want to . draw attention to myself, but now my confidence is unbelievable. 'I . was very shy because I was worried if I said something stupid or acted . silly while out with my friends that people would just laugh at me . because I was fat. 'But now I will approach people that I’ve never met before rather than just sticking to people I know.' And Lisa began to notice the change in herself as she quickly moved through the dress sizes, now wearing a size 10. Lisa started eating fresher meals and cutting down on my portion sizes, dropping half her body weight meaning her sons Michael, 17, and Jonathan, 13, can now pick her up . She said: 'I was always having to replace my wardrobe to keep up with the weight loss, and the amount of stuff I’ve given to charity is unbelievable because things just don’t look right when they’re baggy. 'I can buy clothes which are actually in style now, and my feet have gone from a size six to a size four-and-a-half as well.

'I’ve got more energy than them and my husband put together now!' Where as Lisa would binge on sandwiches with mayonnaise and butter, chicken and chips and burgers before, she now prefers a diet of lean meat and vegetables with a low-calorie hot chocolate for a treat. Lisa added: 'Don’t get me wrong, I do still eat a big bag of Maltesers on a Thursday after Weight Watchers but I can control my diet for the rest of the week, and you’re not supposed to deprive yourself. 'I eat soup, I drink lots of green tea and I do a lot of walking. 'I only have potatoes once a week and I find it very easy to say no now, plus I weigh everything and make sure my portion is smaller than  I give to Philip and the boys. 'I'm really pleased. I would never put the weight back on, and people say that if I can do it, anyone can do it. Just by small changes you can make a big difference.' Lisa’s slimming club leader, Francine Sheridan, said: 'Lisa is an inspiration to anyone losing weight. I have got to know her and was so proud of her when she reached her goal. 'The support she has given to other members has been amazing, encouraging them to join her at swimming or walking outside of the meetings. She provides ideas, recipes, and motivation in the meeting and on our Facebook page and we are lucky to have her as part of our family.'","Lisa dropped from 18st and a size 26 to 9st 10lb and a trim size 10 .

In response to the comments Cook made . during the interview,  Brinkley's attorney, Tom Campagna, released the . following statement: . 'Peter Cook has repeatedly broken the . confidentiality agreement that Christie has continued to uphold. Peter . is the only one to go on national television spewing sexist, . disgraceful, demonstrably false lies, which gives a taste of what . Christie has had to endure since Peter betrayed his marriage vows. Peter . embarrassed himself and hurt his family by having an affair with a . teenage girl and admitting to an extensive pornography habit.' The supermodel recently claimed that she is being bullied by him in a string of nasty emails. Last weekend it was revealed that Ms . Brinkley, 58, wants Mr Cook to cough up $140,000 in fines over the . emails, in addition to $32,000 in expenses for their two children, . including school tuition and summer camp fees. A source told the New York Daily News: . 'Peter keeps trying to control Christie, and he can’t deal with the . fact that he can’t control her'. Mr Campagna told . the paper that a judge smacked Mr Cook with an order after their . divorce that he be fined $5,000 for each time he got out of hand with Ms . Brinkley.

This is about what we're calling bullying'. Last week, Mr Cook lashed out at the supermodel in an explosive court document countering claims he owes her child support. Mr Cook, 53, reignited their bitter . custody dispute, claiming in a 91-page document at Suffolk County . Supreme Court in New York that she owes him money - calling her a . 'narcissistic egomaniac'. The architect claims he is owed . $25,000 from Ms Brinkley for caring for their children while she . performed in Chicago on New York’s Broadway and London's West End, the . New York Post reported. He also claims Ms Brinkley is dragging . their two children into their disputes, claiming she has called him . 'truly narcissistic', and once wrote an email to their son that Mr Cook . 'is jealous of my success'. Ms Brinkley met Mr Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him. Mr Cook legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack. She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, with second husband, musician Billy Joel. Ms Brinkley appeared in several of his music videos, including the 1983 hit Uptown Girl. They were married for nine years. But Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading jabs with Mr Cook since their acrimonious split in 2008. Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn. He was also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, Diana Bianchi, who was 18 at the time. During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet. Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr . Cook was a bad father who used 'overwhelming' physical force when . disciplining the children. The court psychiatrist said both parties needed therapy. Blue-eyed and blonde-haired Ms .

But two entrepreneurs have set up a subterranean garden in former World War Two air raid shelters in south London. The 2.5-acre 'farm', created by Richard Ballard and Steven Dring, sits in dark, confined tunnels under the Northern Line, near Clapham North station. Scroll down for video . Unusual setting: Entrepreneurs Richard Ballard (pictured) and Steven Dring have set up a subterranean garden in former World War Two air raid shelters in London . Lighting: The 2.5-acre 'farm' uses  low energy LED bulbs and a hydroponics system to grow a range of crops . Historic: The bomb shelters are part of the Clapham North tunnels, which opened to the public in July 1944 . Historic: Equipped with bunks, medical posts, kitchens and sanitation, the tunnels were constructed to accommodate up to 8,000 people, but more than 12,000 people swarmed into the tunnels during one raid . It uses special low energy LED bulbs and an integrated hydroponics system to grow a range of micro-herbs, shoots, miniature vegetables and other delicacies. Mr Ballard and Mr Dring have spent the past 18 . months conducting trials in the tunnels - with the first produce . expected to start growing in March. The crops - sold under the brand name 'Growing Underground' - are expected to hit restaurants, supermarkets and wholesalers later this year. They will include a range of . exotic herbs and shoots, including pea shoots, rocket, red amaranth (a leafy vegetable and grain), mizuna, broccoli, garlic chives, red vein sorrel, mustard leaf, radish, coriander and Thai basil. Team: Mr Ballard (left) and Mr Dring (right) have joined forces with acclaimed chef Michel Roux Jr (centre) Harvesting produce: The enterpeneurs have spent the past 18 months conducting trials in the historic tunnels . Crops: The produce is expected to be sold to restaurants, supermarkets and wholesalers later this year . Packaged: It will include a range of herbs, including watercress (left), pea shoots and red amaranth (right) Meanwhile, edible . flowers and miniature vegetables will also be grown in the 'farm' - with plans . to move onto heritage tomato varieties and mushrooms. Mr Ballard and Mr Dring have joined forces with Michelin-starred chef Michel Roux Jr, who has joined the company as a director. He will advise the pair on crop selection, product design and partnerships. Plants and herbs need two things to grow - light and soil. Underground tunnels have neither, but both can be substituted for LED lights and a hydroponic system. LED lights provide plants with the wavelengths of light they need for photosynthesis - essential for growth. Modern LED systems can allow plants to grow perfectly normally without the need for real sunlight. Hydroponics technology allows plants to be grown without soil. It works by dissolving the nutrients that a plant would normally get from soil into water. The roots of a plant or herb can then be suspended, flooded, or even misted with the nutrient-rich solution, allowing it to grow successfully. Mr Roux Jr, who runs the acclaimed Le Gavroche restaurant,  said: 'When I first met these guys I thought they were absolutely crazy. 'But . when I visited the tunnels and sampled the delicious produce they are . already growing down there I was blown away. The market for this produce . is huge.' In order to successfully grow the crops, the temperature in the tunnels is kept at 16 degrees celsius, while produce is grown in specially-designed three-layered platforms. Meanwhile, special filters are used to keep the air in the tunnels free of pests, eliminating the need for pesticides. The underground caverns are part of the Clapham North tunnels - under Clapham North tube station - which were completed in 1942 and opened to the public in July 1944. Equipped with bunks, medical posts, kitchens and sanitation, they were constructed to accommodate up to 8,000 people. However, more than 12,000 people swarmed into the tunnels during a bombing raid on July 24, 1944. Mr Ballard and Mr Dring hope the new crop 'farm' will help the country to achieve a carbon-free economy and successfully deal with the pressures of urban population growth. The tunnels will be carbon neutral, with any energy needs coming from green suppliers - while food miles will also be kept to a minimum thanks to the central London location. Tube: The tunnels sit more than 100ft below Clapham North tube station (pictured) in south-east London . Ready to sell: Exotic herbs, such as Thai basil (above), will be among the crops grown in the air raid shelters . Fresh: Vegetables such as broccoli (left) and red sorrel, peashoots and radish (right) will also be grown . The entrepreneurs have now started fundraising to accelerate the development of the business. 'Steve and I are thrilled to be close to getting Growing Underground under way. We've been experimenting for months,' said Mr Ballard. 'Now that we've secured the site we're kicking off a crowd-funding campaign today. We have a detailed business plan and we've already had lots of interest from private investors. 'We're confident that investors of all sizes will see a significant return on their investment. Hopeful: Mr Ballard (left) and Mr Dring (right) are fundraising to accelerate the development of the business. 'Integrating farming into the urban . environment makes a huge amount of sense and we're delighted that we're . going to make it a reality.' He added that Chris Nelson, an expert horticulturalist used to growing crops in some of the harshest conditions on the planet, will be acting as the company's advisor. 'There is no 'could', 'might' or 'maybe' about our underground farm,' he said. 'We will be up and running and will be supplying produce later this year.' Investors are invited to buy a stake in Growing Underground from Â£10, while Â£25,000 will enable them to have voting rights. The duo are aiming to raise Â£1million from their crowdfunding drive and hope to employ up to 15 staff at the south London site.","Garden set up more than 100ft below Northern Line in south London .

Camp 16 in the 1980s and 1990s, revealed the horror of daily life for prisoners at the site near Hwaseong in North Hamgyong province, which is approximately 215 square miles. He broke his silence to tell Amnesty International, which is banned in the Communist country, about the methods used to execute prisoners incarcerated in the Soviet-style, hidden 'gulags'. Now: . Two satellite images of a village in the northern part of North Korean . political camp 16 (Kwanliso). This one was take on 04 April . 2013. The photo below was taken 23 September 2011 . Then:  The guard post in the immediate vicinity of the village allows . for constant supervision of the prisoners and is indicative of the tight . security within the political prison camp . Expanding: A satellite image from Kwanliso 16, taken on 26 May 2013. Close to the main entrance, shows two more housing units under construction, showing ten 4 x 3.5 metre units in each building . According to Mr Lee, . women were killed after being brutally raped. 'After . a night of ""servicing"" the officials, the women had to die because the . secret could not get out. This happens at most of the political prison . camps,' he said. He also told how detainees were . forced to dig their own graves and were then killed with hammer blows to . their necks. Mr Lee witnessed prison officers strangling detainees and . then beating them to death with wooden sticks at the camp. Today . North Korea’s vast infrastructure of repression was exposed in new . satellite images showing the development of two of the country’s largest . political prison camps. In . a comprehensive mapping of camps, known as kwanliso, '15' and '16', . Amnesty International found new housing blocks, an expansion of work . facilities and tight security with perimeter fences and guard towers . clearly visible. The latest images, taken in May, . indicate a slight increase in kwanliso 16’s population, with newly-built . housing blocks clearly visible - in 2011 it was . estimated to have at least 20,000 people detained. Significant economic activity - such as . mining, logging and agriculture - is clearly visible in the satellite . images and there is an expansion of an industrial area within kwanliso . 16. Forced hard labour is . common in North Korea’s political prison camps which hold an estimated 130,000 prisoners. Two satellite images of the same central (administrative) area of Kwanliso 16 taken on May 18 2011 (below) and May 26 2013 (above).  The area appears to have undergone change in the observation time frame, including the razing and reconstruction of housing structures . The images show that instead of heeding the growing calls for closing its political prison camps, repression by the North Korean authorities has continued and the prisoner population appears to have slightly increased . Perimeter: Satellite image of Kwanliso 15, taken on 16 September 2013. The camp is surrounded by a double fence along its perimeter and numerous guard posts. Access is highly restricted through two gates on opposite sides of the political prison camp . Restricted: Movement appears to be restricted within the camps as this satellite image of political prison camp Kwanliso 16, shows a checkpoint on the main road . Testimony from former . detainees and officials reveals how prisoners spend most of their time . being forced to work in extremely dangerous conditions with inadequate . food and very little sleep. Hundreds of thousands of people, . including children, are detained in political prison camps and other . detention facilities in North Korea. Many have not committed any crime . whatsoever but are merely family members of those deemed guilty. They . are detained as a form of collective punishment known officially in . North Korea as 'guilt-by-association'. The . new images of Camp 15 - also known as 'Yodok'- show that 39 housing . blocks have been demolished since Amnesty last assessed satellite . pictures of the camp in 2011. Women are routinely raped at the largest political prison camp in North Korea before 'disappearing', according to a former security official who used to work at one of the sites (left):  Kim Young-soon, a former detainee in Camp 15 between 1980 and 1989, described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees who were caught attempting to escape (right) These images of prison camp 15 show a compound being built between March 2011 (left) and February 2012 (right). Amnesty said the function of the compound is unclear but is likely to be either a guard station or an administrative area to support logging activities . These satellite images of prison camp 15 show the changes in production activity. The first was taken in March, 2011, and the second was taken in September this year. Amnesty said these images and ones of prison camp 16 that instead of heeding the growing calls for closing its political prison camps, repression by the North Korean authorities has continued . Only six new housing blocks have been built in the camp which covers an area of 142 square miles, and is located in central North Korea around 45 miles from the capital Pyongyang. In 2011, an estimated 50,000 people were imprisoned in the camp, with the population concentrated in river valleys. As with kwanliso 16, security remains extremely tight in Yodok, and there is significant economic activity. Kim . Young-soon, a former detainee in Camp 15 between 1980 and 1989, . described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees who were . caught attempting to escape. She explained how they were first 'half beaten to death' and then:  'They . were brought to a stage after they were badly beaten. The prisoners . were tied to wooden stakes and shot three times in their head, chest and . feet.' This satellite image of camp 16, taken on June 2010, shows building work at the facility. The camp has seen an increase in prisoner numbers, Amnesty said . This image of the same camp, taken in November 2012, shows a new operational industrial facility and new support buildings . These images of camp 15 taken in March 2011 (left) and September 2013 (right) show logging is heavily visible at the prison . Amnesty has shared the latest evidence with the UN Commission of Inquiry investigating human rights abuses in North Korea. The report is entitled North Korea: Continued Investment in the Infrastructure of Repression and its author Amnesty International’s North Korea. Researcher Rajiv Narayan, said: 'Under its new leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea is violating every conceivable human right. 'The camps are a gruesome and powerful tool at the heart of a vast network of repression. 'People . are sent to the political prison camps without charge, let alone a . trial, many of them simply for knowing someone who has fallen out of . favour.'

'When I saw him, all I could say was ""You are a good man.""' Davis said Hrynkiw takes good care of himself and frequently walks for exercise.

After working for days without success to fix a cooling system problem that crippled the International Space Station, NASA announced today that a decision has been made to proceed with spacewalks in an effort to fix the problem externally. NASA has ordered up a series of urgent spacewalks to fix a broken cooling line at the International Space Station. Station managers decided on Tuesday to send two American astronauts out as soon as possible to replace a pump with a bad valve. It's a major job that will require three spacewalks â€” Saturday, Monday and next Wednesday on Christmas Day. Don't look down: NASA astronauts plan to perform three spacewalks, culminating in one on Christmas Day, to repair the International Space Station's coolant system . Chilly up here: A flow-control valve designed to carry ammonia along the outside of the station failed last week making it too cold . Expedition 38 crew members: NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio (2nd from left, back row) and NASA astronaut Michael Hopkins (far right, back row), both flight engineers will take part in the spacewalk including one on Christmas Day . Walkies: US astronaut Rick Mastracchio is likely to be one of those who will take part in a spacewalk. NASA said the spacewalks were scheduled for Saturday, Monday and next Wednesday . 'The next week will be busy with . space walks so not much tweeting from here,' NASA astronaut Rick . Mastracchio tweeted from space soon after the decision was announced. The spacewalks are taking priority . over the launch of a supply ship from Virginia. The commercial delivery . had been scheduled for this week, but is now delayed until at least . mid-January. Half of the station's cooling system . shut down last Wednesday, forcing the six-man crew to turn off all . nonessential equipment, including some science experiments. Because of . the valve failure, one of the two cooling lines became too cold. The space station cooling system, . which runs ammonia through the lines, is critical for dispelling heat . generated by on-board equipment. What a view! After working for days without success to fix a cooling system problem that crippled the ISS, NASA has announced that a decision has been made to proceed with spacewalks in an effort to fix the problem externally . If anyone can fix it, this man can: Expedition 38 astronauts Rick Mastracchio and rookie Mike Hopkins will attempt to remove an ammonia pump module on the station's starboard side and replace it with one of three spares . Houston, we have a problem: The space agency confirmed Tuesday afternoon the launch of a cargo resupply mission whose rocket rolled to its Virginia launch pad Tuesday morning would be postponed until January . Go-time: The decision to do a spacewalk came after efforts to regulate temperatures in one of the station's two external loops apparently were unsuccessful . Heading out: Astronaut Rick Mastracchio, Expedition 38 flight engineer, will be one of those who will take part in the spacewalk . While the astronauts are safe and . comfortable, NASA wants the system back up to full strength, in case of . another failure that could leave the orbiting outpost even more . vulnerable than it is right now. Flight controllers tried in vain to . fix the valve remotely, then came up with a plan to use another valve to . regulate the temperature. Some success was reported, and for a while, . engineers thought the space station could limp along with the short-term . solution. But on Tuesday, managers opted for spacewalks right now. This is the same pump that was replaced by a pair of spacewalking astronauts in 2010. Three spacewalks were needed then. Mastracchio and astronaut Michael . Hopkins trained for just such a repair before rocketing into orbit. They . have been prepping all week, just in case of just such a decision.

Clark has spoken publicly of his long battle with alcohol, which he says also occurred during his NBA career. He now says he’s been sober for five months. He previously told the newspaper he wasn’t prepared mentally to handle the lifestyle of a professional athlete, and says he was already on a 'destructive path.' 'The money, the fame, the fact that I was on TV. People think money will make your life better. Money didn’t dissolve my problems. It increased them,' he said, adding that he’s been getting counselling while he’s in custody. Clark has been in the Vermilion County jail since August 4. Prosecutors said he will have to serve 50 per cent of his sentence, but he will receive credit for 138 days already served and must serve his sentences consecutively.

An eight-year-old double amputee who learned to swim with prosthetic flippers has taken to the pool with the tail-less dolphin that inspired him. Cieran Kelso flew to Florida from England for the rare opportunity to swim with Winter, a dolphin at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium and star of the movie 'Dolphin Tale', that uses a prosthetic tail. It was something the water baby could relate with. After losing both his legs to meningitis when he was just one, Cieran also uses custom-made prosthetic flippers to swim. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Inspirational: Amputee Cieran Kelso, 8, this month fulfilled his long-held dream of swimming with Winter the tail-less dolphin at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, Florida. Cieran was obsessed with Winter after seeing her in the movie 'Dolphin Tale' Beautiful: Before they swam together earlier this month, double amputee Cieran Kelso, 8, was inspired by Winter the tail-less dolphin who learned to swim with a prosthetic tail . 'His first words when he saw the film was, 'Winter's disabled just . like me,' said Cieran's father, Gary Kelso. 'There are some pretty raw . feelings that go into seeing Cieran swim with the dolphin.' The . family, from Northwich, in Cheshire, kept the trip a secret from the boy until August 16th when they . were on the flight to Florida. The flight attendants announced the trip . was a surprise visit to Winter's home, organised by local tourism officials at Visit St Pete/Clearwater. Cieran's dream had come true. On . the day of his swim, trainer Cammie Zodrow urged Cieran to tap Winter, . the signal to raise her tail. 'You guys are best friends now,' Zodrow . told Cieran, whose smile grew wider. He then held onto Winter's fin and swam beside her, swimming in circles and backward for several laps. For more than an hour, Winter and Cieran - . at first alone with the trainer, then joined by his five-year-old sister, . Layla-Eve, and Winter's 'sister' Hope - swam in the tank. Cieran's stepmother, Gemma Kelso, 29, told MailOnline: 'I think he was in shock when he found out he could swim with her. 'He thought he would only be able to meet her - he was just the second visitor to be allowed to swim with her as well. Cieran held onto Winter's fin and swam beside her, swimming in circles for more than an hour. His sister, Layla-Eva, five, also swam with Winter . Cieran's stepmother Gemma Kelso, 29, told MailOnline: 'I think he was in shock when he found out he could swim with her. It was so overwhelming.' Cieran is pictured feeding Winter . 'It was so overwhelming. He had dreamed of it for so long.' She added: 'On the film he saw himself in the dolphin. He can swim like her. 'He felt like he was like Winter. He had never seen an injured animal like that before. 'He said that she was his friend, he identified with her. Winter lost her tail in a an accident involving a crab trap. She was fitted with a prosthetic by staff at Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Cieran felt he could associate with her because her tail is like his prosthetic flippers . Cieran's stepmother said that he views Winter as a friend and that it is now his ambition to go back to Florida to work with her . 'There is a massive bond. You could see the way they were in the water together - they were very calm together. 'Since . we got back he is calmer and more content in himself. His dream job is . now to go back and look after Winter - he no longer wants to be a train . driver!' Cieran said he was Winter's biggest fan and he could have swum with the dolphin 'for a million hours'. Dream come true: Cieran Kelso sits with Winter the tail-less dolphin (left) and Hope in the dolphin's tank at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium after swimming with Winter . A family affair: Cieran Kelso, 8, with his father Gary, stepmother Gemma, his siblings and Winter the dolphin at Clearwater Marine Aquarium, in Clearwater, Florida . 'It was greater than great,' he said after his swim. Planning for the visit took about a year, during which Cieran's parents struggled to keep the process a secret. Cieran was just hours from death after he was struck down with meningitis as a baby. Despite pulling through he had to have both legs amputated below the knee and also lost the tips of most of his fingers. Tragic: Cieran Kelso's legs were amputated and he lost his fingertips after contracting meningococcal septicaemia when he was one. Before his parents bought him a new pair of limbs, he was given prosthetics on the NHS but they didn't fit properly . He . was later fitted with false legs and given a wheelchair to help him get . around but he desperately wanted to swim with his friends. That's when his father Gary and stepmother Gemma spent months fundraising on his behalf. They raised enough money to pay for a custom-made pair of legs that could be used in water. Paul Leishman at the Leeds branch of The London Prosthetics Clinic also made him a pair of flippers that attach to the ends of the feet. Making a splash: Cieran Kelso struggled to balance in the water before he was fitted with new limbs. His step-mum Gemma and dad Gary raised $18,600 to buy him legs that fit and can be worn all day . Waterbaby: Cieran is now speedy in the swimming pool thanks to his new prosthetic legs and custom-made flippers . 'Cieran loves swimming and has been having swimming lessons for just over a year but he couldn't propel himself through the water or stay afloat as easily as everyone else,' Gemma said. 'As soon as Cieran first wore the flippers it was incredible the speed he could travel through the water, his instructor even had to swim with him to keep up. 'We want Cieran to see that even though his legs were taken away by his meningitis he can still follow his dreams and be like his friends, just sometimes we have to make slight adaptations to aid him along the way.'

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford may have offered $5,000 and a car to suspected drug dealers to buy back a video that appears to show him smoking crack, court documents suggest. In police wiretaps of alleged gang members one is heard telling another that he rejected the offer for the tape and planned to meet the mayor and ask for '150,' meaning $150,000. Elsewhere in the recordings the men spoke about delivering drugs to Ford and having pictures of him using drugs. Embattled: Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford is mobbed by reporters in this October 31 file photo. Tapes that suggest he tried to buy back the video showing him smoking the drug were played in court . On one wiretap on April 20, an alleged gang member is heard saying, 'Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today' and that he would post a picture on Instagram. On another wiretap, one man says he has many pictures of Ford 'doing the hezza,' which police say is known to be slang for heroin. Another man suggests those pictures would be worth a lot, the document says. The mayor addressed the issue during an appearance today on a Washington-based sports talk show to make NFL picks on WJFK-FM. 'Number . one that's an outright lie and number two you can talk to my lawyers . about it, but I'm here to talk about football guys,' Ford said. Since the news broke in the Toronto Star and U.S. news website Gawker he has actually enjoyed a boost in popularity with the electorate. He acknowledged last month that he smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' about a year ago. The admission came only after he previously denied the existence of the video. Ford has refused to resign as mayor of Toronto, Canada's largest city and financial capital, despite mounting pressure after a string of incidents that have embarrassed his constituents, from public drunkenness to appearing in another video that showed him threatening 'murder' in an incoherent rant. In response, the city's council has stripped him of most of his powers. Ford attends the 47th Cavalcade of Lights in Toronto: Since the news of his crack use and ongoing coverage of his antics, the Toronto mayor has actually enjoyed a boost in popularity with his electorate . Ford poses for another picture with voters: He acknowledged last month that he smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' about a year ago. The admission came after he previously denied the existence of the video . Ford admitted that he smoked crack cocaine after police said they had obtained a video during an investigation into his friend Alexander Lisi that appears to show him puffing on a crack pipe. The newly released court documents say police heard on the wiretaps that Ford had his phone stolen or lost it at a home they believe to be a crack house and that Lisi was trying to get it back. Police say they overheard that Lisi threatened to 'put the heat on' the gang if he didn't get Ford's phone back and that the alleged gang members said they would not tolerate Lisi's threats because they had a picture of Ford 'on a pipe,' which police believed meant a crack pipe. Police say Lisi gave the men marijuana in exchange for the return of the mayor's phone. Comic figure: Ford has refused to resign as mayor of Toronto, Canada's largest city and financial capital, despite mounting pressure after a string of incidents that have embarrassed his constituents . Dennis Morris, Ford's lawyer, said the wiretaps are snippets of alleged gangsters who are talking among themselves. 'It's very dangerous to put any weight into any of this,' Mr Morris told The Associated Press. 'There's nothing to address.' City councilor Joe Mihevc said police need to examine the allegations that Ford tried to obtain the tape. 'The mayor can't come out and say, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,""' said Mr Mihevc. 'This man needs help. He needs a lot of help.' Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair declined to comment on the newly released documents. The wiretaps are evidence in the case against Lisi, who faces trial on drug and extortion charges. The mayor has not been charged. 'All of the evidence that was gathered in that case has been reviewed by investigators and with the Crown prosecutors in this case, and where reasonable and probable grounds to lay a charge exists, charges have been laid,' said Mr Blair. Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video that purportedly shows Ford smoking crack . Police were in the midst of a drug and weapons investigation involving alleged members of the Dixon Bloods gang when the mayor's name surfaced on wiretaps in March and April. Police didn't open an investigation into Ford and Lisi until May, when U.S. website Gawker and the Toronto Star reported that alleged drug dealers were shopping around the crack video. Ford says he has quit drinking and adopted a healthier lifestyle. And he's not avoiding the spotlight. He's agreed to appear on a Washington-based sports talk show to make NFL picks. Councillor Janet Davis said the image of Ford laughing at the newest revelations demonstrates his arrogance and lack of judgment. 'If he laughed today, and thousands and thousands of people of the city of Toronto saw that he was laughing at what was revealed today, it will just simply deepen the anger toward this man,' said Mr Davis.","Police wiretaps apparently record alleged gangsters discussing the offer .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:28 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:55 EST, 5 December 2013 . Security experts have uncovered a cache of some 2 million pilfered passwords to popular social media websites including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yahoo from Internet users across the globe. Researchers with Trustwave's Chicago-based SpiderLabs said they discovered the credentials while investigating a server in the Netherlands that cyber criminals use to control a massive network of hacked computers known as the ‘Pony botnet.’ The company said Wednesday that it has reported its findings to the largest of more than 90,000 websites and Internet service providers whose customers' credentials it had found on the server. 'Dislike': Hackers stole usernames and passwords to more than 326,000 Facebook Inc accounts . The data includes more than 326,000 Facebook Inc accounts; some 60,000 Google Inc accounts; more than 59,000 Yahoo Inc accounts and nearly 22,000 Twitter Inc accounts, according to SpiderLabs. Victims were from the U.S., Germany, Singapore and Thailand, among other countries, with the Netherlands at the top of the list. Representatives for Facebook and Twitter said the companies have reset the passwords of affected users, but there were no word from Goggle or Yahoo. 'Facebook takes people’s information security extremely seriously and we work hard to protect it,' a statement from the company read. 'While details of this case are not yet clear, it appears that people’s computers may have been attacked by hackers using malware to scrape information directly from their Web browsers.' SpiderLabs said it has contacted authorities in the Netherlands and asked them to take down the rogue Pony botnet server. An analysis posted on the SpiderLabs blog showed that the most-common password in the set was ‘123456,’ which was used in nearly 16,000 accounts. Other commonly used credentials included ‘password,’ ‘admin,’ ‘123’ and ‘1.’ Under attack: Log-in information has been stolen for 60,000 Google accounts and more than 59,000 Yahoo accounts . Nearly 22,000 Twitter accounts were caught up in the hacking, which has been going on since late October . Graham Cluley, an independent security expert, said it is extremely common for people to use such simple passwords and also re-use them on multiple accounts, even though they are extremely easy to crack. ‘People are using very dumb passwords. They are totally useless,’ he said. Researchers at the security company Trustwave analyzed the passwords compromised and found that only 5 per cent were excellent and 17 per cent were good. The rest were moderate or worse . CNN Money reported that the virus was installed in late October on an untold number of computers around the globe to net in credentials and then send them to a server controlled by the hackers. Late last month, cyber security experts found the server in the Netherlands jam-packed with usernames and passwords for more than 93,000 sites. Trove: Cyber security experts found a rogue server in the Netherlands filled with usernames and passwords for more than 93,000 sites . Besides Twitter and Facebook, the hackers potentially compromised accounts on the Russian social media forum Odnoklassniki, LinkedIn and also ADP, which is used by numerous companies to manage payroll. ‘We don't have evidence they logged into these accounts, but they probably did,’ said John Miller, a security research manager at Trustwave.","Hackers possibly compromised 326,000 Facebook accounts; 60,000 Google accounts; 59,000 Yahoo accounts and 22,000 Twitter accounts .

Blame game: David Wildstein, who personally oversaw the George Washington Bridge lane closures, says he has evidence that Chris Christie lied . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie knew about the plans to block entrances to the George Washington Bridge, despite his repeated claims to the contrary, a key Port Authority official said today. Furthermore, David Wildstein - Christie's childhood friend who personally oversaw the traffic disruption in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in September - says he has documents that prove Christie was lying. Mr Wildstein's bombshell revelation in the 'Bridgegate' scandal is the first indication Cristie may have had involved in the debacle. If proven true, the charges could have tremendous implications for Christie and his political future, both in New Jersey and in the wider nation. The recently-reelected Republican is considered a top presidential contender for 2016. There are multiple ongoing investigations of the scandal - including criminal probes by the U.S Attorney and the FBI. The governor's office denied Mr Wildstein's claims and a statement released Friday reiterated Christie's position all along: 'He had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr./Wildstein's motivations were for closing them to begin with.' Mr Wildstein also alleged that the bridge disruption took place to pressure opponents of a multimillion-dollar development in Fort Lee that has ties to the governor's allies. Initial reports  indicated that it was relation for the borough's mayor not supporting Christie's reelection campaign. In a letter released to multiple news outlets, Wildstein directly contradicted the governor's repeated statements that he had no involvement in or knowledge of the lane colsures that paralyzed Fort Lee for four days. 'Evidence exists... tying Mr Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated publicly in a two-hour press conference,' Alan Zegas, Wildstein's lawyer, said in a letter to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Scroll down for video . Telling the truth? Christie staked his reputation on a January 9 press conference in which he repeatedly denied knowing about the closures or having any involvement . He also claimed that the governor . lied to the public during his marathon January 9 press conference. During that nationally-televised appearance, Christie said he accepted . responsibility for the scandal but denied ordering the closures or . knowing that they had been orchestrated by his appointees and members of . his staff. 'I knew . nothing about this,' Christie told the nation. 'And until it started to . be reported in the papers about the closure, but even then I was told . this was a traffic study.' He laid all blame for the scandal on his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and on Wildstein and others at the Port Authority. 'Mr Wildstein contests the accuracy of various statements that the governor made about him and he can prove the inaccuracy of some,' the letter says. Wildstein's attorney did not discuss what the evidence was or reveal any details about it. Wildstein was one of Christie's appointees to the Port Authority, which controls the George Washington Bridge. He was also high school friend of Christie's - although the governor has claimed that they had minimal interaction with Wildstein since his appointment. He resigned earlier this month after emails emerged between him and Ms Kelly in which they discussed closing the lanes and toll plazas in Fort Lee. The emails included Ms Kelly telling Wildstein, 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.' All but two lanes of the Fort Lee approach to the George Washington Bridge were closed for four days in September - paralyzing the borough and frustrating tens of thousands of commuters . The document also includes allegations that the bridge was closed to gain leverage for development deals. 'There have been reports that certain Commissioners of the Port Authority have been connected... to land deals involving the Port Authority, that Port Authority funds were allocated to projects connected to persons who supported the administration of Governor Chris Christie,' the letter reads. Additionally: 'That Port Authority funds were held back from those who refused to support the Governor.' The three-page letter was written by Mr Wildstein's attorney as an attempt to get the Port Authority to pay for his legal bills as several agencies, including the FBI, investigate the scandal. In addition to Ms Kelley and Mr Wildstein, two other Christie confidantes also were let go. His top deputy at the Port Authority, Bill Baroni, resigned after telling a legislative panel the lane closings were for a traffic pattern study, and two-time campaign manager Bill Stepien was told to step aside after he appeared to gloat over the traffic chaos in private emails released during the investigation. Christie, who has a reputation for engendering loyalty and insisting on discipline among his subordinates, explained at a December news conference that he learned of his aides' involvement when an original batch of subpoenaed emails was published. Backup: The gridlock caused by the lane closures led to major traffic problems in Fort Lee - including delays for ambulances and police officers .","David Wildstein says he has documents tying Governor Christie to the closures at the Fort Lee approach to the George Washington Bridge .

A Wisconsin Christian university is dropping the word 'Crusaders' from its sports teams, saying the word doesn't fit with a 'more global society.' The Maranatha Baptist University in Watertown and its sports teams have used the name since the college's founding in 1968. The decision coincides with a recent name change, from Maranatha Baptist Bible College to Maranatha Baptist University. Updating: The Maranatha Baptist University is dropping the name 'Crusaders' for its sports teams and mascot, but says it has not received any complaints about the name . The university's executive vice president stresses that the school has received no complaints about the name Crusaders. 'The heartbeat behind this was not political correctness, but expanded opportunities for our students,' Matt Davis told Fox News. Davis says the change had long been in discussion among the university's Board of Trustees, who decided that 2014 was the appropriate time. Tradition: The college has used the name Crusaders for nearly 50 years . The word Crusades - defined by . Merriam-Webster as 'any of the military expeditions undertaken by . Christian powers in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries to win the Holy . Land from the Muslims' - to some speaks of heroics, but for others - . namely Muslims - it speaks of bloody murder. 'Times . change and we understand that context changes,' Davis told Fox News. 'Our world has changed since 9/11 and we’ve become a more global society . with the Internet.' Ibrahim Hooper, communications director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told Mail Online that he welcomes the 'Crusaders' change, but said CAIR finds team names or mascots that incorporate race or ethnicity more problematic, particularly those pertaining to Native Americans. Changes: The school has recently changed its name from Maranatha Baptist Bible College to Maranatha Baptist University . 'Our main . concern has been with stereotypical and racist team mascots or school . nicknames,' he said, adding that he 'welcomes the spirit of change.' The university is now fielding suggestions from its students, stakeholders and alumni for a new name and mascot for its teams. 'We’re having a blast with the process,' said Davis. 'It’s a fun process, but it’s also a serious process.' The new name will be revealed in the spring. The university's mission is to provide a 'Christ-centered, biblically based liberal arts education... providing each student with a platform to fulfill God’s plan for his or her life.'","Maranatha Baptist University in Wisconsin is dropping the word 'Crusaders' from its sports teams .

Prof Bamforth said beer, particularly real ale, contains many nutrients that are important for a healthy body . Those who went on the wagon in January, giving up alcohol in a determined attempt to detox their body, may have done more harm than good. An American academic claims that drinking regularly, but in moderation, is more likely to ensure a healthy body than simply giving up. The claims come from Professor Charles Bamforth of the University of California, Davis and author of Beer, Health and Nutrition. The professor said it is well understood that drinking to excess can cause serious health problems, but he argues people should not assume that going without completely is healthy. ‘Many people don’t realise that drinking in moderation has significant health benefits and that moderate drinkers have a longer life expectancy than non – drinkers,’ he said. ‘Regular moderate intake of alcohol is good for the heart and blood circulation.’ He added: ‘The key is a little and often. 'You are seriously mistaken if you think that having a month without drinking will protect you from the effects of excessive drinking for the rest of the year. 'The best advice is to drink moderately throughout the year.’ The professor said that regular moderate intake of alcohol is good for the heart and blood circulation . Prof Bamforth said beer, particularly real ale, contains many nutrients that are important for a healthy body. He . said: ‘The great thing about beer is that it is low in alcohol and . brewed from natural raw materials so it’s a good source of important . nutrients such as antioxidants, B vitamins and dietary silicon that . promotes strong bones. Indeed beer used to be known as liquid bread.’ Britain’s Campaign for Real Ale welcomed his comments, suggesting older people could see particular benefits. Chairman, Colin Valentine, said: ’The health benefits of moderate drinking may explain why you meet so many people enjoying a healthy retirement who still like going for a pint of real ale in their local. ‘The evidence also shows that sociability has significant benefits to health and well-being.  You are far better off sharing a beer with friends in a pub than sitting at home drinking by yourself.’","Professor Charles Bamforth of the University of California argues people should not assume that going without completely is healthy .

A self-titled 'remover of impurities' and 'faith healer' has managed to swindle $130,000 cash from two female strangers by convincing them they had evil inside of them that needed to be exorcized. Known to his victims as 'Dorian' and 'Robert' but booked into jail as Joe Alvarez, 32, police say the so-called 'chakra aligner' lives under several aliases and that they are still yet to confirm his identity. Alvarez, who was arrested at a Fort Lauderdale Beach apartment the day people Thanksgiving, preyed on both women at the Aventura Mall in Miami, striking up a friendship separately with each before starting his spiel about being a spiritual leader and how he could cleanse them. Police have described as 'impressive' Alvarez's ability to pick his targets based on their spiritual inclinations. Accused: Living under several aliases and social security numbers, the man police are calling Joe Alvarez, 32, allegedly fleeced over $130,000 cash from two women he met at a Miami mall after convincing them they had evil inside them that he could exorcize . Victim: Cassandre Soray, seen here in a Facebook photo, said she was preyed upon by Joe Alvarez and fleeced of tens of thousands of dollars . 'I was very upset for being so naive and gullible,' one of the women, Evelyn Taveras, 36, told The Sun Sentinel. Taveras crossed paths with Alvarez on Feb. 6 as she entered a store he was leaving. He complimented her 'beautiful aura' and its 'yellow hue'. 'It's just the way he came across, very humble, understanding, just a very familiar feeling,' Taveras said. 'Recently I had been becoming more religious and spiritual with energy work, positive thinking and auras â€¦ and it struck me as odd that he could see that.' Promising to expel bad luck and be rid her of harmful spiritual impurities, Alvarez first sold Taveras three crystals for $5,200 each, saying 'they were essential for her to maintain a good aura'. Taveras mistakenly told Alvarez she had $39,000 cash hidden under her mattress at home, which she was saving to start a business. Joe Alvarez used the Aventura Mall in Miami (picture) to prey on his victims, approaching them in a friendly manner before offering his spiritual services . Because he had multiple aliases, police initially struggled to track down the man booked as 'Joe Alvarez'. They had images of him from Aventura Mall security cameras (pictured) but it wasn't until he made a booking for some pamphlets to be printed that authorities were able to pounce . On May 5, Alvarez showed up at the house unannounced for a visit, telling Taveras not to touch money because she would curse it with bad luck. She ignored the warning and, when she went to inspect the hiding spot, found play money and newspaper clippings in its place. A police report said she was also relieved of of $48,700 worth of jewelery. The second woman, Cassandre Soray, 36, of Miami Shores, told police she was targeted in almost the exact same way.. Soray met Alvarez in December 2012 at Aventura Mall, where he introduced himself as Robert. Over the course of a few months, 'Robert' persuaded Soray to pay him $37,000 'to cleanse the impurities from her', a police report said. Another part to Alvarez's shtick was setting fire to bundles of cash that he had convinced the women to withdraw as part of the cleansing process. However the bin being used as the fire was full of fake money and Alvarez had kept the real notes. Hallandale Beach police were able to track down Alvarez on Nov. 27 after he placed an order with a printing business for a 'spiritual healer' and 'astrological readings' and provided a Fort Lauderdale Beach address. Joe Alvarez, 32, was arrested at this Fort Lauderdale Beach apartment on November 27 . Joe Alvarez is now facing two counts of grand theft and two counts of obtaining property by gaming, according to online jail records . 'The defendant in this case has used multiple identities, dates of birth and Social Security numbers,' police reports said. 'The defendant has no known state photo identification, and his true name has not been confirmed.' Also known as Robert Johnson, Dorian Johnson, Robert Dorian, Joey Alvarez and Bob Johnson, he's now being held in a Pompano Beach jail on $16,000 bond. He faces two counts of grand theft and two counts of obtaining property by gaming, online jail records said. 'His ability to get into them and know that they are into spirituality and to use that as an access into their personal life is impressive,' Hallandale Beach Polic Det.

A comic known for dressing as an old woman on a popular Spanish TV show has been charged with possessing child pornography. Adonis Losada, 49, used to appear on the popular Spanish-language TV variety show 'Sábado Gigante' on Univision. The comic faces 66 child pornography charges, many involving graphic images of young children in sexual situations. Justice: Adonis Losada, the 49-year-old former comic actor from the popular Spanish-language TV show Sábado Gigante, is now on trial in Palm Beach County on 66 counts of child pornography from September 2009 . He has offered no defense and has refused to use an attorney in court. Losada told Circuit Judge Karen Miller on Thursday, 'It's not my wish to be here.' 'I don't want to participate,' he said, 'send me the verdict and all that information.' The judge has ruled Losada is mentally competent and has told him he is required to sit in the courtroom whilst the jury hears the evidence the Sun Sentinel reports. 'It's better if you are present,' Miller said, adding she had a hard time finding any past Florida cases where criminal defendants opted to stay in jail while their trials were held. 'It's your day in court.' Funny man: Adonis Losada once made people laugh whenever he wore a gray wig and granny glasses for his acting role on the popular Spanish-language TV variety show Sa¡bado Gigante on Univision . If convicted on all charges he faces a minimum sentence of 44 years in state prison and a maximum of 330 years. Before the trial got underway on Tuesday, Losada turned down a plea deal for a lighter sentence of 20 years. Judge Miller asked Losada to think hard about taking part in his defense, noting that if he doesn't he can't complain about his conviction after the fact. 'The chairs are more comfortable up here than I imagine they are in a holding cell,' Miller said. 'We take breaks.' Losada replied through his interpreter: 'I'd like the record to be clear: I am here against my wishes.' Losada was first arrested in September 2009 after connecting online with a Boynton Beach police detective posing as a bilingual, bisexual adult male in a chat room for people interested in having sex with children. The room was called '#baby@todderlove,' according to court records. Freedom curtailed: Losada faces 66 child pornography charges. Over the years he's been transferred back and forth between jails in Florida . Losada used a social network to send Detective Charles Ramos — using the name 'Paul' — a photo of a boy and an adult male on August 28, 2009. He also invited Ramos to watch him pleasuring himself via his webcam. The dialogue continued when Losada sent Ramos 32 more child porn images. Four days later, Miami Beach police seized Losada's computer and reportedly discovered 16 child porn images. Losada then told a Miami-Beach detective that he has 'a problem.' In Palm Beach County, Losada was charged with 33 counts of transmitting child pornography, and 33 counts of child pornography. His bail was set at $3 million. In Miami-Dade County, Losada was charged with 16 counts of possession of sexual performance of a child. Over the years he's been transferred back and forth between jails in the counties. Losada's gig as a TV personality on Sábado Gigante ended with his arrest. The trial is set to continue Friday with Detective Ramos still on the witness stand. Prosecutors plan to rest their case on Monday.","Adonis Losada, 49, used to appear popular Spanish TV show Sábado Gigante .

A police officer has been arrested in a prostitution sting by his own force. Emmanuel Augustine, 29, has been a patrol officer with the Harris County Precinct 4 Constable's Office for five years. But on Wednesday morning he was arrested after offering a female undercover officer $10 (Â£6) for 'a sex act'. He was off duty at the time of the incident, but was still said to be wearing part of his uniform. A spokesman for the constable's office said: 'Following his identification, the administration was notified and responded to the arrest location. '[He] was placed on immediate administrative suspension without pay pending an investigation into the incident.' For Augustine's safety, he was kept separate from other suspects while awaiting a probable cause court hearing late Wednesday. Augustine is charged with soliciting prostitution which is a Class B misdemeanor. If convicted of the charge, Augustine will face up to 180 days in jail and or a fine of up to $2,000 (Â£1,200). It is not the first time an officer has been caught out by their own agency. In April 2012 Santa Fe deputy Mike Esikant was apparently caught by the dash cam in his own squad car having a sexually explicit conversation with himself while masturbating. In August 2013 Lieutenant Thomas Foye was arrested after he allegedly stole cocaine from a Ludlow Police evidence locker. Foye, who had been with the department for 25 years, was ordered to hand over his badge and firearms, but has denied the charges. Augustine, who has been a patrol deputy for five years, has been suspended without pay while an investigation is being carried out .","Emmanuel Augustine, 29, has been a patrol deputy for five years .

A big-busted cookery teacher who hoped to solve her back pain problems by having a breast reduction was left with a body she hated after surgery went disastrously wrong. Anne, 57, went under the knife ten years ago to reduce the size of her 32FF chest, but the botched operation left her with nipples placed abnormally high - so high she couldn't even find a bra to cover them. Ann felt so self-conscious that she even began undressing in the dark so her husband Paul couldn't see what had happened to her body. She says she 'felt like a freak'. She explained: 'My nipples look like they've been plonked on too high. It's a complete nightmare. I pop out of everything I put on' Botch job: Reduction surgery left Anne with lopsided breasts and 'abnormally' positioned nipples . One . decade later Ann mustered the courage to write in to TLC show Extreme . Body Disasters, begging them to redo the operation. And after a . successful operation she is finally happy with the way she looks. Speaking . about the trauma of the first operation, Ann said: 'I always had big . breasts and I hated them. After I had children, they . got bigger, and then they dropped and were virtually around my waist. My . posture was terrible, I suffered from terrible back problems and . eventually, I felt, well, enough is enough and I can't carry on like . this.' Supported by husband Paul, they dipped into their savings and pension so Anne could have the cosmetic procedure. 'This was a dream come true - at long last, I thought I was going to be . normal. But when the bandages were taken off, I couldn't believe my . eyes,' Anne said. Anne had been left with lopsided nipples that were abnormally high. Not only did this make her self-conscious in front of her husband, it also made it difficult for her to find underwear that was high enough to cover them. She explained: 'My nipples look like they've been plonked on too high. It's a complete nightmare. I pop out of everything I put on. 'It makes me feel really unsexy. I hate myself and I'm always aware of . it every day and I just hate my body. I've just been left looking like a . freak.' They pop out: The mother said she couldn't find bras to cover her high nipples . She continued: 'I won't let my husband see me naked. I get dressed and undressed in the dark or turn round.' Anne applied to TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if their resident surgeon Dr Vik Vijh could salvage her appearance following the botched operation. Dr Vijh explained how the surgery went wrong because the surgeon positioned the nipples 'higher on the breast mound than they should be'. This then caused 'bottoming out' - which occurs when the skin that was stitched together during the operation can no longer . support the weight of the chest and gravity takes hold. The breasts descent . but the nipples don't. Fixed: Anne went on Extreme Beauty Disasters and had another op to reposition her nipples which she is delighted with . 'It never ceases to amaze me when I see appalling surgeries but it makes me more determined to sort them out,' Dr Vijh said. Dr Vijh operates on Anne to redress the previous problem and this time, she is delighted with the end result. She said: 'I can wear a bra, I can wiggle around and nothing's popping out! They're perfect. It's changed the whole way I feel about myself, my confidence, my posture - it means so much to me.' She added: 'I feel feminine, I feel sexy, I'm a lot more confident than I ever was, I'm happy to wear low tops and it's just made so much difference to me.'

A pit bull puppy that was horrifically tortured by having both ears and its right hind leg cut off, is hoping to be given a new lease of life thanks to a prosthetic limb. The now seven-month-old puppy, named 'Miss Harper', was found riddled with injuries in September and taken in by the Nassau County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Despite her obvious disability, Miss Harper happily runs and plays just like any other dog, but practice manager Donna Kramer believes she may be a good candidate for receiving an artificial leg. She told WCBS 880: 'We’re going to look to get her a . prosthetic now to see if that’s something that she can live with. We . hope that it is.' Miss Harper's extensive injuries will require further treatment and surgeries in the months to come and the Nassau SPCA has asked for the public to help donate towards this via its website.

'We are asking the public and animal . lovers to help us in our efforts to raise funds for the needed surgeries . and care this poor puppy faces.'

Shackled: Philip Chism, 15, from Danvers, Masschusetts., enters the courtroom with his attorney Denise Regan before his arraignment on a second rape charge in Salem Superior Court on Thursday . The Massachusetts teenager who allegedly slashed his math teacher to death and then went to catch a movie and a burger pleaded not guilty today to a second aggravated rape charge. Attorney's for Philip Chism, 15, entered the plea on his behalf as he stood silently with his head bowed and feet shackled during a brief hearing in Essex Superior Court. Around two dozen people attended the hearing, including members of 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer,  who left without commenting. Ritzer was found dead in the woods near the school in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene. Chism, who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, allegedly followed her into a bathroom shortly before 3 pm on October 22 and attacked her, sexually assaulted her twice, stripped her and then stole her cellphone, credit cars and her driver's licenses. According to investigators her body was then placed in a recycling bin and carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped. During the violent assault on Ritzer, Chismm, who was then aged, 14, allegedly raped her twice, one of the assaults was committed with a stick. Not guilty: Philip Chism, 15, from Danvers, Mass., stands with his attorneys, Susan Oker, (left), and Denise Regan, (right), as he pleads not guilty at his arraignment on a second rape charge in Salem Superior Court on Thursday . He had previously pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, robbery and murder. In court documents released last week, state police said Chism confessed to killing Ritzer, but denied sexually assaulting her. Tragic: Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer is seen in this undated file photo provided by Ritzer's family via The Eagle-Tribune. Philip Chism, a 15-year-old boy charged with killing Ritzer . According to the documents, Chism made the statements while being interviewed at the Danvers Police Station, after waiving his Miranda rights. The first rape charge accused Chism of sexually assaulting Ritzer with a stick. The second charge, filed last week, alleges he forcibly had sexual intercourse with her. Court documents released in November describe surveillance video showing Chism following Ritzer into a school bathroom with gloves and a hood. Footage also shows Chism carrying a recycling bin into the bathroom then dragging it out behind the building. The recycling bin was found near Ritzer's body, police said. A hard drive of the school's surveillance footage was submitted as evidence before the court hearing Thursday. Attorneys also discussed whether Chism will be charged as a juvenile or adult offender on the new rape count. A decision is expected by early March. However, despite all the evidence against the teenager, the Freshman soccer star refuses to tell anyone why he did it. Silent: Philip Chism, 15, from Danvers, Mass., sits with his defense team in court as his attorney's addresses the judge during his arraignment on a second rape charge in Salem Superior Court on Thursday . Detectives are working on a theory that Chism â€“ who only moved to Danvers from Clarksville, Tennessee at the start of the school year â€“ was 'infatuated' with Colleen, 24 and snapped when she spurned his advances. But they cannot find any proof. The Essex County District Attorney's office have told the MailOnline they do not have any idea why Chism allegedly did what he did. They also said that, while they are trying to uncover a motive, it is not their primary focus as they do not need one to secure a conviction. A spokeswoman said: 'The motive is part of any investigation, but ultimately we don't have to prove a motive. When you are piecing together any investigation, you are looking for an explanation, but I wouldn't want characterize where we are with that at this stage. Honestly, who knows why anyone would do something like this.' Another police source previously described Chism as 'stone cold' on the night of the killing and said that while he confessed to the crime, he would not give any indication why he did it. Colleen, left, is the oldest of three children (pictured here). She still lived with her parents in nearby Andover and was going to graduate school to be a school psychologist . Friends and family of Chism are equally mystified by the crime. His mother Diana - who is separated from his father Stacey - said her son was, 'born in love' and that she is, 'struggling to understand' the murder. Tragic: Colleen Ritzer, 24, was found dead behind Danvers High School on Wednesday morning . Detectives are also  trying to retrieve data from Philip Chism's Samsung smartphone, which they found badly mangled in the woods outside Danvers High School - near the body of teacher Colleen Ritzer. 'It is not unusual for individuals involved in homicides, particularly sexually violent homicides, to memorialize their victimsâ€™ deaths through photographic, audio and or video media for further humiliation of the victim or later viewing, for guilt relief or enjoyment,' Massachusetts state police detective Steven J. Buccheri wrote in newly-released documents, according to the Boston Herald. Police found Chism's cell phone and Ritzer's iPhone both crushed in the woods. They believe he destroyed both phones in an effort to conceal what he had done. Officers say they also believe Chism returning to the school - barefoot - and changed out of his bloody clothes and into his soccer uniform. He then dumped his soiled school clothes, walked around the school soccer fields, and went to see the Woody Allen movie 'Blue Jasmine' at a nearby theater. When police stopped him on a roadside and arrested him hours later, he had Ritzer's underwear in his pocket - along with a bloody boxcutter, according to police. In November a grand jury charged him with a second count of aggravated rape and revealed he had raped her before murdering her and and dumping her body with a large tree branch sticking from her genitals. Prosecutors believe Philip Chism forced Colleen Ritzer to have sex with him after dragging her into a teachers' bathroom at Danvers High School, where she was a teacher and he was a student. Chism already faced one aggravated rape charge for allegedly sexually assaulting Ritzer with a large stick. Her body was found on her back in a 'sexual position' with the three-foot branch inside her on October 22. Philip Chism, 14, looked down during a court appearance in December in which he pleaded not guilty to rape, murder and robbery charges . Prosecutors said a psychological exam revealed that the teen is mentally competent to stand trial . Prosecutors revealed that psychologists who evaluated Chism have concluded that he is mentally competent to stand trial, the Boston Globe reports. However, his lawyers said they may raise issues about his mental health, if they deem it relevant to the legal proceedings.","Phillip Chism, a 15-year-old Massachusetts boy charged with killing his math teacher today pleaded not guilty to a second charge of raping her .

Five thieves have made off with more than $700,000 worth of watches from luxury jewelry store Cartier in Manhattan in broad daylight. Customers and staff watched in shock as the five brazen bandits used a hammer to smash open a display case near the door and scoop up 16 timepieces around 12:30pm Thursday, fleeing the store before police could arrive. The robbers had pushed past an unarmed guard at the door and were out of the store before the other guards could react. Shopping precinct: The Manhattan Cartier store is surrounded by other high-end retailers on Fifth Avenue . Investigators said two of the men had masks covering their faces and all were wearing gloves. The thieves were possibly emboldened by the heavy police presence around Times Square overseeing preparations for the Super Bowl festivities. Men believed to be the thieves were seen by nearby construction workers before the robbery, peering into the store. Target: Thieves smashed a cabinet and scooped up all the watches they could get their hands on - ending up with a haul of $700,000 . When they made their move, the thieves used hammers to smash the half-inch thick glass of the display cabinet. Well-timed: Thieves took just moments to steal Cartier watches, such as this one that retails for more than $40,000 . 'It happened so fast that people really didnâ€™t know what was going on,' a police source told the New York Post. 'They heard the smashing of the display case, but they thought it was an accident outside. And the perps ran out before the customers realized anything.' Customers and staff were shaken by the incident but no one was injured in the theft. 'It was completely broken on the . top,' . 'From what I saw, everything was missing. 'I . saw some of the guys who worked there standing outside,' Nicholas Basoukos, a manager at the nearby Hellenis Jewelry told . the New York Daily News. 'They were in shock...

Despite the robbery, the store remained open for the rest of the day and staff were later seen drinking Champagne and wine in the store. It was reportedly a pre-organized staff meeting. A similar theft occurred in the Golden Nugget Jewelers in lower Manhattan in October when two thieves smashed the store's counters with hammers and stole $40,000 worth of jewelry.

A paraplegic man has been accused of stealing a car from a dealership by holding his cane down on the accelerator. Shamal Battice visited a dealership in Ocala, Florida, on Wednesday and told a salesman he wanted to swap his wheelchair for a faster ride. But when dealer Anselmo 'Chico' Barreto allowed him to sit in a Pontiac G6, Battice allegedly locked it, turned the key in the ignition and pressed his extending cane down on the pedal before driving away. Ocala police then chased Battice to the Alachua-Marion County line, where Alachua officials carried on the chase, before also giving up. Battice was eventually spotted trying to refill the white sedan in Bradford County, almost 60 miles from where he first started.

A shipwrecked sailor who had been adrift in the Pacific for 16 months has told rescuers he drank turtles’ blood and ate seabirds to survive. Jose Ivan and his battered 24ft fibreglass boat with propellerless engines washed ashore on a remote coral atoll this week. He says that after the engine cut out in September 2012, he drifted more than 8,000 miles from his home in Mexico to Ebon Atoll. Miraculous survival: A man, believed to be called Jose Ivan, claims to have set off from Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012 but ended up travelling more than 8,000 miles to the Ebon Atoll . When he was spotted stranded on a reef by locals, he was long-haired, emaciated and dressed only in ragged underpants. The Mexican told rescuers he had left his homeland for El Salvador with a companion, who had died at sea several months ago. No fishing gear was on the boat and Mr Ivan – who speaks only Spanish – indicated that he had caught turtles and birds with his bare hands, said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology research student on Ebon. She said the details of his ordeal were ‘sketchy’ but there had been a turtle on the boat when it landed at Ebon – part of the largely English-speaking Marshall Islands chain. ‘His condition isn’t good, but he’s getting better,’ she said. Mr Ivan had had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but was now gaining strength. Locals are caring him until he can be taken to the main island in the atoll, to be interviewed by Foreign Ministry officials. 'The boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,' Ms Fjelstad added. No fishing gear was on the boat and Ivan suggested he caught turtles and birds with his bare hands. There was a turtle on the boat when it landed at Ebon. Miraculous survival: He was discovered by locals when he washed up on the Ebon Atoll, pictured, in the Pacific Ocean after 16 months stranded at sea . Stories of survival in the vast Pacific are not uncommon. In . 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were . discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall . Islands, in the middle of the ocean in their stricken boat, nine months . after setting out on a shark-fishing expedition. They survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the bible. And in 1992, two fishermen from Kiribati were at sea for 177 days before coming ashore in Samoa. According to Fjeldstad, the Marshall Islanders who found Ivan took him to the main island on the atoll, which is so remote there is only one phone line at the local council house and no Internet, to meet Mayor Ione de Brum, who put in a call to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro. Officials at the Foreign Ministry said Friday they were waiting to get more details and for the man to be brought to Majuro. The government airline's only plane that can land at Ebon is currently down for maintenance and is not expected to return to service until Tuesday at the earliest, with officials considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. But he did not appear to have any life-threatening illness and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. The Marshall Islands, in the northern Pacific, are home to barely 60,000 people spread over 24 atolls, with most of them standing at an average of just two metres above sea level.","Jose Ivon was discovered by locals on the Ebon Atoll on Thursday .

School support staff are being forced to deal with an increasing number of pupils who have not been toilet trained, an education leader has warned. The issue is putting extra pressure on workers who are already over-burdened, according to Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). Her comments come as a survey by the union found that eight in ten nursery and primary school support staff - such as teaching assistants - in England say that they are expected to deal with children who have wet or soiled themselves. Extra pressure: 80 per cent of school support staff have had to deal with children who have 'accidents' Almost 90 per cent of the 277 questioned said that they had not received any training on how to deal with the issue, while almost 70 per cent said that helping children who have had an accident is not part of their contract or job description. A similar proportion (68.6%) said that their school or nursery does not have a written policy for dealing with incontinence and toilet training problems, while three quarters (76.9%) said parents do not have to provide written permission for their child to be changed. Untrained: A survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers found that many children come to school without knowing how to use the toilet . Dr Bousted said: 'Having to deal with . increasing numbers of pupils who have not yet been toilet trained puts . extra pressure on education staff when they already have enough pressure . on them. 'It is worrying that such a high number of support staff have received no training in dealing with such issues, yet they are expected to deal with pupils, and even though it is not formally within their job description. 'Schools need to give staff clear guidance on how to deal with toileting accidents so they know what they are allowed to do and who should be dealing with an incident. 'It is also important that education staff feel they have support from their school nurse or head, and that they know where to obtain guidance should they need it.' A survey published by ATL in 2012 found that almost two-thirds of primary school staff say they have seen an increase in youngsters having accidents during the school day over the past five years. This figure rose to 71 per cent among teachers working with three to five-year-olds.","Stress of dealing with children who have 'accidents' adds pressure to jobs .

Attempts by Rome to extradite Amanda Knox from the United States are doomed to failure, diplomatic sources have warned. The 26-year-old American is at the centre of a diplomatic tug of war after an Italian court on Thursday sentenced her to 28 years prison for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Knox served four years jail for the 2007 murder, but returned home to Seattle in 2011, when she and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were acquitted on appeal. Amanda Knox reacting to an interviewers questions about a Florence court upholding the guilty verdict for her and her former boyfriend during her recent interview on ABC's Good Morning America show in New York . (Left) Knox preparing to leave the set following her television interview. Knox said she will fight the reinstated guilty verdict against her and an ex-boyfriend in the 2007 slaying of a British roommate in Italy and vowed to 'never go willingly' to face her fate in that country's judicial system . Following the dramatic quashing of that acquittal, followed by the reinstatement of her conviction, Knox said she will never willingly go back to Italy, and will instead become ‘a fugitive’. Once the murder sentence is confirmed by the Supreme Court, Italy can apply for Knox's extradition and arrest. But despite expected Italian efforts, experts say the US State Department will never send Knox back to a country where she was allegedly beaten by police and interrogated for hours without a lawyer or translator. Raffaele Sollecito, Amanda Knox's former boyfriend, leaving after attending the final hearing before the third court verdict for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, in Florence, Italy . Thanks to a powerful public relations campaign, and a prison memoir, Knox has successfully won over millions in the US to her cause counting Donald Trump among her supporters. Even early on senators petitioned Hilary Clinton on her behalf, claiming it was 'an anti-American trial'. And US State Department sources now reveal the 26-year-old has little to fear as she will be protected by the strength of public opinion in America. The Rome-based source confided: ‘We will never send her back to Italy. It’s obvious she hasn’t had a fair trial.’ Amanda Knox has said she counts U.S. property mogul Donald Trump as one of her supporters, seen here speaking during a media event on the sand dunes of the Menie estate, Scotland, the site for a proposed golf resort in 2010 . The U.S. Supreme Court still has to verify and enforce the Italian verdict in order for Amanda Knox to be extradited, but many critics claim that no Secretary of State will ever make the decision to send her back to Italy . Once the guilty verdict is confirmed by the Supreme Court, Italy will almost certainly apply to extradite Knox, because of the expectation from the public to do so, another foreign policy expert said. ‘They will have go through the motions because of the public pressure to do so, even though they know it will fail. No American Secretary of State will ever send her back, the source claimed. He added: ‘The Italians have to support own judiciary. They can’t just do nothing when the judiciary sentence someone for murder.’ In the same way, Britain used to routinely apply for the extradition of criminals living on the Costa del Sol, knowing that the attempts were wasted efforts, he explained. ‘But the government can’t be seen to do nothing’.","Knox was sentenced to 28 years in prison by a court in Florence for murder .

Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani has lost his High Court bid to block his extradition to South Africa until he is fit to stand trial for allegedly organising his wife's murder. A panel of three judges, headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, ruled today that it would not be 'unjust and oppressive' to force him to leave Britain. They said this was on the basis that the South African authorities agreed to send him back to the UK swiftly if he is found unfit to stand trial, which has been agreed to. Dewani, who is compulsorily detained in . hospital under the Mental Health Act, is accused of ordering the killing . of his new wife Anni, 28, who was shot as the couple travelled in a . taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010. Today Anni's family welcomed the ruling but it is understood Shrien could launch one final appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the extradition. Scroll down for video . Court case: Shrien Dewani has been fighting extradition to South Africa where he has been accused of having his wife Anni murdered in 2010 . Long journey: Outside the High Court Anni's family cautiously welcomed the ruling but it could be subject to a new appeal . Dewani, from Bristol, has been fighting removal from the UK to face proceedings over wife Anni's death until he has recovered from mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Suspect: Dewani has been detained under the Mental Health Act because of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder . His lawyers have stressed at various hearings that he will be willing to defend himself at trial once he is fit to do so, but they say he is unfit to plead under English law and his 'prognosis is not certain'. So far three men have been convicted over Mrs Dewani's death. South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting her. Prosecutors claimed he was a hitman hired by Dewani to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied. Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence. Anni’s father Vinod, fighting back tears, said today: 'Since she was taken from us, life has been practically unbearable. I don’t know how we have managed to carry on. 'But the fact that we need Dewani to explain what happened on the night she was murdered has driven us each and every hour. 'I feel no joy whatsoever at today’s decision. But I do thank the judges and the British courts for being absolutely fair and proper in considering all the details'. Mr Hindocha, speaking from his home in Mariestad,Sweden, added: 'I have said all along that I will be happy to go to South Africa with my arm around Shirien’s shoulder and support him. 'If he is innocent, I will accept that.' Claims: Prosecutors claim Dewani hired a hitman to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied . The judges were asked to decide . whether a person who is unfit to plead is 'an accused' for the purpose . of the Extradition Act 2003 'if he is being extradited in circumstances . where he may remain unfit to plead'. They . were also asked to rule on whether it was 'unjust or oppressive to . extradite a person who is agreed at the time of the determination to be . unfit, whatever the prognosis'. Dewani's family have said that he remains committed to returning to South Africa 'when his health would permit a full trial and when appropriate protections are in place for his health and safety'. A lawyer for the South African government said it was 'delighted' with the court's ruling and expected it would be able to give the undertaking, but needed 14 days 'for final clarification'. CCTV footage taken from the couple's honeymoon hotel in South Africa shows the final hours of Anni Dewani who was murdered in 2010 . Lord Thomas said: 'It might be unjust and oppressive to order the return of a person who was agreed to be currently unfit and where there was a prospect that he might remain permanently unfit without considering whether an undertaking should be required from the requesting state.' He added: 'The circumstances of this case are such that we consider, on the findings made by the district judge, it would be unjust and oppressive to return him without such an undertaking.' The effect of the undertaking would be that 'in the event of the appellant (Dewani) being found unfit to be tried, he will be free to return to the UK, unless there is found to be a realistic prospect of his being tried with a year - or other stated reasonable period - of that finding and the trial takes place within the period'. Lord Thomas continued: 'In any event the appellant must be free to return in the event a court in South Africa, having found him unfit to be tried, embarked on the process of determining under the Criminal Procedure Act 1977 whether he did the act.' He concluded: 'If such an undertaking was given, then it would not be oppressive or unjust.' Guilty: Taxi driver Zola Tongo (pictured) was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing . Amit Karia, a first cousin to Anni, said on behalf of family members at London's High Court: 'We are happy with the judgment. We have waited for it for three years, three months.' He said: 'It seems a step closer to finally getting justice for our Anni.' But he warned there was still a possibility that Dewani could launch a last-ditch appeal over today's ruling to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. Mr Karia said: 'We are always worried and don't take anything for granted.' He described the situation for Anni's parents as 'immensely difficult - they do not have normal life any more.' He added: 'They just want the truth - that is all we have ever wanted.'","Judges say it is not 'unjust and oppressive' to force him to leave Britain .

Scores of NHS hospitals say they are struggling with high levels of debt and expect to end the financial year in the red. Latest figures show 64 of England’s 145 hospital trusts – 44 per cent – predict they will be in debt by the end of next month. The combined deficit could reach £330million, according to figures from Monitor, the regulator for foundation trusts, and the NHS Trust Development Authority, which supervises non-foundation trusts. £50million deficit: St Barts Hospital is facing such a cash flow crisis it has drawn up plans to shed nursing staff . Patient campaigners and staff bodies fear it could mean cuts to staff and services, despite the NHS having coped well so far with winter pressures. Many of the worst problems are in London, where Bart’s Health NHS Trust is predicting a deficit of £50million by the end of the financial year, and has drawn up plans to shed nursing staff. Trusts in the Midlands and the East of England are also having problems, with The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust in the West Midlands and United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust both forecasting deficits of £17million. The figures suggest the NHS will struggle to meet its target of delivering £20 billion in efficiency savings by 2015. A survey by the King’s Fund last month found 22 per cent of NHS finance directors expected to be in deficit at the end of next month, along with 13 per cent of clinical commissioning groups, which buy services on behalf of GPs. Professor John Appleby, chief economist at The King’s Fund, said ‘The growing number of hospitals set to overspend their budgets shows that for some, it is no longer possible both to maintain the quality of services and balance their books. 'The emerging concerns about staff morale in hospitals are very worrying as there is a proven relationship between staff satisfaction and the quality of care provided to patients.’ Under pressure: Patient campaigners and staff . bodies fear the mounting debt borne by NHS trusts  could mean cuts to . staff and services, despite the NHS having coped well so far with winter . pressures. (Stock image) Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, blamed ‘endless reorganisations and failed IT projects’ for wasting billions. Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘The NHS must not under any circumstance be allowed to return to a boom and bust cyle of financial planning.’ A spokesman for Monitor said: ‘Unlike NHS Trusts – which are expected to break even every year – NHS Foundation  Trusts have more freedom to run their own affairs. ‘Monitor assesses the financial health of foundation trusts on their performance in the medium term and does not require them to break even each year. ‘They are therefore allowed to run a short-term deficit, and from a business perspective this can be an acceptable method of managing their finances.’","Campaigners fear mounting debts could lead to cuts in staff and services .

British workers have suffered the longest squeeze on their incomes for at least 50 years, official figures showed yesterday. The Office for National Statistics said average wages have fallen 2.2 per cent a year since the start of 2010 after inflation is taken into account. The four-year slump in ‘real wages’ is the longest since records began in 1964 and will fuel the political row over the so-called ‘cost of living crisis’ facing millions of families across the UK. Worry: The new figures showed that wages have been falling for four consecutive years - the longest since records began in 1964 . Household finances have been squeezed by subdued wage rises or even pay freezes at a time when the cost of essentials such as food and fuel has soared. Living standards look set to be a key political battleground between now and the general election in May 2015 with ministers hoping that the worst may now be over. But the ONS said it is ‘difficult to conclude that there has yet been a break from the trend of falling real wage growth’ following a drop of 1.5 per cent between the third quarter of 2012 and the same period of 2013. It followed a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing the average family has an income today which is lower than it was 13 years ago. The IFS said living standards have ‘fallen dramatically since the recession’ as family’s incomes have ‘failed to keep pace’ with the rising cost of living. Labour seized on the reports and branded the government ‘out of touch’. But the ONS said the ‘key driver’ behind the fall in real wages was the fallout from the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 when Labour was still in power. It pointed to the ‘fall in productivity’ during the recession and the increase in part-time work as employers asked staff to reduce their hours rather than making them redundant. The ONS report also showed that wage growth has been weakening for decades. Real wage growth averaged 2.9 per cent a year in the 1970s and 1980s but fell to 1.5 per cent in the 1990s and 1.2 per cent in the 2000s before dropping to minus 2.2 per cent since the start of 2010. ‘The recent period appears to be the latest stage in a series of step-changes in annual real wage growth,’ the ONS report said. Squeezed: Real wages have fallen 2.2 per cent since 2010, the Office of National Statistics said . David Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Should we deplore the fact that Britain has been made poorer as a result of the great recession of 2008/09 and as a result of the financial crisis? ‘The Prime Minister has been very clear about the mistakes that were made at the time and the long-term economic plan which the Government has had to put in place to address it.’ Labour MP Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘While working people are worse off under David Cameron he has chosen this time to give the richest one per cent of earners a huge tax cut. ‘Labour will act to ensure we earn our way to higher living standards for all and tackle the cost-of-living crisis.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Over the last four years British workers have suffered an unprecedented real wage squeeze. ‘Worryingly, average pay rises have been getter weaker in every decade since the 1980s, despite increases in productivity, growth and profits. Unless things change, the 2010s could be the first ever decade of falling wages. ‘A return to business as usual may only bring modest pay growth. We need radical economic reform to give hard-working people the pay rises they deserve.’ Andrew Hunter, co-founder of jobs website Adzuna, said: ‘The recovery in the jobs market is far from over. The great news is unemployment has fallen at record levels, but wages are still stuck in a post-recession hangover - while the backlog of employees waiting for the right time to change jobs is clearing, salary levels are yet to catch up. ‘Compared with this time last year, there are fewer people fighting it out for each position, but the chances of securing a decent salary have become slimmer.’","Figures show wages have slumped, when inflation is taken into account .

Children aged just four could sit exams soon after starting primary school, under proposed education reforms. Under the Government plans, ‘baseline’ tests to monitor pupils’ progress will be moved forward from age seven to reception year by 2016, it was reported. The new tests are expected to encourage teachers to make sure younger children make quick progress in their learning. 'Baseline' tests to monitor progress will be moved forward from age seven to reception year by 2016, reports today suggest (library image) But the proposals - created after a consultation exercise last year - have raised fears among parents and education leaders who claim the tests could place too much stress on young children and pupils being grouped by ability. There are also concerns that the news tests could provide an incentive for teachers to keep test scores low to maximise their progress when they sit national curriculum tests at 11-years-old. According to The Times, the Department for Education (DfE) has proposed that baseline assessments could include a simple check administered by a teacher between two and six weeks after a child started in the reception year. Results would be checked via an external monitoring system. Parents and education leaders have said the tests could place too much stress on young people . Separate plans to rank children according to their scores in new tests that would be taken at the end of primary school have been scrapped after strong opposition from teachers, as have proposals to tell parents how their child’s score ranked within ten bands of national results. Tests for 11-year-olds will also be changed with results to be reported as a ‘scaled score’ between 80 and 130 points rather than levels, such as Level 4 or Level 5. Head teachers could choose from different types of assessments for four-year-olds which best suits their curriculum and school environment. However, critics argue it is near impossible to design accurate tests for children so young because they can react badly to unfamiliar settings and make rapid progress within weeks. Tests may also have to be taken at different stages because those with autumn birthdays are almost a whole school year older than classmates born in the summer. Some schools may be allowed to opt out but it is unlikely as pupils’ progress from age four to 11 will be a key indicator of a school’s performance. The tests could involve a 20 minute on-to-one assessment with a teacher within a month of a child entering reception, which assesses a pupils’ ability in reading, maths, word sounds and short-term memory. A DfE spokeswoman said: ‘We have consulted on our proposed primary school assessment and accountability measures and we are considering our response.’","'Baseline' tests to monitor progress to be moved forward to reception year .

Almost 100,000 British pensioners living in warm countries including Spain, France and Greece are to lose their winter fuel payments in a crackdown on ‘sunshine benefits’. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has hammered out details of a new ‘temperature test’ that will remove the handout, worth up to £300 a year, from such expats. In total, it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Malta, Cyprus and Gibraltar, he revealed. Taxpayers will save almost £17million a year. Almost 100,000 British pensioners living in warm countries including Spain, France and Greece are to lose their winter fuel payments in a crackdown on  'sunshine benefits' Mr Duncan Smith said countries where the average annual temperature is higher than the warmest region of the UK – the South West at 5.6C (42F) – will be affected. Italy is not included because its northern region has a winter climate colder than that of the British Isles. Its exclusion means 1,859 Britons will still be able to claim the benefit, even if they live in the warmer south. There has been increasing controversy over pensioners’ free TV licences, bus passes and winter fuel payments, with half the Cabinet arguing that they should be reined in if further squeezes on working-age welfare are to be justified. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has hammered out details of a new ‘temperature test’ that will remove the handout, worth up to £300 a year, from such expats. But David Cameron pledged at the last election that the payments would be protected until 2015 – and there has been months of wrangling over whether to begin reining them in for expats. Almost £2million goes abroad every week to claimants who still qualify for welfare despite leaving the UK. Traditionally, people were only eligible for the winter fuel payment if they were living in Britain at the age of 60 and only moved out later. But thanks to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the UK would have been forced to pay out to all 444,000 British pensioners living abroad – costing up to £100million a year. The court insisted that any  elderly expat should be able to get the payment, no matter when they left Britain. There has already been a 13-fold rise in the number of expats claiming in the last decade. The . biggest expat population is in Spain, where 49,443 pensioners are . receiving the payment, worth £200 for the over-60s and £300 for those . over the age of 80, costing taxpayers £8.85million a year. But in December and January temperatures in Spain can reach 17C (63F). There . are almost 28,625 recipients in France, many of them in the south where . temperatures in winter are often a comfortable 13C (57F). Controversially, the new regime will mean richer pensioners who have . emigrated to colder countries – or warm parts of Italy – will continue . to receive the payments, while poorer pensioners will lose it if they . are in warmer areas. In total, it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Malta, Cyprus and Gibraltar, he revealed. Taxpayers will save almost £17million a year . Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The huge increase in UK winter fuel payments made to people living in European countries equates to a near doubling in costs to the British taxpayer and follows a ridiculous ruling by the European Court of Justice. ‘The winter fuel payment is intended to help British pensioners with heating costs. From winter 2015/16, we are changing the rules so that it no longer goes to people in European countries with an average winter temperature higher than the warmest part of the UK.’ The number of winter fuel payments made to people in the European Economic Area and Switzerland for winter 2012/13 was 119,587, an increase of 44,901 on 2011/12.","Part of a crackdown on ‘sunshine benefits' in warm countries .

Party leader Nick Clegg is being urged to protect the party's existing seats rather than trying to compete as a national force . The Liberal Democrats could be left with no women MPs after the next election unless they change tack now, Nick Clegg has been warned. Senior figures are urging Mr Clegg to adopt a ‘fortress strategy’ to protect the party’s existing seats, rather than trying to continue to compete as a national force. One Lib Dem member of the Government told the Daily Mail that the party, which is languishing in fourth place in the opinion polls, is on course to lose half its seats, with female MPs disproportionately affected. ‘You can see how 30 colleagues can survive, but the other 27? It’s very difficult,’ he said. ‘We need a fortress strategy right now. If it’s a choice between employing a local campaigner on £20,000 or spending the money on focus grouping a new national policy we should be doing the former. But at the moment we’re not. ‘Everyone knows we haven’t got enough women but the situation could be far worse after next year. If we don’t start to do something about it now we could be left with none.’ The warning is a fresh blow to Mr Clegg who is already reeling from criticism of his handling of sex scandals involving the party’s former chief executive Lord Rennard and Portsmouth MP Mike Hancock. Several disgusted activists have urged women to abandon the party in protest at the leadership’s failure to take tougher action against Lord Rennard over claims he made unwanted sexual advances against women. Mr Clegg has so far proved unable to extract even an apology from the peer, who denies wrongdoing and is threatening to sue the party unless his membership is reinstated. Five of the Lib Dems’ seven women MPs have majorities of around 2,000 or less, suggesting they will be wiped out by the national swing against the party which has taken place since it entered coalition with the Conservatives. Only international development minister Lynne Featherstone, with a majority of just under 8,000, has a notionally safe seat, although she is likely to face a fierce battle to survive against Labour in her north London constituency. Equalities Minister Jo Swinson, who has a majority of just over 2,000, is being urged to do the ‘chicken run’ from East Dunbartonshire, in Scotland, to the relatively safety of Bath, where veteran chief whip Don Foster is standing down. Lynne Featherstone has a majority of just under 8,000 but is likely to face a fierce battle to survive against Labour in her north London constituency. Miss Swinson, seen as a rising star, is married to Chippenham Lib Dem Duncan Hames, whose constituency neighbours bath. The couple have just had a baby and colleagues are suggesting she could present the relocation as being for family reasons. Until recently the Lib Dem hierarchy believed it could hold on to at least 45 of its 57 seats. Aides to Mr Clegg believed the party would receive some credit for its part in the coalition’s economic policies. But despite the economic recovery the Lib Dems remain anchored at just 10 per cent in the opinion polls. The call for a ‘fortress strategy’ is the first sign of panic in senior Lib Dem ranks about the party’s electoral plight. Although the polls suggest the party could play a role in another coalition after the next election, senior figures believe its role would be greatly diminished. One source said: ‘The polls still show we can hold the balance of power. But holding the balance with25 or 30 MPs, how much influence are we going to have in any new coalition? We’re not going to be able to demand four Cabinet ministers, that’s for sure.’ One source said: ‘The polls still show we can hold the balance of power.

Dave Lee Travis gave colleagues 'bear hugs' and said 'grrrr' but it was never sexual, two former assistants have told his trial. Caroline Bonfield, a PA who worked alongside the veteran DJ at Chiltern Radio - where he is alleged to have inappropriately touched three women - said he had a 'vice-like grip' and was 'very tactile'. But she insisted he was a 'fabulous' man who no one considered a sex pest, adding: 'And we did talk about sleazy men'. 'He enjoyed the big bear hugs and cuddles,' Ms Bonfield told the jury today. 'There was no stroking or patting. 'It was just like ""grrr"" and you got a big old cuddle and he let you go.' Sometimes he gave her 'shoulders a good old squeeze... [but] I never had a problem with that,' she said, even if it was not 'everyone's cup of tea'. Ms Bonfield, who was the PA to Chiltern Radio's group managing director, said the allegations were 'totally ludicrous'. 'Anything like that would have gone round the station like wildfire,' she said. 'In any office it would, but particularly in the media. 'There was never any talk about it at all and we did talk about sleazy men. 'There was quite a robust HR department - there was no way it would have been allowed.' Accused: Travis, 68, pictured arriving at court today, denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault . Caroline Bonfield and Gemma Nurden both told the jury Travis (pictured) was tactile and gave people bear hugs - but he meant it in a friendly way, and anything more would have been spotted by staff at Chiltern Radio . Gemma Nurden, who worked as Travis's own personal assistant for 10 years, added: 'When Dave met people, he'd give them a big sort of bear hug. 'He just sort of would always put his arms around people but not in a seedy way or anything - just in a friendly way'. Travis, who is on trial under his birth name David Griffin, denies 13 indecent assaults between 1976 and 2003 and one sexual assault in 2008. The charges relate to allegations from when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while appearing on Top Of The Pops and when starring in panto. The court heard Ms Nurden first worked for Travis in 1992 by feeding his chickens and pigs after his wife Marianne had an operation. Media attention: Travis was questioned today on his time at Chiltern Radio, where he has been accused of inappropriately touching three women, including one who said he thrust his hand up her skirt . Trial: Former PA Gemma Nurden said Travis was not a 'big superstar' and would talk to anyone . The charges include periods when Travis, 68, was working as a BBC DJ, on Top Of The Pops and in panto . A year later she became his PA when he left the BBC to work in commercial radio. She remained working with him until he left Chiltern Radio in 2002 - and told the court claims that he left because of sex pest allegations were 'ridiculous'. Instead, she said, he left because there were plans to reduce his show from five days a week to just one. Ms Nurden told Southwark Crown Court: 'He's great fun. He was a very sort of larger-than-life character. He would chat to anybody. 'He wasn't sort of like a big superstar that wouldn't talk to a doorman or anything like that, and just a lovely person.' Early riser: Bearded Travis hosted the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show, taking over from Noel Edmonds . Reputation: The trial previously heard Travis was known as a sex pest - a claim rubbished in court today . Asked if she saw or heard anything to . suggest Travis ever acted inappropriately with female staff at the radio . station, Ms Nurden, who said she accompanied him to his show every day, . told jurors: 'No.' And when Stephen Vullo, defending, asked if colleagues knew Travis as a 'determined . sexual predator' as the trial has already heard, she said: 'That’s completely untrue.' Travis has been described as a 'determined sexual predator' during the trial . Mr Vuillo asked if she could smell 'pungent aftershave' when Travis walked into the room, as other witnesses said. 'Yes,' she replied, as Travis gave a loud sigh in the dock. Ms Bonfield said she was never aware any of her female colleagues felt Travis acted inappropriately and no allegations were made at the time. 'He was a breath of fresh air at the studio,' she said. 'He was funny, he was kind. Generous of nature. We loved having him about.' Ms Bonfield was asked about an occasion when Travis was called into managing director Colin Wilshere’s office. Prosecutors claim he was confronted about indecently assaulting one of the women, though Travis disputes this. She told jurors she was aware of a 'kerfuffle' and was later told by Mr Wilshere: 'There’s been a bit of an upset with one of the girls.' Ms Bonfield described the woman in question as 'quite strident, quite loud... Self-obsessed and a bit on the neurotic side.' The court also heard from other women who worked at the radio station’s office in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, where Travis was based. Vicki Turner told jurors she had 'not ever' witnessed him acting inappropriately and would have reported him if she had - as she had previously with other colleagues. Despite most presenters having 'an ego which needs to be stroked', she described Travis as 'fun, very professional, very helpful, very kind', adding: 'He was happy to be there. He wanted to be liked.' The trial continues. Larger-than-life: The court heard the DJ was a popular figure, with a personalised car numberplate .

Dismissed: Kerry Miller, 46, has lost her case claiming sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal from her role as a secretary at Burton Albion FC . A soccer PA who was said to have repeatedly burst into players’ changing rooms while they showered has lost her sex discrimination claim against the club. Mother-of-three Kerry Miller sent photos of herself in various states of undress to some players and was alleged to have had relationships with two of them. The 45-year-old widow from Marchington, Staffordshire, claimed she had been forced to quit her job at League Two side Burton Albion last year after being reprimanded for her actions. But yesterday, an employment tribunal in Leicester dismissed her claim for constructive dismissal, sexual discrimination and harassment. Employment judge Saleem Ahmed ruled that Mrs Miller had been ‘the author of her own rumours’. She refused to comment outside the tribunal and was not ordered to pay any costs. Ms Miller also admitted to sending topless photos to 23-year-old striker Billy Kee and having a 'casual' relationship with former defender Ryan Austin, 29, who has since left the club. Today an employment tribunal in Leicester ruled that she had been 'the author of her own rumours' and dismissed her claims. The widow started working in a sales and support role at the club’s Pirelli Stadium in Burton-upon-Trent, Stafforshire, in September 2011 before she quit in February 2013 after a row with the chairman. The tribunal heard how Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs. Veteran defender Aaron Webster, 32, told the hearing Ms Miller would be constantly around the players on a daily basis and at one time was 'all over' the club chairman. Burton manager Gary Rowett - who played in the Premier League for Everton and Leicester City - told the hearing he always believed there was a 'sexual connotation' to her actions. He said he was forced to go to chairman Ben Robinson after a senior player complained that her constantly being in the dressing room was making him feel uncomfortable. Employment Judge Saleem Ahmed today . told the tribunal Ms Miller had 'overreacted' by walking out of the club . when she was shouted at by the chairman. He said: 'Her reaction was exaggerated. It is clear that she was no shrinking violet and was not intimidated by Mr Robinson. Billy Kee, 23 (left), seen outside court, said he was alarmed when he received images from Ms Miller after a match. She also posted photos on Facebook of her on the lap of goalkeeper and model Stuart Tomlinson (right) Confession: The court heard she confessed to a 'casual' relationship with Ryan Austin . She was told her claim of sexual discrimination was unfounded and a male worker would have been treated the same . 'She felt Mr Robinson had not respected her. That he had misunderstood her position. 'She acted immediately and ended her employment. But had she gone away and slept on it she may have changed her mind. He . added: 'As for sexual discrimination we accept that it may have been . necessary for the claimant to have visited the male changing rooms. Mr Ahmed, the employment judge, told Ms Miller her trips to the dressing room were inappropriate . Racy: Ms Miller sent topless photos to striker Billy Kee, 23, and had a 'casual' relationship with a defender . 'Whatever the number the fact is she had entered the male changing room when it was unnecessary. 'If she was told to go there she should have raised it with her line manager as it was clearly inappropriate.' The court heard chairman Ben Robinson (pictured) was contacted by manager Gary Rowett about Ms Miller's conduct in the dressing room . Mr Ahmed told Ms Miller a male employee would have been treated exactly the same. He said: 'It is clear that the chairman’s concern was she was seeking to fraternise with the players and come in contact with them as often as possible. 'This would have been the same had she been a male employee. 'He believed it could be detrimental to the future of the club and damaging to team spirit if she was engaging in a relationship with one of the players. 'It was not because the claimant was a woman.' On the third day of her employment tribunal, the hearing heard of allegations of rumours she had been seeing 28-year-old goalkeeper turned model and wrestler Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012. The court heard she posted a picture . on Facebook of herself with Tomlinson, who the tribunal heard had worked as a . part-time male escort, on a night out just hours after a crucial match. Mr . Ahmed said: 'She was in many ways the author of her own rumours. It was . she who uploaded pictures of herself with a player to Facebook, . starting the rumours about her conduct. 'She was seeking to be close to the players whenever the opportunity arose. 'Therefore the claims of sex discrimination and harassment must fail.' In the dressing room: Two Burton Albion players, Shaun Harrad (right) and Adam Bolder celebrating theri 2-1 defeat over Middlesbrough . During the tribunal, Ms Miller, a widow, claimed the chairman Ben Robinson suggested she wanted to work at the club so she could 'find a new husband' which he strenuously denied.

A headmistress who was excluded from an all-girls school after it was named and shamed by parents as a 'real life St Trinian’s' has received £43,000 of taxpayers' money since she was suspended, it emerged today. Amanda Thain, 54, was suspended on full pay last July from her £86,300-a-year job at Levenshulme High School for Girls in Manchester after a damning report exposed a 'core' of unruly students. A snap inspection found some of the . pupils were involved in a string of bullying incidents as well as . reports of brawling, food fights, swearing at teachers, smoking and . truancy. The school was also placed in special measures after the inspectors gave it a Grade 4 rating - the worst it can possibly give out - branding it 'inadequate' and 'requiring improvement.' The verdict led to comparisons to the fictional St Trinian's school for girls - originally created by a cartoonist in the 1940s which later became the subject of hit movies. But six months her suspension, a disciplinary inquiry into Mrs Thain is yet to be resolved and she is currently still receiving her full salary while being on gardening leave. So far, the headmistress has earned £43,000 as the inquiry continues. Today a row broke out about the payments to Mrs Thain who is head at 990 pupil school where the motto is: 'More Opportunities to Succeed.' Liberal Democrat MP John Leech, many . of whose constituents attend Levenshulme High, previusly raised the school’s . problems with Education Minister David Laws. He said he ‘couldn’t understand’ why Mrs Thain’s suspension had still not been resolved, adding: 'It . appears the council are burying their head in the sand and paying . people to remain on gardening leave, spending money they can’t afford.' Local Liberal Democrat councillor James Hennigan added: 'I understand that due process needs to be followed, but this needs to be dealt with in a timely fashion. 'Every . day, week, month that it goes by unresolved it is costing taxpayers . thousands of pounds. It is for the benefit of the suspended individuals, . staff and indeed pupils and parents that this is dealt with and not . ignored.' The investigation last year came after the school announced plans it was spending £220,000 buying iPads for every pupil to help with homework - and 'engage' with all 80 of the school's teachers. The . iPad 4 model currently retails for £389 although school managers . managed to haggle down the price to £220 per unit. Levenshulme High School for Girls, where an inspection found pupils were starting food fights, had brawls and refused to go to lessons . The school was inspected after it announced it would provide iPads for teachers and pupils . The inspection discovered some pupils were scared for their safety while at school - and others were taking part in brawls, fights, smoking on school grounds and refusing to go to lessons. One girl tearaway was thrown out of class more than 80 times with others sent out 30 times. There was also a race-fuelled mass brawl between two gangs of girls, investigators found. One large group of girls gathered in the playground and only dispersed once a police officer had been called to stand amongst them. Inspectors from Ofsted found eight pupils had been expelled in less than a year. They said there was a 'rapid deterioration' in behaviour in a few months. The inspectors also warned white British girls were 'underachieving' at the school where pupils are predominantly Pakistani and speak English as a second language. Ofsted called the unannounced inspection on July 3 after a parent complained about the behaviour of pupils. Three inspectors spoke to 100 girls and observed 19 lessons and break times and read 16 responses to a survey. Their report found behaviour had declined sharply since a previous inspection in which inspectors originally said students were 'courteous, polite and generally cheerful towards adults, visitors and each other.' The pupils' bad behaviour led to comparisons to the fictional St Trinian's school - which featured in the 2007 film starring Rupert Everett . In the report the inspectors said: 'There has been a rapid deterioration in behaviour. A core group of students has disengaged from their education and show no respect for teachers or their fellow students. 'They cause widespread disruption to learning and an unsafe learning environment resulting in eight permanent exclusions in the academic year to date. 'Responses from parents show that approximately one third of parents disagree that their child feels safe in school and approximately half disagree that the school ensures students are well behaved. 'Behaviour logs from this year show regular reports of unacceptable behaviour including students truanting from lessons, leaving the school site, refusing to go to lessons, smoking, and swearing at teachers. 'Some students have been removed from lessons over 30 times this year and one student more than 80 times - a clear illustration that the behaviour system is not working. 'Many students have no confidence in the ability of the school to combat bullying effectively. Consequently, some bullying goes unreported and is allowed to continue. MP John Leech said he ¿couldn¿t understand¿ why Mrs Thain¿s suspension had still not been resolved . 'Many students feel unsafe in school due to a wide variety of intolerable behaviours including, fighting, congestion and pushing on the stairs, teachers leaving classes unattended, teachers behaving aggressively towards students; and food and drinks being thrown. 'The majority of students behaved well in front of inspectors. Other students were observed at lunch-time, throwing drinks, congregating in a big group, swearing, talking and filming on mobile phones. 'The big group of students only dispersed once a number of staff had spoken to them and the police officer stood in the middle of them. 'Leaders and managers do not effectively prevent bullying and many students spoken to by inspectors feel that staff are unable to protect them and control those whose behaviour is disruptive and dangerous.' The report says most senior leaders at the school were ‘unaware’ of the scale of the bullying and had 'an over generous' view of the quality of teaching due to inaccurate feedback from staff. It went on: 'Teaching is often not good enough, giving rise to the underachievement of white British girls and students who are disabled or have special educational needs. A scene from the 1954 film The Belles of St Trinian's. The school - home to numerous unruly school girls - has featured in scores of adaptations since it was first published as a comic in the 40s . 'A number of students are unable to explore their learning independently of teachers because they do not have a strong grasp of English. This is compounded by the fact that not all teachers are sufficiently confident in integrating literacy support into their teaching. 'Furthermore, some students who do have a good grasp of English have insufficient understanding of specialist vocabulary used by the teacher, which excludes them from learning.' A spokesman for Manchester council said: 'Suspension is a neutral act pending the outcome of investigation into the matters leading up to it. 'It’s therefore standard employment practice that a suspended individual continues to be paid by their employer until the matter has been resolved.' The case comes as it emerged David Watchorn, head of neighbouring Abraham Moss college in Crumpsall, has been paid £56,000 since being suspended in June after falling out with his school’s governing body. Before her suspension Mrs Thain had been . praised by council bosses for saving the local library from closure by . offering to use it daily as a 'satellite school' for youngsters who need . extra teaching - and pay for the upkeep.","Headmistress Amanda Thain, 54, was suspended on full pay last July .

She is one of the stars of the most unedifying show on television, a single mother who used her airtime to show off modelling pictures as she spoke of her life on Benefits Street. Now thanks to her appearance on the controversial Channel 4 show, 27-year-old Sherrell Dillion, who goes by the nickname SB - or sexy b**** - has apparently been inundated with offers from modelling agencies after agreeing to a newspaper photoshoot. The former takeaway worker said she had . always dreamed of being a model and was even scouted age 22 but then suffered an ectopic pregnancy that left her bedridden for months. Cash-in: Sherrell Dillion appeared in a Daily Star photoshoot . Notorious: Miss Dillions, known as SB, appears on the controversial show with her son . On the most recent episode of the show, she complains of being in debt and says she wants to appear on Deal or No Deal to clear what she owes. Now MIM Agency, a Midlands-based company whose clients include Asda, Littlewoods and ITV, have approached her to be on their books, in spite of the Channel 4 show's notoriety. Benefits Street residents have confessed to cameras that they committed benefits fraud, while one man even let cameras accompany him on a shoplifting spree. Police have been seen on the street several times since the show began speaking to residents, while officers also confirmed they had launched investigations in response to footage from the show. However, undeterred agency owner Amelia Cope told the Daily Star: 'Sherrell has a ""real life"" look that lots of companies we work with will be interested in. Trouble: Police have been at James Turner Street since the show aired - an officer can be seen here leading away Mark Thomas, who told the cameras he had fiddled his benefits . Unsightly: The programme shows that there are often large amounts of rubbish heaped up on the street . Work: Modelling agencies have apparently been unafraid to offer her work, despite the unsavoury associations of the programme . Determined: SB won over the nation on Benefits Street because of her sheer determination - and it's paid off . 'She's also got experience of being in front of the cameras, so we can put her forward for work as an extra with TV companies as well.' SB's offers of work, which she hails as an 'opportunity', are in stark contrast to other, more unsavoury repercussion's of Benefits Streets' runaway success. The show's first episode was widely criticised for following resident Danny Smith around Birmingham city centre on a shoplifting spree. Armed with a shopping bag lines with tinfoil to foil alarm systems, he told cameras: 'Fill it up with a £2,000 coat or whatever you ****ing want, you’ll walk out of the shop and you’re coming out with no alarms going off’, he said. The controversial opener to the five-part documentary also featured Mark Thomas, who lives on James Turner Street with his partner and children, admitting that he fiddled his benefits. The father-of-two was led from his house by police shortly after the revelation. The Daily Mail also revealed that self-proclaimed 'mother of the street' White Dee has a conviction for theft, after swindling Birmingham City Council out of more than £13,000. Televised: Miss Dillion as she appears in publicity for Benefits Street . No strangers: Figures revealed that police are called to James Turner Street every month - a figure likely to have increased after the exposure from Channel 4 . Illegal: The programme's second episode showed an influx of Romanians, including these labourers, who did not have work permits . Notorious: The goings-on of James Turner Street have been exposed to the world after millions tuned in to Benefits Street . More shockingly, community leaders revealed that the shows notoriety has even led to children being bullied for living in Winson Green, the neighbourhood which is home to James Turner Street. Community organised Desmon Jaddoo told MailOnline that concerns had been raised at the Oasis Foundry Academy that children who featured on, or were in some way connected with, the show were subject to playground abuse. In one extreme case, Mr Jaddoo revealed that adults 'were driving down the street hurling abuse' while the children were outside playing. Police last week also raised concerns about scenes featuring a large family of Romanian immigrants, in which a 20-year-old man boasted to cameras that his 'wife' was just 15 years old. He made the comments despite it being illegal to marry at age 15 both in the UK and in Romania, but claimed the set-up was 'no problem' because of his culture. However, the show does not reveal what, if any, benefits Miss Dillion is receiving. Another agency, Spirit, is hoping to set up a test shoot with Miss Dillion due to her real 'potential'. Miss Dillion has also been told she should do dental modelling because she has 'good teeth', but she has her sights set on bikini modelling, the Daily Star reports. Speaking about the response to her photoshoot, SB said: 'I'm just going to try to keep my feet on the ground, but I really hope this will give me an opportunity. Bright future: One agency believe she has real potential but SB maintains that she will keep her feet firmly on the ground . Local celebrity: SB says the locals have been very supportive and even stopped her in the street to wish her luck in her new career . 'Everyone in Turner Street went out and bought the paper and I've had people stopping me in the street to wish me luck.' It was revealed on the show that just 5 per cent of Turner Street in Birmingham's residents are in work. Miss Dillion has also been inundated with supportive messages on social media and even received a message, which has since been deleted, from model Imogen Thomas offering to give her advice. Miss Dillion brought up her two children Terrell, eight, and Kiwi, three, on her own after escaping a violent relationship which saw her ex jailed for two years. Famous fan: Model and Big Brother star, Imogen Thomas, showed SB her support via Twitter .","Sherrell Dillion, 27, appeared on Channel 4's Benefits Street .

The furore over the government’s handling of the devastating floods in Somerset is ‘irrelevant’ to the people affected, Ken Clarke has claimed. The senior Tory minister dismissed the ‘lynch mob’ looking for someone to blame after communities on the Somerset Levels spent a month under water. Insisting ‘this is the winter, it is wet, it has rained’, he also defied climate sceptics in his party to suggest the storms may have been may be ‘made worse’ by climate change. Tory minister Ken Clarke accused the media of whipping up a 'lynch mob' against the government, which was irrelevant to the people affected by the floods in Somerset . Troops have been sent in to as Somerset is braced for more floods. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has admitted it could take 20 years to solve the area’s problems. High winds, torrential rain and a tidal surge are expected to swamp coastal defences and swell already bursting rivers over the weekend. This will spell more misery for the Somerset Levels, which have been under water for a month. Ministers have come under fire for not acting sooner, and after backlash from local MPs David Cameron this week appeared to take charge of the situation personally. He announced dredging would resume as soon as is practical and warned Cabinet colleagues that arguments between departments would not be tolerated. Tory minister Ken Clarke . However, Mr Clarke accused the media of whipping up mock anger about the problems in Somerset. He said it was a 'journalistic cliche' that when there is a disaster 'somebody has got to be to blame'. Appearing on BBC 2’s Question Time, he said: ‘I do think the present furore about Somerset, who’s to blame, somebody’s got to be summoned, the sort-of lynch mob stuff is slightly irrelevant to the people there and it should be addressed sensibly and professionally.’ He added: ‘This is the winter, it is wet, it has rained. It may be made worse by climate change.’ He also rejected the idea that the floods proved that the government was failing to address problems caused by global warming. ‘I think it’s ridiculous to take this example and say we’re ignoring climate change – I’ve noticed a few windmills, I’ve noticed a few solar panels, I’ve noticed energy bills going up and then people in a populist way saying ‘we’re going to have a political price on energy’ when you have an international wholesale market and we’re trying to reduce the carbon levels.’ Local people have put up banners and flags in the village of Burrowbridge demanding the government act to dredge the river to stop a repeat of the devastating floods . With more rain forecast, Environment Agency staff have brought in extra sandbags to for properties near the River Parrett . Government sources stressed that Mr Clarke was not criticising those affected by the ‘real tragedy’ of the floods. But his comments come the Environment Agency faces renewed criticism for stopping dredging in the mid-1990s. More than 60 pumps are running at full power to drain an estimated 1.5million tons of water from the flooded area but more storms will only deepen the crisis, which has seen the Environment Agency accused of gross incompetence for failing to dredge clogged rivers that have burst their banks. Pat Flaherty, deputy chief executive of Somerset county council, said the Levels could be under water for weeks. The Ministry of Defence has sent three military planners – an Army major and captain and a lieutenant commander from the Royal Navy – to meet council chiefs to assess the disaster.

Coming in: At first light, an advanced party of engineers rolled into the drowned villages to scope out the worst-affected areas and work out how to help them . Mr Paterson said last night after chairing a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergency committee: ‘We established that we do need a proper 20-year plan to satisfactorily cover this very specialist part of the country. ‘It’s clear from our forecasts that there is further bad weather coming in, there will be heavy rain and that, combined with significant high spring tides around the coast, mean that I’m afraid there is real risk of flooding to properties.’ He reiterated David Cameron’s call for dredging to restart for the first time since 2005. The Prime Minister tried to seize control of the situation on Wednesday, calling for an end to the arguments that have held up action and insisting that dredging must go ahead. The Environment Agency has come in for severe criticism for stopping dredging in the mid-1990s. But David Jordan, operations director . at the quango, who earns more than £160,000 a year, told Sky News last . night: ‘People are trying to make this an Environment Agency-only . problem.

Trouble ahead: A Nasa satellite image shows the huge storm over the Atlantic heading for the UK . ‘It is something which is shared by others and must be owned by others so we come to a collective and agreed way forward.’ His organisation has pledged only £350,000 to dredge the two key rivers in Somerset – the Parrett and Tone – an operation which will cost at least £4million. Yet it has been willing to spend £20million on a bird sanctuary on the Somerset coast. ‘We have a responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers’ money we are given to invest in reducing flood risk is spent to the best effect,’ Mr Jordan said. ‘We are committed to the dredging, we . have put money on the table and that won’t change. But it is also clear . that other parties need to pay their way too. ‘We . believe that even had the dredging taken place, we would still be . seeing very extensive flooding across the Somerset Levels and Moors.’ Mr Paterson said a plan would be in place within six weeks for a long-term approach to tackling flood risk in Somerset. ‘We . established quite quickly that we do need to dredge quite quickly the . two main rivers, we established that we do need a proper 20-year plan,’ he said. ‘I’ve given all the local agencies six weeks to come together with a definitive plan.’ Royal Marines from 40 Commando, based in nearby Taunton, are on standby to assist in the crisis as the fresh storms approach.

Sinderby WI's programme secretary Elaine Fay managed to persuade North Yorkshire Police's armed response unit to hold a demonstration at their January meeting . It was a long way from Jam and Jerusalem. Instead of crocheting, felt craft and cakes, the ladies of Sinderby Women’s Institute found themselves confronted by a full  arsenal of handguns and automatic weapons. Not only that, there were tasers, CS gas canisters, a battering ram, a stinger device, and stun grenades for them to inspect. The weapons were laid out by members of a crack firearms unit from North Yorkshire Police, who had been invited to attend one of the women’s monthly meetings at a small village hall. The WI group had witnessed nothing like it in its 35-year history. One woman gasped and another was heard to exclaim ‘wow’ as the muscular Sergeant Roy Jakins – dressed in his obligatory armoured vest – gave them an insight into his life as a firearms officer. Event organiser Elaine Fay has been attempting to spice up the group’s predictable talks and demonstrations. After three years of trying, she succeeded in getting the firearms team to come. The force initially offered her a Neighbourhood Watch talk. Mrs Fay, 52, said: ‘I thought “how boring, we need something with a bit more oomph,” so I just contacted the firearms unit myself.’ Official clearance was given 18 months ago and finally the date was booked. The plain-speaking Yorkshirewoman told the sergeant the ladies didn’t want to be short-changed. Her instructions were: ‘Come suited and booted. We want to see something. Don’t just stand and talk.’ The team from North Yorkshire Police's armed response unit took an array of weapons including tasers and a selection of guns (file picture) Members of the WI were also shown items including CS gas canisters (file picture, left) and truncheons (file picture, right) The 11-strong audience of women, . ranging in age from their late 30s to late 60s, were allowed to handle . the guns and equipment during the meeting, which lasted for two hours. Mrs . Fay, who works as a cleaner in the village pub, said: ‘We are quite a . mouthy lot and when the sergeant said he had two sets of handcuffs, . Louise (one of the members) shouted out “have you got some pink furry . ones?”. It did get a bit Fifty Shades of Grey for a while!’ The . group have previously had talks from the police dog unit and forensic . science team. ‘The police are just so interesting,’ said Mrs Fay. Treasurer . Sue Curry, 68, added: ‘We only have 14 members so it was a decent . turnout. I could hardly lift the battering ram thing. There is this . stigma about the WI, especially in rural areas, but our meetings can be . really quite interesting.’ But . some things never change. The event ended with tea  and cake.

Up to 50 troops are living at a £100-a-night hotel at taxpayers’ expense because there are not enough beds at their barracks. Around 20 Royal Marines and 30 Royal Navy personnel have been booked into the three-star Holiday Inn in Plymouth, four miles from the Devonport naval base. The hotel, near the city centre, has a restaurant, sauna, steam room, gym and satellite television. Members of the group are each receiving £25 food vouchers a day and have boasted of dining ‘on fillet steak every night’. Lucky manoeuvre: Around 50 troops, including marines like those pictured, are being housed in the Plymouth Holiday Inn . The revelation provoked anger as the Ministry of Defence has pushed through crippling military cuts, including axing 30,000 troops, fighter jets and warships, in a bid to save around £43billion. It also emerged as Prime Minister David Cameron defended the belt-tightening during an appearance before a Parliamentary committee. The MoD yesterday insisted that it was 'extremely rare' to put up troops in hotels. The story came to light after three Royal Marines enjoying a sauna at the Holiday Inn told another guest of the situation. According to the men they had been placed at the hotel 'indefinitely'. The man said: 'They seemed to be enjoying themselves. They told me some of them were going to Nando's every night. Better than the barracks: The servicemen are staying at the Plymouth Holiday Inn, just four miles from their base . Lap of luxury: The marines, who are given a £25 food voucher every day, boasted of eating fillet steak every night . 'But in a time of defence cutbacks sticking 50 troops in a hotel seems like madness. 'It must be costing so much money to put them up there. The hotel is three star and they said they're getting a £25 food vouchers a day. 'It seems crazy they're in a hotel just four miles away from the barracks just because the military can't get their act together.' Defence sources insisted the MoD had negotiated a special discount rate for the rooms of about £50 a night. The situation is expected to last 'a few days', they said. Insiders said there were not enough beds at barracks because there had been an influx of troops passing through Devonport. An MoD spokesman said: 'Due to a slight increase in the requirement for accommodation in Plymouth we can confirm that a limited number of Navy personnel are staying at a local hotel. 'We can be clear that this is only a temporary arrangement to ensure their duties can be carried out and a special rate was secured to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer.'","Around 20 marines and 30 Navy personnel have been booked in .

A pensioner who killed her husband of 50 years after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer claimed today that it was an act of mercy. A court heard Sheila Sampford plead guilty to strangling her husband 82-year-old John, who was dying from leukaemia, at their home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. But she insisted that her motive was to end his pain, and must now face a separate hearing to determine if the murder was indeed an act of mercy. Tragic: The home of Sheila Sampford and her . husband John, who was terminally ill with leukaemia when she strangled . him to death there on July 5 last year, before telling police she had . done so as part of a suicide pact . Mr Sampford was found dead on July 5 . last year. His wife was arrested the same day and told detectives his . death was as a result of a suicide pact. Sampford appeared at Luton Crown Court by video link from Peterborough prison, where she is being held on remand. After entering her guilty plea she was told there would have to be another hearing to decide if it was indeed a mercy killing. Guards patrol the women's wing of Peterborough prison, where Sampford is being held on remand until she can be sentenced following another hearing . Neil Moore, prosecuting, told Luton Crown Court: 'The issue that arises in this case is whether she believed this killing was an act of mercy.' John Price QC, defending, said: 'The only matter is whether he asked her to do what she then did to him.' Mr Sampford was terminally ill with leukemia when his wife of 50 years strangled him to death at their home in the Bancroft Park area of Milton Keynes. Euthanasia, a Greek-derived term meaning 'good death', is where a patients agree to allow another person, usually a doctor, to end their lives. It has been the focus of much controversy in recent years. Although it and assisted suicide have become accepted ways to die in some European countries and American states, both practises remain illegal in Britain. Judge Richard Foster ordered a separate hearing to determine the facts of the case before passing sentence. Murderers automatically receive a life sentence, but if Sampford's actions were motivated by mercy it could affect how much of that she must spend in prison before being freed on licence.","Sheila Sampford strangled her husband John, 82, to death at their home .

A taxpayer-funded website which allows drug dealers to get illegal substances tested for quality has provoked a backlash. The service called Wedinos (Welsh Emerging Drugs and Identification of Novel Substances Project) was set up to enable health professionals and police to check the ingredients of suspect pills and powders. It also offers people advice on how to start taking drugs and safeguards to consider when getting high. Controversial: Users can submit drugs to Wedinos for testing, in complete anonymity, then log on to the site to see the quality of their drugs . The site, paid for by Public Health Wales, has now been launched . nationally in an attempt to combat  health fears sparked by the . explosion in the number of so-called legal highs. But . it has sparked anger from politicians who have accused it of diverting much-needed cash from frontline NHS services and also providing a . de facto kitemark of quality which would be exploited by drug dealers . as a 'marketing tool' to boost their profits. Substances sent anonymously to Wedinos . are analysed to identify their active ingredients, which are listed on . the website alongside a photo of the substance and the packaging it came . in. Conservative . health spokesman in the Welsh Assembly Darren Miller told Radio 4's . Today programme: 'It’s not just legal highs that this website allows . people to test. It’s also illegal drugs as well. 'It’s . clearly open to abuse by drugs pushers who can use this, because it’s . in the public domain, as a marketing tool to publicly advertise the . purity of their substances and therefore increase their prices. Backlash: Wedinos has provoked a fierce backlash for enabling drug dealers to test their own stash (Stock picture) Analysis: Included on the substances listed on the website was a fruit pastille coated in LSD - which came back positive for the hallucinogen . 'If you go on to the website, you’ll find there are brand names on there, there’s packaging on there, and it’s heroin, crack, methamphetamine, all these sorts of substances that people are sending in to be tested. And it includes even advice on how to snort, inject and smoke those substances. Wedinos aims to reduce harm to drug-users by providing rapid information about substances on the streets. A total of 175 samples have been received and tested by Wedinos project. The project cost £103,000 to set up and has a budget of £90,500 a year - less than 1 per cent of the overall substance misuse budget. Of the samples sent to the project, 84 per cent were new psychoactive substances (NPS), of which 16 per cent were synthetic cannabinoids and 31 per cent amphetamine-like stimulants. A spokesman for the project said: 'Wedinos does not test for purity of a sample, and therefore cannot provide any information as to the relative ""cleanliness"" of a drug. 'What the system does do is enable individuals who have purchased substances believing them to be legal to ascertain the true content. 'Of the samples collected to date, bought as legal highs, 27 per cent were found to contain controlled drugs.' 'I think it’s quite clear that the Welsh Labour government have given up the fight against drugs. That’s why they’ve established this website. 'When it’s costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, I would rather see that cash reinvested back into the frontline NHS services that are in crisis at the moment here in Wales.' Included on the substances listed on the website was a fruit pastille coated in the hallucinogen LSD. The sample came back positive for Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD. The project, which cost £103,000 to set up and has a budget of £90,500 a year, has also raised questions about the dangers posed by sending drugs via the mail system. Users are warned on the website: 'The mail system prohibits the posting of controlled drugs and narcotics. Do not knowingly submit samples of controlled drugs via the postal mechanism.' Recent years have seen increasing amounts of new substances entering the UK drug market, manufactured in labs abroad to mimic the effects of known narcotics while sidestepping the law by changing their precise chemical make-up. The unfamiliarity of the substances involved has introduced new risks, as users and health workers can be caught out by unexpected and damaging side-effects. Josie Smith of Public Health Wales . told Today: 'Essentially, the Wedinos project was established as a . consequence of a call from clinicians within emergency departments, . ambulance and other health services, along with the criminal justice . service, where they were being presented with individuals who had taken . substances but were unaware of what they were. 'The clinician would be unaware of what the substance was. They didn’t know how to treat. 'Over . the last few years, we’ve seen a real sea-change in the drugs market. We refer to the term ""new psychoactive substances"" because the term . ""legal highs"" can denote a degree of safety, and actually we are finding . that there are a number of adverse effects that people are . experiencing.' Taking drugs: The publicly-funded Wedinos website offers advice for people who are thinking about starting to take drugs . Ms Smith added: 'We do not specify purity . of substances, what we do is test a sample that has been submitted and . explicitly name all of the substances that are contained within it. It’s . not a purity measure.' Ms Smith said 52 per cent of the samples sent to Wedinos were bought as legal highs, but 27 per cent of those actually contained illegal substances. Evidence from across the UK showed that, even within a single batch of substances brought into the country from China or India, the actual chemical make-up can vary widely.","Website allows drug-users to send substances for analysis in anonymity .

Calum McEwan, 38, was knocked unconscious after he was smashed in the face by a Lothian Bus in Edinburgh . A man has been awarded £9,000 compensation after a bus wing mirror hit him in the face and left him looking like 'Frankenstein’s monster'. Calum McEwan, 38, was knocked unconscious when the vehicle smashed into him as he stood on the pavement in Edinburgh. He needed 18 stitches to his eye and head which split open. Mr McEwan, an estate worker at Heriot-Watt University, was awarded £9,000 in damages - despite Lothian Buses claiming their driver was not at fault. He said: 'I don’t know how the fast the bus was travelling but I felt lucky to be alive. 'I’d just popped out to get a few odds and ends from the shop. 'I was standing on the pavement and looked to my right to check the traffic and the bus mirror hit me immediately. 'I was knocked out cold and when I woke up there was a paramedic over me. 'The police closed off the road and an ambulance took me to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. 'The mirror hit me next to my eye. I hit the other side of my head on the pavement when I fell and cut that open too. 'At hospital I had an MRI scan then got 18 stitches to the cuts and was kept in overnight. I looked like Frankenstein’s monster the next day.' He originally lost his bid for compensation after a sheriff ruled that the collision in November 2010 was 'not reasonably foreseeable'. But appeal judges at the Court of Session found that the sheriff had 'erred in making findings of fact which have no proper foundation'. Compensation: Mr McEwan won £9,000 in damages after the incident which left him in hospital (stock image) Lord Eassie, Lady Clark and Lord Philip also ruled that pedestrians were 'entitled' to be 'not at risk' from passing vehicles. Mr McEwan, who lives in the city, said: 'I hope Lothian Buses learn a lesson and bring in training to avoid this happening again. 'People should be safe on the pavement. The next victim could be killed.' Personal injury lawyer Jennifer Murphy of Slater & Gordon, who represented Calum, added: 'If you are on the pavement you have the right to expect that you won’t be hit by a bus. 'So we are delighted that the original decision was overturned and our client has got a fair settlement for the injuries that he incurred.'

Double life: Frank Bough on Breakfast TV with co-star Selina Scott while he was still a presenter . The quiet village where Frank Bough has chosen to spend his latter years in self-imposed  exile could have been purposely designed to avoid unwanted attention. The 81-year-old former BBC presenter’s home in Berkshire is on a corner plot with a secluded walled garden, and a  15-year-old Ford Focus sits on the narrow driveway. Indeed, the un-starry house would not immediately strike you as the sort of place a man who was once among TV’s highest-earners would choose for his retirement. Certainly, the property is big step down from his previous Thames-side mansion a few miles away, where Bough and his wife Nesta once threw glamorous garden parties for his showbusiness friends. Those days, when Nesta used to be regularly seen by locals whizzing around the country lanes in her blue Toyota MR2 sports car are sadly, long gone. Neighbours say Bough rarely ventures out. Instead, the former Breakfast Time TV, Grandstand and Nationwide host is content to potter around his garden or listen to classical music on the radio. For the best part of 20 years, he has chosen to live in reclusive obscurity with his wife after the shame of two very public sex and drug scandals that brought his career to a premature end. Now, however, the broadcaster is to make a return to our screens. He will appear in a forthcoming BBC2 documentary looking back at the 1983 launch of breakfast television which saw him anchor the BBC’s Breakfast Time. His decision to emerge from the shadows is all the more surprising since he has steadfastly turned down invitations to mark previous anniversaries of the show. Ex-colleagues say that his past refusals have stemmed from a fear of having to re-live his public infamy. Early start: The first episode of Breakfast Time, pictured in 1983, included a champagne celebration. Bough is pictured centre, surrounded by his team . Certainly, for the 25th anniversary in 2008, he was absent when fellow former presenters Selina Scott, Sue Cook and others reunited on screen to reminisce about old times. Likewise, friends confirm that he’s rebuffed several approaches from television producers down the  years keen to sound him out about a return to the small screen for other roles. True to form, this week at his home Bough politely but firmly tells me: ‘I’m sorry, I’m not speaking to the Press.’ He has kept a dignified silence since he confessed to a newspaper about his one-time predilection  for prostitutes and cocaine,  shocking viewers who loved his homely, breakfast TV sofa image, complete with avuncular smile and comfy jumpers. However, friends says Bough has now decided to restore his name as one of the finest broadcasters of his generation. Talented: Frank Bough delivers a segment on the Breakfast programme . ‘To put it bluntly, Frank doesn’t want be remembered any more for snorting coke with hookers in a seedy vice den,’ one BBC contemporary told me this week. ‘He’d rather people were talking about how he helped the Beeb trounce our rivals at TV-am when we both launched breakfast programmes 30 years ago.’ Bough’s decision comes at a time when the spotlight has been turned on the sexual habits of BBC staff during the Seventies and Eighties. Former colleagues are rather surprised that against this backdrop, Bough has agreed to step back into the public eye. Sally Jones, who became the network’s first woman sports presenter when she joined Bough on Breakfast Time in 1986, tells me that there is a big difference between her former colleague’s behaviour with consenting adults and the revelations about Jimmy Savile. Co-hosts: Bough pictured with co-hosts Debbie Rix, left, and Selina Scott, right, in 1983 . She said: ‘Many of us had numerous passes from other senior people within the BBC. I had a nasty run-in with Jimmy Savile in a lift when he tried to touch me up - and I gave him a real mouthful. 'But, I have to say, there was nothing at all like that from Frank towards me.’ However, Bough’s behaviour did elicit a hair-raising story from fellow presenter Fern Britton. In her autobiography, she claimed that he once leaned over to whisper in her ear during the early days of her career: ‘Well, young lady, I wonder how long it will be before I am having an affair with you?’ She also alleged Bough was crude about his fellow Breakfast Time host, Selina Scott, of whom he is said to have observed ungallantly: ‘I bet she even rides a bike with her legs together.’ Past performance: Bough in his days as a sports commentator . But it was not what happened in the office that would be his downfall. Instead, it happened in 1988, a year after he left Breakfast Time to become the presenter of the BBC’s Holiday programme. One of the country’s highest-paid broadcasters - on a reputed £200,000 salary - he was sacked by the Corporation after a red-top Sunday newspaper revealed he had taken cocaine with prostitutes at a Mayfair brothel. Amid a torrent of more damaging revelations, he attempted to stem the tide by giving an ill-advised interview to the now defunct News of the World in a bid to protect his marriage and spare his three sons humiliation. In a grovelling mea culpa, he confessed to snorting cocaine with escort girls and drug-pushers and to watching couples have sex at wild parties, though he insisted the drug made him unable to have sex himself. He said he’d been lured into the world of high-class prostitutes after being introduced to a French-born vice queen. He insisted: ‘I’m not a wicked man, nor do I mean any harm or evil to people. I’ve made mistakes, but everyone’s entitled to do that. No one suffered but my wife, my family and myself. 'It was a brief but  appalling period in my life. Don’t condemn my entire career for a brief episode I regret.’ He then claimed a therapist had cured him of his cocaine habit and his ‘other life’ - ‘for good’. Ex-colleague Sally Jones says she’s convinced Bough’s drug-taking was, in part, his way of beating the exhaustion caused by his workaholism and gruelling early-starts on breakfast TV. ‘One element of the problems he had may have been triggered by his absolutely punishing schedule,’ she says. Mea culpa: Frank Bough, and his wife Nesta, in a revealing television interview following revelations about his sexual activities . She recalls how they had to get up at 3am or 4am to be ready for Breakfast Time and then often go on to front corporate videos or do media training. ‘I couldn’t believe how hard he pushed himself. Once, I remember we took a cab to South London after several hours of presenting Breakfast Time, both of us so tired we could hardly keep our eyes open. ‘I hadn’t the slightest inkling that he was doing cocaine, but in retrospect I think he may well have used it to help him stay awake and alert. Still together: Nesta stood by Frank despite the revelations . ‘Such early-starts, four or five mornings on the trot, meant that you were exhausted by the end of the week. It was attritional, and most of us agreed with  Selina Scott when she said that working on Breakfast aged you ten years.’ Despite his public shame, Bough’s wife, a physiotherapist, stood by him. When the scandal died down, he resumed his career and was recruited by LWT to present its show Six O’Clock Live and then ITV’s Rugby World Cup coverage. However, more deeply embarrassing tabloid revelations were to follow after Bough was photographed leaving a sado-masochistic vice den. He was said to have  spent 50 minutes in a ‘torture chamber’ featuring a slave cage and school canes. The following day he went on TV with his wife and said shamefacedly: ‘I am feeling exceedingly stupid. I bitterly regret many of the things in my life, and if only I could undo them I would.’ Now, surely, there was no return. Yet he took on some radio work, presenting a show on a London talk station before all-but disappearing from public life in 1996. It was the end of a distinguished career. Away from the spotlight, Bough joined a local choir in Windsor, the Royal Free Singers, and in 2001  had a liver transplant after being told he had only weeks to live  when doctors discovered a malignant tumour. Now, though, it seems he wants to rehabilitate his reputation before it’s too late. As his ex-colleague Sally Jones says: ‘Frank was a brilliant all-round presenter - one of the top two or three of his generation. It’s understandable that is how he’d like to be remembered.’ Whether that’s possible, at a time when the sexual morals of BBC  veterans are under such intense scrutiny, is quite another matter.","The 81-year-old presenter helped launched BBC early-morning TV .

Legal fight: Beth Warren arriving at the High Court today where she is arguing the destruction of her husband's sperm should be delayed . Scroll down for video . A grieving widow who needs more time to decide whether she wants her dead husband's baby is at the High Court today to stop his frozen sperm being destroyed. Beth Warren, 26, will ask a judge to ignore a time limit imposed by the UK fertility regulator who says she must use Warren Brewer's sample to conceive by next April. Before ski instructor Mr Brewer died of a brain tumour in February 2012 they agreed they wanted two children, so he had his sperm frozen for use after he was gone. They married in a hospice six weeks before he died. But unless the High Court agrees to them being kept for longer than usual, they will be destroyed in 14 months. Ms Warren said coping with the . personal trauma of the loss of her husband, and her brother in a car crash weeks later, made it impossible for her to make any . decisions about her future within the timescale. Her legal team will argue it should be extended . so she can make a choice in her own time. 'I'm exhausted but it's . not a fight I can give up - Warren said he wanted to give me this . chance. I need to do this,' she said previously. Mr Brewer had signed consent forms allowing the storage of his sperm so Ms Warren could conceive after his death, known as post-mortem conception, but on a time-limited basis after which the samples are set to be destroyed. Mrs Warren, who took her husband’s Christian name as her surname after his death, wants to be financially secure before bringing a child into the world. The physiotherapist from Birmingham said: ‘I am still trying to make myself happy again – you don’t have a child because you are lonely and heartbroken'. Mrs Warren, who put her studies and career on hold to care for her dying husband, said: ‘We just fell head over heels in love. It was a long time ago that we made plans that when we are engaged and married we would have children. ‘Ideally we’d have a boy and a girl and we talked about names. I am just trying to do the right thing.’ Tough: Beth says when her husband Warren died her brother was killed weeks later, leaving her unable to take the decision about when to start a family . Argument: The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says it has 'every sympathy' with Ms Warren but says that they have 'no discretion' over the timings . Mrs Warren added: 'I have the full support of Warren’s family in my legal battle and in whatever decision I make, and they have told me how proud they are of how I am dealing with the situation.' The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has said it has 'no discretion to extend the storage period beyond that to which her husband gave written consent'. The issue will now be determined by family division judge Mrs Justice Hogg. Jenni Richards QC, for Mrs Warren, told the judge that Mr Brewer had wanted to ensure that his sperm could be used by his wife after his death. And she said Mrs Warren was not yet 'emotionally, physically or practically' ready to conceive. 'There is no ambiguity or lack of clarity about what Warren wanted,' said Ms Richards. 'His wishes and intentions are clear. He signed every form he was given to sign.' And Mrs Warren, 28, told the court: 'I am sure there is absolutely no way he wanted to limit my choices in this situation.' Mrs Warren, who uses her late husband's first name as her surname, added: 'All we knew was every form we were ever given we read and we filled in and we signed it. I found it quite confusing.' Mrs Justice Hogg is due to hear arguments from lawyers representing the HFEA this afternoon.She said she would not make a decision today. A woman who fought a similar legal fight nearly 20 years ago was in court to offer Mrs Warren support. In the mid-1990s, Diane Blood, a 47-year-old writer from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, won the right to use her late husband's sperm to try for a child they had planned together before his sudden death from meningitis. 'Mrs Warren got in touch with me,' Mrs Blood, who has two sons aged 15 and 11, told journalists. 'I hope she wins.'","Beth Warren, 28, from Birmingham said she needs more time to think .

It was double joy for one mother after she was given the cancer all-clear on the same day as she discovered that her son had been picked for England's rugby union team. Joyce Burrell, 64, of Huddersfield, was celebrating the England call for 26-year-old Northampton Saints centre Luther Burrell. But just hours after hearing of his call-up, there were tears of relief as doctors gave Mrs Burrell good news about her illness, telling her that tests showed that she was in the clear. Geoff and Joyce Burrell have two things to celebrate: Joyce has been given the cancer all-clear and their son has just been selected for this weekend's England game . Luther is expected to run out for England in the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday afternoon in the RBS Six Nations opener against France - and he wouldn't have ever played rugby if it wasn't for his mother. When Luther found out on Monday that he had been selected for his England debut, he . had cause to be grateful for the angry email his mother, Joyce, sent . Stuart Lancaster many years ago. The . Northampton centre was 15 at the time and had been overlooked by Leeds, . where the man who is now national coach was in charge of the academy. Mrs . Burrell was not amused, as Lancaster soon realised. Stung by her . message, he invited Luther in for a trial and his rugby career took off . from there. Now, as he prepares for a daunting . first Test appearance in Saturday's RBS 6 Nations opener against France . in Paris, Burrell recalled the episode. ‘When . I was 15, one of my team-mates at Huddersfield managed to get picked up . by Leeds’ elite player development scheme,’ he said. ‘I . was pretty unhappy about it so I went home and had a bit of a sulk to . my parents. My mother said, “I’m not having this”, and fired an email . across to the secretary at Leeds. It got to Stuart, he got back and . invited me to a trial. Joyce is celebrating the England call for 26-year-old Northampton Saints centre Luther Burrell . Joyce was diagnosed with suspected cancer in November but medics told her yesterday that she had got the all clear . ‘I . had the trial a couple of weeks later and I haven’t looked back since. I . owe a lot to my parents anyway - for driving me around, up and down the . country, and I owe a lot to my mum for writing that email as well!’ But . for weeks, it seemed likely that Joyce would miss his big day because . of the hospital appointments scheduled in for the same week. Now . Joyce and husband Geoff hope to be on the touchline for kick-off, . although they say their plans are still unconfirmed, as they were forced . to leave booking tickets, travel and accommodation until the very last . minute. 'I was very emotional . when he went to Rome with the England team recently,' said Joyce. 'That was a big . thing but this has always been his ultimate aim so it will be very . emotional seeing him step out on to the turf if we are able to go.' It was also an emotional moment for Joyce and Geoff, who were given the news of their son's triumph at their Lindley home. Mother-of-two Joyce said: 'I got the first call from Luther at 5.15pm . on Tuesday when he rang and said: ""I’m giving you the heads-up, mum, I . may be going to France."" 'He said he would ring me later that evening and at 8pm he called to say: ""I’m getting my cap, mum."" 'My . 11-year-old granddaughter Kaseyleigh was here at the time and she was . just jumping around with joy. She is so proud of him as we all are.' Joyce is unsure if they will make it to the match in France as they may have left it too late to book flights . Luther has been edging towards his first England cap for some time, impressing with his consistently excellent performances for Northampton, right, pictured age 16 . Being selected is a dream come true for Luther, who becomes the first Huddersfield player to represent England . at rugby union since Norman Macleod ‘Nim’ Hall, who made his international debut against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park on in 1947. Luther, . who is 6ft 3in and weighs over 17st, has been edging towards his first . England cap for some time, impressing with his consistently excellent . performances for Northampton.

The piece of cloth stained with the blood of the late Pope John Paul has today been recovered in the basement of two of the men detained for stealing the reliquary last week. Police believe that the men accused of stealing the cloth, both in their early twenties, are drug addicts, a press conference in L'Aquila, east of Rome, was told today. The piece of blood-soaked cloth worn by the Pope when he was shot in a failed assassination attempt in 1981 was stolen on Saturday from a medieval sanctuary in the Abruzzo mountains. Assassination attempt: The ampule contains a piece of blood-soaked cloth that dates back to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II on May 13 1981, in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City . Thieves sawed through iron bars on the . window, officials said, and took the relic (left) alongside a crucifix. There . was no CCTV or alarm in the chapel (right) Thieves ignored other items and focused on this, giving rise to speculation that it was Satanists . Earlier this week, police recovered the metal frame used to hold the relic, following a search involving over 50 officers and sniffer dogs, but could not track the fabric itself until today. Bishop Giovanni D'Ercole told the news conference in Rome, that he had pieced together the reliquary and the cloth. The recovered piece of fabric was missing just a few filaments of cloth and gold thread, he said. ‘I think John Paul has forgiven them. I think we have to do the same,’ D'Ercole said of the men. Two of the three men arrested over . the theft were described as drug addicts aged 23 and 24 who were known . to the police for a range of petty crimes. A . police spokesman said the men 'did not understand the relic's value' and 'cannot remember where they threw away the precious loot', according . to a report by the ANSA news agency. Close call: The Pope was shot and critically wounded when Mehmet Ali Agca (his gun is circled) shsot him four times while he was entering the square . Pope John Paull II is due to be declared a Saint in April this year at which point the value of the relic would increase dramatically. President of the village cultural society, Pasquale Corriere, believed it had been a planned theft. He said: ‘It was no doubt stolen to order. The thieves touched nothing but the relic and the crucifix. ‘They . did not force the door of the sacristy or open the chest containing . donations, which convinces me that [the relic] was the target’. Venerated since medieval times for their healing powers, religious relics still have the power to draw crowds. Grisly: Other remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an operation . A . selection of artefacts associated with John Paul II is touring Europe, . as the Vatican prepares to officially declare the former Pope a saint in . April. The relic was . bestowed on the tiny sanctuary of Pietro della Ienca, on the mountain . peak of Gran Sasso, where the pontiff used to take skiing holidays. The relic was given to the chapel in 2011 by John Paul’s private secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz. Other . grisly remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock . that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 . assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few . days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an . operation. The mantle, . which John Paul II was wearing when he was targeted in St Peter's . Square, was secretly hidden by Dziwisz and its existence only revealed . after his death in 2005. Religious . orders are vying for ampules of blood, taken by the pope's personal . physician and sent to a hospital in Rome during his dying days in . case a blood transfusion was needed. One . precious vessel of blood was almost lost in September 2012 when a . priest carrying it on a train, near Rome, was distracted and robbed by . three bandits. It was found just hours later lying in a field. The . relics were a crucial part of the campaign which saw John Paul II made . the fastest saint in modern times. The event is to take place in . record-breaking time just nine years after his death in 2005. The last obstacle to his canonisation was cleared last year when doctors approved the second of two required miracles. The Vatican maintains that to put a price on a sacred objects is sacrilegious. But Ebay does a roaring trade in JP II relics with 'authentic' vestments worn by the late Pope starting at about $40. In . 2007 the Vatican was overrun with nearly 200,000 requests for pieces of . John Paul II's cassock after offering them for free on the internet.","Blood-soaked cloth stolen from chapel in Abruzzo mountains on Saturday .

Mark Booth, 53, from Ripley, Derbyshire, drank two pints in the pub before strangling his wife's cat, Oli . Booth, who is no longer with his wife, smirked outside the court where he admitted strangling his wife's cat yesterday. John Sutcliffe, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said Booth came home from the pub at 7pm on 19 August last year and started complaining to his wife about the cat, which they had owned for about four years. He said: 'Mr Booth said to his wife the cat had worms, which she was surprised by, and said the next day she would take it for treatment.' Mr Sutcliffe said Mr Booth then went outside, and Mrs Booth heard the sound of the bin lid shutting two minutes later. He said: 'He walked back into the house and she described him as being covered in his own blood from scratches to his arm. 'He said to his wife: ""The cat wonâ€™t bother you any more.  I killed it, I strangled it.  You know it had to go.'

He added: 'The couple are no longer together any more and it is not known if that is because of a consequence of this or whether it was a contributing factor. 'The couple had owned the cat for about four years, it was extremely affectionate, a female tabby called Oli. 'After the incident she [Mrs Booth] was very upset. She immediately left the house, and went to a friendâ€™s where they discussed what happened and what they should do. 'She then decided to call the RSPCA.' Mr Sutcliffe said the cat was removed from the bin and taken to a vet who carried out a post-mortem examination on Oli. He told the court: 'What there was, was evidence that the cat had been twisted by its neck. 'When Booth was interviewed about the incident he first said it was his wife that had got rid of the cat. 'But he later conceded he did it himself and that he should not have killed it in this way. He said he had been drinking but that he had only drunk two pints and was not drunk.'

Free school meals are to be extended to all infant pupils in England at a cost of £600million a year. Nick Clegg will announce today that from next September an extra 1.5million children will qualify for the meals, regardless of their parents’ income. The Deputy Prime Minister will tell the Lib Dem conference that the policy – which will save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child – was his price for agreeing to Tory plans for a tax break for married couples, worth about £150 a year. Scroll down for video . Free: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and wife Miriam Gonzales visited a school ahead of an announcement of free lunches for four, five and six year-olds in England . Not impressed: As the Cleggs around healthy fruit snacks to pupils at Lairdslands Primary School, six-year-old Dylan Hogg turned his nose up at the apple, grapes and strawberries . Last night there were concerns over the cost of the scheme, while critics swiftly branded it a ‘gimmick’. Treasury . sources said it would be funded through spending cuts elsewhere, but . critics questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all . young children, while taking the axe to other universal payments such as . child benefit for the better-off. One senior Tory said it was ‘an . appalling waste of £600million of taxpayers’ money’ and a ‘deal done on . the back of a fag packet’. Mr . Clegg’s announcement at 5pm came only two hours after Treasury Chief . Secretary Danny Alexander had told the conference: ‘There’s no spending . bonanza around the corner.’ Currently, . free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families. Extending them to all reception, year one and year two pupils is part of . what the Lib Dems called a ‘straight up and down deal’ with the Tories . that will mean them agreeing to a similar sum to be spent on a tax break . for married couples. Tour: The Deputy PM visited the school in Kirkintilloch near Glasgow ahead of his announcement on free meals, which will only apply in England . Mr . Clegg will tell delegates in Glasgow: ‘My ambition is that every primary . school pupil should be able to sit down to a hot, healthy lunch. ‘Over . the course of a year, families spend over £400 on lunch money for each . child. I am determined to do all we can to help put money back in the . pockets of these families. 'The Conservatives . . . have made it clear . that their priority is to help some families over others, with a tax . break for married couples. A tax break for some, funded through the . taxes of others. ‘That tells . you everything you need to know about their values. We, however, will . help all families in these tough times, not just the kind we like best.’ But . Tory sources dismissed the idea of a ‘deal’ over marriage tax breaks, . pointing out that the Coalition Agreement struck in 2010 committed the . Lib Dems to abstaining on that issue. Healthy: Mr Clegg will argue that pupils who have school meals are healthier and achieve more academically . Learning: Pupils who eat a free school meal were two months ahead of children who did not in pilot schemes . Visit: Mr Clegg was joined by wife Miriam on meeting children at Lairdlands Primary School, in Kirkintilloch near Glasgow . Announcement: The Lib Dem conference draws to a close in Glasgow on Wednesday . Restaurateur John Vincent proposed free school meals in a review for the Government earlier this year. Mr Vincent, co-founder of the Leon chain, said: ‘I am in Ethiopia right now, and frankly I cried when I heard. This is ground-breaking stuff.’ But . former Labour welfare minister Frank Field said the money could be . better spent on support for disadvantaged children before they reached . school age. ‘If one was looking for ways to ensure every child fulfils . his potential, this would fall early in the debate,’ he said of the . meals policy. ‘This has more than a little of the smell of 1950s . political gravy about it.’ In . pilot areas where free school meals have been extended to all, . including County Durham and parts of London, students were found to be . on average two months ahead of peers elsewhere. Quite the likeness: A bust of Nick Clegg is finished by a 3D printer at the Microsoft stand at the Lib Dem Party Conference at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow . Ryan . Bourne, of the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, said: ‘There was . me thinking we had huge public borrowing. 'The poorest children are . already eligible for free school meals – the main beneficiaries of this . new universal benefit will be middle and upper-income households, who . really don’t need a public subsidy.’ Robert . Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, blasted the move as a ‘conference . gimmick’, while Mark Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, . said: ‘This is an enormously bad use of public money.’ However, . Save the Children’s director of UK poverty, William Higham, said: ‘This . will have a huge impact on the lives of tens of thousands of children . in England. For many children, a school meal will be the only decent hot . meal they get.’ The National Union of Teachers said pupils of all ages should qualify, adding: ‘Children do not stop being hungry at seven.’","Deputy Prime Minister will announce £600m policy in conference speech .

These pictures show the remarkable moment a massive male lion appeared to get a telling off after playtime when two baby cubs got carried away. The photographs by game lodge manager Tom Coetzee captured the Black Dam pride at play in the Greater Kruger National Park, South Africa. Mr Coetzee had been tracking the pride of three lionesses, four cubs, and a male to a favourite location near a riverbed where the females had set up a den. Pictured is the play fight that turned a little too rough for the mother lions liking. Not so rough: The male lion gets a telling off from the mother of their cubs for playing too aggressively. Pictures were taken by a game keeper near their riverside pride in Greater Kruger National Park in South Africa . The cubs beginning their playtime (left). Baby cubs often play fight as a practice for their later years where they may be forced to fight for dominance. Cubs play with anything that interests them including ostrich eggs, turtles and their mothers tail . Mother plays with the cubs while the male lion looks on. Female lions remain playful in their later years, much more so than the male adult lions . Defending cubs against outside males is one of the primary reasons why female lions live in groups, as there is strength in numbers and only groups of females can defeat males and successfully protect their cubs . These pictures show the Black Dam pride in South Africa, the images captured by a local game lodge manager who takes care of the grounds. Prides may have several female and male lions, with the male lions all vying for dominance . Female lions remain more playful in adult life than male lions in order to teach cubs how to fight and defend themselves, as well as play fighting to show affection to their young . The male lion may have many female partners throughout his life as head of the pride, which means he will have many children by many different mothers . While the lion's powerful jaws can often be strong enough to break the neck of significantly larger animals like antelopes, gazelles, or zebras, they are soft but firm when playing with their young, with one mother lion showing expert control in this picture . The male lion of the pride approaches his cubs. While male lions are often not as playful as female lions, they do have a soft side, sometimes taking time out from eating and basking to engage in a bit of rough and tumble . The male lion appears to begin playing with the cubs of the Black Dam pride. The male lions can often be aggressive toward their cubs as a way of asserting dominance over fast-growing young males lions . The male lion starts to get a bit rougher: The males will rough-house with the younger members of the pride when they are smaller because they do not have the physical advantage, but will remember that the lion is the dominant male . Mother, who has been watching the play fight, begins to intervene. The male lion can often get carried away while fighting, which is why the female lions of the pride stick close . The female lions gang up on the male. Often, groups of females will stick together to contest male lions from other prides that might have approach their territory, finding safety in numbers . The mother defends her cubs: While the play fighting is innocent and often harmless, the act of defense is not, as a mother will become incredibly fierce to defend her cubs . The fight becomes serious. While the mother has to defend her cubs, the male of the pride also has to maintain his dominance, making these sorts of fights dangerous, and sometimes lethal . The cubs and other female of the Black Dam pride look on as the fight comes to a close. Lions have tremendous agility and brutal strength, making them incredibly efficient and deadly hunters . The mother pounces at the male lion, who appears to recoil at the challenge, showing that the female has successfully defended the cubs, who still look on at the fight as it comes to a close .","Lions were part of a pride in a South African park, and the spontaneous fight was captured by a game keeper .

"By . Carolyn Lazarus . PUBLISHED: . 19:06 EST, 29 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:13 EST, 29 January 2014 . Regrets: Carolyn Lazarus wishes she had never quit her job . Recently, seething after a blistering row with my husband Marc, I plotted my escape from our marriage. I imagined packing a case and taking our children Chad, 16, and Daisy, 13, to a hotel. It’s a scenario I’ve played out numerous times in the aftermath of a marital humdinger but never actually made it a reality. Why? Well, mostly because Marc and I do still love each other. But also, because I couldn’t afford to leave if I wanted to. It’s a situation in which I have felt trapped and one that sometimes leaves me frustrated and angry. I’m sure many of my affluent friends, who are also stay-at-home mothers, share my misery. But it’s something none of us dare express for fear of being labelled ungrateful. After all, women like me are living every female’s dream. Aren’t we? With two happy, healthy children who gleefully greet me at the school gate each evening, a beautiful home and a supportive, successful husband, I know how lucky I am. But, before you pour scorn on me, please understand that I have come to this situation from a very unusual starting point: I gave up a successful, £80,000-a-year career as a commercial lawyer to become a full-time mother and housewife. I did this even though for the early part of our marriage, I earned significantly more than Marc. And, hard as it is to admit, ever since I gave up my job 13 years ago and accepted the household would be run with Marc’s salary, I’ve felt rather empty. While Marc is kind, generous and constantly assures me that it is our money not his I abhor the fact that I’ve allowed myself to lose my financial independence. As much as being present for every violin concert and sports day has filled me with pride, and as much as my children have benefited from having me as a constant in their lives, I can’t help but feel that the price of their happiness was my own. And every time I spot a groomed . career woman in her crisp Pink shirt and Reiss suit, I feel a stab of . envy, then guilt, as I creep back home to the detritus of domesticity. Because, . even though I know how it feels to be an exhausted working mother, . having worked in the years after Chad was born, back then at least I had . a sense of purpose. Motherhood may be a privilege, but it simply cannot . replace the confidence I lost when I gave up my job. I . look back at how Marc and I met as students at Chester Law College in . 1981 when we were both 21 and know that the younger me would never have . imagined the future that transpired. Carolyn and Marc on their  wedding day (left) never dreamt of a rockier future . I’d just graduated with a degree in . law from Sheffield University. Our jobs took us to London where we both . worked in the City. Before long, we bought our first home. While . Marc opted for litigation, I delved into the lucrative world of . commercial law. I used to regularly take Concorde to New York or fly . first class to India, Tokyo, Canada and California to sign off deals for . my firms’ clients, mostly pharmaceutical giants. I was frequently the . only woman in the boardroom. Even after our marriage in 1989, . children seemed a long way off. But, in 1994, my younger sister Janet . had a baby. As I held her daughter for the first time, her pudgy little . fingers clasping my thumb, I instantly knew I wanted one, too. Looking . at Marc, joyously cradling his newborn niece in his arms, I knew he felt . the same. We were both overjoyed when I fell pregnant in 1996, when we were both 38. I worked until two weeks before the birth. Chad . was born in May 1997 and within a few months I couldn’t wait to get . back to work, confident I could juggle baby and boardroom. I was back at . my desk in November. Three months later I left for a nine-day business . trip to Tokyo. Marc was . actually very supportive of my decision to go. He knew how exhausting . I’d found juggling child and boardroom and saw the trip as me getting a . bit of a break. His mother stayed at our house to care for Chad. Business class travel and luxury hotels were a welcome respite from . nappies and baby food. Carolyn (second left) pictured with son Chad (far left) daughter Daisy (second right) and husband Marc (far left) But when I returned home, Marc was . cradling Chad on his shoulder, and my baby boy had a sad look on his . little face that I’ll never forget. And I was racked with guilt. Over . the next 15 months, Chad’s grip on my heartstrings tightened. I dreaded . the daily farewell at nursery, prising his tiny hands from my neck. At . work, guilt and fatigue made it difficult to concentrate. Keen to extend our family, I was delighted when I became pregnant again the following year. But this pregnancy — and two more . quickly followed — demonstrated how little control I now had over my . body and circumstances: I suffered three miscarriages within nine . months, the last while I was sitting in a meeting in London. Distraught, . I rang Marc on the train home and told him I was going to quit my job. Put simply, I couldn’t take any more — the demands were too great. Marc . was calm and reassuring. I handed in my resignation the next day. Looking back, I’m incredulous that this was the extent of the . discussion. Secretly I suspect Marc was relieved that he would, finally . be the breadwinner. Happy times: Carolyn's marriage fell under strain following her decision to leave her job . Although my success and salary . genuinely never caused a problem between us, he’d had a very traditional . upbringing with men being providers and protectors. Two . months later, Daisy was conceived. Keen to embrace my role as a . full-time mum, in August 1999 we moved to a farmhouse in Herefordshire . to be close to my parents. Daisy . was born in April 2000 and initially I took to full-time motherhood . gleefully, relishing the time with my children, and not having to . express milk before going to the office. But Marc was either working . 12-hour days or staying in hotels near his office and I missed him . terribly. Days dragged interminably. Around . the same time, we were invited to a dinner party. I was sitting next to . a rather pretentious stockbroker who asked me what I did. I said I was . at home with the children and watched his eyes glaze. Previously he was . the kind of man I would have relished putting in his place in the . boardroom — now I felt cowed by him. 'Although my success and salary genuinely . never caused a problem between us, he’d had a very traditional . upbringing with men being providers and protectors' When we moved to our current home in 2004, a converted tile factory with four vast bedrooms and a self-contained annexe — now worth around £1 million — several friends commented that ‘Marc’s obviously doing well’. I smarted. It was as if I’d contributed nothing. I tried part-time voluntary work, working as a tour guide for an exhibition at Hereford Cathedral, and as a magistrate when Daisy was at school. But my agonising insecurity chipped away at our marriage, by now beset with resentments over money and our roles. My easy-going husband started to feel the pressure of being the breadwinner, and during our escalating arguments, his ‘quips’ about my days, playing tennis and hosting coffee mornings, began to grate. I know Marc wondered where the joyous woman he married had gone. But, as he’s never had to take a day out of his career when the kids have been ill, or ever known how it feels not to have his own money, how could he understand? I remind him — usually during a row — that had I still been a lawyer, I’d be earning around £200,000 a year now. Far more than him. I know I do this to score points, but I just can’t help myself. Ironically, the only time I have no qualms about spending Marc’s money is after a row, usually in the boutiques in Cheltenham. Family life has improved following Carolyn's decision to start up her own website . Five years ago, we resorted to marriage guidance counselling. The counsellor instantly pointed out that I was bored, unstimulated and reliant on Marc. Even his insistence that the money is ‘ours’ cannot shake off the feeling that he is funding my life, which can make me feel little more than a chaffeur or a cleaner. He now regrets the fact that we never made plans for me to return to work once both children were at school — for all our sakes. So, 18 months ago, I set up a website called totally4women, for women like me. This should hopefully save our poor husbands from the brunt of our frustration. The website has already broken even and is on the cusp of earning a small income from sponsorship. And yes, I’m smiling more. Even though my children know I used to have a successful career, I want them to see my work ethic for themselves. I regularly implore Daisy not to completely give up her career if she is one day lucky enough to have children. The greatest lesson I have learned is that a happy wife and mum equals a happy household. For that reason alone, I wish I’d found a way to return to work, even part-time. I adore my children, and am proud of the childhood I’ve been able to give them. But I miss the old ‘me’ every day.  Interview by Sadie Nicholas .","Carolyn Lazarus quit her job as a high flying lawyer to be a full time mother .

The shop worker was then flung to the ground when the car rounded a corner. Some of his injuries are likely to be permanent. Charnley claimed he had ‘panicked’ and had no intention of hurting the shop worker. But a jury found him guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after nine hours of deliberation. Crime scene: The attack happened in July last year at this Texaco petrol station in West Kingsdown, Kent . Shock: Police and forensics officers attended the scene and closed the road while they investigated . Charnley, from Hartley, Kent, had already admitted causing serious injury by driving dangerously. He was also handed a 15-year driving ban. Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl told him ‘results can be catastrophic’ when cars are used as weapons. Speaking after the sentence was handed down, the victim's wife said he was in a critical condition for two days. 'Things got progressively worse so they had to do a major operation to save his life,' she said. 'For the first four or five weeks we didn’t know if he was going to survive or not. 'It just didn’t seem possible that someone could do that and travel so far before he threw him off the bonnet. 'He can’t work at the moment and may never be able to work again. We just don’t know what he’ll be capable of - it’s completely destroyed our lives. Investigation: Forensics officers at the corner where the shop worker was believed to have hit the road . The crime happened in West Kingsdown, a village near the North Downs in Kent near affluent Sevenoaks . 'At the moment, he’s very suppressed, very quiet, his whole character has changed - he’s just not the man I married.' She added: '[Charnley] will serve his sentence and then continue the rest of his normal life whereas we’re left to pick up the pieces. 'In two minutes, everything changed. He should never have driven up the road with him on the bonnet - he obviously just didn’t care. 'I’d like to know why he did it. Why do that to somebody else for no reason?

The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria has been given the all-clear after an investigation into higher-than-normal radiation readings detected at a perimeter fence. The monitoring system picked up 'elevated' levels of radioactivity overnight, leading to workers and contractors being told to stay away. But following an analysis by safety staff, Sellafield said the levels were 'naturally occurring background radon'. Scroll down for video . Evacuation: All non-essential staff were warned to stay away from Sellafield today because of 'elevated' radiation levels but have since returned to work . The company is still trying to establish exactly why the alarm was sounded even though it has now established the cause. A . statement said: 'Sellafield Ltd can confirm that the radioactivity . detected by one of our in-air monitors overnight is not attributable to . any issue or problem with any of our operations on site. 'Our . in-air monitors are extremely sensitive and pick up on any abnormality. Overnight the monitoring system initially indicated elevated levels of . activity. Following investigation and analysis, we can now confirm these . levels to be naturally occurring background radon. 'The . number one priority for us is, at all times, safe secure stewardship of . the Sellafield site, which is the most complex and challenging nuclear . site in Europe. 'As such we . act in a safety conscious manner, and take cautious, conservative . decisions, such as the one taken overnight to ask non-safety essential . staff to stay at home this morning, rather than come to the site. Message: Staff were told to stay away from the site in rural Cumbria unless 'requested to attend' work . 'All . of our plants and storage facilities were quickly confirmed as . operating normally, and we were always confident that the issue posed no . risk to the workforce or public because the levels being detected, . whilst above background radiation levels, were still low. 'This . view was reinforced by the fact that none of our other installed . monitors were picking up any kind of increased levels. However, we take . such issues so seriously that we investigated fully to confirm that . everything was okay.

National . officer Gill Wood said: 'Higher than normal radiation readings have . been detected at one monitor at a perimeter fence. As a precaution, . non-essential staff have been advised to stay at home today while the . relevant specialist team investigates. 'The . company's decision to partially close some areas at the site is a . precautionary and measured decision and a safety measure that is . recognised worldwide.' Remote: Sellafield site is built close to the village of Seascale on the Cumbrian coast facing the Irish Sea . Controls: Workers in protective overalls in 1957 after the Windscale fire - Britain's worst nuclear disaster . Sellafield was the world’s first commercial nuclear station, and has suffered 21 'leaks' in 60 years. The giant facility opened under the name of Windscale to produce plutonium for Britain’s H-bomb. In 1957, a fire broke out in No 1 of the twin ‘piles’ or reactors, which became the worst nuclear disaster in British history. It was only discovered 50 hours later, and took three days to bring under control. The blaze was caused by heat building up in the reactor after a series of safety blunders. As the fire raged, workers at the plant used hoses to try to cool the reactor. However, contaminated air escaped through the 400ft-high chimney and rose over the Lake District in a long grey plume. Eventually, radioactive particles fell on to the local countryside or were caught in a changing wind, which blew them further inland towards Wales and over the sea to Ireland. In 1982, the British National Radiological Protection Board issued a report estimating that 32 deaths and at least 260 cases of cancer could be attributed to the fire. But there are widespread concerns that this figure was much too low. There have also been several other leaks. In 1983 there was a notorious 'discharge incidents' where radioactive material was leaked, shutting a 10-mile stretch of beach and sea. In 2005 it emerged there was waste leaking from a cracked chamber, which may have been undiscovered for eight months. Bosses have been fined heavily after the incidents. It is also claimed by groups like Greenpeace that various leaks while it was being built means that the Irish Sea is one of the most contaminated stretches of water in the world because waste was diluted and dumped into it.","All non-essential staff have been warned to stay away from Cumbria site .

"By . Lorraine Candy . PUBLISHED: . 17:58 EST, 29 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:58 EST, 29 January 2014 . Couldn't resist: There's a new addition to the Candy household (posed by model) Rule Number One of parenting. Never go into a pet shop with your children (or anyone's children). Actually, I suggest that for the duration of parenthood you should avoid a pet shop with anyone under the age of 25 at all costs. Don't even walk past one with your offspring. Avert your eyes, cross the road. Because buying a pet, like weighing yourself on the first Monday after Christmas, is something you must do alone. How on earth we managed to get through . a decade of parenting without stepping over the threshold of an Animal . Magic, Petcetera or Paws 'n' Claws is beyond me. Friends didn't believe us, but we stayed strong. Until Gracie-in-the-middle's tenth birthday last week. My . daughter's desperation for something of her own to look after and love . was becoming uncomfortable. The continual pleading was disarming and . non-stop. She talked of nothing else. It was a relentless campaign . unlike any others before it. Then one night as I tucked her into bed she softly murmured: 'Just one fish.' And I crumbled. She looked so sad, her little pale face all miserable as she drifted off. And I couldn't help but admire her dogged persistence: even in dreamland she remembered  her mission (I'm sending her CV to Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg pronto). So 'Gracie challenges' were set; many sticker reward boards were speedily completed. Her room was show-home tidy, even inside the cupboards and under the bed. Homework was done early, books read all the way to the end. Sibling rivalries were halted. I think she may even have gone as far as eating a Brussels sprout if I'd asked. So we gave in. She could have one goldfish. 'One goldfish,' I repeated loudly in the car park of Pets At Home as all four of them bounced towards the sliding doors with the enthusiasm of orphans headed to Disneyland. An hour later I had a tank with no fish in it and Unwanted Walter, a hamster the size of an earring, on my lap. Remind you of anyone? Walter runs manically on his wheel getting nowhere . There are 24 million pets in this country (double the number of pensioners, apparently) and we've got one no one else wanted. Unwanted Walter is what happens when you take all your children into a pet shop, slightly hungover and sleep deprived (us, not the children). If I'd been a Lone Ranger on the birthday fish mission I'd have been able to resist 'the wall of rejected pets', but four sets of teary eyes dissolved my resolve on the 'no rodents' clause in my parenting contract. For the wall of unloved pets is one of the saddest places in childhood. It even brought a tear to my eye and that hasn't happened since the baby elephant died in front of its mum on David Attenborough's Africa series. There the furry little fellas sit with their 'loser' CVs written up beside their cages, detailing why they are unloveable. Name game . 'Hamster' comes from the 17th-century German word hamustro. In turn, the German verb hamstern - 'to hoard' - comes from their behaviour . It said Unwanted Walter, the dwarf hamster, had been brought back twice, once because he'd been bullied in the cage by his siblings (code for fighting). He'd been on the wall for a record amount of time - he was thus the least appealing of the lot. 'Oh my God, that is terrible,' the kids wailed, no doubt imagining themselves in that position, as all children generally think about is themselves. We'd just been told that we couldn't buy a fish until we'd set up a tank at home and had the water tested after a week (who knew the world's most boring pet would need so much care?). So for a moment it looked as if we could walk away from the pet shop animal-free. But then they spotted 'the wall'. They said they'd give up their pocket money for a month to buy hamster accessories and quickly outlined a surprisingly well thought through cage-cleaning rota. But I was already smitten with Walter, a tiny tearaway with a big personality. I liked the way he hurtled around the cage manically. It reminded me of something. 'We'll take the one no one wants,' I said to everyone's surprise and gratitude. Everyone loves Unwanted Walter, despite his tendency to nip. 'He's an attack hamster,' my seven-year-old son tells me as Walter hangs off his little finger with a determined glint in his eye. Anyway, it's a good job we got Walter because Dave, the fish we got a week later, died 24 hours after putting him in the tank.

Witnesses at a London Overground station saw a flash of light and heard an explosion as the woman fell to the ground in a shower of sparks. She was immediately taken to hospital with burn injuries following the incident on Wednesday night, and remains in a serious condition. Railway officials today warned travellers to stay away from the tracks, pointing out that even a 'harmless prank' can be extremely dangerous. Reckless: A young woman was pictured standing on top of a freight train moments before she was electrocuted by a power line and thrown into the ground . The woman, who appeared to be drunk, was seen climbing onto a train at Hackney Wick station in east London around 11pm on Wednesday. She apparently spent several minutes running around on top of the carriages, laughing to her friends who were watching below. But then she collided with an overhead power line and was thrown 20ft onto the platform - making bystanders fear that she might be dead. She was taken to hospital, where she is in a serious but stable condition two days later. Horror: The incident took place on Wednesday evening at Hackney Wick station in east London (file photo) A witness told the Evening Standard: .

'Passengers should always take care at train stations and should never go on to the tracks or near the overhead power lines.' A Network Rail spokesman told the Standard: 'The railway is a dangerous place, with trains travelling at high speeds and power lines carrying more than 25,000 volts of electricity.

Row: The interlude between beach belle Mrs Rooney, here soaking up the sun in a Melissa Odabash bikini in 2011, has highlighted her penchant for product placement . With a footballer husband who reportedly earns £26,000 a day, Coleen Rooney can certainly afford to splash out on a new bikini or two for her next exotic holiday. Yet it seems the 27-year old proves the old adage that those who  can afford to pay for things don’t have to. For while Mrs Rooney and her husband, England striker  Wayne, have a combined wealth of £64 million, that has not stopped her from accepting free gifts from everyone from designer clothes brands to Mothercare — much to the disgust of her online followers. Within moments of Coleen  sending a gushing tweet thanking celebrity fashion designer Melissa Odabash for the free swimwear she had received last week, the WAG was lambasted by her Twitter followers for accepting freebies — and for gleefully parading them online. Coleen’s tweet: ‘Thank you @melissaodabash for my gorgeous bikinis!! I absolutely love them!! x’ sparked an angry backlash, with one commentator asking: ‘Millionaire husband and still accepting freebies, do you not feel bad when there’s people who can’t pay their gas bill?’ She was also branded ‘fat and dumpy’ by one Twitter user, after being photographed in a similar luxury two-piece swimsuit, also by Melissa Odabash. Others criticised as ‘unreal’ her ‘endless’ product placement on the social networking site, while one user said she was ‘sickened’ by Coleen’s actions. The row saw Mrs Rooney retaliate by telling one of her critics: ‘Go and try and blag yourself a bikini you sad cow!!’ The unedifying exchange highlighted Mrs Rooney’s endless plugs for freebies ranging from spa vouchers to designer goodies and baby clothes. Scroll down for video . Hooked on fashions: Support for Liverpool designer Francesca Kearns, MissFCouture (left), and a new brand of protein shake, giving the maker a hat-tip (right) With more than one million Twitter followers, the mother-of-two is only too aware of how powerful her online endorsement is. So when Coleen isn’t tweeting her thanks for a free gift or product, she is using the social network to promote her own clothing lines with Littlewoods and Very.co.uk. But it was all finally too much for some of her 1,083,297 followers, and last Monday one of them took umbrage with her tweet to Melissa Odabash, pointing out the star had again endorsed ‘another freebie’. If the shoes fits: Usually seen in high heels, Coleen gushed about a new pair of Converse, and tressed to impress (right) she praises Shashy Smith for creating this braid in August .

Not going to . get anywhere being negative in life. You are one bitter person!! I don’t . ask for things!’ While expecting her second son Klay, now . nine months old, Mrs Rooney received a haul of free baby essentials from . High Street store Mothercare — and promptly sent a tweet to her . followers ‘Got some great stuff from@mothercareuk for our new . baby!!Thank you!!’ The couple’s five-year-old son, Kai, hasn’t missed out either. Wearing it well: Coleen dons a white jacket and trousers to promote not a freebie, but her own Littlewoods fashion collection this month . Splash of colour: Posting a selfie of a shirt from her Littlewoods collection in December . In August Coleen tweeted a message to . luxury childrenswear boutique Melanie Louise, which stocks mini Dior and . Ralph Lauren, thanking them for  the outfits she’d received for her . boys. Coleen also posts endless gushing messages of thanks for items she claims to have paid for herself. In April she tweeted ‘Loving my new . converse! Thanks!’, while she has also posted fawning messages about . hairstylists, protein drinks and clothes by label Miss F Couture. While Coleen’s representatives refused . to give an official comment, they did claim that, in all of these . cases, she paid for the items herself. It is not known whether she paid . the full price, however. In June 2012, Coleen’s husband Wayne was also criticised for endorsing products on his Twitter account. The Man Utd forward was censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for passing off an advertisement for Nike as a personal comment. According to ASA rules, celebrities endorsing products on Twitter should really use hashtags such as #spons (for sponsor) or #ad to clarify that they’re doing so. Yesterday the ASA claimed that, as Mrs Rooney was not paid cash to send the tweets, she had not breached their guidelines. Spokesman Matt Wilson said: ‘Any Tweet that is paid for and controlled must be disclosed, i.e. made clear it’s an ad. ‘It’s important to mention that the actual buck stops with the advertiser. 'If we received a complaint that a Tweet was misleading because it didn’t make clear the content was advertising we would investigate the advertiser, not the celebrity who has tweeted.’","Mrs Rooney blasted followers for saying they're 'sickened' by promotions .

Harry Dyrstad, owner of specialist wildlife abattoir Vilteksperten, north of Trondheim, enlisted the help of a certified halal butcher and has 100 reindeer ready to be sent off to the shops. The butcher has had interest from as far afield as Dubai, and he is looking forward to bringing reindeer to the previously unexplored Muslim market. Roasted Rudolph: A Norwegian abattoir has slaughtered more than 100 reindeer which have been given the seal of approval by the country's Islamic Council . After invitation from Mr Dyrstad, the Islamic Council of Norway visited the abattoir and has given their seal of approval on the reindeer meat. Mr Dyrstad is currently in the process of butchering the animals to send them off to shops around Norway, but says he plans on exploring other markets. ‘We had the idea one-and-a-half years ago,’ Dyrstad told The Local. ‘We spoke to someone who had some contacts in Dubai, and he said that if you want to sell reindeer meat, it has to be halal, so we had to try.’ Mr Dyrstad has also looked into the possibility of curing some of the halal reindeer in order to  introduce ham to the Muslim community. Muslims in Norway will now be able to join in the tradition of reindeer for Christmas dinner, as well as tasting ham as the abattoir plans to cure reindeer meat to produce something similar to pig . ‘We got some information that we could produce some ham from the reindeer, so Muslim children can have ham on their sandwiches,’ he said. Reindeer meat is popular across Scandinavia and is served in many homes as part of Christmas dinner, a tradition in which Norwegian Muslims will now be able to take part in, . ‘It is going to be exciting to see how Muslims receive the novelty of reindeer. This is a completely new halalproduct that Muslims have not had access till before,' Mehtab Afsar, General Secretary of the Islamic Council of Norway, told Adresseavisen. ‘I have been told that this is a very good meat, but I have never tasted it myself.’ Reindeer is both farmed and wild in Norway and the rest of Scandinavia. The Sami, the indigenous people of northern Scandinavia, have been herding reindeer for centuries and are the group of people more often found still living off reindeer farming. Their local language has more than 400 words for reindeer, the meat and products involved in reindeer herding.","Norwegian abattoir has slaughtered 100 reindeer the halal way .

The following year he climbed to the top of Mount Everest in just six weeks and has now returned home after cycling 18,000 miles around the world - through more than 20 countries in 214 days. Mr Ketchell said: 'After my accident, I felt I needed something to do to prove to myself that I'm alright. I think I've done that now.

While he was not trying to break any records for the fastest journeys, his Atlantic row was completed in an impressive 110 days - and he climbed Everest in only six weeks. 'After my bike accident, the doctors were pretty bleak. But I've never been one to let people tell me what to do, so I just decided to do the maddest, toughest challenge I could think of,' he said. 'I could have sat and felt sorry for myself, or I could do something about it. I think I made the right choice.' Speaking about his 2007 accident, Mr Ketchell said: 'I was thrown off my motorbike at 70mph coming out of a corner, which resulted in a broken hand, leg and ankle. 'The worst injury was to my ankle, which was dislocated and smashed into 15 pieces. Doctors told me I wouldn't be able to walk normally again. Finish: On his return to Britain, he was greeted by friends and family . Troop: Members from his loyal Scout group were also there to greet him on his arrival . 'The rehabilitation was long and painful, but worth it. 'At first progress was slow but the more I did the exercises, the stronger and more movement I got back in my ankle.' As a Scouting Ambassador, Mr Ketchell will travel around the country giving talks to Scouts and schoolchildren about his experiences. Next year, the intrepid adventurer is planning on rowing across the Indian Ocean with a pal, who suffers from epilepsy, to highlight how much life can be enjoyed by people with the condition. He has been raising money for the ELIFAR Foundation, a charity which helps to improve the quality of life for disabled children and adults.

HMS Olympus struck a mine in the early hours of 8 May, 1942 shortly after she left Malta Harbour under the cover of darkness. Nearly 90 men perished in what was one of the worst naval disasters of the war. Only nine of the vessel's 98 crew members survived after swimming seven miles back to shore in cold water. Pristine condition: A sonar image of the wreck of HMS Olympus, which lies seven miles off the coast of Malta. The submarine's exact location had been a mystery for 70 years . The exact spot where the 283ft-long submarine sank in the Mediterranean Sea remained a mystery for 70 years. But now a marine archaeology survey . team has confirmed that they last year discovered the Olympus' resting . place using side-scan sonar to survey the seabed. Timmy Gambin, the archaeological . director of Florida-based Aurora Trust, told the Guardian: 'We had . suspicions it was the Olympus. 'Armed with our research on the . features of the submarine, where the guns were, the placing and types of . the rudder and propeller, we were able to identify her. 'Except for the damage from the mine she was in pristine condition, sitting upright as if she'd been placed on the seabed.' Olympus is in the best condition of any wreck found by the Aurora Trust with almost no underwater growth on it. The team twice visited the wreck last . year. On the second trip in September, they used deep-sea robotic . vehicles to film the wreck. In action: HMS Olympus in Malta Harbour. She sunk after hitting a mine in the early hours of 8 May, 1942 shortly after she left the harbour under the cover of darkness . Location: Olympus is in the best condition of any wreck found by the Aurora Trust with almost no underwater growth on it . The footage confirmed that Olympus' propeller remains intact and her hatch open. The hole caused by the mine . is located on bottom of the submarine. Also visible are canons, radio antennas and machine guns. The site is now expected to be formally designated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Mr Gambin said that the site is being treated with 'every sensitivity possible' as it remains a mass grave. Keen to protect its cultural history, . the Maltese authorities only this week gave the Aurora Trust permission . to announce their discovery. Malta was of huge strategic importance during World War II. Between 1940 and 1942, the British . Navy fought a German and Italian blockade to keep the island supplied . with food rations, war supplies and fuel.

It is a culinary scandal which has gone right to the top of the political food chain and left Bill de Blasio with a rather sour taste in his mouth. But the New York City Mayor may find his first crisis in office a little easier to swallow knowing that it will eventually help those most in need. In an incident dubbed Forkgate, de Blasio provoked mock outrage after being caught eating his pizza with a knife and fork instead of with his hands as is the New York way. Now the owner of the Goodfella's Pizzeria where he was pictured has kept hold of said fork and plans to auction it for charity. Scroll Down for Video . Put a fork in him: de Blasio earned the disapproval of New Yorkers when he ate a slice with a knife and fork at Goodfellas, Staten Island . Marc Cosentino, a retired NYPD . sergeant, placed the fork in an evidence bag he acquired from a former . colleague and is proudly displaying it behind the bar. He told dnainfo.com: 'I just did it because I thought it was funny. 'Then all of a sudden it got all this interest, so I thought let's do something, let's do something for charity.' It's not clear when the utensil will go up for auction or which charity will benefit. Fewer . than 10 days into his term as mayor, de Blasio found himself on the . defensive after a picture of him using utensils spread across Twitter, . prompting mock outrage among on blogs and news sites. Responding . to the pizza palaver, de Blasio said that his Italian ancestry is . behind his decidedly un-New York pizza-eating style. 'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and Iâ€™ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said. Hand it to him: de Blasio did eventually pick up his slice . It's a method New Yorkers have variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter. As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands. The . incident, already dubbed 'Forkgate,' happened at Staten Island pizza . joint Goodfellas last Friday, where de Blasio stopped in for lunch with . local business owners. Proving he is not a complete heathen, though, de Blasio explained that he likes to use his hands too. His method is a combination of the Italian and New York styles, he said, describing it as 'very complicated.' 'I often start with a knife and fork. But then I cross over to the American approach and pick it up when I go farther into the pizza,' he told a reporter who questioned his methods, adding that the inquiry was a 'very important question.' Charles Greinsky witnessed the incident and is not letting his longstanding friendship with the mayor get in the way of what's right. One of us: Conservative pals Donald Trump and Sarah Palin made news in 2011 when they stepped out of Trump's presumably gold-plated apartment in Trump tower for a slice of pizza and proceeded to use a knife and fork . The American way: Both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama would win approval from New Yorkers with their pizza approach . He told The New York Times he loved having de Blasio in his home borough but could not approve of his genteel pizza-eating. 'No,' he told The New York Times. 'No. It's blasphemy.' Relenting a little, he added, 'He's from Boston. He doesn't know any better.' For the record, de Blasio ate three slices of smoked mozzarella and sausage pie.","New York City Mayor photographed eating his pizza with a knife and fork .

When it failed to sell, Mr Girling said: 'It didn't find a home today, I'm afraid, and lives to fight another day. You missed a golden opportunity here in the room and on the phones and online, is all I can say.'

The president and his supporters are pushing to get higher wages for American workers, but the nation's largest pro-Obama organizing group is telling its footsoldiers not to expect a paycheck at all. Organizing For Action, which flexed its muscles as Obama For America during two presidential election campaigns, announced Wednesday that it's seeking 'Spring Organizing Fellows' to 'be a part of our growing organization' and 'explor[e] OFA's broad scope approach to issue advocacy.' But unlike most fellowships, which offer a stipend or a housing allowance, the positions are strictly 'unpaid' and require Americans to work 'without the expectation of pay, for civic and public service purposes.' Organizing For Action collected $7.7 million during the third quarter of 2013, according to disclosure reports collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. The group has raised nearly $21 million this year. President Obama's election machine is now called 'Organizing For Action,' and it's looking for free labor while it pushes for a minimum wage hike . On Wednesday President Obama railed on against big-business efforts to block a minimum-wage hike, while his wealthy campaign machine pushed for free labor to do his bidding . An hour before OFA announced its 2014 fellowship program, the group tweeted a line from the president's Wednesday speech on the economy. 'Retweet if you agree: ""It's well past the time to raise the minimum wage."" —President Obama,' the group's message read. Three hours later the Twitter account @BarackObama, which OFA controls, blasted out an infographic that claimed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would create 140,000 new jobs. And the group's website advocates for policies that 'reward work by raising the minimum wage so an honest day’s work pays more.' In a lengthy economic policy speech on Wednesday, the president complained that 'there are airport workers, and fast-food workers, and nurse assistants, and retail salespeople who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty.' 'And that’s why it’s well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office.' 'Wage slaves'? Fast food workers are picketing McDonald's restaurants in New York City today, as part of the union-led social movement that Organization For Action supports . Thousands marched in front of Walmarts on Black Friday, demanding higher wages for employees. Unions paid some protesters to show up; Walmart hasn't budged on its wage policies or its decision to avoid unionizing its workforce . 'For all their talk of fairness and justice, supporters of minimum wage hikes hypocritically fail to offer these exact same policies to their own employee interns,' Employment Policies Institute research director Michael Saltsman told MailOnline. 'It’s a classic case of ""do what I say, not what I do.""' Organizing For Action did not respond to a request for comment. The group has operated fellowship programs for several years, including the two presidential election cycles when it was the official Obama campaign organization. But in those days, throngs of volunteers flocked to 'fellowship' meetings to learn how they could help elect, and then re-elect, Barack Obama. In the president's second term, however, OFA has found it tougher to recruit cost-free labor. June 2012: Hundreds of OFA volunteer 'fellows' packed a hall in Virginia to learn how they could help re-elect President Obama . Trouble in paradise, May 2013: An OFA organizer proudly tweeted a picture of just two 'fellows' building a climate-change database for OFA . 'Look,' a Republican election consultant told MailOnline, 'Obamacare is in the trash heap, Iran is about to have a nuclear bomb, the IRS and Justice Department are as corrupt as a New Jersey mobster, and the White House has become a punchline.' 'No wonder the volunteers are staying home.' Online photos from 2010 and earlier show hundreds of 'fellows' gathered in meeting rooms to receive their marching orders. More recent images circulating on Twitter and Facebook show tiny handfuls of volunteers engaged in defending the president and his policy objectives. Anti-Obama partisans lashed out on Wednesday after OFA launched its search for unpaid workers. 'Do you provide a living wage to do this work?' one asked. Another quipped: 'Only if you pay me $15 per hour, plus benefits. Otherwise you are exploiting my labor.'","Organizing For Action, known as Obama For America during the election season, is advertising for 'fellowships' to push the White House's agenda .

A pair of trick handcuffs which let escape artist Harry Houdini fool the world with his death-defying stunts will be auctioned next week. The restraints, made of cast iron, were a vital prop in Mr Houdini's Chinese water torture escape. The performer would amaze audiences by escaping from the handcuffs and a set of wooden stocks while submerged. But decades after his death a fellow magician discovered that the devices had been altered so that they could easily be slipped off, allowing the Hungarian illusionist to escape impossible situations. Tricked: Experts believed Mr Houdini used heat to alter the locking mechanism and allow him to escape the handcuffs . Shackled: The handcuffs were once owned by Harry Houdini, pictured who would amaze audiences in the early 20th century with his stunning escapes . Billy McComb analysed the rusty handcuffs, once owned by Mr Houdini's brother  Theo Hardeen, in the 1960s and found the secret behind his illusions. It is believed that when Mr Houdini first put the shackles on he heated them over an open flame which loosened the spring mechanism inside. When they were placed onto his wrists and held upright they would securely lock, but when they were turned upside down they would snap open. The item, believed to be the first specially-altered pair to reach the market, is expected to fetch some £3,000 by auctioneers Bloomsbury on 12 December. The auction also features a pair of Mr Houdini's leg restraints, and a padlock owner by the illusionist. Locked up: This pair of Mr Houdini's leg restraints is also up for sale next week . Mike Heseltine, specialist in conjuring and performing arts at Bloomsbury, said: 'Houdini started using handcuffs in his routines from 1895. 'He did a variety of water stunts and it is a possibility that these handcuffs could have been used in the Chinese Water Tortune trick, which was seriously dangerous. 'This pair have been altered so they unlock when manouvered in a certain way, and this is the first time I have heard of him using handcuffs like this. 'There is no secret mechanism and they lock in the normal way, but it is thought that when he was wearing them he heated them up which relaxed the pressure on the spring. 'This meant that when they were on they would be locked, but if they were manouvered in a certain way they would come open as a security measure. 'He would have needed to have that precaution to make sure he could get out. The audience wouldn't have known because his tricks were done in a matter of seconds. 'I haven't ever seen anything before like this or heard of any handcuffs of his that have been altered, so these are very rare. I expect these will sell to a private collector.'","Restraints owned by the famous illusionist are expected to fetch £3,000 .

The daughter of Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu has had plastic surgery on her nose five times because she could not bear to look like her ‘hoodlum father’, she admitted yesterday. In a ferocious attack on the French actor, who turns 65 this month, Julie Depardieu added that he had little hope of living beyond the age of 70. Miss Depardieu, 40, said she continually called in plastic surgeons because she had inherited her father’s trademark nose and wanted to be less recognisable. She told French newspaper Le Monde: ‘I had five nose jobs because I couldn’t stand myself. It was a question of identity. It was not even to be pretty. ‘I didn’t want to have that nose, because it resembled someone in my family.’ Miss Depardieu is an award-winning film actress in her own right, having starred in a number of films, including La Petite Lili, for which she won a Cesar – the French equivalent of an Oscar – for Best Supporting Actress. She was also nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Cesar in 2005 for her performance in Podium. But her father became a household name in Britain and America after starring in hit films including Jean de Florette, Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac. Miss Depardieu said: ‘He won’t grow much older – 65 years – it’s not old. And when you know what he does, he won’t last. In five years’ time, he won’t be around. He’s the next on the list, I know it.’ The actress, who has two sons – Billy, two, and Alfred, one – added: ‘My father is a hoodlum. He says one thing, he does another. You have to be wary of him.

He was . also fined the equivalent of £3,800 earlier this year for drink-driving . on his scooter in the French capital. Depardieu had two children with Elisabeth Guignot, the French actress to whom he was married between 1970 and 2006. His daughter said her family had never been a very close one, saying that at Christmas ‘everyone argues with each other’. ‘Often . we don’t even open the presents because everyone has already got up . from the table,’ she said. Miss Depardieu added that it had been . difficult for her and her late brother Guillaume to grow up in their . father’s shadow. ‘He’s a guy who is always going off somewhere else and who explains to you that he can’t stay around. ‘He’s got a handicap, in fact, because he’s someone who cannot stay in the same place.’ Red carpet appearances: Ms Depardieu at the Franck Sobier fashion show in 2008 (left) and at the Tommy Hilfiger Champs Elysee flagship opening in 2010 . Depardieu, who has made more than 150 films, wrote an open letter to France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault last year explaining why he was leaving his native country. He wrote: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’ He . said he paid 85 per cent of his income to the Government last year, and . estimated that he had paid more than £130 million in total since he . started work on leaving school aged 14. Career: The 40-year-old presenting new film 'The Witnesses' at the 57th International Film Festival in Berlin in 2007 . In August, the actor said he considered himself a 'citizen of the world' after a Belgium town made him an honorary citizen. To celebrate, he invited 200 guests to a barbeque at his house in Nechin, just one kilometre from the border with France. The ceremony was held at the Chateau Bourgogne where he was made an honorary citizen of Estaimpuis municipality, which includes the village. In 1998 the actor was involved in a motorcycle crash when his blood-alcohol level was five times over the legal limit. He escaped with leg and face injuries.","Julie Depardieu said her father Gerard had little hope of living beyond 70 .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 12:14 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:55 EST, 5 December 2013 . Amy Robach has returned to the small screen after having a double mastectomy and said that she will begin chemotherapy treatment in less than two weeks. 'Physically I feel remarkably well. Mentally, that's another challenge because that was phase one,' the Good Morning America correspondent said during the show Thursday morning. As MailOnline reported yesterday, ABC initially announced that Robach would be back on the morning news program this past Monday but much of the show earlier this week was dedicated to celebrating Sam Champion's sudden departure for The Weather Channel. She's back: Amy Robach made her return to Good Morning America on Thursday and explained how she is scheduled to begin four months of chemotherapy on December 16 . At the table: Robach said that she plans to work at ABC through her treatment, citing fellow breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts as her inspiration . Robach, who first discovered she had a malignant tumor in her right breast after an on-air mammogram, said that it was only after she had a double mastectomy three weeks ago that doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some abnormal cells in the left breast. After the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final step. Staying positive: The 40-year-old mom said that her age and young children were the driving force behind her decision to pursue an aggressive treatment regime . 'That was the devastating news for me. When I woke up, the first question I asked was ""Did it spread to my lymph nodes?"" because that’s the difference between chemo and no chemo,' she explained. The 40-year-old, who opted for the most aggressive form of treatment because of her age and the fact that she has two young daughters and three stepsons, begins her four-month chemotherapy treatment on December 16. 'Anyone who has gone through this battle- as Robin has- knows, (surgery's) the first step but the next couple ones are going to be tough, and mentally I think is the toughest part of this,' she said referring to GMA anchor Robin Roberts' own battle with breast cancer. 'I'm going to work through it. I saw Robin do it. I know how strong you were and you give me strength, Robin, because it is important to get up and have something to do each day even if you don't feel great and even if you feel crappy and I know they have all these new drugs to make it a little less difficult.' ‘There are days where if you let your mind wander, it's fairly devastating.’ Ever since her diagnosis on October 30, Robach has said how she was hesitant to get the test done because she had no family history of the disease and there are certain medical authorities that suggest women first have the test when they are 50-years-old. Looking great: Amy was first spotted back at ABC studios on Wednesday but she didn't go on air that day . Support: She tweeted this photo of she and Champion in the ABC studios shortly after GMA ended on Wednesday . Today, Robach said that she had had the prescription to have a mammogram for a year before she actually went in for the exam. '40 for me was the right time but 39 probably would have bneen better,' she said, adding that if she waited much longer 'that could have meant the difference between life and death for me.' Her on-air discussion this morning coincides with the publication of this week's People magazine where her cancer battle is featured as the cover story. 'It’s going to be a crappy year, and then . I'll be on drugs for probably the next 10 years and there are other . issues down the road that we're discussing and we're dealing with. It's . about being vigilant and taking care of myself,' she told People Magazine. Staying positive: After an on-air mammogram revealed that she had a tumor in one of her breasts, further tests revealed that she had a second tumor, more abnormal cells and the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes . Support: Robach's husband Andrew Shue has been on hand throughout the ordeal, seen here on set when she announced that she had cancer . Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were. They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery. Even though she remains 'resolute' in her decision to choose the most aggressive form of treatment, it has been an emotionally taxing process. 'I'll be honest: there have been a couple of nights where I've sobbed myself to sleep,' she said.","GMA correspondent Amy Robach said that she chose the most aggressive form of treatment because of her age and the age of her children .

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:57 EST, 5 December 2013 . A Florida teen has had a lucky escape after accidentally swallowing two buckminsterfullerenes or 'Buckyballs' - rare-earth magnets that are incredibly strong and can perforate the stomach and even kill if swallowed. Christin Rivas, 14, was given six of the magnets by a church friend just before Thanksgiving, and took them to her school in Melbourne to 'freak out' her friends with tricks such as pulling a pen up a wall from a neighboring classroom. But the fun ended when Christin Rivas accidentally swallowed the magnets and had to have them surgically removed along with a portion of her colon and her appendix. Life-saving surgery: Doctors removed rare-earth magnets from Christin Rivas' small intestine after she accidentally swallowed two Buckyballs . Buckyballs come in a set of 216 magnets that can be manipulated into sculptures and chain jewelry. Christin Rivas says swallowing the tiny, spherical magnets was 'one of those stupid moments.' 'I was going to the bathroom and I put them in my mouth because I didn't want to put them on the floor. I wasn't quite thinking. The kid on the other side said something that made me laugh and swallow them,' she told ABC News. 'I started to try to make myself throw up because I read they were really dangerous and got really worried,' she said. 'I told my teacher, and she sent me to the clinic and they called my mom.' Christin Rivas' mother, Barbara Rivas, did some research on the internet and realized that her daughter's condition was life-threatening. She rushed her to the emergency room where doctors told her to go home and wait until her daughter passed the magnets. Not a toy: Magnet-related emergency room visits have increased five times since 2002, and been linked with one death . Not content with this solution, Barbara Rivas sought a second opinion and christin was sent to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. 'She came in overnight feeling fine, and in the morning when we repeated her X-ray we saw what looked like two round magnets and they had passed into the stomach,' Dr Tejas Mehta, her gastroenterologist, told ABC News. Irresistible: The tiny magnets have proven tempting for children and kids swallowing them or putting them up their noses has resulted in a huge increase in magnet-related injuries . 'We thought we could do an upper endoscopy and be done with it.' Mehta was wrong. By the third day, the magnets had become stuck at the end of Christin's small intestine, risking perforation and infection of the tissue. The buckyballs Rivas swallowed were made of neodymium, a material that begins to chip and erode in stomach acid. The . risk becomes even more extreme if more than one magnet is swallowed, . because if they become separated they can twist parts of the intestine . and stomach between them, cutting off blood supply. After five days in hospital, Christin was finally released and her mother says she is 'doing well.' Barbara . and Christin Rivas are hoping to draw attention ot the dangers of the . tiny magnets - particularly if swallowed by a small child who can't . communicate the information to parents. 'They are very dangerous unless they are used for the right things,' Christin told ABC News. 'I wanted to make people more aware of this before Christmas when younger children can get ahold of the stuff. There is a 60 per cent morbidity. A little kid wouldn't survive.' Rare-earth magnets pose 'unique health hazards to children,' according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2003, one death and 19 injuries, often requiring gastrointestinal surgery, have been reported and between 2002 and 2011, magnet-related emergency room visits among people under 21 incerased five fold - a total of 22,500 cases. Hospital stay: Doctors at Arnold Palmer Hospital (pictured) in Orlando, Florida, had to perform surgery on Christin Rivas when the magnets became stuck in her small intestine . Barbara Rivas would like to see the tiny magnets completely banned. In 2012, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) started a product recall proceeding against the former CEO of Maxfield & Oberton, the company that makes Buckyballs, linking them to 1,700 emergency room visits from 2009 to 2011. According to Bloomburg Business Week, in February this year the CPSC invoked a little-used legal doctrine to attempt to force Craig Zucker, the former CEO of Maxfield and Oberton, to pay an estimated $57 million in costs related to the recall. Last month, Zucker filed a lawsuit asking the U.S. District Court of Maryland to block the CPSC from seeking damages against him personally.","Christin Rivas, 14, swallowed two Buckyballs accidentally .

First husband: Nigella Lawson with her John Diamond who died from cancer in 2001 after a four-year battle with the disease . After they took the Class A drug together, she told the jury she didn't take it again until 2010 when Mr Saatchi had subjected her to 'intimate terrorism'. Miss Lawson is giving evidence against her former PAs Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo who are accused of spending £685,000 on themselves using the millionaire art dealer's company credit cards. She told the jury today that she 'became involved' with Mr Saatchi after Mr Diamond passed away. 'It would be fair to say that not very long after my first husband died I began to become involved with Mr Saatchi,' she said.

Miss Lawson married journalist John Diamond in 1992 in a ceremony in Venice and they later had two children together.

She told the jury yesterday: 'I did speak to a doctor of . palliative care because I was troubled about whether I should let John . continue, and he said just let him. And so I didn't judge or begrudge.' But . she said claims that credit cards and envelopes containing white powder . were left around the home she shared with Mr Diamond in Shepherds Bush, west London, were 'completely . false'.

"Jeremi J. Alicea, 27, of Bedford, . Ohio is accused of pandering child pornography and he is also accused of . possessing a criminal tool . By . Alexandra Klausner . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:53 EST, 31 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:27 EST, 31 January 2014 . The nephew of the Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro followed in his uncle's sexually deviant footsteps and was charged on Thursday with 22 counts related to child pornography. Jeremi J. Alicea, 27, of Bedford, Ohio is accused of pandering child pornography and he is also accused of possessing a criminal tool. The court records say that Alicea's laptop was his 'criminal tool' and that the alleged crimes occurred on Sept. 17 2013, and Oct.8, 2013. Both Ariel Castro (left) and his nephew Jeremi J. Alicea (right) exhibited sexually deviant behaviors . NBC reported that the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force investigated the child pornography case. Alicea's arraignment will take place at 8:30 am on February 13. Alicea's uncle Ariel Castro kidnapped and brutally raped three young women over a period of 10 gruesome years that 'seemed like an eternity.' Castro was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison on August 1, 2013. On September 3, Ariel, fed up with the 'improper' treatment in prison, hanged himself at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility. Castro kidnapped Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight and held them captive along with a 6-year-old girl he fathered with Berry. Bedroom windows were boarded shut from the inside with heavy closet doors and doorknobs had been removed and replaced with multiple locks. The house was divided in ways to make it more secure and to hide the existence of rooms. Amanda Berry . Gina DeJesus . Michelle Knight . Ariel Castro enters the courtroom on July 26, 2013, in Cleveland, United States . Castro abducted the women from the streets of Cleveland from 2002 to 2004 when they were 14, 16 and 20. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts including kidnapping, rape and murder and blamed his behavior on childhood molestation and porn addiction. He chained his captives by their ankles, fed them only one meal a day and provided plastic toilets in their bedrooms that were infrequently emptied. He menaced them with a gun, threatened them with tales of other captives, some of whom hadn't made it home, and at one point locked all of them in a vehicle in his garage for three days while he had a visitor. Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus were rescued May 6 when one of them broke out part of a door and called for help. Unlike Castro's nephew who seems to have issues of his own, Castro's son has spoken out publicly about his father's behavior and has labeled it atrocious. Anthony went on the Today Show this past June and said, 'I cannot express how happy I am that my father will never be able to hurt anyone again. Behind bars is where he belongs for the rest of his life. I have absolutely nothing to say to him.' He spoke of being beaten as a child and of witnessing horrific crimes against his own mother. 'No one should ever have to see their mom crumpled in a heap on the floor beaten,' he said. Anthony has made it his mission to speak out against sexual violence instead of perpetuating it. Anthony Castro also suffered at the hands of his father when he was a child .

She's the fastest female skier in the world, but Lindsey Vonn was testing, not competing, when making her first World Cup training run today in 10 months. Returning to her prized foreground, Lake Louise in Alberta - a course that has been dubbed 'Lake Lindsey' after the Olympian took 14 World Cup race victories there - the 29-year-old slid across her first finish line since February and declared her repaired right knee was 'stable'. Vonn will wait until after the training run on Thursday to decide whether to race for the first time since a high-speed crash at the world championships in February, where she tore two ligaments in her knee and broke a bone in her lower leg. 'Happy to be out there,' Vonn said. Scroll down for video .

'And, yeah, I'm looking forward to improving for the races, hopefully.' There are downhill events slated for Friday and Saturday, and a super-G on Sunday at a mountain where Vonn has earned 14 of her 59 career World Cup race wins. That includes three-victory sweeps in both 2011 and 2012. 'It was my first run, so I was, of course, a little bit nervous,' the four-time overall World Cup champion and 2010 Olympic downhill gold medalist said. 'First training run. First kind of real race situation since February. 'So it's been a long time, and I'm really happy.' As for her knee, the one in which she partially re-tore one of those reconstructed ligaments in a fall last month during practice in Colorado? 'Knee feels good. Feels stable,' Vonn said.

With temperatures tipping below freezing, Lindsey Vonn covers up with a ski mask . The biggest factor for Friday will be making sure there's no swelling in her right knee so it won't affect her thigh's ability to react and 'fire appropriately,' according to Vonn, who is three race wins from equaling the World Cup women's record of 62 held by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell. The temperature dropped below zero Wednesday, and Vonn sniffled occasionally as she spoke near the finish line. The American covered the course in 1 minute, 59.53 seconds, the 22nd-fastest time among the 65 skiers who finished Wednesday. Carolina Ruiz Castillo of Spain was fastest in training at 1:57.40, followed by past overall World Cup champions Hoefl-Riesch in 1:57.41, and Tina Maze of Slovenia in 1:58.06.

She always brings a pretty positive attitude,' said U.S. teammate Laurenne Ross. 'Even with her injuries and stuff, she seems to be pretty high-spirited.' Vonn said she 'can't really put a percentage on' how hard she was trying to charge and repeatedly acknowledged feeling jitters about getting back on a World Cup slope. She had hoped to return last week at Beaver Creek, Colo., not far from her home in Vail, but her setback from the crash on Nov. 19 scrapped those plans.

A varsity high school basketball player, with two prosthetic limbs, is now allowed back on the court -- after his school benched him over concerns he might hurt other players. Bailey Roby, 18, who plays for Mountain Vista High School in Highlands Ranch, was born with fibular hemimelia - meaning there is no fibula in either leg - and with three toes on each of his feet, The Denver Post reports. Roby's legs were amputated when we was 7 months old and received prosthetic limbs at age 1. Roby normally played toward the end of boys' varsity basketball games, according to 9 News. Prior to being benched, he played in 7 games this season, totaling 9 points and attempted 12 of his 13 shots from behind the 3-point line, Yahoo! Sports reports. Roby, seen here during the varsity Jan. 24 game, previously played on a special mixed team including special needs students -- until his skills earned him a spot on the junior varsity team last year . Bailey Roby, center, is seen playing on January 24. The Roby family had to pick up the special blue padding on his prosthetics the same day as the game 'otherwise he wouldn't be able to play,' according to his mother . That was before Roby was told he could not play before a January 14th game, the Denver Post reports. The next day after meeting with school officials, Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) did not approve his eligibility. On Thursday, the CHSAA issued a new statement, saying Roby will be allowed to play on a game-by-game basis. 'Bailey Roby will be permitted to play in games, so long as there is an agreement in place between both schools involved to ensure the situation on the floor remains safe for all participants,' it reads. 'CHSAA will consider approving this participation on a game-by-game basis.' Officials were previously concerned that Roby's prosthetic legs might pose a safety risk on the court. He is now allowed to play on a game-by-game basis . The CHSAA was concerned over Roby's eligibility and a national high school basketball association rule which states 'The referee shall not permit any team member to wear equipment or apparel which, in his/her judgment, is dangerous or confusing to other players or is not appropriate [...] the accommodations should not fundamentally alter the sport, heighten risk to the athlete/others or place opponents at a disadvantage.' Roby, who is 6-foot-3 but stands an extra two inches taller on his prosthetic legs, played on a school team that includes special needs students until he earned a spot on the junior varsity team last year, The Denver Post reports. The CHSAA gave him a letter of authorization when safety concerns were brought up. Roby played in Friday's game against Douglas County -- with Mountain Vista winning 75-59. Though Roby missed his only shot,  he was more than happy to be on the court, according to 9 News. 'I'm just glad I'm back on the court to play, make some threes, do some layups and block...I get to play again,' he told the channel.","Bailey Roby, 18, plays varsity basketball for Mountain Vista High School .

Bloomberg stepped down as mayor of New York at the turn of the year . Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, has been lined up to be the United Nations special envoy for cities and climate change, sources claimed on Thursday. Barring any last minute changes, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, who is seeking to re-energize the global climate change debate and boost the UN's role - could make the announcement as early as today, sources told Reuters. Mr Bloomberg, a billionaire philanthropist who left office last month, made combating climate change a key focus during his 12 years leading the United States most populous city. He also advocated for national climate change legislation. He has has played a leading role in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, an international group of mayors created in 2005 and dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The C40 group, of which Mr Bloomberg is president of the board, is due to meet in Johannesburg next week. He announced last month that New York City's greenhouse gas emissions have dropped by 19 per cent since 2005, putting the city nearly two-thirds of the way to meeting the goal that he set five years ago. Man of the people: Bloomberg rides the subway after he left City Hall for last time as Mayor of New York, on New Year's Eve in New York, December 31, 2013 . Bloomberg greets supporters as he leaves City Hall Tuesday, Dec. 31, 2013, in New York. He spent New Year's Eve with family and friends rather than attend the usual festivities . In the climate change blueprint he launched in 2007, called PlaNYC 2030, Mr Bloomberg set a goal to slash citywide emissions 30 per cent by 2030 through a number of initiatives, such as requiring hybrid taxi cabs, building bike lanes and retrofitting municipal buildings to make them more energy efficient. Mr Bloomberg pledged to continue focusing on promoting his key causes - combating climate change, gun control and immigration - after leaving office through his philanthropic work. The United Nations will host a one-day climate change summit in New York on Sept. 23, 2014. Many developing nations want it to be a deadline for rich countries to outline planned cuts in greenhouse gases beyond 2020 as a key step towards a global climate deal in 2015. Last month, Ban appointed former Ghana President John Kufuor and former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg as special envoys on climate change to drum up support for the planned September conference. Ban Ki-moon, seen getting a haircut in a barbershop in Old Havana, Cuba, on Monday, Jan 27, 2014, is keen to re-energize the climate change debate . Ever since the 2009 U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen failed to secure a deal on a binding treaty on reducing carbon emissions, the United Nations has been sidelined, U.N. diplomats and officials say. Climate discussions have shifted away from the world body to bilateral talks between key world powers and the Group of 20 club of major developed and developing nations. But Mr Ban has long seen galvanizing support for global action on climate change as key to his legacy as secretary-general, the officials and diplomats say, and is eager to restore the United Nations' relevance to the climate negotiations.","Bloomberg made combating climate change a key focus of 12 year reign .

Some of the pieces were acquired by her father, a Montana copper king, railroad baron and senator who founded Las Vegas. Monet's shimmering Water Lilies, which Christie's said has not been publicly exhibited since 1926, is estimated to sell for $25 million to $35 million. Rare collection: This image provided by Christie's auction house is Young Women Playing Badminton by French impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir . Heir to a fortune: Huguette Clark, pictured in 1930, was notoriously exclusive .

He is the namesake of Nevada's Clark County and established its county seat, Las Vegas. A onetime socialite who became a social shadow, Huguette Clark died at 104 in 2011. She had a penthouse and two other apartments on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and exquisite homes in Santa Barbara, California, and New Canaan, Connecticut, but she elected to spend her last 20 years in a hospital. With no close relatives, she left a roughly $300 million estate and a swirl of questions about the input she'd gotten from a close circle of caregivers and advisers and about the extensive gifts and bequests she'd given them in return.

An 81-year-old Florida woman is behind bars for repeatedly feeding black bears at home after being warned to stop by a judge multiple times. Mary Musselman from Sebring is now facing charges ranging from violating probation to battery on a law enforcement officer. Mrs Musselman, a retired gym teacher who worked at the local middle school, is described her as gentle hearted, sweet and someone who is harmless. She is also an animal love, but therein lies her downfall. Scroll down for video... Jailed: 81-year-old Mary Musselman, a retired gym teacher from central Florida is behind bars after feeding bears bowls of dog food despite being told not to on several occasions . Ignored: Florida resident Mary Musselman didn't listen, officials said. The authorities had warned her multiple times not to feed the black bears coming onto her property . No sign of stopping: Mrs Musselman would feed the bears 17 to 18 bowls of dog food at a time. The bears loved it and kept coming back. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission hated it and kept coming back, too . Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission officials told ABC Action News the trouble with Mrs Musselman began last year when they had to euthanize a black bear she kept feeding. 'Feeding bears results in bears losing their fear of people,' explained Gary Morse from Florida Wildlife Commission spokesperson. Once bears learn a particular behavior, they cannot be relocated because the animal's natural instincts are disrupted. Wildlife Officers even spent time to educate Mrs Musselman about the dangers of feeding wildlife showing her educational videos and leaving her with information  pamphlets. 'She told us she wasn't going to stop,' Mr Morse recalled. After several more warnings in November, FWC officers went back to her property after hearing she had been feeding two more bears. Source WFLA . Risky: They went to great lengths to explain to her why she shouldn't give the wild animals food, said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. They brought her informational videos and pamphlets, had conversations with her . Problem: Feeding bears results in bears losing their fear of people. After they get used to living around humans and getting food from them, relocating them does not solve the problem . Officers came back with more educational videos and told her that she would be visited weekly. After being summoned to appear in court in December, a judge ordered her Mrs Musselman to stop feeding all wild animals, however just before Christmas, at least three bears were being given large amount of food with up to 18 bowls of dog food being left out for them. A judge found her guilty of two counts of feeding wildlife and she was placed on probation for one year. Just before New Years Eve, Mrs Musselmen was once again found to be feeding bears and she was arrested. 'Unfortunately, she didn't heed the warnings,' Mr Morse said. When FWC officers arrested Mrs Musselman, she threatened to them. 'Feeding wildlife puts the community at risk from property destruction to possible danger of life and limb,' Mr Morse explained. Mrs Musselman reportedly told officers she had to feed the bears or they would starve to death. 'She didn't want to accept that fact that they'd be fine without her...they hibernate when there is no food,' Mr Morse added. Some of Mrs Musselman's former students over the the past forty years gathered outside her home and prayed for her. They have tried to bail her out but she is being held without bond. Many say her behavior is out of character. They want to get her back home as soon as possible because her husband is dying of cancer.

Despite the latest allegations that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie knew about plans to block entrances to the George Washington Bridge last year, the governor was out hobnobbing with celebrities like Jon Bon Jovi and Jimmy Fallon last night. Christie attended a birthday party for shock-jock Howard Stern on Friday - the same day his childhood friend, and former adviser announced that he has evidence that proves Christie was lying when he claimed to have no prior knowledge of the lane closures until after it happened. The governor, however, disputes the claims made bu David Wildstein, a high-level appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who personally oversaw the traffic disruption that many say was an act of political retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee who didn't back Christie in his last election. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . King of All Media: Governor Chris Christie attended a birthday party for shock-jock Howard Stern on Friday . Jersey: Christie hobnobbed with rock star Jon Bon Jovi (center) on the same day it was alleged that he knew about the 'Bridgegate' scandal . Christie arrived at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan about 6:30 p.m. - after his motorcade zipped past reporters. Just before 7 p.m., the governor took the stage at the party to wish 'The King of All Media"" a happy birthday - and to introduce New Jersey native Bon Jovi, joking that he is not the 'representative from New Jersey.' 'The representative of New Jersey you want to see right now ... is one of New Jersey's favorite sons, one of my good friends, and a great artist' Christie said. 'Ladies and gentlemen, Jon Bon Jovi.' Bon Jovi performed his 1987 hit 'Wanted Dead or Alive, and Christie left the event shortly after 7 p.m. Comedian Joan Rivers also was at Stern's shindig and had some fun on her Twitter page at the expense of the embattled governor. 'A surprise guest at Howard Stern's birthday was Governor Christie. I asked him how the traffic was coming in,' Rivers joked. Joker: Comedian Joan Rivers joked with the governor, asking 'how was the traffic' on his way to the party . Hardy-har: Hopefully Governor Christie has a sense of humor . Christie's motorcade zipped by reporters on his way into Stern's party at Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom . Christie's cameo at Stern's birthday bash came just hours after Wildstein announced that he has documents that prove Christie was lying. Mr Wildstein's bombshell revelation in the 'Bridgegate' scandal is the first indication Cristie may have had involved in the debacle. If proven true, the charges could have tremendous implications for Christie and his political future, both in New Jersey and in the wider nation. The recently-reelected Republican is considered a top presidential contender for 2016. Blame game: David Wildstein, who personally oversaw the George Washington Bridge lane closures, says he has evidence that Chris Christie lied . There are multiple ongoing investigations of the scandal - including criminal probes by the U.S Attorney and the FBI. The governor's office denied Mr Wildstein's claims and a statement released Friday reiterated Christie's position all along: 'He had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr./Wildstein's motivations were for closing them to begin with.' Mr Wildstein also alleged that the bridge disruption took place to pressure opponents of a multimillion-dollar development in Fort Lee that has ties to the governor's allies. Initial reports  indicated that it was relation for the borough's mayor not supporting Christie's reelection campaign. In a letter released to multiple news outlets, Wildstein directly contradicted the governor's repeated statements that he had no involvement in or knowledge of the lane colsures that paralyzed Fort Lee for four days. 'Evidence exists... tying Mr Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated publicly in a two-hour press conference,' Alan Zegas, Wildstein's lawyer, said in a letter to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Telling the truth? Christie staked his reputation on a January 9 press conference in which he repeatedly denied knowing about the closures or having any involvement . He also claimed that the governor . lied to the public during his marathon January 9 press conference. During that nationally-televised appearance, Christie said he accepted . responsibility for the scandal but denied ordering the closures or . knowing that they had been orchestrated by his appointees and members of . his staff. 'I knew . nothing about this,' Christie told the nation. 'And until it started to . be reported in the papers about the closure, but even then I was told . this was a traffic study.' He laid all blame for the scandal on his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and on Wildstein and others at the Port Authority. 'Mr Wildstein contests the accuracy of various statements that the governor made about him and he can prove the inaccuracy of some,' the letter says. Wildstein's attorney did not discuss what the evidence was or reveal any details about it. Wildstein was one of Christie's appointees to the Port Authority, which controls the George Washington Bridge. He was also high school friend of Christie's - although the governor has claimed that they had minimal interaction with Wildstein since his appointment. He resigned earlier this month after emails emerged between him and Ms Kelly in which they discussed closing the lanes and toll plazas in Fort Lee. The emails included Ms Kelly telling Wildstein, 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.' All but two lanes of the Fort Lee approach to the George Washington Bridge were closed for four days in September - paralyzing the borough and frustrating tens of thousands of commuters . The document also includes allegations that the bridge was closed to gain leverage for development deals. 'There have been reports that certain Commissioners of the Port Authority have been connected... to land deals involving the Port Authority, that Port Authority funds were allocated to projects connected to persons who supported the administration of Governor Chris Christie,' the letter reads. Additionally: 'That Port Authority funds were held back from those who refused to support the Governor.' The three-page letter was written by Mr Wildstein's attorney as an attempt to get the Port Authority to pay for his legal bills as several agencies, including the FBI, investigate the scandal. In addition to Ms Kelley and Mr Wildstein, two other Christie confidantes also were let go. His top deputy at the Port Authority, Bill Baroni, resigned after telling a legislative panel the lane closings were for a traffic pattern study, and two-time campaign manager Bill Stepien was told to step aside after he appeared to gloat over the traffic chaos in private emails released during the investigation. Christie, who has a reputation for engendering loyalty and insisting on discipline among his subordinates, explained at a December news conference that he learned of his aides' involvement when an original batch of subpoenaed emails was published. Backup: The gridlock caused by the lane closures led to major traffic problems in Fort Lee - including delays for ambulances and police officers .","Christie partied with stars like Jon Bon Jovi and Jimmy Fallon .

Barman, a pint of neat gin for my French pal, please. Just the one straw. The Swan at Swinbrook, pretty place, has appeared in Downton Abbey. President Francois Hollande was taken there and offered potted shrimps, a spot of trout and apple crumble for afters. Scroll down for video . Need a drink? M Hollande and Mr Cameron at an Oxfordshire pub yesterday . Not a bad Friday lunch. They even opened a bottle of French wine. Piat d’Or, presumably. But . it might as well have been Chateau Sarsons Vinegar 2014. For a terrible . deed  had been done. Minutes earlier those vilipendious vipers of ze . British press had done it again. Chiens!

French President Francois Hollande was seen running out of the pub where he met David Cameron for lunch . The Frenchman appeared to want a quick getaway after a day which saw him clash with Mr Cameron on Europe and face tricky questions about his love life . Their . dinky little executive jet had dropped through the misty heavens and a . great-coated David Cameron was on hand as the doors opened. He’d make a . fair hotel commissionaire, young Cameron. Frisky . Francois emerged, smiling. Good grief. I hope the air hostess was all . right. Behind him was the customary French military bod with kepi and a . uniform adorned with scrambled-egg braid. He follows le President (nearly) wherever he goes and carries France’s nuclear-bomb codes in an impressive briefcase. Or . at least that is what we are always told.

One . of the prototype designs of the drone was in the hangar, as were lots . of French journos and the French foreign minister (who had trouble . keeping his eyes open during Mr Cameron’s little speech). The French press corps has proved supine during the scandal of President Hollande and his girlfriends. French President Francois Hollande refused to comment on whether his affair has made France an international joke . Double trouble: Mr Hollande refused to comment on his affair with actress Julie Gayet (right) or the status of former First Lady Valerie Trierweiler .

But here he . was, signing military communiques with our lot, in the process learning . some of our military secrets. None of our business? He . and Mr Cameron had been asked about EU treaty re-negotiations. M . Hollande, taller than Ronnie Corbett but not much, radiated nonchalance.

TV psychologist Dr Phil has been accused of having a teenage girl 'incarcerated' in a 'private prison' in Utah instead of giving her psychological counseling. In a lawsuit filed by Missouri couple Terri and David Myers, they claim they approached Phil McGraw for help after their 15-year-old daughter had been seeking sex with older men online. But instead of showing sympathy, McGraw allegedly berated the mother for failing her child 'by a . country mile' and attacked the daughter for seeking sex on the Internet, when they appeared on his show last year. Claims: Dr Phil has been accused in a lawsuit of sending a troubled teenager who appeared on his show to a 'private prison' The teenager, identified only as SM in the suit, had started soliciting sex after she and another 15-year-old girl saw the adult they had been in a sexual relationship with killed in front of them. She appeared on an episode of Dr Phil, called Young, Online and Out Of Control, which was broadcast on February 23. After allegedly chastising the girl and her mother, Dr Phil offered free treatment at Island View in Utah which, according to the lawsuit, is a 'punitive behavior modification lock-down facility' and a 'private prison'. Despite the parents' concern for their daughter, who had witnessed a murder, 'Dr Phil, however, knew or should have known, that any placement at Island View would subject S.M. to such a demented regimen that she would be at risk of her problems being exacerbated.'

"By . Rosa Monckton . PUBLISHED: . 18:16 EST, 31 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:18 EST, 31 January 2014 . Inspiration: Sandra d'Auriol before her death . Some people fill the space around them with a kind of life force, and my friend Sandra d’Auriol was just such a person. I could hardly believe it when I received an email from her family, telling me of her violent death, plummeting from the roof of a 15-storey building in Beverly Hills, on the morning of January 22. Sandra had gone to Los Angeles to have a straightforward cosmetic surgery operation in a renowned Beverly Hills clinic. The operation lasted 13 hours, after which she was removed to a recovery room under 24-hour nursing supervision. A few hours later she came round in a state of panic and paranoia, which the doctors described as post-anaesthetic psychosis. This apparently happens in around 2 per cent of such procedures. She overpowered the nurse, stripped off her clothes and ran towards the first exit. Sandra made her way to the roof, where she stayed for over three hours, alternately sitting and teetering along the edge. A team of doctors talked to her, but she was unresponsive. Eventually she stood up, and leapt off the building to her death. Even as I write this, I cannot imagine a more horrible, frightening and awful way to die. In every article I have read about Sandra this week, she has been written of — or off — as a ‘socialite’. She was so much more than that. I first met Sandra in the early Eighties, when I was running the marketing department at Asprey, the jewellers, in Bond Street. She was 19, and the youngest person in my team. She already had a poise about her, and a self-assurance and serenity that was older than her years. Five of us shared an office tucked away in the Dickensian labyrinth of the Asprey building. Sandra’s innate sense of design was apparent in everything that she did, from the layout of the catalogues to how a window display was arranged. She always had an opinion, quietly but emphatically stated, and invariably right. She was always immaculately groomed, and I can still see her — vividly — striding down Bond Street on her endlessly long legs, with a clipboard and pen, taking notes on the window displays, then making seemingly minute alterations which immediately made an enormous difference. Sandra worked with me at Asprey for three years, but was becoming increasingly frustrated at having no direct outlet for her evident and growing jewellery-design talents. One day, I remember bringing to the office an amber necklace given to me by my step grandmother. Three weeks later, this previously old-lady necklace was transformed into a bohemian chain, with additions of carved golden beads and black glass. Memories: Sandra, right, stands with Rosa, second right with a man dressed as Father Christmas . Last March, when Sandra was in London, I wore it when we met for lunch. ‘Not bad,’ she said of it, ‘not bad at all.’ In 1983 Sandra had an opportunity to go to Hong Kong. At the time she was in a relationship that had run its course, but she didn’t quite have the courage to admit it. Day after day she would appear bleakly in the office, unable to decide what to do with her life. Finally I took her out to lunch, and said that I was going to make the decision for her. I told her that if she didn’t take the opportunity to go to Hong Kong, I would fire her. In an email to me last year, she mentioned this: ‘How right you were to push me out of the door of England all those years ago … never looked back … though I do sometimes ache for the English countryside, especially old trees and dank earth.’ She quickly established herself in Hong Kong, and eventually met and married Frenchman Yan d’Auriol, a former L’Oreal executive, with whom she had three children. Her creative energy went into designing unusual one-off pieces of jewellery, oriental in style, using carved jade, semi-precious stones and beaten silver. Plunge: Sandra D'Auriol jumped from the roof of a clinic in Los Angeles (black building, pictured right) She became highly successful, (as I knew she would be) and organized exhibitions all over the world. For many years she had a collection at the upmarket Chinese fashion boutique Shanghai Tang in London. Sandra co-founded a charity called the Child Welfare Scheme, for children in Nepal, which was funded with the profits from her business. She was that rare combination - a creative talent and a successful business woman. She enjoyed all of the good things that she and her husband had worked for, but never, ever forgot those less fortunate than herself. She started an appeal after the recent terrible typhoon in the Philippines, and raised a substantial amount of money and goods. Not content with doing that, she got on a plane with Yan, and helped on the ground with the distribution of disaster aid. Talented: Sandra d'Auriol pictured later in her life . There are wealthy women whose involvement in charity work consists just of attending fundraising dinners and getting their names on committees, but Sandra got involved at the sharp end. She was genuinely compassionate, and never in it for any mentions she might receive in fashionable magazines. We kept in touch intermittently over the years, and I would see her when she came through London. Each time I saw her she looked increasingly glamorous, but underneath she was still the same down-to-earth Sandra. She would, on every occasion, say how blessed she felt - surrounded by her family, and doing work that she loved. She had an elusive presence, which is difficult to capture on the page. Her most overwhelming characteristic was an absolute serenity. The precocious self-assurance of her late teens had matured into an almost tangible calmness. Yoga, for Sandra, was almost a way of life. In 2004, on the last day of a family holiday in Bali, her son, Teo, died in a swimming accident. He had gone to the pool for a final swim, and was doing underwater laps when he lost consciousness. He was 12 years old. Sandra’s strength in coping with the death of her only son was humbling to witness. She accepted that his allotted time on earth had ended, and told me that she felt blessed to have had the time she did with him. A few years later, she came to see me at our home in Sussex. She brought copies of a painting that Teo had done shortly before he died. I remember the vivid colours, a rainbow on a bridge, with a figure half way across, seen through an arch of light (Teo had clearly inherited his mother’s artistic sense). Sandra was convinced that Teo had some intimation of his own mortality, and that this painting was his subliminal way of expressing it... his last good bye. Sandra was not a conventionally religious person, but she believed in God, and had a deep spirituality. In my study I have a photograph she sent me, taken on that last family holiday. The photo portrays a tight family group: Yan and Sandra and their beautiful girls, with Teo smiling cheekily in the centre. I look at it now, and weep for them all. Some people are described as life-enhancing. Sandra was more than that; she was life-affirming. I can hear her mellifluous voice as I sit at my computer. I am as certain as I can be that she would not want anyone to grieve for her for too long. She will be with Teo, and she would want us to understand this, and celebrate that reunion. From there, she’d want us to celebrate her life, and the joy and passion with which she lived it. Her memorial service is being held in St John’s cathedral in Hong Kong, which held a special place in her heart. Friends are being asked not to send flowers - Sandra abhorred the waste of flowers at ceremonies - but to dress in bright colours ‘to create the most colourful and precious bouquet of all for Sandra: one made up of her beloved friends and family’. The last email I received from Sandra was on December 29. She had spent Christmas in the Philippines with Yan and the girls, her parents and Yan’s family. She wrote: ‘It is good to be able to give back a little of the love we were given.’ Sandra gave love in abundance. I still cannot believe that she has gone, and am devastated for all those she has left behind. The words she wrote for Teo’s funeral in November 2004 seem all the more poignant now: ‘Sharing this pain has helped us understand what it means to be surrounded by love, your prayers have bolstered us, your voices have soothed us: in this moment of utter pain we have found a strength... we will find a way to come to terms with Teo’s death. It is truly at a moment like this that one understands the meaning of the word love.’ I pray that Sandra’s family will be able to draw on her strength and love, which must surely live on in their hearts.","Sandra d'Auriol died last week after jumping off the roof of a clinic in Los Angeles after a straightforward operation .

Bizarre plot: Rosemary Vogel, 65, of Sun Lakes, Arizona, has been charged with first-degree attempted murder for allegedly injecting fecal matter into her hospitalized husband's IV line . An Arizona woman has been charged with attempted murder after police say she injected fecal matter into her hospitalized husband’s IV line. Rosemary Vogel, of Sun Lakes, was arrested Thursday after a nurse caught the 65-year-old handling her husband’s IV line, which was found to contain a brown substance, police said. A hospital lab test identified the matter in the IV line as feces, and a trace amount of the same brown substance also was found in the needle of an otherwise empty syringe found in Vogel’s purse, according to police. When it was searched in the hospital, Vogel’s pocketbook contained a total of three syringes, including two with a clear liquid, police said. Records showed that Mrs Vogel is a registered nurse who formerly worked at the hospital, Chandler Regional Medical Center. Investigators plan to conduct forensic tests on all the materials involved over the next week or two, police Sgt. Joe Favazzo said. However, the hospital had to test the brown substance in the IV line immediately for treatment purposes. ‘The lab came back with fecal matter,’ he said. The incident occurred after the 66-year-old man had undergone a heart procedure. He’s expected to survive that, as well as the alleged attempt on his life. Caught in the act: Nurses at Chandler Regional Medical Center, where Vogel used to work, found the woman manipulating her husband's IV . Police have yet to determine the motive behind the attack. Mrs Vogel declined to be interviewed by police and asked for an attorney. According to a police report, Mrs Vogel was sitting with her husband in a Chandler Regional Medical Center recovery room at around 1.30pm Thursday following a procedure on his heart. A pair of nurses walked into the room and noticed the wife in the act of handling her husband's IV line, which caused an alarm to go off. Herself a registered nurse, Rosemary Vogel told her former colleagues that the IV line needed to be flushed. That is when another hospital staffer discovered a brown substance in the medical equipment and removed the line from the patient’s arm, noting that the IV smelled like feces, the station WFSB reported. Contaminated: A hospital staffer observed that the 66-year-old patient's IV line contained a brown substance and smelled of feces . The nurse went for help, and upon her return she found the 65-yar-old wife trying to empty the contaminated IV bag into the trash, only to have one of the hospital personnel snatch it out of her hands, according to the report. The suspect initially had faced a charge of aggravated assault, which was later upgraded to first-degree attempted murder.","Rosemary Vogel charged with first-degree attempted murder for allegedly trying to kill her 66-year-old husband .

Love birds: These swans appeared to be coming over all romantic as they formed a perfect heart shape at the Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset . Home to a colony of around 600 nesting Mute Swans, the Swannery was originally set up by the Benedictine monks who built their monastery at Abbotsbury during the 1040s. Originally the swans were farmed to produce food for the monks' lavish banquets, and when the monastery was destroyed by Henry VIII in 1539, they Swannery came under the stewardship of Ilchester Estates, which still oversees it today. Unlike most British swans, these are not owned by the Queen as they were sold by Henry VIII to Sir Giles Strangways, Earl of Ilchester.

It was the most terrifying frog to have ever hopped the Earth – and now scientists believe the ‘devil frog’ was even scarier than first imagined. The ancient frog, named Beelzebufo ampinga, had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell. It was the size of an African bullfrog, growing to about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across, and lived between 70 million and 65 million years ago. The ancient frog, named Beelzebufo ampinga, had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell.  A new computer model for Beelzebufo ampinga's skeleton incorporates fossil specimens marked in dark blue. The scale bar at lower right marks roughly an inch in length . The species bone fragments have been collected for nearly two decades, but researchers have only recently pieced the fossils together to reveal its incredible features. ‘We knew it was big; we knew it was almost certainly predatory,’ said study co-author Susan Evans, a palaeontologist at the University College London told Live Science. ‘What the new material has shown us is that it was even more heavily armoured than we imagined.’ Study also found the devil frog was slightly smaller than previously thought. It was the size of an African bullfrog, which grows to about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across. Pictured is an illustraion of what scientists initially thought the frog looked like compared with a modern frog, and a pencil added for scale . The devil frog’s name, Beelzebufo ampinga, came from Beelzebub, the Greek for devil, and bufo - Latin for toad. Ampinga means ‘shield,’ named for an armour- like part of its anatomy. The creature had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell. It was the size of an African bullfrog, which grows to about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across, and lived between 70 million and 65 million years ago. Even though it lived far away, Beelzebufo appears to be closely related to a group of frogs that live today in South America. They are nicknamed ‘Pac-Man’ frogs due to their huge mouths. Some have little horns on their heads, and the scientists think Beelzebufo also may have had horns. The first frogs appeared about 180 million years ago, and their basic body plan has remained unchanged. The devil frog lived during the Cretaceous Period at the end of the age of dinosaurs, which went extinct along with many other types of animals 65 million years ago. Earlier studies suggested the creature had a huge, round head as well as sharp teeth and short back legs. But the spiky flanges and plates in its skin were an unexpected discovery. Scientists suspect the devil frog’s body armour may have been an adaptation to a dry environment allowing it to burrow underground to cool down. The armour may also have been protection from dinosaurs that roamed the Earth during the same period. It was powerfully built and possessed a very wide mouth and powerful jaws. It probably didn't dine daintily. ‘It's not outside the realm of possibility that Beelzebufo took down lizards and mammals and smaller frogs, and even - considering its size - possibly hatchling dinosaurs,’ said David Krause of Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, . When the team looked the frog's body structure, they found that physically, it fit in with a family of horned frogs called the Ceratophryidae, now found only in South America. However to reach Madagascar from South America, the frogs would have needed to through Antarctica – a route which was submerged underwater by 112 million years ago. That would mean that devil frogs diverged from their South American relatives before that submergence, pushing back the origin of Ceratophryidae by more than 40 million years. Researchers collected frog fossil fragments in the Mahajanga Basin in Madagasca. The majority of specimens of Beelzebufo were discovered in the green sections shown on this map . The skull of the devil frog is shown here. Scientists suspect the devil frog's body armour may have been an adaptation to a dry environment allowing it to burrow underground to cool down.

Mr Mitchell was forced out of his Cabinet job after a row with police at the Downing Street gates in September 2012, but insists officers lied  about what happened. He was accused of calling a policeman a ‘f****** pleb’ during the row, a charge he has vehemently denied. One PC, Keith Wallis, has admitted he wrongly claimed to have witnessed the argument and will be sentenced this week for misconduct in public office. Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell in Westminster, central London. The Metropolitan Police's heavily criticised investigation into the plebgate affair has lasted almost a year . But it can be revealed today that Mr Mitchell’s own account of the incident will not be put before the judge. In an extraordinary intervention, prosecutors have told the former Chief Whip that they will not submit his ‘impact statements’ because they do not agree he was the victim of a police conspiracy. Mr Mitchell believes the officer he argued with as he tried to cycle through the Downing Street gates, PC Toby Rowland, also lied about what happened – but he has not been charged and is suing the Tory MP for libel over the allegation. The Crown Prosecution Service wrote to Mr Mitchell on Friday, saying: ‘Your assertion does not accord with the rest of the prosecution evidence upon which we concluded that there was insufficient [evidence] to show that PC Rowland lied or that you were a victim of a conspiracy of misinformation.’ British police officer Keith Wallis arrives at the Old Bailey in London, England on 10 January 2014. The officer from the Diplomatic Protection Group is in court over claims that he sent an email to the deputy chief whip, John Randall, who was his MP, wrongly claiming that he had seen an incident in Downing Street involving other police officers and British Conservative Party member Andrew Mitchell . The letter added: ‘We are not proposing to draw the judge’s attention to any part of the statements you have already given.’ However, the letter said that if Mr Mitchell wanted to prepare another statement that referred only to the impact of PC Wallis’s conduct on him, the CPS would ‘consider your representations’. Last November the CPS said there was insufficient evidence to show PC Rowland had lied, but soon after the Tory MP for Sutton Coldfield said the ‘lying phrases’ had been ‘made up and disseminated’ to ‘destroy my political career’.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:21 EST, 31 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:18 EST, 31 January 2014 . Medical reports have revealed that Veterans Affairs doctors were fooled for years by Aaron Alexis, the gunman who killed 12 people in last yearâ€™s rampage at Washingtonâ€™s Navy Yard. The records show that he lied so convincingly to those treating him that they concluded he had no mental health issues despite serious problems and encounters with police during the same period. Just weeks before the shootings, a doctor treating him for insomnia noted that the patient worked for the Defense Department but wrote hauntingly 'no problem there.' More than 100 pages of treatment and disability claims evaluation records for Aaron Alexis, spanning more than two years have now been revealed. They show Alexis complaining of minor physical ailments, including foot and knee injuries, slight hearing loss and later insomnia, but resolutely denying any mental health issues. Scroll down for video . Attack: Aaron Alexis went on a shooting spree in Washington's Navy Yard on September 16 and had security clearance to access the buildings because he worked as a consultant for the defense department . He directly denied having suicidal or homicidal thoughts when government doctors asked him about it just three weeks before the shootings. In a bizarre incident in Newport, R.I., Alexis told police on August 7 that disembodied voices were harassing him at his hotel using a microwave machine to prevent him from sleeping. After police reported the incident to the Navy, his employer, a defense contracting company, pulled his access to classified material for two days after his mental health problems became evident but restored it quickly and never told Navy officials it had done so. Just 16 days later, after Alexis told a VA emergency room doctor in Providence that he couldn't sleep, the doctor wrote that his speech and thoughts seemed 'clear and focused' and noted that he 'denies flashbacks, denies recent stress.' Liar: The medical records showed that Alexis answered 'no' when asked, 'Do you have anything that could be considered a weapon?' The medical records said Alexis, 34, was found sleeping in the VA waiting room in Providence on August 23 while waiting to see a doctor. During that visit he was prescribed 50 milligrams of trazodone, an antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication that in such low doses can be used to treat insomnia. 'Denies any pain except discomfort rt (right) temple,' a nurse wrote on August 23. 'Pt (patient) taking no medications including any otc (over-the-counter) medications.' An attending doctor provided additional details, saying Alexis suffered from fatigue after sleeping only two or three hours every night over the past three weeks. 'Speech and thoughts clear and focused. Denies flashbacks. Denies recent stress. Denies drugs, cocaine, heroin, caffeine product, depression, anxiety, chest pain, sob (shortness of breath), nightmares. He denies taking nap during the day. Denies SI (suicidal ideation) or HI (homicidal ideation),' the doctor wrote. 'He works in the Defense Department, no problem there,' the doctor added. The medical records showed that Alexis answered 'no' when asked, 'Do you have anything that could be considered a weapon?' The VA told the AP that was a standard question it asks veterans whom it treats in a triage setting. Five days later, on August 28, Alexis visited a VA medical facility in Washington, again complaining of sleeplessness: 'Patient presents to ER with c/o (case of) awakening each morning about 4am like clockwork and he cannot figure out why this is happening.' He answered 'no' when asked whether he was having feelings of hopelessness for the present and the future. Another doctor that night described the examination as 'unremarkable.' The VA gave him 10 more tablets of trazodone and sent him home just before 9pm. Alexis, a defense contractor and former Navy reservist, went on a deadly shooting rampage at the Navy Yard on September 16, spraying bullets in a hallway and firing on workers from a balcony. He died in a gunbattle with police. Understanding an attack: Before the Navy Yard shootings, Alexis left behind a note that FBI agents recovered saying he had been targeted by ultra-low frequency radio waves for the previous three months . He had purchased the shotgun he used two days before the shooting from a gun shop in Virginia. Alexis had been involved in at least two earlier shooting-related incidents, in 2004 when he was arrested in Seattle and charged with malicious mischief for shooting the tires on a construction worker's vehicle and in 2010 when he was arrested in Fort Worth, Texas, for firing a rifle into a neighbor's apartment. No charges were filed in those two cases, but it was not immediately clear whether Alexis was answering honestly on Aug. 23 when he was asked whether he still had any weapons. The FBI told the Associated Press it found no weapons when it searched the hotel where Alexis had been staying after the shootings. Before the Navy Yard shootings, Alexis left behind a note that FBI agents recovered saying he had been targeted by ultra-low frequency radio waves for the previous three months â€” the period that covered his visits to the VA medical facilities when he denied he was experiencing any stress or violent thoughts. Sidney Matthew, a lawyer representing the family of one of the shooting victims, told the AP it's possible that Alexis was evasive with his doctors but expressed skepticism that physicians adequately questioned Alexis about why he wasn't sleeping. 'There doesn't appear to be very much curiosity about what the ideology of the insomnia is,' said Matthew, who represents the family of Mary Frances DeLorenzo Knight in a federal lawsuit. The lawsuit claims the VA failed to treat Alexis' mental illness. Matthew noted that Alexis aggressively confronted a family at Norfolk International Airport on August 4, just days before his encounter with police on August 7 that was so bizarre that police contacted the Navy about their concerns. Alexis' family also had concerns about his mental health during the period. Victims: One man lays on the ground in the Navy Yard after being shot. 12 died in the attack . If doctors were perplexed about the cause of a patient's problem, there are limits as to how far they can investigate. The executive director of the National Center for Veteran Studies, Dr. Craig Bryan, said conducting an online search of a patient would be time-consuming and unlikely to help. That's particularly the case for a doctor working in an emergency room setting treating a condition as common as insomnia, he said. With few exceptions, it would be illegal to contact others, such as family, friends or an employer to search for clues, Bryan said. Other experts agreed. 'In an emergency setting, a patient with insomnia who does not report stressors or substance use, who denies suicidal or homicidal thoughts and who otherwise does not have urgent psychiatric or medical issues would typically be referred for further, full evaluation of the insomnia in a nonemergency setting,' said Dr. William E. Narrow, acting director of quality improvement for the American Psychiatric Association. The AP obtained 114 pages of Alexis' medical records under the Freedom of Information Act after requesting them a few weeks after the shootings. It is unusual for the government to disclose anyone's medical files, but the Veterans Affairs Department agreed that the public interest in the mass killing outweighed Alexis' privacy rights in keeping his treatment records secret after his death. In the records the AP obtained, the government withheld the names of all the doctors and others who treated Alexis to protect their privacy. Congress and the Pentagon are investigating the shootings, including whether faulty security clearance procedures allowed him to get and maintain his job. Looking over the tape: Alexis is seen on surveillance footage carrying a backpack into the building . Some lawmakers have said Alexis fell through the cracks at the VA and should have been treated by mental health professionals, but they have stopped short of specifying what government doctors should have done differently. The medical records also describe Alexis' efforts to qualify for disability payments because of ringing in his ears and orthopedic problems. In February 2011, almost immediately after Alexis received an honorable discharge from the Navy, he complained about tinnitus, which he said was 'annoying and can be distracting.' He said it began in 2009 when he was still serving in the Navy. An audiologist in Dallas determined that his hearing in both ears was 'within normal limits' and said any hearing loss or tinnitus probably didn't occur when he was serving in the military. In October 2011, Alexis filed another disability claim for what he said was a broken right foot he suffered when he fell down stairs in 2009, causing him mild to moderate pain daily. The Navy alleged in a nonjudicial punishment in July 2009 that Alexis was drunk when he leaped off stairs and suffered a broken ankle, but Alexis appealed the disciplinary action and it was removed from his record six months later because there was insufficient evidence he had been intoxicated. Alexis also complained to the VA about a spine problem and conditions with his knee and shoulder. An examiner concluded that Alexis had a degenerative disc in his back and less movement than normal in his shoulder and knee. The government granted him a 20 per cent disability rating for orthopedic issues in December 2011. He was awarded an additional 10 per cent for tinnitus and received $395 in monthly benefits retroactive to his leaving the Navy, or about $4,740.","Aaron Alexis left a note saying that he had been targeted by low-frequency radio waves for three months before the September 2013 shooting .

Demand: Lyle Kercher, brother of Meredith Kercher, said America must 'practise what it preaches' and lock up Amanda Knox . Amanda Knox could face up to five years in jail in the US as she awaits extradition to Italy, it was revealed last night, as the family of her victim called for her to be ‘locked up while she waits’. Top U.S. extradition lawyer Bruce Zagaris said if her latest conviction for the murder of Meredith Kercher is upheld  by the Italian Supreme Court, she will be put in jail. Mr Zagaris said: ‘It is rare for the U.S. to deny extradition requests from allied countries like Italy. Her lawyers would have the chance to appeal and any extradition is a long, drawn-out process which takes between one to five years. ‘If Italy applies for extradition Knox would be arrested by marshals and placed in jail. She could apply for bail and may get it but it would be a close call. It’s likely that she will spend one to five years in jail in America while the process drags on.’ Meredith’s brother Lyle Kercher told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She should be locked up while the process goes on.  I don’t understand why a convicted criminal is not in custody. America needs to practise what it preaches. We see cases all the time where they’re trying to extradite people – Julian Assange, Edward Snowden. You can’t be going around saying one thing and doing another. ‘I would be surprised if America doesn’t accept it if Italy calls for extradition. It would make a mockery  of the word reciprocation. ‘We would like to see her extradited. I would like to see her imprisoned in Italy. I don’t think it’s right her remaining  in her own country.’ But a close friend of the Knox family, retired Seattle judge Michael Heavey, said: ‘There is no way Amanda will spend another night in jail. Killed: Meredith Kercher, pictured, was found dead in her bedroom in 2007 . 'The overwhelming majority of the American public believe that she is the victim of a chronic miscarriage of justice and that she and indeed the Kercher family continue to be made victims by this charade going  on in Italy. 'There would be an outcry if anyone tried to place her in any US jail. It’s never going to happen.’ Perugia lawyer Marina Cancellotti said Knox’s ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 25, – who remained in Italy for the second trial where he was also re-convicted – could end up in prison while she remains free. Cancellotti said: ‘Italy will ask for extradition but will not obtain anything. I mean who would send Knox back to Italy? We will have to weigh up what it means to live in Italy or the U.S. if Sollecito ends up in prison and Knox free in the States.’ 'We will have to weigh up what it means': While Knox, right, may avoid prison, or spend years in America awaiting extradition, Raffaele Sollecitor, left, could be jailed much sooner . Knox, 26, could be put in Seatac Federal Detention Centre less than five miles from her father’s home in Seattle where Knox watched on TV as an Italian judge re-convicted her of murder on Thursday and sentenced her in her absence to 28 years and six months in jail. The ultimate decision about whether to extradite Knox will rest with John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State who has refused to comment on the case. Zagaris said: ‘There is always room for political pressure but the U.S. will likely extradite if the Italy government requests it because they will not want to get into a diplomatic row with Italy.’ Knox has told friends she has written to the Kercher family offering sympathy for their plight, but Meredith’s brother Lyle added: ‘If there’s a letter that has ever been sent to the family my parents never mentioned it and they would have. 'She’s never called or written a letter to say sorry for our loss or express any regret.’","Meredith's brother Lyle Kercher says U.S. must 'practise what it preaches'

Controversy: Tory, Lib Dem and Labour members furiously debated a 7.7 per cent rise in the price of tea at the House of Commons from 65p to 70p . With large parts of Britain under water, the NHS in chaos and the economy barely out of recession, you might think MPs had better things to do than worry about a 5p rise in the cost of a cuppa in the Commons Tea Room. But politicians staged a heated debate on the issue at Westminster last week, and voted by narrow majority to increase the price from 65p to 70p. The taxpayer-subsidised cost is still less than half the price of a cup in Caffè Nero opposite Big Ben, where tea is at least £1.65. The debate took place behind closed doors at a meeting of the Commons Administration Committee, which is in charge of catering at Westminster. Tribal party allegiances were put to one side as Tory David Evenett, Labour’s Mark Tami and Lib Dem Mark Hunter vigorously opposed the 7.7 per cent hike. One source said: ‘They said the price of a cup of tea is high enough and there is no reason why MPs – or staff – should pay any more.’ But Labour’s Thomas Docherty said MPs could not impose budget cuts on ordinary voters and then refuse to do likewise in the Commons. The 5p increase would save taxpayers £10,000 a year, officials said. The rise, to come in from April across most Commons cafes, was decided by a majority of five to four. The committee chairman, Tory MP Sir Alan Haselhurst, did not vote while Dave Watts, chairman of the backbench Parliamentary Labour Party, decided to abstain. Commons bosses have already introduced price rises across the network of Westminster cafes and restaurants to bring them closer to high street prices. Savings: The boosted price of the popular beverage will save about £25,000 of taxpayers' money a year . Change: Despite a bid to move closer to high street costs, it remains less than half the price of Caffe Nero tea . Debate: MPs were told they could not impose budget cuts to ordinary voters and then refuse to do likewise . A series of other increases were approved, including 5p for a banana, taking it to 35p, 5p on a bag of chips (85p) and 5p on a cup of latte coffee (£1.70). All the measures together will save about £25,000 a year. One MP who did not take part in the debate said: ‘MPs don’t earn as much as people think and  I don’t think 65p is particularly cheap. 'Our secretaries earn even less. The way things are going, we will soon have to pay the kind of prices you get in five-star hotel.’ But Mr Docherty defended the increase, saying: ‘We have to make an effort to reduce the taxpayer subsidy on catering.’","Majority of five voted in favour of increase from 65p to 70p for tea .

Britain's beef herd needs to go on a diet after . gorging on high-sugar grass . It's a time of year when many Britons are still struggling to shed those extra pounds they gained over Christmas and are perhaps pinning hopes on the latest fad, the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet. But eating too much, it seems, is not just a problem for humans. Britain’s beef cattle have grown overweight after months of feeding on high-sugar grass – and now farmers have been warned to cut their rations. Dr Basil Lowman of Scotland’s Rural . College, said: ‘I have never known so many cows across Britain to be so . overweight. They need to be slimmed down urgently.’ He said that overweight animals would experience health problems and have difficulty calving, so risking farmers’ livelihoods. The problem has arisen because prolonged sunlight leads to increased sugar levels in grass. Cattle . were able to eat outside for longer during last year’s fine summer, and . when they were moved into sheds for the winter they continued to enjoy . their sweet treat in the form of silage made from the  grass. Dr Lowman added: ‘It was a  season of plenty for cows. ‘There . is always a greedy cow or two in a herd but I would say this year about . 15 to 20 per cent of every herd is too fat. These cows are on average . at least 176lbs overweight.’ The . bovine equivalent of a beer belly or muffin top is a fatty layer around . the tail. Dr Lowman said: ‘It’s as if someone has put the cow’s tail . through a big Polo mint and put it on the cow’s back. They look obese. ‘The . trouble is that farmers see their cows every day and don’t really . notice if they’ve grown or put on excess weight. So they need to take a . friend or a vet to look at them. ‘If the cows are too fat they will  be too tired to give birth. Calves may die and in extreme cases, cows will die, too. ‘This causes a massive welfare problem and is a huge loss to the farmer – probably about £2,000 per animal. ‘It is very difficult to get rid of fat, so the quicker the farmers put their cows on a diet the better.’ Healthier cows: There is always one or two . greedy cows in a herd, says Dr Basil Lowman of Scotland's Rural College, . but at the moment some 15 to 20 per cent of the whole of Britain's beef . herd is too fat . Peter Scott, farm manager at Oatridge College near Edinburgh, admitted that 40 out of 100 cattle at the site were overweight and he urged fellow farmers to face up to the problem. He said: ‘We’ve got about four weeks before calving begins. We’re weighing our cows regularly to get them fit. You can easily see that some of them are far too fat.’ Typically, a cow on a diet will eat 22lbs of straw a day, 4.4lbs of meal and drink seven gallons of water. Chris Mallon, director of the National Beef Association, said: ‘This is a timely reminder for farmers to keep an eye on the condition of their cows.’","Overweight animals could suffer health problems and have difficulty calving .

Jim Davidson was banned from the funeral of long-term friend Margaret Thatcher as he faced historic sexual abuse allegations. The controversial comedian and staunch Thatcherite met regularly with the former prime minister he called 'Maggie' throughout her premiership. When she died in April at the age of 88, he was under arrest in connection with Operation Yewtree, set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal, and denied an invite to the service at St Paul's Cathedral. Friendship: Jim Davidson met with Margaret Thatcher regularly for years after they met when she was prime minister . Now cleared of the allegations, Mr Davidson, 60, has spoken of his heartbreak, blasting the Conservative party for 'stabbing me in the back'. He told the Sunday Express: 'It broke my heart, it really struck home as I knew her well. I used to go and sit and have tea with her. 'I got a call from the British Forces' Foundation to say ""You can't go to Maggie's funeral"". 'I said 'Why? Who has banned me? They said 'Mark, her butler, got a call from The State', which must have been Downing Street.' Mr Davidson, winner of this year's Celebrity Big Brother, was arrested in January 2012, and again in March, over claims made by 10 women - including one in the Falklands Islands - which he denied. In August, the Crown Prosecution Service ruled the women's allegations were not strong enough for there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction. The TV star, who shot to fame . presenting the Generation Game, was first detained at Heathrow as he . arrived back in the UK ahead of a planned appearance on last year's . series of Celebrity Big Brother. Ban: The controversial comic was facing sexual abuse allegations when Baroness Thatcher died in April last year, and was uninvited from the ceremonial funeral at St Paul's Cathedral . Speaks out: Davidson, 60, who won this year's Celebrity Big Brother, is writing a book about his 'year of hell' Mr Davidson had flown into London to give a series of interviews to journalists in advance of his appearance on the show. TV executives quickly held crisis meetings and replaced him with someone else. After his initial arrest he told friends: 'I am no Jimmy Savile. I have never forced myself on a girl in my life. I once let a drunken dancer sleep in my bed, but I never touched her. I am a gentleman.' The former Conservative supporter is now writing a book documenting his 'year of hell', in which he will address missing Baroness Thatcher's funeral. He now intends to hold his own memorial service at her resting place in the grounds of Royal Hospital Chelsea. The Iron Lady was known to be a fan and close friend of Mr Davidson since they met at a charity event for his charity supporting military personnel. Former Tory MP Gyles Brandreth spoke of the pair's friendship at the time of her death. He . said: 'Mrs Thatcher was a great fan of the comedian, not only because . he was so entertaining but because of the way he entertained the troops.

Baroness Sally Morgan has claimed she is being forced out of as chairman of schools watchdog Ofsted in a Government move to oust non-Tories from key posts. The Labour peer’s contract, due to end this month, has not been renewed. She said last night: ‘There is a determined effort from No 10 that Conservative supporters will be appointed to public bodies.’ A source close to Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws said: ‘The decision to get rid of Sally Morgan had absolutely nothing to do with her abilities and everything to do with Michael Gove’s desire to get his own people on board.’ Labour peer Baroness Sally Morgan (pictured with Alastair Campbell) currently chairs the schools inspectorate Ofsted, but has reportedly been told she will not be given a second three-year term at the watchdog . A No 10 spokesman admitted that Mr Gove had taken the decision, but denied that it was political. ‘This Government appoints people on merit. For example, Sally Morgan herself,’ he said. David Cameron was today accused of seeking to purge public bodies of officials who do not support the Conservative Party. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added: 'I am the latest of a fairly long list of people now who are non-Conservative supporters who are not being re-appointed. 'I think there is absolutely a pattern. It's extremely worrying.' It . was reported that Michael Gove was keen to appoint a 'fresh face' - . despite the fact that Lady Morgan, a Labour peer, is a strong supporter . of the Education Secretary's free schools and academies. However, she insisted today that she . had not fallen out with Mr Gove and suggested that No 10 was behind the . decision not to give her another three-year term. 'One . of the really important things about public appointments is that they . are made on the basis of merit and they are seen to be transparently . made,' Lady Morgan said. 'I think there is something going on in the . centre that's mitigating against that. 'I think there is an absolutely determined effort from No 10 that Conservative supporters will be appointed to public bodies. Although Lady Morgan is seen as a strong supporter of both Mr Gove's free schools and academies programmes, it is believed the Education Secretary wanted a fresh face in the post . 'It . has been a quiet, quiet drip. I'm not talking about Labour people being . replaced, I'm talking about non-Conservative supporters being replaced . by Conservative supporters. 'There . is a lot of concern about it. Often they are people who have been . working really well with their organisations and, indeed, with their . host departments, so I do think this is coming from No 10.' Although . Lady Morgan was once a close adviser to Tony Blair, she was seen as . being close to Mr Gove and he has paid tribute to her 'tremendous . contribution' to the work of Ofsted. The peer, whose current term is due to end this month, is expected to carry on until the autumn while a successor is found. The moves comes amid tensions between . Mr Gove and Ofsted - the Chief Inspector of Education, Sir Michael . Wilshaw, was angered by media reports that there were plans to reform or . even replace the organisation. Mr . Gove was forced to issue a statement voicing his full support for Sir . Michael and promising to dismiss any aides if they were found to be part . of any 'dirty tricks' campaign. Paying . tribute to Lady Morgan, he said: 'She has brought great knowledge and . insight, leading the board strongly through a period of significant . change, both managing the smooth transition when there were changes in . Chief Inspector, and leading the reforms to the inspectorate and its . work.' 'I hope that she continues to play an active role in helping to shape the education landscape to improve standards for all children and young people.' Lady Morgan told The Independent: 'Ofsted plays a crucial role in delivering independent inspection that is trusted by the public and particularly by parents. 'I am proud of helping lead Ofsted through a period of reform that has strengthened our inspections.' 'Our tougher regime is driving improvements with more good schools and colleges than ever before. 'There is also a renewed focus on raising expectations in all parts of the country and for all children, including the most disadvantaged.' Baroness Sally Morgan of Huyton - a former geography teacher and mother of two  - joined the Labour Party in 1985. She has held several posts at Labour HQ , including director of campaigns. In 1997, she joined Tony Blair's office in Downing Street as political secretary. She was made a life peer in 2001 . After a brief stint as Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for women she rejoined No 10 as director of government relations. She left Downing Street in 2005. She has also held roles as a nonexecutive director at Carphone Warehouse and as a board member of the Olympic Delivery Authority.","Labour peer Sally Morgan currently chairs the schools inspectorate .

Tragic: Horses are being abandoned, starving, when their owners cannot afford to feed or care for them. This pony was found alone in Norfolk . Thousands of horses are being left to starve as uncaring owners abandon them on verges and wasteground in what animal charities are warning is set to become a major animal cruelty crisis. Many have been dumped by middle-class families who bought them cheaply as pets, only to be hit by the soaring cost of feeding and caring for them. The RSPCA – which is helping four horses a day – will tomorrow reveal that it has seen a 69 per cent increase in equine rescues across England, up from 901 in 2012 to 1,526 last year. The most horrifying cases include a foal that was tied up in a bag and abandoned on an industrial estate in East London, and a pony, too weak to stand, left by the side  of a nearby busy road. One group of eight ponies was even released at Cardiff Airport. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘You’re looking at people who thought they could afford livery or rented fields but have discovered they can’t in the economic crisis. ‘Feed costs keep going up so they turn the horse out to fly-graze. We believe there are certainly cases where parents bought ponies which their children have outgrown. ‘If the pony has little value, they may not know what to do with it. So they just leave it on a piece of open ground.’ Chief Inspector Cathy Hyde, co-ordinator of the charity’s National Equine Inspectorate, added: ‘You can now buy a pony for £5. People who once could never have afforded one now can – but they soon discover they can’t afford to keep them. ‘With prices collapsing, there’s no incentive to send them to auction. They can’t afford to get these  animals gelded so they just dump them on land where they breed. ‘Fly-grazing has always been a problem in some areas but it’s increased dramatically across the UK. This is a major crisis. Where  in the past you might have seen a few horses, now you’ll see 20 or 30.’ Thousands of ill or under-nourished horses have been left to roam free because equine charities are unable to trace their owners or provide enough places at sanctuaries. Saved: A pony left by the side of the road in South East London - the second found in just one week . Only in extreme cases of suffering are the animals put down. The RSPCA figures include all rescued horses, not just those set loose and abandoned. But the sharp rise reflects studies by other leading equine welfare groups. World Horse Welfare said it estimates that 3,500 fly-grazed horses across England and Wales are suffering neglect. It sets the total number of places available in the country’s equine charity rescue centres at just 2,800 – and nearly all have already gone. Meanwhile, charity Redwings has warned that the number of neglected or abandoned animals reported to its helpline has risen fivefold, from 160 in 2009 to 806 last year. Among the worst fly-grazing hotspots are Gravesend in Kent, the Avon Estuary near Bristol, suburbs around Manchester and Hull, and parts of South Wales. And it revealed the problem is set to worsen as tougher laws in Wales encourage unscrupulous owners to dump their animals in England. Chief Inspector Hyde said: ‘This is fantastic for Wales but it is just going to export the problem to  England. We know that owners and dealers, particularly in the traveller community, already move large groups of horses around the country to find new sites.’ The Control of Horses (Wales) Act, which came into force last week, gives councils the right to seize, impound, rehome or, as a last resort, humanely destroy horses grazing on land without consent. This horse in Basildon was unable to stand due to malnutrition when the RSPCA rescue team found her . Campaigners say it is vital that Parliament gives English local authorities similar powers – cutting through complex legal procedures. Because most fly-grazed horses cannot be traced to an owner, councils can take action only after a minimum two-week investigation. Although they can then confiscate the animals, the only option is to microchip them – making them ‘legal’ – and sell them at auction. A spokesman for World Horse Welfare said: ‘Far too often these horses will simply be bought back by the dealer who gets a horse whose value has increased with the microchip. And the problem will be perpetuated.’ A spokesman for Redwings said: ‘Unless England takes action as well, it is possible the 2,000 or more horses being fly-grazed in Wales will simply be moved over the border into England.’ The charity’s chief executive, Lynn Cutress, added: ‘We have seen first-hand the devastating effects  of the increase in abandonment of horses, from large groups roaming on to playgrounds, airports, nature reserves, housing estates and farmland, to tiny foals left to fend for themselves, and even one that was deliberately thrown into a river and left to die. 'It doesn’t just affect the horse community. It has a severe impact on all areas of society.’","RSPCA has seen 69% increase in equine rescues, up 901 since last year .

Police forces across the country have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds kitting officers out with iPads in the fight against crime. Crime scene investigators and even armed response units have taken advantage of the newest high-tech fad to help them carry out their daily duties. Freedom of Information requests sent to every police force in the UK found that since 2009, forces have spent more than £646,000 on 1,876 touchscreen tablet computers. Hi-tech: Forces have spent more than £646,000 on iPads since 2009 . The array of gadgets, ranging from a regular iPad to exotic models costing more than £2,000 each. As only 35 of the 45 police forces in the UK disclosed their expenditure, the true figure is likely to be in excess of £750,000. Forces spent an average of £20,000 each on tablet computers of all descriptions since 2009, with Hertfordshire Constabulary spending the most at £57,598, while some services, such as Wiltshire Constabulary and Surrey Police, have not bought any of the gadgets. The craze for iPad policing appears to be gathering speed, as £375,000 of the expenditure – more than half – came in the 2012/2013 financial years. Although most of the devices were said to be used by staff to access paperwork, Tweet, or assist senior officers, some forces admitted that their officers rely on tablets for front-line policing. Defending the expenditure, forces have said that the devices represent 'cutting-edge' policing and enable officers to be much more mobile and spend more time on the streets. Hertfordshire Constabulary    £102,573City of London Police                 £57,598Durham Constabulary                £48,826Sussex Police                             £47,575Staffordshire Police                   £46,040 . Derbyshire Constabulary, which had previously had no tablets, bought 100 iPads to be used by its Crime Scene Investigators this year, at a cost of £23,000. The Firearms unit of Merseyside Police was also given five iPads, which the force said were for 'accessing maps and documents whilst mobile'. In common with the buying public, the tablet of choice for police officers is the Apple iPad, with officers often paying top price for the latest models. Of the 1,879 devices purchased, 1,085 were iPads, with the latest iPad 4 model proving the most popular. Depending on the specifications, forces paid as much as £541 for a single device, which can be bought online for as little as £329.99. Technology: A police interviewer uses an iPad while speaking to Tia Sharp's killer Stuart Hazell . However, while the iPad was the most popular choice of gizmo, many forces have experimented with much more expensive hardware. In 2010/11, Hertfordshire police bought its Olmypic Unit three HP CF-19 'toughbook' laptops, which are weather-resistant at a cost of £2,140 each. And in the last financial year, Hertfordshire bought 55 HP 2760-P computers for its crime management division, costing £845 each - the most expensive single order of touchscreen devices by a police force. The pricey computer can convert from a tablet to a conventional laptop, and has an in-built keyboard. But while police forces have claimed the devices help improve their efficiency by cutting down on paperwork, campaigners have warned that the services must offer value of money. Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'The police should make use of the latest technology if it helps them fight crime, but there is a danger that the rush to buy iPads will result in cash being frittered away. 'The tablets are a premium product with a premium price tag; their purchase must represent value for taxpayers’ money.' A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said: 'Hertfordshire is at the cutting-edge of technology with equipment designed to empower officers to be able to carry out a multitude of tasks quickly and efficiently when dealing with crime and anti-social behaviour. 'The devices will save money in the longer-term, because police officers won’t have to return to a police station or a police office to duplicate information and the use of technology will therefore give a better service to members of the public.'","Police forces have spent £646,000 on touch-screen computers since 2009 .

North Yorkshire Police said earlier this week they believe the most likely explanation for her disappearance is that she got separated from her group while under the influence of alcohol and fell in the River Ouse near to York's Lendal Bridge. Search: Megan Roberts, 20, has not been seen for more than a week since she disappeared during a night out with friends in York city centre . River Ouse: More than 30 officers are searching the water around the Lendal Bridge where the student was last seen last Thursday . They are now using sonar equipment to search the river for the missing student . Concern: Officers have launched an urgent search after the disappearance of Megan Roberts, 20, last week . Divers: The Yorkshire search team have complained of 'really difficult conditions' with 'no visibility in 'fast flowing and very cold' water . Divers from the regional police underwater search unit have been searching the river since Miss Roberts, who is from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, was reported missing on Monday. A spokesman said the team was now using special sonar equipment to scan the water from Lendal Bridge downstream to Naburn. The operation has supported by firefighters using a boat. The spokesman said: 'Over the weekend officers will conduct searches along the banks on both sides of the river.' Megan was last seen on CCTV on the corner of Rougier Street and Lendal Bridge at around 2.20am on January 23. Extra officers have been drafted in as they search land and water along the Ouse between Lendal Bridge and Ouse Bridge in the city centre .

Divers from the regional police underwater search unit have been searching the river since Miss Roberts, who is from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, was reported missing on Monday . A week after her disappearance, Superintendent Phil Cain said: 'The strongest and most probable line of inquiry being pursued by police is that Megan, affected by alcohol, has entered the river.' Mr Cain stressed that there was ‘no evidence to indicate foul play’, adding ‘on balance, this presents as a group of young friends on a night out that is likely to have ended in tragedy’. The officer said Miss Roberts was with a group of friends who had been drinking for 'several hours' before leaving the Popworld nightclub, in York city centre, at around 2.10am on Thursday morning. Night out: On the evening she vanished Megan was at the Popworld bar in York with her friends .

Last sighting: At 2.10am CCTV footage shows Miss Roberts with a group of people on the corner of Rougier Street near Lendal Bridge, left. Ten minutes later they crossed to the other side, right, but Megan was gone . Mr Cain explained how the group were spread out and some of them ran down a street called Tanner's Moat, past The Maltings pub, where Miss Roberts - the last in the group - was spotted bumping into a row of cycle racks. 'CCTV evidence does not show Megan running back up the same street with the others to rejoin the main group,' he said. Mr Cain said the group of friends has been extensively spoken to and officers are confident that none of them is directly responsible for Miss Roberts's disappearance.

And now, the elusive apostrophe has struck once more. In a blunder that has sparked furious debate across Cambridge, one street features all three variations of the punctuation mark. Outrage: Residents in Cambridge warn the misuse of punctuation on signs could confuse emergency services . The signs for Worts’ Causeway in Cambridge - named after 17th century landowner Sir William Worts - read Worts, Worts’ and Wort’s. Cambridge City Council is already facing criticism for abolishing all grammar from signage and some locals have started adding their own apostrophes. Now, locals are calling for official guidance on the matter. Marketing expert Jeremy Jones, 33, who lives on the street with three names, said: 'We shouldn’t be removing punctuation from road signs. 'The whole point is that it’s named after an individual and it’s part of the character of the area. 'If you remove it, it takes out that heritage. But if the council is going to have a policy, it should apply it correctly.' Cllr John Hipkin, an independent member on Cambridge City Council and a former English teacher, agreed. He said: 'We don’t want any warts on Sir William Worts’ name. He should be properly remembered.' The three signs displaying the name of a street named after landowner Sir William Worts feature three different uses of the apostrophe . Policy: The council attempted to rule out punctuation from all signs, but these signs have slipped through . Kathy Salaman, director of the Cambridge-based Good Grammar Company, said the apostrophe should come after the ‘s’ - making Worts’ the correct spelling. She said: 'My understanding is that it is named after somebody and so the apostrophe has to come after the 's'. 'You could add an additional ‘s’ after that but it is a matter of preference really. 'The other two variations of the street name are certainly wrong.' The move to ban apostrophes from all signage in the city came in the light of new national guidance which warned punctuation could confuse emergency services. Council bosses were widely criticised for dropping apostrophes with local government secretary Eric Pickles wading in to blame the ban on 'overzealous pen-pushers'. But despite the confusion a council spokeswoman has claimed there are no plans to remove the incorrect signs. She said: 'Whilst we agree the correct form of usage is Worts’ Causeway, our records show the name has been represented in various forms over the years. 'Having looked at documents produced by others we can also see the same variations appearing over time as well. 'Whilst there may be an inconsistency, we don’t believe this is causing confusion locally. 'We are not proposing to replace the signs at this time as this would not be a good use of council taxpayers’ money.'","Residents call for official guidance on punctuation of Cambridge street .
