"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of the region, but all of Florida's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. ""There have been no reports of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill-related oil products reaching the shore beyond the Northwest Florida region,"" Visit Florida's website said. The beaches and waters at tourist hot spots like Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island are open, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. ""The air here is also still fresh and clean, with no smell of oil whatsoever,"" the bureau's website said. A few tar balls have been spotted, however, and there is a chance the area could see the approach of oil sheen in the coming week, according to the bureau. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . There have been no oil effects in Panama City Beach, Florida, and the area's beaches and waters are open, the  Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau website said. The water at Pensacola Beach is also open for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. A health advisory has been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama line to the entrance of Johnson Beach on Perdido Key, the Pensacola Bay Area visitors bureau said. Swimming and fishing in the affected waters are not advised. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are located in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the park service's website said. Crews are finishing the cleanup of existing oil on Petit Bois Island, Mississippi. Meanwhile, more oil has been reported approaching Pensacola Pass, between the western point of Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island and the eastern coast of Perdido Key, according to the website. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. The beaches remain open for sunbathing and walking, but the City of Orange Beach is flying double red flags, meaning the waters are closed to the public. Public beaches in Gulf Shores are flying a yellow flag, meaning that caution is necessary. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou or Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website, although most of the coast is unaffected. ""The primary affected area is from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east. Over 75 percent of Louisiana's coastal waters extend westward from the mouth of the Mississippi River,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","All of Florida's beaches are open, including tourist hot spots Panama City and Pensacola .

"A 31-year-old Bronx woman has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime in the death of a man shoved in front of a subway train, Queens prosecutors said Saturday. District Attorney Richard A. Brown identified the woman as Erika Menendez. She was arraigned late Saturday, where she was ordered held without bail and to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. ""(She) said in sum and substance 'I pushed a Muslim off the train tracks because I hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001 when they put down the twin towers I've been beating them up,'"" the prosecutor said in a statement. The victim, Sunando Sen, grew up in a Hindu family, his roommate said. Witnesses said a woman paced the platform and talked to herself Thursday evening shortly before pushing the man as the 11-car train entered the station. The 46-year-old man's body was pinned under the second car after it came to a stop. The woman made ""statements implicating herself in the death of Sunando Sen,"" Paul Browne, the New York Police Department's chief spokesman, said earlier.  Security video showed a person running from the scene. Menendez was identified Saturday afternoon in a lineup, Browne said. She was recognized earlier in the day on a street in Brooklyn by a passer-by who called 911, the police spokesman said. The caller said she resembled the woman in the video. ""The defendant is accused of committing what is every subway commuter's worst nightmare -- being suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train,"" said Brown, the district attorney. ""The victim was allegedly shoved from behind and had no chance to defend himself. Beyond that, the hateful remarks allegedly made by the defendant and which precipitated the defendant's actions can never be tolerated by a civilized society."" It was not clear Saturday evening whether Menendez had obtained an attorney. Sen, of Queens, owned a shop called New Amsterdam Copies and was a graphic designer for posters, said roommate Ar Suman. In early December, Ki-Suck Han, 58, was shoved onto the tracks in a Times Square station as a train approached. Naeem Davis, 30, a homeless man, has been charged with second-degree murder in that case.","Judge orders suspect to be held without bail, and undergo a psychiatric exam .

"""Game of Thrones"" has been setting ratings records for HBO this season, so it's probably no surprise that the fantasy hit is once again settings records for illegal downloading too. According to piracy-monitoring blog TorrentFreak, the season 4 Thrones finale ""The Children"" had roughly 1.5 million downloads within just the first 12 hours after the finale aired on the premium cable network, with more than 250,000 users sharing the same file (a record-breaking ""swarm"" of users). The site estimates that total number of downloads will exceed 7.5 million in the days to come. EW: 'Game of Thrones' full coverage . On HBO, the episode delivered 9.3 million viewers its first night, and is expected to eventually surpass the show's current season average across all platforms (including the network's streaming player) of 18.6 million viewers. Earlier this season, ""Thrones"" topped ""The Sopranos"" to officially rank as the network's most-watched series of all time, while also ranking as the show's most illegally downloaded season as well. HBO tends to view piracy from a somewhat grudgingly pragmatic standpoint. The premium network officially condemns theft, yet also recognizes that ""Thrones"" is an enormous hit, that content leakage is tough to prevent and that the show's popularity among pirates is inevitable (countries such as Australia, where viewers don't receive new episodes via pay cable in a timely manner, tend to be among the biggest piracy territories). HBO's programming president Michael Lombardo last year told EW that the downloading was a ""compliment of sorts,"" noting, ""the demand is there. And it certainly didn't negatively impact the DVD sales. [Piracy is] something that comes along with having a wildly successful show on a subscription network."" EW:  'Game of Thrones' showrunners talk season 5 . This year, HBO added this statement: ""There are numerous anti-theft tools we utilize and we have significantly shrunk the international distribution window for original programming to practically correspond with the US premiere. Unfortunately, with popularity comes piracy. Good news is ""Game of Thrones"" continues to grow significantly and tens of millions are watching the series legally around the world."" Jeff Bewkes, CEO of HBO's parent company Time Warner, once claimed that piracy resulted in more HBO subscriptions. ""Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world. That's better than an Emmy."" See the original story at EW.com.","Site says there were roughly 1.5 million downloads early on .

"Criminal gang membership increased as much as 40 percent in the United States during the past three years, according to an FBI report released Friday. An estimated 1.4 million people are active in more than 33,000 street, prison and outlaw motorcycle gangs across the country, the report states. That compares to about 1 million gang members when the investigative agency last compiled such figures in January 2009. FBI officials, however, were quick to emphasize that the apparent 40 percent increase in membership may reflect more accurate reporting of numbers, in addition to any sudden swell in gangs' ranks. They said some of the spike could be due to much better reporting by law enforcement officers, an increase in the number of agencies reporting and other  administrative factors. ""We know gang membership has increased. How much, we really don't know,"" a senior FBI official told reporters at the agency's Washington headquarters. The 100-page 2011 ""National Gang Threat Assessment"" claimed criminal gangs pose a growing threat in communities throughout the United States. ""The most notable trends for 2011 have been the overall increase in gang membership and the expansion of criminal street gangs' control of street-level drug sales and collaboration with rival gangs and other criminal organizations,"" according to the report. While there was no data related to how the economy might factor into growth in gangs, more aggressive recruiting and cultural and ethnic factors may have contributed to the increase in gang membership. Although overall crime in the United States has continued to decline over the past three years, the relative amount of crime inflicted by gang members appears to have increased. The new FBI report claims that gangs are responsible for 48% of violent crime, on average, in most jurisdictions. Neighborhood-based gangs have proven that they can be as violent as the notorious Central American gang MS-13, which continues to grow. U.S.-based gangs are establishing stronger working relationships with Central American and Mexican gangs to facilitate not only drug smuggling, but also weapons trafficking and immigrant smuggling, the report claims. Although anti-gang officials said at Friday's press conference that they are concerned about gang members who enter the military, they don't note any evident gang activity among active U.S. military personnel. However, they fear those individuals who receive weapons and tactical training might use both to commit violence crimes when they re-enter society. Officials said that some gang members have radicalized while in prison, expressing worries that those individuals could be even more dangerous when they're released. Although some view criminal gangs as susceptible to payments from would-be terrorists, the anti-gang officials said today's gang leaders are often sophisticated and understand the risk of getting caught up in any terrorist organizations or plots. To date, officials have not noticed any clear connections between criminal gangs and terrorist groups. Gangs can be found in every U.S. state and the District of Columbia. The largest number of gang members is in southern California, southern Arizona and the Chicago area. The vast majority of these people belong to street gangs, predominantly in the West.","An estimated 1.4 million are active in U.S. gangs, compared to 1 million in 2009 .

"Some 50 million Americans still lack health insurance. That will change for the greater majority when the Affordable Health Care Act, or Obamacare, as it's more commonly known, rolls out over the next couple of years. While the bulk of the law goes into place in 2014, you'll see a few changes this year. However, much of 2013 will be dedicated to health facilities and government offices getting ready for the larger changes coming down the road. On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services conditionally approved eight more states' plans to set up their own health insurance exchange programs.  The conditional approvals mean a total of 19 states plus the District of Columbia have the initial thumbs-up on their plans. Two others, Arkansas and Delaware, have the go-ahead to run an exchange in partnership with the federal government. Decision day for states on health insurance marketplaces . States can decide to set up an exchange at any time, but the clock is ticking. States that plan to partner with the federal government need to do so by February 15.  People not living in a state with an exchange have access to a federal program. All the exchanges are supposed to be up and running by October 1 of this year. In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said she was encouraged by the progress states have made so far. ""From the beginning, this process has been guided by our belief that states know their own needs better than anyone else,"" Sebelius said. ""That's why we have worked so hard to give states the flexibility and resources to create and participate in marketplaces that work best for their citizens, and it's encouraging to see so many states moving forward to do just that."" What these exchanges will do is give the uninsured a better chance to shop for insurance in a way that's supposed to take the mystery out of buying a plan. Think of it like an online travel site that pulls information from hundreds of companies, allowing customers to compare the costs of flights or hotels on one easy-to-read screen. Another advantage to the exchange may be a lower cost for health insurance, according to Jay Angoff. He is the former director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight at HHS, the office responsible for implementing Obamacare. ""The key issue is not if the state or the fed runs the exchange,"" Angoff said. ""The key is: Will it be a strong or weak exchange, and will it use the bargaining power that it has to standardize the benefit packages and establish a real competitive bidding process that can really drive down rates? ""If the exchanges allow insurance companies to sell whatever they want, if (the state) doesn't negotiate or establish competitive bidding process, it's another case,"" he said. Obamacare to flesh-eating bacteria: Top 2012 health stories . Here are some other parts of Obamacare taking effect in 2013: . Preventative services . The federal government is sending more money to state Medicaid programs that offer preventative services for free or at little cost. Services include tests for high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol; many cancer screenings including colonoscopies and mammograms; counseling to help people lose weight, quit smoking or reduce alcohol use; routine vaccinations; flu and pneumonia shots; and others. Increased Medicaid payments . Doctors that take Medicaid patients get a pay raise.  Starting January 1, Medicaid payments in every state were brought up to the same level Medicare pays doctors. Some experts say the Medicare rate is too low, but Medicaid paid even less. While it varies from state to state, primary care physicians see on average a 73% pay bump according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A pilot program for bundling services . The law sets up a national pilot program that will encourage medical providers to coordinate patient care. Rather than have each service billed separately under Medicare, a flat rate would be paid for an episode of care. Justices won't block Obamacare's required emergency contraception coverage . Medicare tax increase . The wealthy face a 0.9% tax increase on the income they earn in excess of $200,000 (for couples filing jointly, it will hit those that make in excess of $250,000).  This will help boost the Medicare trust fund. Medical device tax . A new 2.3% tax goes on the price of medical devices. This doesn't include hearing aids or corrective lenses, but does include devices like defibrillators, pacemakers, artificial joints and others. Medical deductions . Up until now, Americans got a tax deduction if all their total medical expenses added up to more than 7.5% of what they earn (minus deductions and exceptions). Those expenses now will have to add up to 10% or more for most tax filers. Cap on FSAs . Flexible Spending Accounts now have a cap.  Up until now, employers set the limit on how much employees could set aside from their paychecks tax free to pay for medical expenses not covered by their insurance.  The majority of companies set an FSA limit of around $5,000. The government is now limiting FSA's to $2,500. Health benefits spelled out . W-2 tax forms issued this year for wages paid in 2012 must now include a line on the form showing the benefit employees receive from their employer-sponsored health care.  This is supposed to help you understand your benefits better and make health care spending more transparent.","8 more states conditionally approved for health insurance exchange programs .

"(CNN)Amber Nolan is stuck. The 30-year-old is in Alaska and she needs to get to the lower 48 -- ""or Hawaii."" She plans to leave Alaska by plane and it likely won't cost her a dime. Nolan's not a stowaway. The aviation enthusiast calls herself a ""jet hitchhiker."" Since 2012, she has hitched rides on jets, planes and the occasional B-17 bomber all across the United States. ""So far I have been to 46 states. All I have left on my list is Utah, Oklahoma, Kansas and Hawaii,"" says Nolan. In this age of tough airport security, something as casual as hitchhiking might seem out of the question. But Nolan says it's easy. ""The way it works is, I just hang out at small airports talking to people. There are about 14,000 general aviation airports across the country. There is a whole community there and if you are passionate about flying, they love to talk to you."" Nolan finds out where her new friends are headed and catches a ride. ""I have no agenda or time frame to get anywhere and I'm completely on other people's schedules.  I just get rides in the general direction I need to go,"" Nolan told CNN. The flights may be free, but the ride isn't. Nolan has no sponsor for her adventure, so when money gets tight, she picks up odd jobs. ""I've worked at restaurants, youth hostels, housekeeping on yachts,"" says Nolan. ""I even worked with the AIDS healthcare foundation for a while. I take whatever I can get and I stay with whomever I can.  I have been basically couch-hopping this entire time."" Nolan has also been blogging about her experiences on JetHiking.com. Like all good journeys, Nolan's will come to an end. Eventually, she'd like to write a book about jet-hiking and get a pilot's license of her own. ""That whole free spirit nature, your Amelia Earharts and Charles Lindberghs, are hard to find these days,"" she says. ""People only really hear about plane crashes and negative flying stories."" So far, Nolan's story is anything but negative, filed with chance encounters and friends new and old in towns and airports across the country. And, of course, for Nolan that's the point. ""It's more about the journey, the whole thing is actually the goal."" CNN's Tony Marco and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Still to go on Amber Nolan's list: Utah, Oklahoma, Kansas and Hawaii .

"New York (CNN) -- #BringBackOurGirls has now been tweeted more than a million times across the world, as global outrage over the kidnap of hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls grows. Shock has given way to anger as thousands in cities everywhere took to the streets to demand the Nigerian government, and other authorities, do more to rescue them. ""The Nigerian girls are my sisters,"" said Malala Yousafzai, who after being shot in the head by the Taliban for going to school launched The Malala Fund, which raises money for girls' education initiatives globally. The Malala Fund has now launched a Nigerian girls education campaign to support Nigerian organizations which are working to promote girls' schooling around the country. Indeed, ""Boko Haram"" translated means ""Western education is sin."" The militant group is one of many that threaten the efforts of girls worldwide to go to school, and to change their circumstances. CNN's Girl Rising looked at just some examples of the obstacles that many of the more than 600 million adolescent girls living in developing countries face every day -- obstacles that prevent them from going to school, from freedom, and from simply being a child. There are many ways to help girls, like those kidnapped in Nigeria, who face persecution, violence, poverty and other barriers to education. GIVE . CNN and Impact Your World don't accept donations but do help you find reputable places to give your money and time. ""CNN's Girl Rising"" was the centerpiece of 10x10, a global campaign to educate and empower girls. It created the 10x10 Fund for Girls' Education. Donations to this fund are distributed evenly among the film's nonprofit partners. Many of the girls profiled in the film were helped by these organizations, and the groups continue to work for girls' education in developing countries. As little as $50 can educate a girl for a year. CARE USA works to help educate girls in some of the poorest, most desperate parts of the rural areas in the mountains of Peru. Senna from ""Girl Rising"" was helped by this organization. GirlUp -- United Nations Foundation is a campaign inspiring American girls to take action for girls in countries such as Ethiopia, Guatemala and Liberia who face a lack of access to education and are susceptible to child marriage, high maternal death rates and HIV infection. The U.N. also spearheads the Girls' Education Initiative, a partnership of organizations that hope by 2015, children everywhere can complete free primary schooling. Partners in Health has worked in places such as Haiti, Rwanda, Malawi and Lesotho. They try to help all children, especially girls, receive the health care and social support needed to go to school. Wadley from ""Girl Rising"" benefits from Partners in Health's work in Haiti. Plan International USA tries to give girls around the world access to food, water, education, financial security and protection from sexual violence and exploitation. Yasmin, the girl in Egypt in ""Girl Rising,"" was part of a Plan International USA program helping to keep street girls safe. Room to Read focuses on helping young girls develop literacy skills and a habit of reading. Their hope is to create a legacy of gender-equal education in developing countries such as Nepal and Cambodia. Suma from ""Girl Rising"" had the chance to learn because of Room to Read. World Vision supports girls' education in many countries through many initiatives. Two of the girls in ""Girl Rising"" are World Vision-sponsored children: Ruksana from India and Azmera from Ethiopia. ""Education is truly a girl's best chance for a bright future,"" First Lady Michelle Obama said in her weekly address, ""not just for herself, but for her family and her nation.""

"As his plane made a rapid descent to normalize cabin pressure, a Southwest Airlines pilot went on the plane's loudspeaker and apparently told passengers the aircraft was going down. ""At first it sounded like someone was coming over the PA to talk. Then it sounded like shots through the cabin, twice, back to back,"" passenger Grace Stroud told CNN. ""Seconds later, the panicked captain said, 'We're in trouble; we're going down.'"" The flight attendants then began securing the bins, she told ""CNN Newsroom"" in a separate interview. One told the captain to deploy the oxygen masks. ""I'm sure everybody went through their private moments,"" Stroud said. ""My moment was, 'OK, so this is how I'm going to die,' and 'At least it will be quick.'"" Another passenger, Shelley Wills, told CNN affiliate WTVD that the pilot made the remarks as the plane went into a nosedive when it neared the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. ""He said, 'We're going down.' And everyone is looking around like, 'Is this a joke? Is he serious?' And then you felt the nosedive."" Soon after, the Boeing 737 leveled out and made an emergency landing at the Raleigh airport. Pilot's deadly in-flight heart attack threatens flight . Asked about the WTVD report, a Southwest spokeswoman said it was inaccurate. ""Our pilot said he was descending to 10,000 feet. The report was not accurate from this customer. We landed safely,"" spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger told CNN. But in an e-mail the airline sent Stroud, it acknowledged what Stroud suspected may have happened. ""As the captain was communicating his plan with the flight attendants, he inadvertently activated the PA system in the cabin,"" the e-mail said. ""We sincerely regret any confusion caused by the relay of the information."" Passenger lands plane after pilot falls ill . Southwest Airlines Flight 3426 had taken off from Tampa, Florida, and was headed to Raleigh. As it approached its destination, the pilot noticed a loss of cabin pressure -- prompting him to make a earlier-than-usual descent. ""As the checklist mandates when there is a pressurization issue, our captain did communicate with flight attendants over the PA that he was initiating a descent to a lower altitude,"" Eichinger said. ""The issue resolved itself, which is also not uncommon, and the aircraft landed normally at Raleigh-Durham."" Photos: Amazing airplanes crashes with no loss of life . For her part, Stroud said, ""I know what I heard."" She said she talked to others seated around her, and they all agreed  they heard the pilot say the same thing. The FAA says it is investigating the incident. For the ""uneasy feelings"" the experience may have caused her, Stroud was offered a voucher good toward a future flight.

"(CNN) -- The buildup of separatist forces in Donetsk, Ukraine, and Moscow's patently confrontational tone are raising the specter of another offensive in eastern Ukraine before winter grips the region. On Wednesday, NATO warned that ""columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops"" had been spotted entering Ukraine. Is this crisis about to flare up again, just two months after Russia withdrew its forces? Given the strategic costs, it might seem unlikely that Russia would reignite this war, especially with winter looming. Yet both the opportunity and the motivation appear to be there in Moscow. The invasion of Ukraine and confrontation with the West have whipped up nationalist sentiment, but Russia has run out of foreign policy victories to feed to the fire. That might explain why Moscow is aggravating NATO with airspace violations and playing alleged underwater games with Sweden, moves that appear aimed at keeping the Russian public in a confrontational mood. Russia plans bomber flights over Gulf of Mexico . The problem for Russian President Vladimir Putin is that none of this is likely to sustain his astronomical approval ratings or keep economic woes from chipping away at public support for the Ukrainian adventure. Another motivating factor could be that pro-Russian separatists simply do not control enough of the Donbass, the populous region that includes Donetsk, to have made this conflict worthwhile for Russia. The territory controlled by them looks awfully small in comparison to lofty talk of re-establishing a grand Novorossiya, and the ceasefire line of control left many separatist home cities under Ukrainian control, so the separatists seem keen to fight for the rest. All this means that the current line of control looks more like a stopping point than the desirable outlines of a frozen conflict for Russia. Of course, for Moscow's policy aims, the smarter approach would be to keep Ukraine in a permanent state of crisis and use this foothold to maintain pressure on Kiev. However, domestic political considerations and the militarily advantageous position of pro-Russian separatists are themselves compelling arguments for a surprise winter offensive. Why should Putin put off until tomorrow the parts of Ukraine that he can conquer today? Russian provocations: A new Cold War? The separatist force now numbers anywhere between 20,000 and 25,000, half of whom are likely locals, with the other half composed of Russian volunteers and fighting groups from the North Caucasus, particularly Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Chechnya. Many of the fighters from the Caucasus will go home for the winter if there is nothing for them to do in Ukraine. This suggests that the ideal time to use them in a bid to gain more territory is now, rather than trying to regroup these fighters next year for another season of conflict. Russia, for its part, used the ceasefire to drastically increase the separatist stores of equipment and ammunition. Convoys arrive regularly bringing munitions. Meanwhile a good deal of captured Ukrainian armor is being restored by the separatists themselves inside repair facilities they control. Conversely, Ukraine's army is in a period of consolidation and has lost a large portion of its best equipment, perhaps 60% according to President Petro Poroshenko. The country just fired its third defense minister. Volunteer battalions, the country's most motivated force, are in a period of reorganization. And since the signing of the ceasefire, Ukraine has lost many of its best soldiers inside the meat grinder that Donetsk airport has become. One of the primary constraints on Moscow in this shadowy war has been the lack of public support for Russian casualties in Ukraine. It meant any invasion would have to be brief, decisive, and with few losses in order to be tolerable at home. If the separatists are sufficiently armed, trained and supported that they can seize territory without the need for Russian regulars, then there is much less for Moscow to risk. Still, seizing more territory would come at great cost elsewhere for Moscow. Russia's economy is badly creaking from the drop in oil prices. Meanwhile, the central bank is failing to contain inflation, while the government has to find a way to roll over billions in corporate debt for companies that no longer have access to the Western financial system due to sanctions. Another military intervention by Moscow would probably result in further Western sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy, meaning Putin could lose any hope of driving a wedge between Europeans to reverse the current sanctions in place. Starting another campaign in Ukraine would mean a new spiral of unpredictable events -- yet Moscow's calculations might be based on a different reading of the situation. For a start, sanctions are not the source of Russia's economic woes, but more a humiliating annoyance. In the winter, Russia has a comparative advantage in economic reprisals, because it can threaten gas cutoffs to Europe in retaliation for new sanctions. Ukraine's energy dependence and broken economy, along with relatively weak Western promises of financial aid, suggest that Kiev would have to sue for peace no matter what Moscow does. And what does Russia gain from maintaining the peace anyway? It will not raise the price of oil or stop ruble speculation, and the United States does not appear keen to start rolling back sanctions, even though it genuinely needs Russian cooperation on Iran, Syria, and ISIS in the Middle East. Now that Republicans have regained control of the U.S. Senate, Russia knows there is little it can practically do to lift the sanctions anyway. Illegitimate elections in the separatist regions and the massing of Russian forces only reinforce the impression that Moscow has no interest in implementing the Minsk agreement or in reconciliation with the West. And while it is true that a renewed quest to widen separatist-held territory would be a reckless adventure, fraught with costs for everyone involved, reckless foreign policy risk seems to be the new normal in Russia. Now a winter offensive is far from unthinkable.","Moscow is striking a patently confrontational tone, says Michael Kofman .

"When does a romantic anniversary trip with your hubby to celebrate five years of marital bliss become an international kerfuffle, complete with calls for you to be prosecuted for treason? Well, when it's Cuba, where Americans are banned from traveling to for tourism, thanks to one of the most enduring embargoes in the history of mankind. Yesterday, Beyoncé stopped by ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and confessed the outcry over her and Jay Z's trip to Havana was ""quite shocking."" Welcome to the land of cray cray, Bey. Emotions run deep, high, and very bizarre when it comes to the subject of Cuba. When photos of the celebrity couple strolling Havana were released, a political tumult of epic proportions erupted in Florida. Sen. Marco Rubio and a small band of conservative Cuban-American politicos released a statement vociferously demanding an investigation of the trip by the president and the Treasury Department. One anti-Castro activist went as far as to threaten to file a petition against the celebrity couple to be formally prosecuted. Hova and Beyoncé's crime? Chilling in Havana. There's little doubt the collateral damage and suffering on both sides of the Florida Straits -- families divided, innocents killed, fortunes lost -- has been profound. But it's high time we stop the madness and bring sanity to this debate. For a long time, I've been of the opinion that the Cuban embargo policy in general is for Cubans on the island and the Diaspora to resolve. Those of us who have not suffered directly should stay out of it and let cubanos figure their way out of this mess. But, what happens when political views of a few trample on an entire nation? And, what are the ramifications when these opinions border on the irrational? The few but very influential pro-embargo lobby have put a stranglehold on a lucid discussion surrounding Cuba. Five decades of failed policy later, our nation is being held hostage unable to have a cogent discussion on anything Cuba-related. The U.S. embargo has not and will not work. Put in place in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy, the policy is stuck in a time warp that has nothing to do with modern-day reality. The most enduring embargo in modern day history is a remnant of a Cold War past when the Soviet Union was the enemy and the world was on the brink of nuclear war. The thinking was that financial sanctions, which included a ban on travel by American citizens, would collapse the island economy and force people to revolt against Fidel Castro. Over the years, these sanctions have been eased or toughened depending on political winds. In 1992, disgraced New Jersey Rep. Robert Torricelli was behind one the cruelest acts which banned, among many things, food and medicine sales to Cuba and prevented Cuban-American families from sending cash to their relatives. These were tough times and seeing many friends and families suffer because they couldn't visit their elderly mothers more than once every three years, or being prevented from sending them needed supplies, was very painful. Restrictions have eased under President Barack Obama but there is still a major ban. Enter Jay Z and Beyoncé. It's 2013 and we need to debate Cuban policy earnestly. Members of Congress must stop the cowardice around the issue and stop humoring the delusions of passionate folks stuck in the 1960s for political votes and favor. The pro-embargo folks are ignoring the policy's epic failure and fail to recognize that U.S. policy has played into the hands of the Castro brothers, who have sinisterly used it to make the case to their people that if Cuba is starving and the island economy can't grow, it's because of this U.S. policy. In 1995, I won an Emmy for producing a show that explored the Cuban embargo. What was special about the program, ""Embargo Contra Cuba,"" was that it gave an opportunity for the many different opinions in the Cuban debate to be heard.  The voices of everyday Cuban families caught in the quagmire of policies that make their family members the ""enemy"" were allowed to surface. These are the folks -- cubanos to the core -- who will tell you, if they had a mic and a safe forum, that the current U.S. policy is stupid. We hardly hear from these normal cubanos and for that matter, other average Americans on this issue. That void is tragic. Cuba policy is steeped in dysfunction on both sides. Last week, the State Department denied Fidel Castro's niece Mariela Castro a visa to travel to Philadelphia to receive an award for her gay activism, no reason given. A State Department official said visa applications are confidential. Fifty-one years into the policy, another Castro is in power and the island is still communist. The U.S. still trades with communist China despite its human rights violations. The U.S. still trades with communist Vietnam. We, the hip-hop generation, see right through the political hypocrisy and we want change. There are some bright lights in Congress giving hope. U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor held a news conference after visiting Cuba on a three-day fact-finding trip recently. The Tampa Democrat announced that she found the island has made economic reforms and called for the United States to promote these positive changes. Castor is part of a new group of audacious politicians, some from Florida, who are pushing to normalize relations and bring constructive dialogue with Cuba. Obama stands to make history by using his pulpit to encourage a more sensible dialogue around a Cuba policy that has been futile. I doubt that he'll step into this issue willingly. It will take gigantic political cojones to do so and on Cuba, sadly, the president hasn't expressed a willingness to ""go there."" The best hope for sanity rests on the voices of reasonable Americans and Cuban-Americans to demand change. Real democratic progress in Cuba will happen when the gates of travel are opened. You want democratic transformation in Cuba? There's nothing more compelling than a bunch of celebrities sporting Prada bags in one hand and smoking puros in the other to inspire revolutions of capitalistic proportions.","Beyoncé stopped by GMA and said the reaction to their trip to Cuba was ""quite shocking""

"When Chris Reynolds opened his June PayPal e-mail statement, something was off. The Pennsylvania PR executive's account balance had swelled to a whopping $92,233,720,368,547,800. That's $92 QUADRILLION (and change). Money that would make Reynolds -- who also sells auto parts on eBay in his spare time -- the richest man in the world by a long shot. Rich, as in more than a million times richer than Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim. And he's worth $67 billion. Oh, if only. ""It's a curious thing. I don't know, maybe someone was having fun,"" Reynolds said. So he logged online, and reality bit back. His account balance read $0. The correct amount. PayPal admitted the error and offered to donate an unspecified amount of money to a cause of Reynolds' choice. ""This is obviously an error and we appreciate that Mr. Reynolds understood this was the case,"" PayPal said in a statement. Before this incident, the most Reynolds ever made on PayPal was ""a little over $1,000"" selling a set of vintage BMW tires on eBay. So what would the would-be quadrillionaire have done with all that cash?

"He's a Grammy-winning musician, with a band that's brought in hundreds of millions of dollars from touring, and to cap it off, his latest release, ""Away From the World,"" just topped the Billboard album charts. But Dave Matthews was still frightened when it came to showing his art in a professional New York exhibit. ""I've always drawn and painted, but as my own thing,"" the musician said. ""I've never done anything as ambitious as this."" The result of the singer's ambition is ""Itica Pritica"" (the ""C"" sounds like a ""K""), an exhibition of more than 20 silk-screened works by Matthews and close friend Beezy Bailey at the Robert Miller Gallery in Chelsea. ""I'm very afraid of things like this,"" Matthews said. ""For years, Beezy has said, 'Come on, let's do something together.' "" A fellow South African, Bailey knew just what to say to get Matthews over his fears and into the gallery. "" 'No one's ever died making a painting,' I told him,"" recalled Bailey, an artist with more than 30 years' experience. The paintings, on display until April 13, may have taken only two weeks to complete, but they reveal some of the singer's personal feelings to the world, according to Matthews. He says his favorite piece, covered with meticulous etchings, displays his compulsive side while other works show his hatred for the poaching of the African rhino. The art is not all serious. Like classic Matthews lyrics, there are works celebrating the idea of ""Eat, drink and be merry."" The ""fat man,"" an alter ego for Bailey, appears as an explorer in many of the pieces. ""I just can't get enough of him. I can't. When we did anything, I'd say, 'Let's put the fat man on it,' "" Matthews said. ""I won't apologize for the fat man. I won't apologize for the fact that we used him so much. He's glorious."" Matthews said getting over this first artistic hump might open the floodgates for more art shows. ""Of the points in my life that I'll look back on as monumental to me, this will definitely be one,"" he said. The famous singer might be OK with his mug all over TV and film, but he apparently is a bit apprehensive when it comes to his face on his art. One piece has his face plastered more than 20 times throughout. The work sIts sequestered in the back, and Matthews joked about it coming to an untimely end. ""I hate it,"" he said. ""If there's a fire in the building, leave that s**t in!""","Dave Matthews says he was nervous about displaying his art in a New York exhibit .

"(CNN) -- President Obama and his family are hoping for a chance to unwind during their weeklong getaway to Martha's Vineyard. The Obamas arrive at Martha's Vineyard on Sunday. The first family, along with Obama's sister Maya Soetoro-Ng and the first dog Bo, arrived on the Massachusetts island Sunday. The Obamas are staying at a secluded 28-acre private estate. The No. 1 priority on Obama's vacation agenda is ""To get a little break,"" White House spokesman Bill Burton said Monday. ""He certainly appreciates the hospitality of the folks who are here. But his desire here is to relax and spend time with the family."" The president squeezed in a workout and some tennis with wife Michelle before hitting the golf course Monday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina; Robert Wolf, the chief executive of UBS; and White House aide Marvin Nicholson were expected to join the president on the links, although reporters following the game didn't see Clyburn. Close friend Eric Whitaker, however, was spotted on the course. The president waved to the crowd that had gathered to watch him tee off, and a little boy was heard yelling, ""Hi, Obama!"" On Sunday, Obama dined with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and her daughter. Burton shot down rumors that the president has plans to golf with Tiger Woods this week, telling reporters that ""nothing like that is on the schedule."" Burton also said there are no plans for Obama to visit the ailing Sen. Ted Kennedy, who is just across the Nantucket Sound on Cape Cod. In addition to spending time with family and playing golf, Obama's hopes to hit the books, Burton said. The president's reading list includes five books: ""The Way Home"" by George Pelecanos, ""Hot, Flat, and Crowded"" by Thomas Friedman, ""Lush Life"" by Richard Price, ""Plainsong"" by Kent Haruf and ""John Adams"" by David McCullough. In all, the books on Obama's list total around 2,300 pages, meaning the president would have to read close to 300 pages each day to polish off the list. As for the rest of the week, Burton offered few details, saying the president himself doesn't even have a particular schedule. ""He's on vacation, so everything is a little bit loose,"" he said. ""You wake up, you have some breakfast, you workout and then you decide 'What do I feel like doing today?' He's doing that just like anybody else."" The president will be getting a daily briefing. A member of the national security staff is on the island, and Obama also will receive briefings by paper. If necessary, he'll have teleconferences with his advisers in Washington, Burton said. Obama's first vacation since taking office comes as voters across the country are jumping in on the emotionally charged debate over health care reform. Burton said the president will talk to his advisers about the issue as needed, but has a lot of faith in his team working at the White House. ""So the president thinks that there is still a real possibility of getting a bipartisan plan through. He's going to continue to work towards that end,"" Burton said. While there are no calls on the schedule, Burton said the president might make calls to individual members of Congress on health care ""as appropriate."" En route to Martha's Vineyard on Sunday, Burton offered two instructions from Obama to the reporters who are also on the island. ""He wants you to relax and have a good time. Take some walks on the beaches. Nobody is looking to make any news, so he's hoping that you guys can enjoy Martha's Vineyard while we're there. ""And the second thing I'll say is, of course, the first family would very much appreciate if you respect the privacy of the girls while they're out here on vacation,"" Burton said.","Obama spends first full day of vacation golfing, playing tennis with wife Michelle .

"(CNN)The stabbings of two people at a Detroit-area bus stop began with what police said was a simple question: Are you Muslim? Terrence Lavaron Thomas, 39, was arraigned Tuesday on assault with intent to murder, drug possession and weapons charges in the Saturday night bus shelter stabbings in Southfield, Michigan. One of the victims, a male in his 50s, was stabbed five times in the face and neck and three times in the upper back, Southfield Police Chief Eric Hawkins said. The other victim, also a man in his 50s, was stabbed in the hand when he tried to intervene in the assault. The two men, whose injuries were not life threatening, were treated for their injuries and released, police said. The three men did not know one another. Hawkins said Thomas asked a group of people waiting for a bus whether they were Muslim. When two people responded that they were not, Hawkins said, Thomas allegedly ""became upset by that answer, saying he was Muslim and it was not acceptable that they were not."" The Federal Bureau of Investigation was involved in the investigation of possible hate crimes, Hawkins said. At court Tuesday, Bond for Thomas was set at $1 million. His next court appearance is on March 4. It was unclear whether Thomas has an attorney.","Stabbings at Detroit-area bus stop are being investigated as possible hate crimes .

"The recent decision by Yahoo's chief executive to drop the company's work from home policy makes sense, doesn't it? Plenty or people believe that if you aren't in the office, you aren't working; if you aren't clocking face time with bosses and co-workers, you aren't fully committed, and long hours are the measure of productivity.  Right? Not exactly. Organizational sociologists call these beliefs ""rational myths,"" convictions about how things should be done that are widely shared but not necessarily accurate.  Back when work revolved around the power loom and the assembly line, centralized schedules and locations made sense.  The 40-hour work week, time-oriented management practices, and our beliefs about them, became institutionalized during this period. But a lot of what we believe about the right kind of workplace is wrong.  Studies show that people who have control over when and where they work are more productive and have better morale and loyalty. And face-to-face office interactions have a dark side. A Harvard study of software engineers found that emphasizing face time encouraged managers to arbitrarily label problems as crises and then evaluate workers on whether they put in long hours in response. Inefficiency got worse when workers knew management was evaluating only time, not results --  they put in lots of hours, but got little done. Managers who replaced the clock-watching culture with more rational planning increased productivity, reduced stress and shifted efforts toward collectively getting work done. Simplify your life: Telecommuting isn't just for parents . But what about the collaborations and creativity from water-cooler conversations? These conversations actually may encourage groupthink rather than innovation.  Studies show that people tend to network, cooperate  and collaborate with others like themselves, so hallway conversations may merely result in interactions among those who think alike.  It's the collaboration among diverse groups of people that fosters the most creative and cutting-edge thinking.  Because virtual interactions through online chats and teleconferencing make personal similarities less obvious, these may be better than hallway conversations for cultivating innovation. Equating face time with productivity also has gender implications.  First, men are more likely to have supportive partners managing home and family, and therefore have more time to spend in the physical workplace. Not so for women, who are more likely to have employed partners, or no partners to help shoulder responsibilities at home. It is no accident that institutionalized work schedules favor workers in traditional family relationships; the 40-hour workweek was a historical bargain between employers and labor for a family wage sufficient to support a male breadwinner and a homemaker spouse.  But only about 20% of families fit that model anymore, and most of those are headed by men. Focusing on face time can disadvantage women, especially mothers, in other ways.  A Stanford study found that mothers were permitted fewer absences than fathers, even when their productivity and performance were the same.  Similarly, a study of large-firm lawyers found that hours worked both in and out of the office positively affected men's chances for partnership, but hours worked out of the office did not help women make partner:  Only face time mattered for women. Who works from home and how they do it . Why do we cling to the face time fallacy? The real problem is that our cultural beliefs about workplace practices lag behind technological and other changes in the workplace.  They get in the way of finding new management techniques for the virtual workplace.  Perhaps Marissa Mayer of Yahoo bought into the idea that face time means productivity because it seemed like a legitimate way to show she meant business. But if recent reports that she monitors her employees' remote data connections are accurate, she could have fired the slackers who failed to log in rather than demanding that all workers get back to the office. Other companies promote innovation without requiring face time:  3M rewards employees who come up with innovative ideas, Google encourages interactions across departmental divides without eliminating telecommuting altogether, and companies like Suntell and Gap Inc. evaluate their employees on performance, not presence. Yahoo's new policy may drive workers with family responsibilities, disproportionately women, to quit, leaving it more male, young and childless. With less diversity, innovation will suffer. This explains the other, vociferous reaction to Yahoo's policy change:  surprised dismay.  By allowing employees to work outside the office, Yahoo and its competitors revealed a new way to work that improves productivity, diversity and morale.   In our view, the outcry at Yahoo's retrenchment shows the destabilization of the rational myth of face time. The shifting culture and reality of work reveals what else might be possible—and better—for workers and for employers.","Shelley Correll, Catherine Albiston: Work in office more productive, right? Wrong .
They say studies show those who can control where they work are more productive .
They say men who worked in and out of office more likely to make partner than women .

"A newly published U.S. Army regulation said until Friday that a service member could be referred to as a ""Negro"" when describing ""black or African American"" personnel. The Army confirmed Wednesday the language was contained in the October 22 ""Army Command Policy,"" known as regulation AR 600-20. The regulation is periodically updated but the Army could not say how recently the word was added to the document. In a lengthy section of the document describing ""race and ethnic code definitions,"" the regulation stated under the category ""Black or African American"" that would include, ""A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used in addition to ""Black"" or ""African American."" The U.S. Army changed the regulation Friday and issued an apology ""to anyone we offended."" The new policy states that ""Black or African-American"" are the only acceptable terms. The Army, along with the rest of the military, collects extensive demographic data on the makeup of the military force for issues such as equal opportunity and ensuring discrimination does not take place. One Army official familiar with the document said it's possible the word was added so when forms are filled out, a black or African-American person could ""self report"" and choose to identify themselves as a Negro. But a military officer specializing in personnel issues for the Defense Department called that ""the dumbest thing I have ever heard,"" noting the Pentagon does not use the word in any of its extensive collection of demographic data. Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt, an Army spokesman, said the use of the word comes from an outdated section. ""The racial definitions in AR600-20 para. 6-2 are outdated, currently under review, and will be updated shortly,"" he said on Wednesday. ""The Army takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race, color, religion, gender and national origin.""","Regulation says ""Negro"" OK to describe ""black or African American""

"Fancy a stroll around the observation deck of the tallest building in the world? Normally, doing so would involve a flight to Dubai, an expensive hotel room and a struggle through traffic under blazing sunshine. But now you can take it all in from the comfort of your own living room. Google has launched a new project capturing a 360-degree view of the iconic Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- a building so enormous it is sometimes referred to as the ""vertical city."" The images taken by Google allow users to navigate through the building, using Street View technology, which the company generally uses to map cities. Users can explore the structure from the opulent basement entrance hall to the highest occupied apartment in the world on the building's 163rd floor. To compile the images, Google's photographers used state of the art equipment and battled 40 mph winds at the top of the building's spire, 828 meters (2,716 feet) above ground level. The pictures will be the first time Street View has been used in the Middle East, and the first collection of images to feature a skyscraper. The Burj Khalifa is the tallest man-made structure in the world. Modeled on principles of classical Islamic architecture. The building took six years and more than 22 million man-hours to erect. The edifice's massive foundations required over 58,900 cubic yards of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes. Close to 26,000 glass panels, each individually hand-cut, were used in the exterior cladding -- equivalent to 17 soccer fields of material. Google's Street View technology had to be specially adapted to document buildings such as this. The 360 degree cameras are mounted on a backpack which can be carried by a single operator. Other landmarks and natural wonders like the Eiffel Tower and Grand Canyon have also been captured by the technology.","Google captures world's tallest building Burj Khalifa with Street View .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- A day-by-day summary of significant events in Egypt's upheaval, as compiled by the CNN Wire: . TUESDAY, JANUARY 25 . As many as 20,000 protesters spill into the streets of Cairo in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage inspired in part by the Tunisian revolt. The official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reports three people dead and 49 wounded in clashes between protesters and police in Cairo and the port city of Suez. JANUARY 26 . Police use water cannons and tear gas against thousands of protesters who returned to the streets of Cairo and other cities. MENA reports at least 90 arrests in Cairo, while state-run Nile News reports at least 27 wounded in Suez. JANUARY 27 . Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency and a possible presidential candidate, returns to Egypt to join demonstrations. The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition bloc, calls on its supporters to join protests after Friday's weekly prayers. The government responds by arresting a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader and shutting down internet and text-messaging services. JANUARY 28 . Protesters battle police in Cairo, Suez and Alexandria to demand an end to Mubarak's rule. The headquarters of Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party is ransacked and set ablaze. Egyptian troops move onto the streets through clouds of black smoke and tear gas to enforce a curfew, the first time since 1985 that the army has been used to put down domestic unrest. JANUARY 29 . In a speech delivered shortly after midnight, Mubarak announces that he has sacked his Cabinet and acknowledges the ""legitimate demand"" for political and economic reforms. He names Omar Suleiman, his longtime intelligence chief, as vice president -- the first time he has filled that position since taking office in 1981. Protesters are not satisfied: Clashes continue around Cairo's Tahrir (Liberation) Square, and hospital officials in Alexandria tell CNN that at least 31 people have been killed there. In Washington, President Barack Obama says he has told Mubarak that he must take ""concrete steps"" to deliver on his pledge of reform. Britain, France and Germany issue a joint statement calling on Mubarak to begin a ""process of transformation,"" including free elections. JANUARY 30 . Egyptian warplanes and helicopters buzz over Tahrir Square in a show of force as thousands of demonstrators defy curfew orders. ElBaradei is met by cheering throngs who surround him as he arrives at the square, telling supporters, ""What we started can never be pushed back."" In a CNN interview, he calls on Mubarak to ""leave today and save the country."" JANUARY 31 . On the eve of a planned ""march of millions,"" Egypt's military command announces it won't open fire on peaceful protesters. Suleiman says the government has begun discussing reform with opposition parties, promising plans will be drawn up ""expeditiously."" Egyptian authorities shut down the country's rail network, post troops at key locations and pull the plug on mobile phone and internet service ahead of the next round of demonstrations. FEBRUARY 1 . Mubarak announces he will not seek a new term in September's elections, but plans to stay in the country and finish his current one. Protesters packed into Tahrir Square wave shoes in the air -- a deep insult in the Arab world -- and vow to continue their demonstrations until Mubarak quits outright. Clashes between pro- and anti-Mubarak demonstrators in Alexandria leave 12 injured. FEBRUARY 2 . Pro- and anti-Mubarak demonstrators battle each other with rocks, chunks of concrete and Molotov cocktails around Tahrir Square throughout the day as Egyptian troops stand by. Opposition protesters say the pro-Mubarak demonstrators include plainclothes police officers and government workers who are paid to take part. Government officials deny the allegation, but independent observers say the tactic is one Mubarak has routinely employed in the past. The pro-Mubarak demonstrators also attack several international journalists as state television portrays the unrest as a ""foreign conspiracy."" FEBRUARY 3 . As street battles continue around Tahrir Square, Egyptian authorities crack down on journalists and human rights activists bearing witness to the crisis. Several of the leading opposition parties say they won't hold talks with the government until the clashes end. Mubarak tells the American news network ABC that he was ""unhappy"" with the violence, adding he would step down right away -- but says his immediate resignation would plunge Egypt into further chaos. Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq apologizes for attacks on anti-government protesters and vows to punish those responsible, while Suleiman tells demonstrators, ""Finish up the strike. Your demands have been met."" FEBRUARY 4 . Undeterred by deadly clashes and government crackdowns, tens of thousands rally in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a largely peaceful mass rally. Their message to Mubarak: ""Leave."" In another plaza just half a kilometer away, supporters and foes of Mubarak fight running street battles. Youths wielding sticks and rocks engaged in fights and the sound of gunfire rang out. The opposition Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group officially banned by the government, says one of its offices was stormed by a ""gang of thugs."" The satellite news network Al-Jazeera reported a similar attack on its Cairo office. FEBRUARY 5 . Apparent fissures in Egypt's regime surface as key members of the embattled ruling party, including Mubarak's once heir-apparent son, give up their party leadership posts and the vice president begins talks with opposition leaders. The embattled Mubarak, however, remains in his position as head of the party's higher council and as head of state despite popular demands that he relinquish power immediately. The president's foes question whether the moves are meaningful or cosmetic. Demonstrators on the streets say Mubarak is just trying to appease the people.","Tuesday, January 25 brought first massive protest in Tahrir Square .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Men may rule the roost in AMC's hit drama ""Mad Men,"" but behind the guys are a group of women whose lives shape the award-winning story. Writers from the TV show ""Man Men"" pick up awards at the Writers Guild ceremony in February. A young woman sits in a bustling office, wringing her hands as she waits to confront her boss. Nerves palpable, she is readying herself to demand four walls in a company where all the women sit at open desks. ""I need my own office,"" she says when she gets 30 seconds of face time. ""It's hard to do business and be credible when I'm sharing with a Xerox machine. Freddy Rumsen's office has been vacant for some time. I think I should have it."" ""It's yours,"" her boss says matter-of-factly. ""Really?"" ""You young women are very aggressive."" ""Oh,"" she recoils a bit. ""I didn't mean to be impolite."" ""No, it's cute. There are 30 men out there who didn't have the balls to ask me."" So goes a typical scene in ""Mad Men,"" AMC's Emmy-winning mega-buzz drama about the inner workings at 1960s ad agency Sterling Cooper, which just began its third season. The exchange, from last season's penultimate episode, is between Peggy Olsen, an up-and-coming copywriter struggling to get ahead in a man's world, and Roger Sterling, a partner at the firm. True, the interaction is dated. You won't hear that kind of dialogue in today's workplace -- not unless the boss wants a lawsuit -- but Robin Veith, ""Mad Men's"" executive story editor, would argue it's less a product of the decade than viewers might think. ""The truth is that a lot of these moments that seem period and horrible for women come directly from experiences that I and the other women writers have had in our lifetimes,"" says Veith, one of seven female writers on the show's nine-person writing team. ""Like the [first season] episode 'Ladies Room' where Peggy goes into the bathroom and there are women crying. That came from [consulting producer] Maria Jacquemetton's life experience."" That's not the only office drama Jacquemetton says she's seen firsthand. ""Peggy assumed that Paul Kinsey in Season One wanted to talk to her and valued her opinion, and it turned out he really just wanted to date her. That's something that has certainly happened to several women on the staff, including myself, in our early days out [in Hollywood],"" she says. ""Men like women, and women want to be valued for more than just being attractive, and sometimes those things intersect. That's certainly not something that's decade-specific."" Oprah.com: How to speak up to get what you want . What is time-specific, Veith says, is the way the ulterior motives are communicated. ""There's more decorum about it now,"" she says. ""People have trained themselves to hide it better. I've worked in many offices, and that stuff still goes on. It's just not as blatant, and women have learned to draw lines a little more strongly."" Both writers are quick to point out that while gender biases still exist in the workplace, they don't exist in their workplace. In the ""Mad Men"" writers' room, a great idea is a great idea, they say, no matter who came up with it. ""We have a predominately female writing staff -- women from their early 20s to their 50s -- and plenty of female department heads and directors,"" Jacquemetton says. ""[Show creator] Matt Weiner and [executive producer] Scott Hornbacher hire people they believe in, based on their talent and their experience. 'Can you capture this world? Can you bring great storytelling?'"" Much of that storytelling revolves around the three main female characters: Betty Draper (wife of main character Don Draper), an unhappy suburban housewife who's just learned she's pregnant; Joan Holloway, the sultry Sterling Cooper office manager who's always dreamed of a husband and white picket fence but is suddenly having second thoughts; and Peggy, the would-be careerwoman quietly climbing the agency's ladder. Oprah.com: Behind the scenes with January Jones . All three seem to fit nicely into convenient 1960s boxes, but Jacquemetton says the fun is in showing the characters' true complexities. ""Those are labels that we, as society, place on these three women,"" she says. ""But we never talk about the characters in those terms in the writing room. Joan wants certain things, and we'll definitely discuss that she wants to move to the suburbs, she wants love. But they're people; they have different shadings. We don't think of them as, 'Okay, Joan's the sexy bombshell, so her storylines all have to be about using her sexuality to manipulate people.' We start with, 'This is a person who wants this...'"" It's all about staying true to the characters and the time period, Veith says, even when that means adding details that make the writers cringe -- say, putting a cigarette into the hands of an expectant mother. ""We always have to remind ourselves that we can't judge these characters. We try not to protect them,"" she says. ""Women did smoke back then while they were pregnant. They knew it was wrong on some level, but they didn't think it was that wrong. No one's going to chastise another woman for doing it. So while it's horrible for us to watch, it's important for us not to change it, because it happened."" Oprah.com: Why a writer should feel like he's over his head . While the ""Mad Men"" writers try to check gender at the door when they enter the writers' room, both Veith and Jacquemetton recognize that theirs is a highly unusual situation. According to a 2006 report from the Writer's Guild of America, women are under-represented on TV staffs 2 to 1. ""I don't think [having so many women] influences the way the female characters are written, but I think you have a larger pool of experiences to draw from,"" Jacquemetton says. ""If you have a predominantly male staff, it's their point of view of how a woman would react as opposed to the actual experience of being a woman."" ""Occasionally, we'll embarrass one of the guys by pulling the curtain back too far, and then they're shocked to see how the female mind operates at the basest level,"" Veith jokes. ""But we sort of delight it in, and that's when we know that we're possibly saying something new."" They claim that, when it comes to the job, being female is secondary. Still, when Jacquemetton mentions her anticipation of the upcoming season debut, you can't help but notice she chooses different words than her male counterpart might.

"Attorneys for the family of a 17-year-old student found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at a southern Georgia high school called on authorities Thursday to release surveillance video that they say could show what happened. Kendrick Johnson, they allege, was slain in January -- counter to authorities' conclusions that the three-sport athlete suffocated in the mat while reaching for a sneaker. ""There is one eyewitness that we know is available -- it is the video recordings made from surveillance cameras there in the gymnasium where the body was found,"" attorney Chevene B. King Jr. told reporters in Valdosta, Georgia. ""For some unknown reason, this tape has been withheld,"" he added. Gym mat death shocker: Body stuffed with newspaper . Attorney Benjamin Crump, who recently joined the case after representing the family of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, said that Johnson was ""murdered, and we intend to get to the truth of what happened."" Johnson was found dead at Lowndes County High School in Valdosta on January 11, his body resting headfirst in the rolled wrestling mat. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation autopsy found that he died from positional asphyxia, and the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office determined the death was accidental. But a second autopsy, which a private pathologist conducted at the request of Johnson's parents in June, found that he died because of ""unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma."" Teen's death not accidental, family's autopsy finds . The Lowndes County sheriff has declared the case closed, and the U.S. Justice Department said in September that it wouldn't open a civil rights investigation. But Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney for the district that includes Valdosta, is reviewing the case and weighing whether to open his own investigation. 'Getting to the facts' King acknowledged Thursday that Moore's office has surveillance material from the school and that he believes Moore is ""making every effort to establish what in fact the ... tapes may show."" Still, King said, he doesn't know whether Moore has all the relevant tapes, and he said his team should be permitted to see them -- which he said hasn't yet happened. ""I'm (awaiting) some word from (Moore) as to whether or not"" he'll release the tapes to the team, King said. Moore released a statement saying that ""this is about getting to the facts and the truth, and we want the Johnson family and the community of Valdosta to have confidence in the process."" ""I am cognizant of time, and we continue to move the process along,"" he said. King and Crump, watched by a few dozen supporters of Johnson's family, made their comments on what would have been Johnson's 18th birthday. Before the news conference, the supporters held signs calling for answers in the death, and chanted refrains like: ""No justice, no peace!"" Johnson's father, Kenneth Johnson, spoke briefly, asking authorities to give his son ""a good present today."" ""Give us the videotape,"" Kenneth Johnson said. Internal organs removed . The attorneys' plea also came after Johnson's parents told CNN this week that their son's body and skull had been stuffed with newspaper before burial. That discovery was made during the second autopsy in June. The private pathologist,  Dr. William R. Anderson with Forensic Dimensions in Florida, told CNN that every internal organ from the pelvis to the skull was gone when he opened up the teen's remains. ""We have been let down again,"" Kenneth Johnson told CNN. ""When we buried Kendrick, we thought we were burying Kendrick, not half of Kendrick."" During an autopsy, internal organs are generally removed and examined before being returned for burial. GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang told CNN that after the first autopsy, ""the organs were placed in Johnson's body, the body was closed, then the body was released to the funeral home."" The funeral home would not comment to CNN. But in a letter to the Johnsons' attorney, funeral home owner Antonio Harrington said his firm never received the teen's organs. Harrington wrote that the organs ""were destroyed through natural process"" due to the position of Kendrick Johnson's body when he died, and ""discarded by the prosector before the body was sent back to Valdosta."" A prosector dissects the body for pathological examination. King said Thursday that his team would take a close look at what happened to the body between the first autopsy and the burial.","Attorney: ""For some unknown reason, this tape has been withheld""

"South African newspapers published photos of President Jacob Zuma's home Friday in defiance of a verbal ban by the country's state security minister. ""No one, including those in the media, is allowed to take images and publicize images even pointing where the possible security breaches are,"" State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele said Thursday, warning the media not to publish footage of Zuma's home. In response, South African daily The Star splashed its front page Friday with a picture of the scenic home with the caption ""Look Away"" in bold across the top and a sub-headline that reads ""Even the White House has its own virtual tour."" Another popular local paper taunted authorities with the headline ""So arrest us,"" along with a snap of Zuma's sprawling estate in the town of Nkandla, southeast of the capital. Others took to microblogging site Twitter to express their outrage about what they say is a move to restrict free speech by the African National Congress government,  including journalist Barry Bateman, who tweeted the Google coordinates to the President's home and urged his followers to use the satellite imaging service to view it. The South African government denied issuing a gag order and accused local media of deceiving the public by misconstruing Cwele's comments. ""Government has no problem with the media publishing pictures of National Key Points, including President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla residence, as it is part of their daily line of duty. However, zooming into safety and security features of National Key Points is a challenge as it compromises national security,""  Government spokeswoman Phumla Williams said in a prepared statement. Members of the media lambasted the country's police and state security minister, accusing them of avoiding accountability for more than $19 million in renovations paid for by the public. ""We will continue to publish images of the Nkandla upgrades because we firmly believe there is immense public interest in doing so. To stop doing so will be a betrayal of our duty as watchdogs of democracy,"" the South African National Editors Forum, an organization of journalists, said in a prepared statement Friday. The controversy comes as Public Prosecutor Thuli Madonsela investigates the potential misuse of public money to fund Nkandla homestead upgrades, including a helipad and a bunker. ""The power to determine whether or not that power has been exercised in accordance with the law belongs to my office, other competent bodies, and ultimately the courts,"" Madonsela was quoted as saying by state-run news agency SAPA on Friday.","Newspapers show pictures of Zuma's estate in the town of Nkandla .

"Rescuers plucked stranded New Jersey residents from flooded neighborhoods, workers pumped water from swamped Manhattan tunnels and stunned homeowners dug through the wreckage of their houses Tuesday after Superstorm Sandy ripped into the Northeast. ""I've lived here for 39 years,"" Toms River, New Jersey, restaurateur Keith Paul told CNN. ""I've been through several hurricanes, going back to Gloria. And I've never seen anything like this at all."" Sandy struck land near Atlantic City, New Jersey, around high tide Monday night, whipping up a storm surge that ripped apart piers on the Jersey Shore and inundated subway and highway tunnels in New York. The U.S. death toll rose to at least 33 by late Tuesday, spanning the Eastern Seaboard from North Carolina to Connecticut, plus one in Canada. That's on top of the 67 fatalities inflicted in the Caribbean last week. ""I never thought I'd see what I saw today,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told reporters after spending the day reviewing the damage to his state. Photos: Aftermath of Superstorm Sandy . Recovery efforts were starting to take hold Tuesday night. The number of electric customers shivering without power fell to just under 6.9 million, down from nearly 8 million reported earlier in the day across 15 states and the District of Columbia. Two of the New York area's major airports, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty, were slated to reopen Wednesday with limited service. But thousands of people waited in shelters, not knowing whether their homes had survived. Salt water streamed down the concrete canyons of lower Manhattan as utility workers pumped out the passages that run beneath the city. And as if the water wasn't enough, the Queens neighborhood of Breezy Point lost scores of homes to an inferno that erupted at the height of the storm even as other houses within a few blocks were washed away. ""In all honesty, it looks like a war zone,"" Breezy Point resident Mike Long said. ""It looks like during the night, that fighter planes or bombers came through and just bombed the entire area. It just looks terrible."" Sandy's impact: State by state . Christie said about 1,000 people had been rescued Tuesday. But those efforts were scaled back at nightfall because of the hazards lurking in the dark, swirling water that lingered across much of the region. ""There's poles down, there's trees down across wires with transformers blowing up on the street,"" Paul said. ""You go out and walk around, it's dangerous, because if you hit a puddle and it's got electricity -- there's really not much you can do until things get cleaned up a little bit."" And in Newark, Mayor Cory Booker said authorities there were still struggling to get help to residents with medical problems. ""I've got high-rise buildings with seniors who might be dependent upon power and electricity for medical machines, people who have medicine that requires refrigeration,"" Booker said. ""We have to get to those people, have to get them secure, got to get them to hospital. We still have flooded areas. We still have a lot of challenges."" NYU hospital evacuates patients . Atlantic City, famed for its beaches, boardwalk and blackjack, became an extension of the ocean as seaweed and flotsam swirled in the knee-deep water covering downtown streets. But while the property damage there was ""pretty extensive,"" Mayor Lorenzo Langford said, ""I'm happy to report that the human damage, if you will, has been minimal."" One fatality had been reported in Atlantic City, Christie said Tuesday night. Parts of the boardwalk were washed out in the storm, Langford said, but the Atlantic City Alliance, which promotes tourism there, said the damage was limited to a residential area away from the district most tourists visit. Christie said seeing the damage left behind to the state's treasured beaches was ""overwhelming,"" to him ""as a kid born and raised in this state."" ""We will rebuild it. No question in my mind, we'll rebuild it,"" he said. ""But for those of us who are my age, it won't be the same. It will be different because many of the iconic things that made it what it was are now gone and washed in to the ocean."" Transit systems struggle to restart . Across the Hudson River, meanwhile, parts of New York could be without electric service for four days, Consolidated Edison President Kevin Burke told reporters. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said restoring power and mass transit were the biggest challenges facing officials in the days ahead. ""I'm happy to say it's the beginning of a process that we all know will take a while,"" Bloomberg said. ""But this is the end of the downside, and hopefully from here is going up."" Free but limited bus service was resumed Tuesday evening to take up some of the slack left behind by the crippled subway system, and the New York Stock Exchange was scheduled to resume trading Wednesday morning. Powerful Superstorm images flood social media . While the East Coast was still grappling with the scope of the disaster, federal officials warned that Sandy was an ongoing concern with the potential to inflict more pain on inland states. The storm was centered about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh and packing 45-mph winds Tuesday evening, bringing flood warnings to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and blizzard warnings to higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountains. ""The coastal impacts are certainly less today than they were last night, but the effects are not zero,"" National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb told reporters in a conference call. Forecasters predict the storm's center of circulation will be north of the Great Lakes by Wednesday. But coastal flooding in the 2- to 4-foot range could still occur ""in spots,"" while the potential for other floods stretched as far west as Lake Michigan, Knabb said. Superstorm Sandy's toll . The full scale of Sandy's wrath has yet to be determined. But according to a government prediction, the storm's wind damage alone could result in more than $7 billion. One estimate from Kinetic Analysis Corp., which conducts weather hazard assessments, said the storm's economic impact could be up to $25 billion. In Washington, President Barack Obama pledged the full support of the federal government for recovery efforts. He signed major disaster declarations for New Jersey and New York on Tuesday, clearing the way for federal aid to residents and to state and local authorities. ""My instructions to the federal agency has been, 'Do not figure out why we can't do something. I want you to figure out how we do something. I want you to cut through red tape. I want you to cut through bureaucracy.' There's no excuse for inaction at this point,"" Obama said during a visit to the headquarters of the American Red Cross. ""I want every agency to lean forward and to make sure that we are getting the resources where they need -- where they're needed as quickly as possible."" Waking up to floods, fires and darkness after Sandy . The storm's timing a week before the presidential election is tricky for Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Both candidates sought to balance the real threat of a killer storm against the need to squeeze out any last-minute advantages in battleground states ahead of next Tuesday's vote. Obama discarded campaign events in Florida and Virginia to return to Washington and address the storm from the White House. He was scheduled to travel to New Jersey on Wednesday and survey storm damage, the White House said. On Tuesday, Romney swapped campaign rallies for a relief event in Ohio. ""We have heavy hearts as you know with all the suffering going on in a major part of our country. A lot of people are hurting this morning,"" said Romney, adding that he had the chance to speak with some of the governors from the affected areas.

"He's serving a 28-year sentence for killing a Peruvian woman. He's also the main suspect in the disappearance of an American teenage girl.  But these days, Joran van der Sloot is more focused on his wedding plans than his legal situation. Maximo Altez, van der Sloot's Peruvian defense attorney, told CNN the 26-year-old Dutch national is getting married ""in late May or early June"" to a Peruvian woman he befriended in the prison in which he's being held in Lima, the capital. ""They met when she was visiting a relative in prison. They became friends and spent a lot of time together in his cell,"" Altez said.  ""Unlike The United States, here in Peru loved ones or relatives can see inmates inside their jails."" Leydi Carol Figueroa Uceda, 23, the bride-to-be, is expecting a baby boy fathered by van der Sloot, according to Altez. She's five months' pregnant. The accountant has a 2-year-old boy from a previous relationship. ""He's very happy about getting married. Since his girlfriend is pregnant, he wants his child to be born to a married couple and he's anxiously awaiting the day he can get married,"" Altez said. According to the defense attorney, the small, private wedding will be held in the prison's chapel. Van der Sloot is being held in the Piedras Gordas prison, located in Lima's Ancon district.  In January 2013, he was sentenced to 28 years behind bars after being convicted of murdering Stephany Flores in 2010. Flores was 21 when van der Sloot strangled and beat her to death in his hotel room only days after meeting her in Lima, according to prosecutors. They said during the trial he was upset because Flores had asked him about his alleged involvement in Natalee Holloway's disappearance. Holloway declared legally dead . Van der Sloot is scheduled to be released on June 10, 2038; but his attorney says the 28-year sentence can be reduced considerably ""for good behavior."" The inmate has long been considered the prime suspect in the disappearance of Holloway, an 18-year-old from Alabama.  She was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving a nightclub on the Caribbean island of Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. Holloway's body hasn't been found. Flores' murder happened exactly five years to the day Holloway disappeared. Peruvian media have raised the possibility that van der Sloot is getting married to avoid extradition to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament. But  Altez, his defense attorney, dismissed the suggestion that the wedding is a legal maneuver to avoid extradition, saying the wedding shouldn't be ""a big deal."" ""He's getting married because he's in love and is having a child.  There are no hidden agendas,"" Altez said. The inmate will be able to meet the baby after delivery. In compliance with Peruvian law, van der Sloot's attorney is publishing his client's intent to marry in newspapers across Peru on Thursday. Altez said his client is studying international business at Universidad Alas Peruanas through a prison program and is preparing for tests. Van der Sloot is teaching English to inmates. Peru agrees to extradite van der Sloot to U.S. ... in 24 years .","Joran van der Sloot plans to marry in a Peruvian prison .

"A trial over one of Latin America's darkest moments is under way in Argentina, where 25 defendants are accused of crimes against humanity for their alleged role in a 1970s campaign of repression and violence. Operation Condor was an organized campaign by the continent's right-wing governments to suppress and crush political opposition. On Tuesday, 25 former officials tied to the operation appeared in court for the first day of what officials say could be a trial of more than two years. The clandestine nature of Operation Condor means that its full extent may never be known, but researchers estimate that 50,000 were killed, 30,000 were ""disappeared"" and presumed killed, and 400,000 were jailed, according to The Center for Justice and Accountability. Chile under dictator Augusto Pinochet was central to the operation, which also included participation from Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay, the center says. Tuesday's trial is the first time for such a large number of defendants in the case to be tried together. The defendants are Argentinean except for one Uruguayan, former Maj. Juan Cordeiro Piacentini. Among the specific charges, 12 of the defendants, including former Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, are accused of 108 counts of human rights violations in several South American countries. Videla is already serving a life sentence for human rights abuses during his tenure. Another former Argentinian dictator, Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone, is among another group of defendants being charged with 35 specific cases of abuse under Operation Condor. Bignone also was previously convicted of human rights abuses in another trial and is serving a 25-year sentence. The trial is expected to last a minimum of two years and about 500 witnesses are expected to testify, the government's Center for Judicial Information said.","A major human rights trial is under way in Argentina .

"Tweet it and it may come true. In the world of travel, anyway. Sending under-appreciated scribes into a frenzy of ecstasy across the United States, Amtrak is launching an official residency program for writers on its long-distance routes. The best part? It's free. That minor earthquake you just felt was the rumble of several million freelancers scrambling for their computers. Writers are now able to submit applications to drop everything in their lives to focus on their writing while getting gratis rides on Amtrak's most scenic routes. All thanks to a playful tweet from a freelance writer. Brilliant move . It's the most positive wave of publicity Amtrak has had at least since Joe Biden's last railroad rhapsody. The residency ball began rolling when New York-based writer Jessica Gross tweeted a quote from Pen America's interview with novelist Alexander Chee. The writer said he'd written his novels on trains and enjoyed doing so. ""I wish Amtrak had residencies for writers,"" Chee said. Gross and a friend promptly tweeted the quote at Amtrak. In a shocking plot turn, Amtrak tweeted back: ""We'd need a test run. You two up for a trip to Chicago and back?"" The stunned Gross quickly agreed and Amtrak soon arranged a free writing trip for her from New York to Chicago and back. Writers nearly broke their keyboards with excitement once the news hit social media after Gross tweeted out about the ride at Amtrak's request. Who knew so many writers did their best work on trains? Or like free trips? The romance of rootlessness . The next amazing chapter unfolded when Alexander Chee announced his own Amtrak residency. Chee says he was ""blown away, absolutely amazed"" by the sensation inadvertently brought about by his interview. ""I'll be working on my third novel, using the residency as a chance to just live inside it for four days straight,"" Chee tells CNN. ""There's a mix of anonymity and rootlessness to being on a train that makes you feel you could be anyone, anywhere -- which turns out to be excellent ground for writing fiction."" Chee's residency is scheduled for May, and will take place on a train from New York to Portland, Oregon, changing trains in Chicago. ""One thing I've been moved by are the many stories I've since heard of, train trips that people have taken in order to just write, or even to think,"" says Chee. He says a friend wrote to say Gerard Mortier at the Paris Opera would take long-distance trains for the luxury of long, uninterrupted discussions on important matters. ""I think what happened was borne out of that, even as it's also reminded people this is a really easy, even very traditional way for them to just go off and write,"" Chee says. Back at Amtrak . Meanwhile, Amtrak's social media team has been busy. ""It's been an overwhelming reception, I don't think we could ever have anticipated how quickly so many people would respond to the idea of the program, and how liberally they're endorsing it,"" says Julia Quinn, Amtrak's director of social media. But for Amtrak, what's the upside of having writers clamoring for free rides? ""We're always looking for unique ways to expose different audiences to our product,"" says Quinn. Quinn says the reaction within the company ""is only positive"" and that news of the program has re-kindled nostalgia for train travel among people who might not have previously considered a trip by train. ""Now we have people saying that they are doing or want to do their own versions of the Amtrak residency,"" she says. ""There's something very romantic about train travel."" Program details . Amtrak unveiled the official application process on Saturday. Up to 24 writers will be chosen for residencies, which will only take place on undersold long-distance routes. Each residency will include accommodation on a sleeper car with all a writer really needs: a bed, a desk and outlets. Applications will be judged on a year-round basis by a panel of Amtrak executives and outside writers. Because travelers tend to book longer routes earlier, it's easier for Amtrak to predict which routes will have the vacancies they can grant to resident writers, says Quinn. Residents won't be obliged to write about or mention Amtrak in their work, nor will they be expected to turn in any writing to the company after their trips. Quinn says Amtrak has concluded that the organic social-media buzz created by the residency program provides enough of a return on investment. All residencies will take place over two-to-five days on 15 long-distance routes, and will be free. Creating a personalized #AmtrakResidency . As Amtrak was formalizing its residency application process, Quinn shared a few of the company's picks for best routes for writers to get cracking on the next great American novel. ""Someone writing about food could do the long-distance trip from Chicago to Memphis, via New Orleans, doing a huge foodie tour with a lot of little stops, for example,"" says Quinn. Brilliant suggestion. Here are three more writing-trips suggested by Amtrak and fleshed out by wistful editors stuck in offices. Empire Builder (Chicago to Portland/Seattle) From the train writers can ponder the Mississippi River and imagine sharing the same writing space as Midwest bard Garrison Keillor as they chug past the glowing night skyline of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The next morning, the stark North Dakota plains and Big Sky country in Montana provide an atmosphere suited to contemplative procrastination. From Spokane, Washington, writers can pick their bohemian finale by continuing to Seattle or head down the Columbia River Gorge to Portland, Oregon. In either end point, they'll be in their element, surrounded by freelance writers highly motivated for freebies. California Zephyr (Chicago to Emeryville/San Francisco) The California Zephyr plies one of the most beautiful train routes in North America. Crossing through the plains of Nebraska to Denver gives writers ample time to begin thinking about what a rough outline might eventually look like. Baby steps ... then happy hour! (Is Amtrak aware this is how writers work?) Climbing through the heart of the Rockies, and then the snow-capped Sierra Nevadas, may ennoble the stout of word, but the outstanding views might distract less self-disciplined writers. The rhythm of the rails is intoxicating, indeed, but beware, loquacious scribblers, for it also induces a state of somnambulant torpor from which even the combined forces of Webster, Roget, Strunk and White may not rescue you. Southwest Chief (Chicago to Los Angeles) The Chief rumbles across eight states, passing wheat fields, ranches, missions, pueblos, mountains, canyons and deserts. What scenery could be better to gaze at out a window while pondering future royalties and which outfit to wear for your first interview with Colbert?","Writers can now apply to an Amtrak writer residency, heading through their most scenic routes .
Each residency will include accommodation on a sleeper car with a bed, a desk and outlets .
Residencies will take place over two-to-five days on 15 long distance routes, and will be free ."
"The last few years haven't been kind to the private jet industry. A still-not-recovered global economy has meant a continued lull in the sales department, and many execs are wary of incurring the wrath of shareholders should they get caught cruising on a corporate jet. The market is starting to find its footing, however, thanks in part to the innovations of a few savvy companies, who are working together to make private aviation faster, cheaper and more accessible. According to WINGX Advance, a market intelligence provider for the aviation industry, the private jet industry (including fractional and whole ownership) was practically stagnant in the U.S. last year, and declined by nearly 4 percent in Europe. By comparison, the charter business is soaring. Adam Twidell, the founder of PrivateFly, an online booking service that has done for the private jet industry what Expedia and Priceline did for commercial flights, has seen a yearly threefold growth since he launched his company in 2007. While third-party booking sites have become standard in the field of commercial aviation, in the private jet industry, PrivateFly is an innovator. ""When I really started looking around online, I couldn't believe there wasn't a way to book a private jet,"" says Twidell. He recognized a gap in the market, and his wife and partner, Carol Cork, sold her house to help him start a new company that would fill the gap. Though Twidell jokes that his ""mother-in-law still isn't completely convinced it was a wise decision,"" PrivateFly has since become Europe's fastest growing aviation company. The advantage to customers, he notes, is that they can compare prices of over 2,500 aircraft, either through the website or on the PrivateFly mobile app. They can also book a jet at practically a moment's notice. ""Our record to get somebody airborne from having their request submitted is 40 minutes,"" he notes. Read more: Frequent flyer health tips . For the 700 operators that list their jets through the site, they can ensure their planes aren't sitting around, gathering dust and incurring parking fees. ""Essentially, it's a matchmaking exercise,"" says Twidell. Making the connection between supply and demand less obscure has also helped bring down the price of private jets. For example, if an operator has an ""empty leg,"" that is, they've flown someone one way and face a potentially empty cabin on the return flight, they can offer a discount for that leg of the journey. In this way, private flight has become more affordable, and more accessible, than ever before. PrivateFly isn't the only company to take advantage of the empty leg. U.S. charter company JetSuite posts several empty leg sales daily (they dub these ""SuiteDeals"") via Facebook and Twitter. These range from $499 to $1,499 for one leg of a journey on either a Phenom 100 (which seats up to four) or a CJ3 (which can seat six). That price is not per person; it's per aircraft. ""Some of those trips are silly, like Santa Monica to Van Nuys. But sometimes you can get an entire plane for $499 that flies from Los Angeles to New York, and you can split the price between four people,"" says JetSuite CEO Alex Wilcox. Granted, he notes, ""that's a rarity."" JetSuite's clients have to buy into a membership (and these start at $50,000), but they get considerably more bang for their buck. The number of flight hours they use is subtracted from the total, and JetSuite says they charge half of what their competition might charge, around $3,000. ""A lot of our competitors are still caught up in the 1980s, when private jets were all about champagne and caviar. We don't serve food on board; we're just a time machine,"" says Wilcox, who was also a founding partner of JetBlue. Read more: Economy class goes gourmet . Aside from cutting food, JetSuite saves money by offering more transparency in booking. Customers, for instance, can choose to land in airports with lower taxi landing fees -- a savings that is reflected in their total bill. It also opts for lighter, less expensive planes. ""We have an efficiency model,"" says Wilcox. ""Not only does the Phelon 100 cost less, but it burns less gas. We're saving a ton of money on fuel and capital costs, and we pass those savings on."" Though their model may come across as rather austere for a luxury product, Wilcox notes it's more practical in the current climate. ""There's a stigma attached to a corporation having their own airplanes right now,"" he notes. ""So a lot of companies are looking for alternative solutions. For guys who are afraid to use airplanes because their shareholders won't like it, they use us."" JumpJet, a private jet service that launched last October, is hoping to bring the price of bookings down even further, so they're on par with first- and business-class commercial flights. The company is still in the process of gathering members and plans to launch its first flights in May. Like JetSuite, JumpJet is a membership program, with plans starting at $2,350 per month (these include 10 U.S. domestic round trip flights of up to 3.5 hours). Unlike JetSuites, JumpJet doesn't own any planes. Rather, they purchase charters and allow members to divide the cost. ""We're not one jet, one customer, which is a tradition for the industry,"" notes Will Ashcroft, JumpJet's CEO. Instead, JumpJet will try and pair members who are heading to the same place at the same time on a single flight. Read more: What women want: Hotels look to cater for more female business travelers . While not all JumpJet flights will be equivalent to a first-class ticket, for a long-haul flight, the prices can be about equivalent, especially when you take into account the time savings. ""Most people give up three to five hours a day flying commercial, and when you fly private you get this time back,"" says Ashcroft, referring to the hours saved avoiding security lines, bag checks and customs. ""Keeping that in mind, when you break down a coast-to-coast trip, it is $6,600 to fly JumpJet, versus $6,000 to fly first class with an airline. I'd take a private jet any day.""","Private jet sales were practically stagnant in the U.S. last year .
New charter businesses let customers compare prices and book flights on private jets .
The companies also help jet owners fill empty planes at lower prices .
Some service providers use membership fees and bring down prices of flights ."
"You do not want to talk to me on the phone. How do I know? Because I don't want to talk to you on the phone. Nothing personal, I just can't stand the thing. I find it intrusive and somehow presumptuous. It sounds off insolently whenever it chooses and expects me to drop whatever I'm doing and, well, engage. With others! When I absolutely must, I take the call, but I don't do a very good job of concealing my displeasure. A close family member once offered his opinion that I exhibit the phone manners of a goat, then promptly withdrew the charge — out of fairness to goats. So it was with profound relief that I embraced the arrival of e-mail and, later, texting. They meant a conversation I could control — utterly. I get to say exactly what I want exactly when I want to say it. It consumes no more time than I want it to and, to a much greater degree than is possible with a phone call, I get to decide if it takes place at all. That might make me misanthropic. It surely makes me a crank. But it doesn't make me unusual. (Read about the TIME Mobility Poll here.) The telephone call is a dying institution. The number of text messages sent monthly in the U.S. exploded from 14 billion in 2000 to 188 billion in 2010, according to a Pew Institute survey, and the trend shows no signs of abating. Not all of that growth has come out of the hide of old-fashioned phoning, but it is clearly taking a bite — particularly among the young. Americans ages 18-29 send and receive an average of nearly 88 text messages per day, compared to 17 phone calls. The numbers change as we get older, with the overall frequency of all communication declining, but even in the 65 and over group, daily texting still edges calling 4.7 to 3.8. In the TIME mobility poll, 32% of all respondents said they'd rather communicate by text than phone, even with people they know very well. This is truer still in the workplace, where communication is between colleagues who are often not friends at all. ""No more trying to find time to call and chit-chat,"" is how one poll respondent described the business appeal of texting over talking. The problem, of course, is what's lost when that chit-chat goes. Developmental psychologists studying the impact of texting worry especially about young people, not just because kids are such promiscuous users of the technology, but because their interpersonal skills — such as they are — have not yet fully formed. Most adults were fixed social quantities when they first got their hands on a text-capable mobile device, and while their ability to have a face-to-face conversation may have eroded in recent years, it's pretty well locked in. Not so with teens. As TIME has reported previously, MIT psychologist Sherry Turkle is one of the leading researchers looking into the effects of texting on interpersonal development. Turkle believes that having a conversation with another person teaches kids to, in effect, have a conversation with themselves — to think and reason and self-reflect. ""That particular skill is a bedrock of development,"" she told me. Turkle cites the texted apology — or what she calls ""saying 'I'm sorry' and hitting send"" — as a vivid example of what's lost when we type instead of speak. ""A full-scale apology means I know I've hurt you, I get to see that in your eyes,"" she says. ""You get to see that I'm uncomfortable, and with that, the compassion response kicks in. There are many steps and they're all bypassed when we text."" When the apology takes place over the phone rather than in person, the visual cues are lost, of course, but the voice — and the sense of hurt and contrition it can convey — is preserved. Part of the appeal of texting in these situations is that it's less painful — but the pain is the point. ""The complexity and messiness of human communication gets shortchanged,"" Turkle says. ""Those things are what lead to better relationships."" Habitual texters may not only cheat their existing relationships, they can also limit their ability to form future ones since they don't get to practice the art of interpreting nonverbal visual cues. There's a reason it's so easy to lie to small kids (""Santa really, truly did bring those presents"") and that's because they're functional illiterates when it comes to reading inflection and facial expressions. As with real reading, the ability to comprehend subtlety and complexity comes only with time and a lot of experience. If you don't adequately acquire those skills, moving out into the real world of real people can actually become quite scary. ""I talk to kids and they describe their fear of conversation,"" says Turkle. ""An 18-year-old I interviewed recently said, 'Someday, but certainly not now, I want to learn to have a conversation.'"" Adults are much less likely to be so conversation-phobic, but they do become conversation-avoidant — mostly because it's easier. Texting an obligatory birthday greeting means you don't have to fake an enthusiasm you're not really feeling. Texting a friend to see what time a party starts means you don't also have to ask ""How are you?"" and, worse, get an answer. The text message is clearly here to stay and even the most zealous phone partisans don't recommend avoiding it entirely. But mix it up some — maybe even throw in a little Skyping or Facetime so that when you finally do make a call you're actually seeing and interacting with another person. Too much texting, Turkle warns, amounts to a life of ""hiding in plain sight."" And the thing about hiding is, it keeps you entirely alone.","As texting use rises, the phone call is becoming a dying institution .

"Thousands of angry protesters poured into the streets of the Central African Republic's capital Friday. The target of their rage? Peacekeepers sent to protect them. Two people were fatally shot, according to the African Union-led peacekeeping force, known as MISCA, when peacekeepers opened fire as their base came under attack in Bangui. Tensions have been high in Bangui for months. But they erupted this week after an attack Wednesday on a church that killed at least 17 people, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Another 27 civilians were reportedly abducted by assailants and remain unaccounted for, the U.N. agency said. It said the church, Notre Dame de Fatima, was housing 9,000 internally displaced people at the time of the attack. They included some 2,050 people who had moved there only a week ago to escape trouble in nearby neighborhoods, the refugee agency said. Some of those killed and injured in the church attack were taken Wednesday evening to Bangui's Community Hospital, where medical personnel battled to save them. In the emergency room, a priest and a 15-year-old boy arrived as patients but did not survive. Other victims were driven straight to the morgue. Two children were among those killed, the refugee agency said. Burning tires, barricades . It's not clear who attacked the Church of Notre Dame de Fatima. But the Fatima area borders the unstable ""PK5"" neighborhood, where the last remaining group of Muslims in the capital live, trapped and under siege from Christian militia groups. According to witnesses, an armed group burst into the church Wednesday afternoon, shooting people in and around the area. Immediately afterward, angry young men responded to the attack by installing barricades around Bangui. Smoke rose as the youths burned tires, while Christian, or anti-balaka, militiaman moved through the city and sporadic gunfire rattled in the streets. A few hours later, on Thursday morning, a mosque in Bangui's La Kouanga area was destroyed in apparent retaliation for the church attack. The attackers ransacked the interior, removing carpets and breaking down the doors. It was one of the last mosques remaining outside the PK5 neighborhood. Local Christians had been protecting the mosque because it was being used by foreign Muslims, from Senegal and elsewhere, but that tolerance came to an abrupt end with the church attack. AU troops tried to remove the barricades Thursday, but tensions were high around the mosque. Hundreds also came out in the streets to protest against the international peacekeeping forces -- French troops and the MISCA forces -- whom they accuse of doing too little to protect the people. The unrest continued Friday. The International Red Cross described the situation in Bangui as ""fluid and somewhat chaotic."" Its teams on the ground have received reports of injured people in the demonstrations but are still assessing the number of casualties, it said. A town divided . People in Bangui are not alone in suffering the effects of brutal sectarian violence. And once again, the peacekeepers sent to protect the people are bearing the brunt of their anger. Until last week, Muslims and Christians co-existed peacefully Bambari, a town some 240 miles northeast of the capital. But all that changed when fighting broke out between Muslim youths and French peacekeepers outside the town. The young Muslim men, afraid that the peacekeepers would disarm the predominantly Muslim militia based in the town -- leaving them unable to fight off the advancing Christian militia -- took up arms. Some Muslim militia members then joined them. As the first shots and explosions rang out, terrified Christians and other non-Muslims took refuge in a dusty area between the town's cathedral and the diocesan headquarters. For three days, thousands took shelter from the clashes. Even as the fighting eased Sunday, most remained there, too scared to leave. Meanwhile, members of the Muslim community stayed in their neighborhoods, leaving the town of some 65,000 effectively segregated. The French peacekeepers have kept a distance outside town. The mostly Muslim militia once known as the Seleka changed its name this month to Republican Forces. Its leaders decided this month to make Bambari their headquarters to stave off the threat from anti-balaka rivals. ""We don't want dialogue with the anti-balaka,"" a spokesman for the rebels in Bambari said. ""The only thing that exists between us and the anti-balaka is cartridges,"" he added, slapping the barrel of his gun to emphasize his point. Spiral of violence . The country began its descent into chaos in March 2013 after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels ousted President Francois Bozize. The former Seleka group has since been forced from power, but Christian and Muslim militias have continued to battle for control. To counter attacks on Christian communities, the vigilante groups known as the anti-balaka, which translates to ""anti-machete,"" fought back. The ethnic violence prompts fears of another genocide like the one in Rwanda 20 years ago. According to the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the attack on the Church of Notre Dame de Fatima followed violence this week in which suspected anti-balaka elements killed three Muslim youths. Ban urged the transitional government, which took charge this year, to prevent further violence and hold those responsible to account. He also called on the peacekeeping forces to do all they can to support those efforts. The United Nations has promised as many as 10,000 military personnel by September 15, which may help expand peacekeeping operations.","Protesters rally in Central African Republic capital against international peacekeepers .

"An Israeli hospital is treating people wounded in Syria, where civil war has killed thousands and wounded thousands more. Ziv Medical Center in Safed, Israel,  ""cannot confirm"" whether the seven Syrians being treated are from the Syrian opposition or the military, said Dr. Oscar Embon, the hospital's director. ""We treat patients regardless of religion, race, nationality and give the best care we can provide,"" Embon said. The Syrians are under guard for their own protection, he said. Israeli doctors frequently treat people from groups with which Israel has tensions, or even is engaged in conflict. In November, CNN visited an Israeli hospital treating an Israeli child and a Palestinian child, both wounded in warfare between Israel and militants in Gaza. Ziv Medical Center treated soldiers and a Syrian pilot during the 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon, hospital officials said. It's unclear what will ultimately happen to the seven Syrians. After treatment at the hospital, they will be returned to the Israeli military, which brought them in for help, and they will need rehabilitation, Embon said. An Israeli military spokeswoman told CNN the Israel Defense Forces ""provided medical care to seven injured Syrians adjacent to the security fence between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights, and the wounded were transferred to an Israeli hospital for further treatment."" Embon said one of the seven patients is in severe condition in an intensive care unit. He was to undergo surgery Sunday. The other six have moderate injuries and had surgery Saturday night. Five have bone fractures in extremities; the sixth has a vascular injury. The six are in stable condition. Some will need further operations, Embon said. All will be at the hospital for at least a week; some will need to remain longer, Embon said. He did not know whether other Syrians will be brought for treatment. Ziv Medical Center is in northern Israel, close to the Syrian border. ""We are used to treating trauma patients,"" said Embon. ""There is a geographical and professional reason for that."" Many hospital employees speak Arabic, he added. Asked how the Syrians are responding to being treated in an Israeli hospital, Embon said only that their reaction ""is reasonable."" Last month, Israeli fighter jets struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, a senior U.S. official said. Israeli Defense MInister Ehud Barak did not explicitly confirm or deny such an attack, but called the event ""another proof that when we say something we mean it -- we say that we don't think that it should be allowable to bring advanced weapon systems into Lebanon."" Syria's government-run news agency SANA called Barak's statement ""an overt hint that the aggression came in implementation of the Israeli threats uttered lately under the pretext of targeting 'a weapons shipment.'"" The death toll in the Syrian war is probably approaching 70,000, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said last week. At least 61 ""martyrs"" were killed Sunday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Syria, which blames the violence on ""terrorists,"" said Sunday its military ""inflicted heavy losses"" on them. The United Nations and numerous countries, including the United States, have called on Syria to end its brutal crackdown on opposition fighters and called on all sides to halt the violence.","Israeli hospital is treating seven people injured in the civil war in Syria .

"Fifty people have been arrested in connection with this week's killing of a Christian couple who were beaten and pushed into a burning kiln in eastern Pakistan, a police official said Thursday. Investigators believe the 50 were part of a mob that killed the couple Tuesday after the pair were accused of desecrating the Quran, said Bin Yameen, a police official in the Kasur District in Punjab province. Police said the attack in the village of Kot Radha Kishan came after a local mullah declared the couple were guilty of blasphemy. The mob allegedly marched to the couple's home, broke down their door, dragged them outside, beat them and threw them into the brick kiln where they both worked. Police officials identified the woman as Shyman Bibi Urf Shamar, and her husband as Sajjad Nasir Zurjah Nazir Nasir. The village is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Lahore, the capital of Punjab. The province's government will pay the couple's family 5 million Pakistani rupees -- about $49,000 -- as compensation for their deaths, the province's chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif, said in a news release. The government also will give the family 10 acres of land, Sharif said. Desecration of the Quran is punishable by death or life imprisonment under Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law. Human rights groups have long urged the country to repeal the law, arguing that it has led to discrimination, persecution and murder. Woman takes blasphemy law to Pakistan's highest court . The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it sent a team to the village, and that the team ""did not come across any evidence of desecration of the Holy Quran."" The commission said that the couple had three young children -- two sons and a daughter -- and also indicated that the slain woman was pregnant. But a postmortem examination later revealed no evidence that she was pregnant, CNN affiliate GEO News reported. Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law often is used to settle personal vendettas, rights groups say, and people accused of the committing the crime are frequently targeted by mob violence. That, according to the HRCP, appeared to be the situation in Kot Radha Kishan, and that the incident stemmed with a dispute over money the kiln's owners said the couple owed them. An accusation that the couple had desecrated the Quran ""was spread to nearby villages and announcements (were) made through mosque loudspeakers,"" the HRCP said. The mob that went to the kiln was estimated at around 500 people, the rights group said, citing local police. The HRCP said its team learned that four policemen went to the kiln to demand that the couple be handed over for protection from the mob, but that the owners ""instructed their employees not to hand the couple over and the policemen were also beaten up."" The kiln's owners were among those arrested, the rights group said, quoting police.

"(CNN)Monday morning, February 9, was my last morning at the hospital; in just a few hours I would be headed for the airport. We held an appreciation program with breakfast for all the ELWA Hospital staff after our morning chapel gathering, to recognize those who had served so courageously during the worst of the Ebola crisis. Along with Dr. (Jerry) Brown, our medical director, I was asked to say a few words. As I spoke, thanking our nurses, midwives, aides and cleaners for coming to work during the toughest times in August, September and October, my mind went back to a meeting with health care planners from an international nongovernmental organization. They wanted to know: ""What allowed ELWA to remain open when other hospitals closed?"" The health system collapse was one of the greatest unanticipated consequences of the Ebola epidemic. It led to many deaths due to malaria or obstructed labor or pneumonia: illnesses that have nothing to do with Ebola, but which went untreated because hospitals and clinics were closed. ELWA Hospital was one of the bright spots, remaining open and caring for the sick through the most difficult months of the crisis. Also on Monday morning, we discharged little Noah (not his real name) from the hospital. Noah, a 5-week-old, had come in about 12 days earlier with severe vomiting. He couldn't keep anything down. He was hungry and was breastfeeding vigorously, but after every feeding he would vomit all of it up. He wasn't making dirty diapers any more. He had lost weight and become dehydrated. One of our doctors suggested he might have pyloric stenosis, a thickening of the muscle around the outlet of the stomach into the small intestine, which leads to blockage of the flow of nutrition. The best test for pyloric stenosis is an ultrasound exam, and I've developed reasonable ultrasound skills over many years of scanning and learning on the job. I went to the office and found our big two-volume ultrasound text, and read about pyloric stenosis. With the ultrasound machine, you can measure the thickness of the muscle in the pyloric canal (the outlet of the stomach) to confirm the diagnosis. As I scanned little Noah, one of my colleagues joked with me about doing the scan with the ultrasound in one hand and my textbook in the other. I told him this was not the first time I would be doing this, nor would it be the last. We got some clear images showing that little Noah did indeed have pyloric stenosis and would require surgery. God has blessed ELWA with some truly gifted staff. Brown, our medical director, is one of the few residency trained surgeons in the country. We also have some highly qualified anesthetists, one of whom is especially skilled handling infants.  So after coordinating the schedules of all the staff who were needed, the child had a successful operation about four days after admission. As we monitored Noah through his recovery, I realized we were one of only a few institutions in Liberia that could pull together the resources to successfully diagnose and operate on this little baby. After the surgery, little Noah improved quickly. He nursed voraciously and started gaining weight.  His mom and dad were so relieved. Finally, on my last day in the country, he would be going home! This takes me back to the question that was asked by the visiting international health care coordinators. After the reopening of the hospital on August 6, how did ELWA manage to stay open when other facilities were having repeated closures? As I see it, there are two reasons: the first is that our staff are mission driven. They are motivated by the example of Jesus Christ and his call to care for their neighbors who are in need; their belief in God is no mere intellectual assent or religious ritual, but real, where-the-rubber-meets-the-road faith that strengthened them to do this difficult and fearful work and leave the results to God. The second answer has to do with little Noah. When you put all the pieces of the puzzle together, you can accomplish so much more than any one of you could accomplish on your own. That synergy, the teamwork that results in the ability to give a couple back their baby, who surely would have died otherwise, makes the work so satisfying. This, too, can motivate people to come to work, when they know they are a critical piece of the puzzle that saves lives.","Liberia's hospital system collapsed during the Ebola epidemic .

"A motorist who shot and killed a man near the Maryland-Pennsylvania border in an apparent fit of road rage was being sought Wednesday.  Authorities believe the shooter might strike again. The victim, Timothy Davison, a 28-year-old resident of Maine, was driving home Saturday on Interstate 81 in Antrim Township in Pennsylvania when he dialed 911 to report that another motorist was chasing him and driving aggressively, police said. Moments later, Davison was shot dead. Investigators believe that the same motorist may have been behind another road-rage shooting eight hours earlier in the same area. No one was injured in that incident, when shots were fired at a car. ""The acts committed against Mr. Davison were random only to the point of his initial encounter with his assailant,"" the Pennsylvania state police said in a statement. ""Beyond that, the acts against him were very deliberate, calculated, and violent... The potential for additional incidents of similar nature is anticipated due to the violent nature of this incident."" James Allocca, Davison's uncle, told CNN that the family ""wants justice before someone else gets hurt."" The victim's father, Timothy Davison Sr., told CNN that he learned about his son's death when police arrived at his door on Saturday. ""I can't begin to tell you what it's like to hear that,"" he said. ""It's not right."" He went to Pennsylvania Tuesday to collect his son's personal belongings. His son, he said, was a ""great guy and a very easy kid to raise."" ""He cared for everyone around him,"" he said. ""He was a rugged kid, extremely sensitive."" Davison worked at his father's construction business. He said he hoped to meet his son's killer. Asked what he would say, Timothy Davison Sr. said: ""That is for me."" A task force that includes the Pennsylvania and Maryland state police as well as the FBI was investigating the two shootings over the weekend. ""While there are many similarities between the two; conclusive evidence definitively connecting the two has yet to be established,"" the state police statement said. ""Both investigations will be treated as being related until conclusive evidence proves otherwise."" Police said the shooter was driving a small truck similar to a Ford Ranger, and the vehicle would have panel damage from ramming Davison's vehicle. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 800-472-8477. ""There are different levels of loss,"" Allocca said. ""This has to be the worst.""

"Richard Biennestin was only 20 years old when he was shot and killed on April 13. Jessie Leon Jordan was 23. Sione Fakatoufifita was 19. Titania Mitchell was only 13. Of the nearly two dozen people reported killed that day, about half were under age 30. Sadly, this tally is not rare. According to the Children's Defense Fund, guns kill twice as many kids as cancer while Congress remains stalemated. A bill to pass gun reforms failed in the Senate on Wednesday. As CNN has reported, 13 young people between ages 10 and 24 are the victims of homicide every single day. Firearms account for 80% of those deaths. The toll gun violence is taking on young people was the inspiration for GunShowGallery.com, a collaboration between the Creative Action Network and my organization, Rebuild the Dream. More than 70 artists have submitted 111 poster designs against gun violence. Most of these artists are in their 20s. You do not have to agree with the message of each individual poster. Collectively, they represent the diverse voices of a generation desperate to stop the violence devastating its members. In poll after poll, large numbers of Americans age 18-30 support gun reform measures. It is worth listening to what the young people who submitted these posters are trying to say. Alyssa Winans, a 23-year-old from Providence, Rhode Island, submitted ""A Farewell to Arms."" She says people are desensitized to the violence. ""It is simply how it is, how it has always been. This is what guns are like."" She grew up outside Chicago and recalls one of her older sisters coming home from school in the city with terrifying news: ""My classmate got shot and they're dead."" It left a lasting impression on her. J.D. Reeves, 25, was around guns while growing up in rural Oklahoma. Guns were for hunting. They were not something bad or dangerous, simply a part of life. But a personal experience last spring led to his piece, ""End Gun Culture in America."" Reeves and his wife were considering going to watch the Oklahoma Thunder NBA playoffs game in Oklahoma City, but decided against it at the last minute. That night, gunfire broke out near the arena. Eight people were wounded. ""I always heard about shootings in cities but never felt a connection because I live in the country,"" Reeves says. ""That made it real. We could have been there. I have friends who were there. They have video of it on their phones."" Ryan Keller, from Iowa, sent in a piece called ""Dissolve the Targets."" Though he supports restrictions on guns, he has a big problem with violence in the media, especially the video game industry. Young people, he says, ""need to see that violence in general is absolutely horrific. They need to see humans as humans, not something you can kill and get 100 points."" Juana Medina lives in Washington, but grew up in war-torn Colombia. She recalls seeing people threatened and killed. Her aunt and uncle met while taking cover under a table at a restaurant during a gunfight. Her poster, ""Less Fear, More Kindness,"" aims to confront the culture of fear she saw in Colombia and sees today in cities around America. Can their posters make a dent in a debate dominated by the NRA's army of lobbyists? They think so. ""We live in a culture of short attention spans and high consumption,"" Medina says. ""As artists we create striking images that even if you see for only two or three seconds can change minds."" Max Slavkin co-founded the Creative Action Network with longtime friend Aaron Perry-Zucker. After Newtown, artists started asking what they could do to help. ""Older generations accept that this is how the game is played, the need to wait for Congress, that leaders can't go too far,"" Slavkin says. ""But younger people have seen failure after failure -- on the financial crisis, the environment and guns. We're too fired up to wait or sign petitions that we just haven't seen working."" Perry-Zucker, the creator of 2008's Design for Obama, believes that art and culture can simulate the kind of personal experience that gets people involved. ""Seeing one of these posters forces you to take a stance,"" he notes. ""You can't help but decide if you agree, or if you see it differently. And now you are more involved."" Or, as Allyssa Winans puts it, artists can pose a simple question: ""What if it wasn't like this?"" J.D. Reeves recalls a story in an Oklahoma paper about a known felon buying a firearm at a gun show while the local police stood by, helpless. ""If you're smart with guns and people are around guns they aren't necessarily bad. But seeing this story you realize something has to change for our safety as Americans."" Idealistic, yet practical.

"Two women shot to death by a man at an Elkhart, Indiana, grocery store may have known their attacker, police said Thursday. Police shot and killed Shawn Walter Bair, 22,  Wednesday to end the rampage at Martin's Super Market. Although state police said they do not believe the three knew one another, State Police Sgt. Trent Smith  told CNN on Thursday that investigators have received calls that Bair may have had some relationship to the two women. The nature of that relationship, if there was one, wasn't immediately clear. The women's names have not yet been released. According to Smith, Bair arrived at the store around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday armed with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a large hunting knife. He walked around for more than 30 minutes before opening fire, Smith said. About a dozen people were in the store at the time, Smith said. According to police, he shot two women -- a 20-year-old shopper and a 44-year-old employee -- before police arrived to find him holding a store manager at gunpoint. They managed to distract him, allowing the manager to run away. But Bair also escaped down a store aisle, resulting in a search through the store that lasted between 40 and 60 seconds before police confronted Bair, who then pointed his handgun at them, Smith said. He declined to say if Bair opened fire on police before he was shot but said he appeared to be agitated. Police found the women's bodies aisles apart inside the sprawling store. Tony Beltran told CNN affiliate WNDU that his mother was working at the store at the time of the shootings. ""She told me that she heard what sounded like gunshots, and everybody around her was telling her they heard gunshots,"" he told the station. ""Obviously, I was afraid. I said a quick prayer."" Two Elkhart City police officers shot the gunman to death when he turned his weapon on them, according to WNDU. Employees at the store knew Bair or had seen him before, Smith said.

"(CNN)When Drew Manning stepped out from behind the cardboard cutout of his former fat self on Monday, the audience of ""Good Morning America"" was appropriately shocked. The fitness trainer's journey had come to an end after successfully losing more than 70 pounds -- six months after he purposely gained the same amount. ""Like it never happened,"" host George Stephanopoulos said. ""Kind of,"" Manning said. Both Manning and his wife, Lynn, can attest that a lot actually has changed in the past year. While Manning's body may have returned to its six-pack heydays, his mind, in many ways, has not. Always a fitness junkie, staying in shape comes naturally for Manning. He's that guy at the gym the rest of us love to hate, the one who likes to use his biceps for pumping iron instead of changing channels, and who prefers sucking down a spinach shake to indulging in a brownie sundae. Because of that, Manning was a ""judgmental"" trainer, his wife says. ""He would look at someone who was overweight and say, 'They must really be lazy.' ""I was convinced people used genetics or similar excuses as a crutch,"" Manning writes in his new book, ""Fit2Fat2Fit."" ""You either wanted to be healthy or you didn't."" The link between fat and cancer . That point of view wasn't helping Manning help his clients. When he failed yet again to push someone over to the light side, he knew something was wrong. In order to better understand the struggles his clients were facing, he had to face them himself. He gave up the gym and started consuming junk food, fast food and soda. In just six months, he went from 193 pounds with a 34-inch waist to 265 pounds with a 48-inch waist. Lynn saw the difference in her husband in less time than that. He became lethargic, stopped helping around the house and was less than eager to play with their 2-year-old daughter. ""He was so insecure -- saying 'I'm so fat. I look so horrible,' constantly complaining about how he looks,"" she said. Manning says he didn't realize the effects of his weight gain would be more than physical. It altered his relationships and his self-confidence. Returning to the gym after the Fit2Fat portion of his journey made him nervous. The fact that he had to do push-ups on his knees was almost humiliating. ""The biggest thing [I learned] is that it's not just about the physical. It's not just about the meal plan and the workouts and those things. The key is the mental and the emotional issues. I realized those issues are real."" Of course, Manning had his critics. Experts said that his stunt was dangerous. His blood pressure and cholesterol shot up with such dramatic weight gain. But Manning has no regrets. The followers on his website have encouraged him with their own tales of weight loss. A fat girl gets naked . ""We see the success stories of people losing all this weight, but it's more common now,"" he says. ""To see someone do it in reverse on purpose -- it's mind blowing. A balance of craziness and inspiration."" Manning suffered through soda deprivation headaches and food cravings on his way back to fit. The journey was easier for him than for most, he'll admit, but he's eager now to provide tips for others to follow in his footsteps. Power walker loses 150 pounds . Lynn is just glad to have her husband back, maybe a bit better than he was before. Before Fit2Fat2Fit, the self-described foodie wife would make treats, and Manning wouldn't even look at them.

"A woman accused of driving a minivan into the Atlantic Ocean with her three children in Florida was arrested Friday on three counts of attempted first-degree murder, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said. Investigators say they think Ebony Wilkerson was trying to kill her children -- ages 3, 9 and 10 -- when she drove into the surf Tuesday in Daytona Beach, Johnson said. ""She actually told them to close their eyes and go to sleep, she was taking them to a better place,"" he said. Bystanders and beach rangers went into the water and rescued the children, witnesses and police said. Wilkerson tried to keep rescuers from pulling her children from the minivan and at one point was fighting her son for control of the steering wheel, Johnson said. Johnson said Wilkerson told investigators she was trying to drive out of the surf, not into it, and has denied trying to harm her children. Tim Tesseneer was driving along Daytona Beach on Tuesday with his wife when they noticed the minivan driving through shallow water. They heard the screams, he said, of two children, who were crying and waving for help out of one of the rear windows. Tesseneer threw the car in park and raced over to help. One child was screaming, Tesseneer recalled Wednesday to CNN's Piers Morgan. "" 'Please help us, our mom is trying to kill us.' "" The other child he could see was wrestling a woman for the steering wheel. But the woman just kept saying, "" 'We're OK. We're OK. We're OK,' "" as another man joined Tesseneer trying to get the driver to stop. With the minivan in the cold, heavy surf of the Atlantic, the second man, Stacy Robinson, opened a door and pulled out the two panicked children. There was a good chance if he and Tesseneer hadn't been there, the children, ages 10 and 9, would have drowned inside the van as it pitched in the water, officials said. Another child, a 3-year-old girl, was strapped in a car seat. A lifeguard dived in through a front window and unbuckled the child and handed her to another lifeguard as the vehicle bobbed in water about 3 feet deep. The mother just walked away, Tesseneer said, silent with a strange, almost ""possessed"" look on her face. While there is no evidence that drugs or alcohol were involved, Johnson said one goal of charging her was to make sure she gets help for any possible mental issues. ""This is a tragic event. And our goal is to get her into the system so that we can protect the children and take whatever action we need to help her, too,"" he said. Wilkerson also is being held on three counts of aggravated child abuse, Johnson said. She has not yet requested an attorney, he said.","""She actually told them to close their eyes and go to sleep,"" sheriff says .

"Four militants and three Russian security force members were killed Wednesday in a shootout in the Russian republic of Dagestan, Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported, citing anti-terror officials. The shootout came amid an anti-terror operation at a house in the Dagestan village of Karlanyurt, the officials told RIA Novosti. At least five officers were also injured in the shootout, the agency added. The confrontation, news of which spread first on Twitter, came as Russian security forces have tried to address security concerns before next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, about a 13-hour drive west of Karlanyurt. It also comes amid years of unrest and an Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region. Concerns about security in Russia were heightened after twin bombings on public transit that killed more than 30 people in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last month. Security tightened . With weeks to go until the games begin, a huge security operation has swung into gear around Sochi. A special exclusion zone went into force last week, under which only Sochi-marked vehicles, emergency transport or specially accredited intelligence service cars will be allowed into the wider Sochi area. Air traffic and sea access will be restricted, and everyone going into the zone will have to go through heavy security and identity checks. Russia is pouring huge resources into ensuring that the Games, seen as a flagship project of President Vladimir Putin, go off without incident. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Volgograd, but suspicion has fallen on Chechen separatist groups. A bitter battle for an independent Chechnya, lasting almost two decades, spawned an insurgency that has spilled into neighboring republics in the North Caucasus region, including Dagestan. Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Islamist Caucasus Emirate group, last summer called on his followers to do what they could to disrupt the Games. He says they will be held on the graves of Muslim occupants of Sochi, who he says were driven out by Russian imperial forces in the 19th century. Despite the shock waves from the Volgograd attack, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said he was confident that Russia would keep the Winter Olympics safe.","The clash occurred at a house in the Dagestan village of Karlanyurt, RIA Novosti reports .

"(CNN) -- Charles Barkley hasn't met a sensitive topic he couldn't dig into, and now he's speaking on what he calls a ""dirty, dark secret"" in the African-American community. During an interview with a Philadelphia radio station, Barkley expounded on claims that Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson wasn't liked by some of his teammates in part because he wasn't considered to be ""black enough."" Barkley said he wasn't at all surprised. ""There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success,"" Barkley said. ""It's best to knock a successful black person down 'cause they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful. It's crabs in a barrel. ... We're the only ethnic group that says, 'hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' "" The concept of ""crabs in a barrel"" isn't new, and it's universal. If you've ever seen a bucket of crabs at the market, the ones at the bottom will try to pull down the crabs that are closer to the top. ""I lived this, and if it weren't for my parents I wouldn't have pushed through it,"" one Twitter user said in response to Barkley's comments. Education advocate and CNN contributor Dr. Steve Perry is another observer who agrees with Barkley. Others have been irked by Barkley's delivery. When Perry tweeted that he applauded Barkley's remarks, some responded that they bristled at Barkley's tendency to generalize the experience of an entire group. ""Unfortunately, as I tell my white friends, we as black people, we're never going to be successful not because of you white people but because of other black people,"" Barkley said. ""When you're black, you have to deal with so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out."" The controversy began with an item from Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman, who said some of Wilson's Seahawks teammates don't care for him because ""they think he's too close to the front office,"" he ""doesn't always take the blame with teammates for mistakes he makes,"" and ""some of the black players think Wilson isn't black enough."" ""There is ... an element of race that needs to be discussed,"" Freeman said of Wilson's relationship with his teammates. ""My feeling on this -- and it's backed up by several interviews with Seahawks players -- is that some of the black players think Wilson isn't black enough. This is an issue that extends outside of football, into African-American society, though it's gotten better recently. Well-spoken blacks are seen by some other blacks as not completely black. Some of this is at play."" (Bleacher Report shares a parent company with CNN.) The report has been denied by Seahawks player Richard Sherman, who said the accusations were ""made up,"" and Wilson too has shaken off Freeman's point of view. ""Black enough? I don't even know what that means,"" Wilson said. ""I'm just an educated, well-spoken male."" But to Barkley, Freeman's assertions are a very real part of being successful and black. ""For some reason we're brainwashed to think if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent and don't break the law, you're not a good black person,"" he said. ""It's a dirty dark secret. I hate to bring white people into our crap, but as a black person, we all go through it when you're successful.""","Charles Barkley speaks on a ""dirty dark secret"" in the black community .

"Rebels aided by al Qaeda-linked militants seized control of the only border crossing between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Wednesday. The capture of the Quneitra crossing by Syrian rebels, including members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, represents a new dynamic in a war long feared not only for its deadly effects inside Syria but for threatening to widen into a destabilizing regional conflict. The border crossing made headlines earlier this week, when American journalist Peter Theo Curtis was handed over on the Syrian side of the checkpoint by the al-Nusra Front to U.N. peacekeepers. During the fighting on Wednesday between Syrian forces and rebels, three errant mortar rounds and some small-arms fire crossed into Israeli-controlled territory, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. An Israeli military officer was moderately injured, the IDF said on Twitter, and Israeli forces responded by striking two Syrian military positions. The Israeli military has closed the area around the border crossing. An activist in the Golan Heights, Shamil al-Jolani, said the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiya and other rebel groups, not all of them Islamist, also were involved in the fighting. Video from the scene showed heavy smoke rising from the Syrian side of the crossing. A journalist working with CNN said that heavy shelling and gunfire erupted earlier from the Syrian side but that the situation had since calmed. Jolani said some fighters were able to reach the crossing despite bombardment by Syrian warplanes. Because of agreements with Israel, Syrian forces could not bomb the forces at the crossing, he said. Wednesday's fighting marks at least the second time rebels have attacked the crossing. In June 2013, rebels and Syrian forces battled for control of Quneitra. The violence prompted Austrian troops to pull out of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Golan Heights. Israel sent tanks and troops to the border for a time, as well. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War, and fought off an attempt by Syria in 1973 to retake the rocky plateau. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights. It is considered to be occupied territory by the international community.

"For many families this holiday season, video games will come wrapped in colorful paper, ribbons and bows -- and lots of questions. Inevitably, in the wake of the tragic school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, video games have become part of the national conversation about the roots of violence. To be sure, any role they may have played in Newtown remains unclear. Police have said nothing about them, and scattered news reports have gunman Adam Lanza playing games ranging from the military strategy ""Starcraft"" to kid-friendly ""Dance Dance Revolution,"" neither of which rank among the more violent titles on the market. And while violent video-game controversies date back to the 1970s, studies into whether games cause violent behavior have been inconclusive. For many gamers, it's an old and tired debate. But after the Newtown shootings, which claimed the lives of 20 children and seven adults -- including Lanza's mother -- some shoppers are weighing whether it's appropriate to give certain video games to children or young teens this holiday season. CNN reached out to iReporters and commenters on the site for their thoughts on the issue. ""I have two boys, age 9, that want 'Call of Duty,' "" said a CNN commenter using the screen name goldeneagle78, referring to the popular military-shooter game series. ""They will NOT be getting it, or any other game that is rated above their age level."" Reader Crysty Harper of Maricopa, Arizona, said she understands that millions play games with no ill effect, but that ""for the mentally unstable, these fantasy scenarios are fueling the violence, and being re-enacted in real life."" The Entertainment Software Rating Board created a ratings system for video games similar to the classification used in movies, such as PG-13 and R. ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 2,"" like many other games depicting violence, adult language or sexual content, is rated ""M for Mature,"" or suggested for players 17 and older. Some readers lumped video games in with other media that depict violence. ""If they want to ban guns, why not ban them in movies, television and video games?"" asked reader Bill Smells in an iReport article inviting ideas for halting mass shootings. ""Why do we allow the media and entertainment industries to glorify weapons and killings? ""If we're going to start regulating and banning weapons, why not start by aggressively banning and preventing the abuse of weapons in media?"" Smells added. ""Why do we allow our children and young adults to buy video games that put them in the position of being rewarded for shooting and killing other players?"" Commenters repeatedly mentioned the Entertainment Software Rating Board's system, saying parents should be as responsible about games their children play as they are about the movies they allow them to see. David Kaelin, president of Texas-based video game chain Game Over, said part of the confusion around the issue is because some parents and other adults only deal with video games once a year, around Christmas. Kaelin said he tries to help uninformed parents get the information they need, including ratings, before choosing gifts. But ultimately, he said, parents are responsible for keeping an eye on their kids. ""I have two young kids myself,"" Kaelin said. ""For any parent to be able to be involved in whatever your kid's doing, you need to be (educated). You need to know what those things are."" Kaelin said he doesn't believe games are responsible for societal violence. But he said he thinks the way kids play them can tell parents a lot about possible problems, especially when a child is spending a lot of time alone on the computer. ""Go into their room and see what they're doing and what they're into,"" Kaelin said. ""Being an active and involved parent is being a good parent."" That's a view echoed by many others. ""I would not consider buying my child a first-person shooter game,"" wrote a reader using the handle dxp2718. ""My kids, admittedly, are too young to play video games like that, but they COULD play with toy guns, swords or soldiers if I let them have them -- and I wouldn't even think of it. ""NOT HURTING OTHERS is lesson #1. It comes before reading, writing, counting or anything else."" Antwand Pearman, CEO of gaming and health company Gamer Fit Nation, said he doesn't believe games are to blame. But he started a movement, including a hashtag on Twitter, urging people to give up playing first-person shooter games on Friday, December 21, as a show of sympathy and understanding for the Newtown victims. ""It's not to say that video games are to blame. It's more to show that we as gamers give a damn,"" Pearman said. ""Video games are more so a reflection of real life. Gaming is an outlet, just like movies and music."" CNN commenter Sean S. said he hopes people will look deeper for answers. He said parents have the most responsibility to teach their kids, especially since they are often the ones buying the games and they cost so much. ""People blame the video games because it is easier than blaming themselves, but the fact is millions of kids around this country and around the world play the same violent and destructive video games, and yet only a very select few have made the choice to take that violence and killing from the game and bring it into real life,"" he said.

"Hank Williams Jr. apologized Tuesday for comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler, a remark that prompted controversy and resulted in ""Monday Night Football"" pulling his popular musical introduction from this week's game. His statement Tuesday went beyond his Monday statement, in which he said ""my analogy was extreme -- but it was to make a point."" On Tuesday, the country singer stated:  ""I have always been very passionate about politics and sports and this time it got the best or worst of me. ""The thought of the leaders of both parties jukin' [sic] and high fiven' [sic] on a golf course, while so many families are struggling to get by, simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement, and I am very sorry if it offended anyone. I would like to thank all my supporters. This was not written by some publicist,"" Williams wrote. Williams made the comparison on Fox News this week when he was asked about Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, playing on the same team in a June golf game. Earlier Tuesday, the Anti-Defamation League condemned Williams' comments and praised ESPN for pulling his ""Are You Ready for Some Football?"" musical recording that opens ""Monday Night Football."" ""The Holocaust was a singular event in human history, and it is an insult to the memory of the millions who died as a result of Hitler's plan of mass extermination to compare the Nazi dictator to any American president,"" said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director and a Holocaust survivor. ""Hank Williams Jr. should know better.  He owes an apology to Holocaust survivors, their families, and the brave American soldiers who gave of themselves to fight the Nazi menace during World War II.  The last thing we need is to enter another election cycle on a sour note tainted with inappropriate, tired and over-the-top analogies to the Nazis,"" he said. ""ESPN responded appropriately and did the right thing in pulling the Hank Williams Jr. football song from the airwaves,"" Foxman said. On Tuesday, ESPN said it had made no decision on Williams' future beyond the Monday night telecast, according to Bill Hofheimer, senior director of communications at ESPN. Williams has criticized Obama in the past, when the Democrat was running for the presidency. In 2008, Williams was even mentioned in some media outlets as saying he was considering running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in the next election cycle, but those plans never materialized. Williams, who supported the Republican ticket in 2008 and even penned a song called ""McCain-Palin Tradition,"" said during that campaign that candidate Obama didn't like the national anthem. The ""McCain-Palin Tradition"" song, which is a riff on the Williams tune ""Family Tradition,"" included a line suggesting that Obama has ""terrorist friends."" The day before voting in the 2008 election, Williams said: ""You know, I'm usually at Monday Night Football tonight, but Colorado, this is a lot more important tonight. Join me now in our national -- you know, that song that, uh, Mr. Obama's not real crazy about, we're singing it right now."" Williams then performed his version of the anthem. In an appearance on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" on Monday morning, Williams referred to a June golf game with Obama and House Speaker John Boehner on the same team, against Vice President Joe Biden and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, as ""one of the biggest political mistakes ever."" Asked what he didn't like about it, Williams said, ""Come on, come on. That'd be like Hitler playing golf with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu. OK. Not hardly."" When one of the Fox News interviewers later pointed out that Williams invoked ""one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe ... the president,"" Williams responded: ""That is true, but I'm telling you like it is, you know. That just wasn't a good thing. It just didn't fly. So anyway, like Fred Thompson said, you don't want to ask me a question because I'm going to give you too straight of an answer. So talk about something else."" Thompson, an actor and ABC Radio Network commentator, was a Republican senator from Tennessee and one-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. In a statement Monday, ESPN said that while Williams ""is not an ESPN employee, we recognize that he is closely linked to our company through the open to 'Monday Night Football.' We are extremely disappointed with his comments and as a result we have decided to pull the open from tonight's telecast."" In a statement issued through a representative, Williams, son of legendary country singer Hank Williams, acknowledged his analogy was ""extreme -- but it was to make a point."" ""Some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood,"" the country singer said. ""... I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me -- how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don't see eye-to-eye and never will."" Williams, however, said he has ""always respected the office of the president."" Still, he noted, ""Every time the media brings up the tea party, it's painted as racist and extremists -- but there's never a backlash, no outrage to those comparisons. ... Working-class people are hurting -- and it doesn't seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job -- it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change."" In Nashville, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum said the controversy won't affect its ongoing exhibit of ""Family Tradition: The Williams Family Legacy,"" a 5,000-square-foot display about Williams and his family, including his father, an iconic country singer himself, spokeswoman Tina Wright said. In 2009, the museum extended the exhibit through the end of 2011, citing ""overwhelming positive response,"" spokesmen said.","""I am very sorry if it offended anyone,"" Williams says of his comparison .

"San Antonio, Texas (CNN) -- The case of the New Mexico hotelier who required Latino employees to adopt English names and avoid speaking Spanish at work reminds us of the need for balance as we grapple with cultural evolution in America. Many of us take our name and its pronunciation for granted. I imagine I did too -- until I was 5 years old. That's when my dad dropped me off on the front porch of Sunnyside School in Brownsville, Texas, the border town where I was born and raised. Like any kid on his first day of school, I was engulfed by longing and loneliness, staring forlornly at my dad through the screen door as he walked away. When I turned to face the classroom, the teacher's mouth moved and I heard words, but I failed to understand. Tears pricked my eyes. I didn't speak English yet, having been home with my mom up until that first day of kindergarten. That day my world changed. My introduction to the world as baby Rodolfo Ruiz -- the cocooned son of an immigrant mother and an eponymously named first-generation Hispanic father -- had ended. My journey as an American began. My teacher, Mrs. Collins, was a tall, grandmotherly figure with neatly coiffed silver hair and wire frame glasses. She ran Sunnyside in a modest house she'd once called home. Quickly, I felt her casa was mi casa. Patiently and kindly, she explained that to make us both more comfortable she was changing my name from ""Rodolfo"" to ""Rudy."" ""It'll be easier for the other kids -- and frankly for me -- to pronounce!"" She smiled. I nodded politely, just like my mamá had taught me. And that was that. I became Rudy Ruiz without debate or anguish. By the end of the school year I was fluent in English. And by second grade I was promoted to the advanced learners class of the elementary school to which my parents transferred me after Sunnyside. There, in a predominantly Hispanic grade school run by Catholic nuns, I began to wrestle with what my name meant to me, and how I wanted it pronounced. I didn't mind ""Rudy"" but I didn't like ""Ruiz"" pronounced in English. It just didn't sound right to me. Call it instinct, or since I was bilingual and my mother rigidly emphasized speaking both languages correctly, perhaps I felt the most respectful and authentic pronunciation of a name should be that of its language of origin. Thus, I arrived at my own compromise by fifth grade. I began to say my name bilingually. ""Rudy"" in English. ""Ruiz"" in Spanish. Balance. Balance, or the constant search for it, became a hallmark of my life. Maybe it was because I was reared on the US-Mexico border, a place akin to the fulcrum in a playground see-saw. To the south thrived my living heritage, which I experienced at home and with my family. To the north loomed my future, which I was learning and absorbing at school and in the media. It took five minutes to commute from my house in the United States to my abuelos' home in Mexico, where I whiled away countless afternoons playing ball beneath a giant avocado tree in the backyard, devouring homemade corn tortillas hot off the plancha, and listening to the colorful yarns my abuelita spun and the wise dichos (sayings) my abuelito religiously repeated. Meanwhile at school, I gobbled up books and determined to someday head north to Harvard and make my way as a productive American. And all along, as I introduced myself, I started my name in English and switched gears into Spanish for the second half. Even though I was bilingual, it took practice. You see, different languages employ varying muscles in your mouth and face. Unseen, but not unheard, the tongue curves uniquely in each language, enabling one to enunciate not only different words but diverse vowel sounds, unique consonants, cadences and accents. And the alliteration of ""Rudy Ruiz"" provided a challenge in that the ""r"" in Rudy flows smoothly in English, while the ""r"" in Ruiz rolls like a locomotive thundering over the old railway bridge that spans the Rio Grande in Brownsville, often backing up traffic for miles. That quick change-up from English to Spanish when pronouncing my brief, four-syllable name stopped me in my tracks more than a few times, causing my cheeks to flush with embarrassment at the struggle of pronouncing the name I had not chosen in the way I had chosen. But, despite the difficulty, I persevered. Try quickly repeating ""Rudy Ruiz"" 10 times bilingually. It's a bicultural tongue twister, a ""trabalenguas"" as they say in Spanish. So I practiced some more. Until I got it right. Four letters in English. Four letters in Spanish. A smooth ""r."" A rolled ""rrrr."" Balance. Pronounced completely in the native tongue, a name could be interpreted as a sign of a person's unwillingness to embrace American culture and integrate fully into society. On the flip side, translated entirely into English it can give the impression that one is trying to hide his or her heritage, that perhaps the past is a source of shame rather than pride. The story of the innkeeper stirred my memory. Surely, it's no surprise that when a child finds challenge in something as simple as their name, he or she will likely also face a complex path in crafting an identity as a multicultural American. But what I take from these experiences is that an extreme approach in either direction is not the most constructive, healthy strategy. Cultural evolution and acculturation take time and involve compromise and negotiation, in the hearts and minds of individuals as well as within our broader social discourse. The key to attaining the right balance is empathy. The secret to maintaining it is practice. If the innkeeper had taken an empathetic, compassionate approach -- like Mrs. Collins did with me -- he might have elicited a more positive, collaborative reaction from his staff, media and observers. In the end, if we achieve balance, we can enjoy the best of two worlds -- creating a new one that acknowledges our past while cultivating our future. A funny thing about ""balance."" While it sounds different in English and Spanish, in both languages it is spelled the same way and it holds the same meaning. Just like my name. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.","Hotel owner who asked workers to take English names sparked a memory for Rudy Ruiz .

"From building-crushing hurricanes to killer sinkholes, Gulf Coast residents have seen a lot. But even these battle-tested veterans of the weather wars are marveling at torrential rains that washed out bridges and roads, sent chest-high water into homes and forced major military bases to shut down Wednesday. ""We've seen flooding before, but never flooding that washes the back of a house away,"" said CNN iReporter Matt Raybourn of Pensacola, Florida. ""There are no words for what we are seeing here."" The rushing waters reduced some streets to rubble, gouged huge gashes in others and left stretches of many others submerged, including parts U.S. 98, the main east-west route along the coast. It was closed in several places between Fort Walton Beach and Panama City. Abandoned cars sat half-submerged along the highway. Along the coast, water pushed ashore by wind-driven waves and unusually high tides lapped at sand dunes as red flags warned swimmers to stay out of the water. There was one drowning death tied to the flooding, Florida officials said. The victim, a 67-year-old woman, drove or was swept into a drainage ditch Tuesday night, Escambia County spokeswoman Kathleen Castro said. In Alabama, waters rushed in so fast that residents climbed on top of furniture and waited on rooftops to be rescued, said Reggie Chitwood, deputy director of emergency management in Baldwin County. ""The waters rose at a historical level. ... People had to scramble,"" Chitwood told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" In a neighborhood north of Pensacola, a creek overran its banks, inundating homes and forcing residents to retreat to their attics to await rescue, Escambia County spokesman Bill Pearson said. Rescuers were reaching the residents on state Fish and Wildlife boats and personal watercraft normally used to patrol the county's beaches, he said. The National Guard was also on the way. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said that crews had rescued 300 people. 'People have lost everything' ""It's unbelievable the amount of flooding we've had. We've have roads torn up, water clear through homes. I went to one home where the foundation was gone. ... You saw cars just thrown down a road, pushed down upside down,"" Scott told ""The Lead."" ""People have lost everything, and they didn't buy flood insurance because they didn't think they were in a flood area."" Scott declared a state of emergency and warned residents to expect more rain and flooding. As much as 18.9 inches of rain fell over 24 hours in Alabama and Florida, according to the National Weather Service. At Pensacola's airport, an estimated 15.55 inches of rain fell on Tuesday -- the largest amount to fall in a single calendar day since officials started tracking rainfall in 1880, the National Weather Service said. It was all the result of a slow-moving and massive storm system that sucked up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico for days before dumping it back onto land in a series of thunderstorms, said CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray. Satellites captured an image of the water vapor held aloft by the storm tracing a huge sideways 'S' shape across much of the country. As the storm crept up the eastern seaboard Wednesday afternoon, heavy rains caused flooding in the Washington area. In Baltimore, the edge of a street buckled in a landslide that sent cars tumbling into a ravine. No one was injured, the city's transportation department said. In Perdido Key, Florida, iReporter Steve Olensky described the storm as a ""hurricane and tornado all in one."" ""It was blowing and blowing, the rain was coming. It was just incredible,"" said Olensky,  whose 22-foot boat vanished in the storm. ""We've been through (hurricanes) Ivan and Katrina, and we've never seen anything like this."" There's one major difference between this week's storms and a hurricane, Pensacola resident Cindi Bonner told CNN. ""You have time to prepare for a hurricane,"" she said. ""This was not something that anyone had prepared for."" Damage to bridges, disruption to military bases . Many roads in the city of Gulf Shores, Alabama, were ""totally flooded,"" the city said on Twitter. At least three heavily used bridges in Escambia County, Florida, had been badly damaged or destroyed, said Pearson, the county spokesman. Naval Air Station Pensacola, Eglin Air Force Base and Hurlburt Field, another Air Force installation, were closed to all but essential personnel, the installations said on their Twitter and Facebook accounts. In nearby Baldwin County, Alabama, the Fish River reached historic flooding levels, according to the National Weather Service. Most government offices in the Florida Panhandle were closed Wednesday, as were many schools. Pearson said emergency officials were urging businesses to stay closed as well and were asking motorists to stay off the roads. Tides up to 2 feet higher than normal were causing minor coastal flooding and dangerous rip currents, the National Weather Service said. CNN iReporter Randy Hamilton said the scene felt like the aftermath of a hurricane with ""abandoned and flooded cars just littering the streets."" ""Debris from trees everywhere. Standing water all around, gray skies, and wind gusts that make you fear something will blow down on you,"" he said. Arkansas tornado was EF-4 . The storms were part of the same system that has spawned tornadoes and other severe storms since Sunday, claiming at least 36 lives in Oklahoma, Iowa, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and now Florida. Tens of thousands remained without power in the South, where suspected tornadoes tore through homes and businesses late Monday. Officials revealed new details Wednesday about the powerful tornado that struck the Arkansas towns of Mayflower and Vilonia. The twister was rated an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage scale, with an estimated peak wind speed between 180 and 190 mph, the National Weather Service said. It was on the ground for 41.3 miles on Sunday and was responsible for 15 deaths, officials said. In addition to the Florida flooding death, police in Athens, Georgia, said a driver was killed Wednesday when storm winds toppled a tree onto a car. Authorities in Mississippi confirmed another death from storms that struck Monday. At least 38 people have been killed since Sunday in storm-related deaths in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Florida and Georgia, according to a CNN tally of state reports. The storm could bring heavy rains and possibly thunderstorms to Jacksonville, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia;  Raleigh, North Carolina; and Atlanta, the National Weather Service said. Heavy rain will be the norm. Flooding could be a concern in the New York City area on Thursday. Forecasters say rainfall could total up to four inches, with heavier amounts in some areas.","Storms caused 38 deaths since Sunday; 67-year-old woman killed in Florida .

"(CNN) -- Tony Gwynn, a Hall of Fame outfielder who spent his entire Major League Baseball career with the San Diego Padres, has died after a multiyear battle with salivary gland cancer. He was 54. ""Major League Baseball today mourns the tragic loss of Tony Gwynn, the greatest Padre ever and one of the most accomplished hitters that our game has ever known, whose all-around excellence on the field was surpassed by his exuberant personality and genial disposition in life,"" MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement. Gwynn -- known for slapping singles between third base and shortstop in his 20-year career with the Padres -- had 3,141 hits and a .338 batting average. He also was a 15-time All-Star. In 2007, Gwynn was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame with Cal Ripken. ""He was beloved by so many, especially the Hall of Fame family, for his kindness, graciousness and passion for the game,"" Jane Forbes Clark, chairman of the board of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a statement. ""Tony was one of baseball history's most consistent hitters and most affable personalities. He was an icon for San Diego Padres fans, never more evident than on Induction Day of 2007, when tens of thousands of Tony's most appreciative fans filled Cooperstown for his Hall of Fame speech. We extend our deepest sympathies to Alicia and the entire Gwynn family."" ""I am deeply saddened to learn that Tony Gwynn has lost his courageous battle against cancer,"" Tony Clark, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said in a statement. ""Since his diagnosis, Tony displayed the same tenacity and drive in his fight against this horrible disease that he brought to the plate in every at bat of his Hall of Fame career."" Gwynn was known as ""Mr. Padre"" during and after his career in the majors. The team retired his No. 19 jersey in September 2004 at Petco Park. In the spring of 2005, the street on which the stadium is located was named Tony Gwynn Drive in his honor. There's also a statue of Gwynn at Petco Park, which was unveiled in 2007. After Gwynn retired from the Padres in 2001, he became the head baseball coach for San Diego State University, his alma mater. He was diagnosed with cancer almost a decade later. In March, Gwynn took a medical leave of absence while undergoing cancer treatment, but he had recently signed a one-year extension with the Aztecs. San Diego State tweeted Monday, ""Our hearts are heavy today. RIP Tony Gwynn. Thoughts to the entire Gwynn family and SDSU Baseball family."" As a collegiate baseball player, Gwynn was an All-American at San Diego State. He also played basketball while growing up in Long Beach and arrived at San Diego State as a highly recruited point guard in 1977. He played basketball for the Aztecs for four seasons and baseball for three seasons, garnering all-Western Athletic Conference honors in both sports. According to San Diego State's athletics website, Gwynn remains the only athlete in WAC history to be honored as an all-conference performer in two sports. Baseball still runs in the Gwynn family. Gwynn's son, Tony Gwynn Jr., followed in his father's footsteps and currently is an outfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies. ""Today I lost my Dad, my best friend and my mentor,"" Gwynn Jr. tweeted on Monday. ""I'm gonna miss u so much pops. I'm gonna do everything in my power to continue to... Make u proud!""

"Washington (CNN)Another Bush is poised to confront the seemingly endless challenges of Iraq. Nearly 25 years after his father launched the first Gulf War and almost 12 years after his brother began a much more contentious sequel, it's Jeb Bush's turn to articulate his vision of America's approach to the Middle East -- and Iraq in particular. How he responds will have big implications for his White House ambitions. On Wednesday, he'll deliver his first foreign policy speech since signaling his serious interest in running for president next year, laying out ""how America can regain its leadership in the world,"" according to advanced excerpts of the speech. The remarks come as the United States is again being drawn back into the Middle East, including Iraq, to combat the brutality of the Islamic State. The speech will offer Bush a chance to show whether his national security views align more with the swaggering interventionism of his brother or the cautious internationalism of his father. Democrats are vowing to tether him to the controversial decisions of his brother, President George W. Bush, who they blame for starting a war in Iraq on false pretenses and for presiding over a disastrous occupation that cost trillions of dollars, thousands of U.S. and Iraqi lives and destabilized the region. The challenges of addressing his family's foreign policy legacy are clear to Bush, who is already trying to defuse them. ""I love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make,"" Bush will say according to excerpts of his speech. ""But I am my own man -- and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences."" But he will also project them as a strength, calling himself ""lucky to have a father and a brother who have shaped America's foreign policy from the Oval Office."" Bush is wading into foreign policy at a crucial time, when it appears that public opinion on issues of war could be shifting. A new CNN poll shows that Obama is beginning to pay a price for the lurid execution videos posted by ISIS and the group's widening footprint through the Middle East and North Africa. Disapproval of Obama's management of the ISIS crisis has climbed from 49% in late September to 57% now, potentially providing an opening for Republicans to push for tougher foreign policy. And Bush will slam Obama's foreign policy as ""inconsistent and indecisive,"" pointing out that Obama's foreign policy has made the U.S. less influential despite Obama's promise to engage leaders around the world, what Bush will dub ""the great irony"" of Obama's presidency, according to excerpts. But Bush is nevertheless likely to find himself pulled into a debate over conflicts initiated by George W. Bush that still vex U.S. policymakers and remain an open wound in American politics. Democrats insist they won't let Bush get away with his pledge to not re-litigate old wars. ""If you thought George Bush's foreign policy made the world less safe, then you're going to really hate Jeb Bush's approach,"" said Mo Elleithee, communications director of the Democratic National Committee. ""Even with the benefit of hindsight, he's one of the few people left who still stands by the decision to rush into a war in Iraq based on false information, even when it took resources away from the hunt for al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And he's made it pretty clear that if he had his way, we'd still be in Iraq and staying there indefinitely. "" Democrats believe George W. Bush created a mess abroad and voters will not buy attacks on President Barack Obama by his brother. ""The bulk of what we know of Jeb's foreign policy experience is his steadfast refusal to criticize his brother when his brother was in office,"" said Ben Ray of the progressive PAC American Bridge. ""On Friday, I think you saw him take an unsustainable position. That is not how presidential politics works."" Bush's past statements on his brother's presidency are already powering the Democratic attacks. ""During incredibly challenging times, he kept us safe,"" Bush said at the Republican National Convention in 2012. In an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" in March 2013, Bush said: ""The war has wound down now and it's still way too early to judge what successes it had in providing some degree of stability in the region."" A 2010 CNN interview in which the Bush brothers appeared together could provide Democrats even more fodder. During the interview, Jeb said ""I have never disagreed with (George W. Bush)... 'til death do us part."" There are deeper reasons why Bush will find it hard to skip a full discussion on Iraq or Afghanistan. Neither war produced a clear-cut U.S. victory and both nations still face intractable political, military and sectarian challenges, including the rise of ISIS and the resilience of the Taliban, which will be among the most pressing foreign challenges for the next president. The politics of the Iraq war, meanwhile, remain toxic, and disputes over the origins of the conflict  -- which have never been resolved -- cloud the debate over how to rescue Iraq from its current plight. Even people who worked for his brother believe Jeb Bush needs to address Iraq soon. ""There is no question that Gov. Bush has to talk about Iraq at some point,"" said Peter Feaver, who was a leading official responsible for Iraq on George W. Bush's National Security Council and is now at Duke University. ""Those questions will be asked of him and he has to have an answer."" Kori Schake, who also worked as a senior foreign policy aide in the Bush administration, agreed. ""I do think he is in a vulnerable position on Iraq because of his last name,"" she said, conceding that the public perception of the Bush legacy on foreign policy was a wider problem for his party, not just Jeb Bush. ""Conservatives, Republicans have to rebuild public confidence in what we say we are going to do,"" said Schake, now at the Hoover Institution. ""That is a high hurdle but it is an achievable hurdle."" Bush can take several approaches. He could argue that avoiding a rehash of the fierce war debate may actually help move the nation on and focus on the best way to tackle ISIS as it spreads across the Middle East. That might be beneficial because the current foreign policy disputes in Washington seem still mired in a perpetual blame game. ""When you ask: 'What is the appropriate U.S. response to ISIS?' half the people in Washington answer: 'George W. Bush broke Iraq and ISIS was born in the rubble. There would be no ISIS if it weren't for him.' "" Peggy Noonan wrote in her Wall Street Journal column earlier this month. ""The other half answer: 'When Barack Obama withdrew from Iraq, ISIS was born in the vacuum. There would be no ISIS without him.' "" Bush seems to be happy to engage in war talk if it centers on Obama's missteps, which may offer him a chance to turn the conversation on Iraq away from simply yet another fight over his brother's legacy. At the Detroit Economic Club earlier this month, Bush warned that Obama's failure to arm rebels in Syria and insufficient attention to Iraq left a void for jihadism. ""As we pulled back from the Middle East, look what happened,"" he said. ""Look what happened with ISIS in Syria. Look what happened with ISIS in Iraq."" And on Wednesday he will make the case for unapologetic leadership on the world stage coupled with a strong military, ""because I believe, fundamentally, that weakness invites war...and strength encourages piece,"" according to excerpts. This is hardly the first time Iraq has emerged as a campaign issue. The United States is fighting its third war in the country, if the current campaign against ISIS is included. Iraq was a key issue in presidential elections in 2004 and 2008. It now looks certain that Obama will deposit the messy aftermath of the wars onto his successor, meaning they will return to the campaign trail in 2016.","Bush doesn't want to ""re-litigate"" old rows over brother's wars .

"(CNN)Three more cemeteries have been vandalized in France, at a time of heightened sensitivity over religion and terrorist threats. The Interior Ministry announced Wednesday that overnight, headstones were damaged in a small Christian cemetery in Saint-Beat in southern France and swastikas were scrawled in Jewish cemeteries in Challans, in the west, and Issoudun, in central France. Those three incidents are in addition to the defacing of tombstones in western France's Tracy-sur-Mer and the desecration of about 250 graves late last week in a Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union. Authorities took five teenagers -- one of whom turned himself in and none of whom have criminal records -- into custody in that incident and charged them with desecration of graves and with organized damage on property for the public benefit, Saverne prosecutor Philippe Vanier said Monday. One of the teens denied the attack was anti-Semitic, claiming they'd thought the cemetery was abandoned and didn't notice the graves were Jewish until after the vandalism began, according to the prosecutor. Whatever the motive, the Sarre-Union vandalism spurred strong condemnations from French officials, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls calling it ""a vile, anti-Semitic act"" and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve vowing, ""The French Republic won't allow another act against our values."" The incidents come at a time when Jews in France have become targets, most glaringly with last month's deadly hostage siege at a kosher supermarket in Paris. It's not just France, though, as the recent shooting near a synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, illustrates. This all comes amid a push by groups like ISIS for its twisted version of Islam and against any nonbelievers, with Jews and Christians being singled out as targets. Muslims have also come under fire. After the Paris attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and kosher market siege, numerous mosques in France were attacked -- with shots fired in some cases and other instances in which a pig's head was stuck on a prayer room door and  messages of hate were sprayed on walls, according to French media reports. CNN's Laura Akhoun and Margot Haddad contributed to this report.","Ministry: Headstones were damaged in a small Christian cemetery in Saint-Beat .

"A referendum over Catalonia's future as a part of Spain has been put on hold. Spain's Constitutional Court on Monday suspended the planned referendum on independence for Spain's Catalonia region set to happen on November 9, a court spokeswoman told CNN. The court has suspended the referendum as it consider the grounds of a lawsuit issued by Spain's federal government that challenged the planned independence vote as ""unconstitutional."" The President of the Catalonia region, Artur Mas, on Saturday had signed a decree setting the date for the vote. Even before the Constitutional Court suspended the plan, the federal government had made it clear that it any such referendum. A legal and political confrontation was expected. The next move is in Catalonia's hand -- and whether its leaders decide to go ahead with the vote anyway. The holding of Scotland's independence referendum earlier this month buoyed other separatist movements around the world, despite Scottish voters opting to remain part of the United Kingdom. Mas has said that Catalonia wants to speak, wants to be heard and wants to vote. On September 11, Catalan national day, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona for the third year running demanding a vote on independence be held. But Madrid argues that Catalonia, which represents one fifth of Spain's economy, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. And it insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away. Catalonia is a region of northeastern Spain, with Barcelona -- the second-largest city in Spain -- as its capital. A referendum is expected to ask a two-part question: ""Should Catalonia be a state?"" And those who vote yes to that can then go to vote on the second question: ""Should that state be independent?"" Polls indicate that a majority of Catalans want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence, given the chance.","A top Spanish court suspends Catalonia's referendum on independence .

"Wanda Butts dropped the phone and screamed when she heard the news that her son was dead. Josh had drowned while rafting on a lake with friends. The 16-year-old didn't know how to swim, and he wasn't wearing a life jacket. ""I couldn't believe it, I didn't want to believe it: that just like that, my son had drowned and he was gone,"" she said, recalling the 2006 tragedy. Butts had worried about her son's safety when it came to street violence or driving, and she said she had always warned him of those dangers. But water accidents never crossed her mind. ""It did not occur to me that my son would drown because he didn't know water safety,"" she said. ""Josh was never taught the basic life skill of learning how to swim."" Josh was not alone in the black community. According to USA Swimming, 70% of African-American children cannot swim, compared with nearly 60% for Hispanic children and 42% for white children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African-American children between the ages of 5 and 14 are three times more likely to drown than white children in the same age range. As Butts tried to make sense of her son's tragedy, she realized she had passed her own inexperience to her son. Her father had witnessed a drowning when he was young and instilled in her a fear of water. ""So as a child, I never went around water,"" said Butts, 58. ""I never went swimming. I didn't know anything about water or life jackets and water safety."" Because of this fear, Butts raised Josh without any exposure to water. But today, she is determined to prevent other mothers from doing the same. In 2007, she started the Josh Project, a nonprofit that provides low-cost swimming lessons for children in Toledo, Ohio. ""After losing my son, I wanted to do something to help other people, to help another mother not have to suffer the way I do every day from the loss of a child drowning,"" she said. To date, the Josh Project has helped more than 1,000 children learn how to swim. ""All children are at risk of drowning, but the majority of the children that the Josh Project serves are minority children, who we have found are more at risk,"" Butts said. Several cultural and historical factors can help explain why that is. One is the segregation of swimming pools during the 20th century, according to Jeff Wiltse, author of ""Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America."" Relatively few swimming pools were built to serve the black community back then, so much of a generation was denied the opportunity to swim, Wiltse told the BBC. Also, if parents can't swim, their children are far less likely to learn how, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Memphis. The study, sponsored by USA Swimming, found that a fear of drowning and a fear of injury prevent many African-American parents from putting their children in swimming lessons. It also found that many avoid swimming for cosmetic reasons, such as the effect chlorinated water has on their hair. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . For some families today, it's still tough to find an accessible pool. ""The public pools near our home have been closed in the past, and other places were not affordable,"" said Lisa Haynes, whose 14-year-old son, Joshua, is one of 60-plus students in the Josh Project this season. The swimming lessons take place at a local high school over four Saturdays for a total cost of $10. ""I am less worried if (Joshua) is near water because he has the basics of how to swim,"" Haynes said. ""And we're thankful for that."" Butts is doing much more, however, than just providing swimming lessons. ""She ups the awareness, and that is half the battle,"" said Shaun Anderson, a swimming coach who was so inspired by her story that he created a Josh Project swimming program at Norfolk State University in Virginia. ""Once these communities learn how to swim, they will pass it down, which results in future generations that know how to swim."" Butts said she has two goals for the future: One is to change the drowning statistics of minority children, and the other is to have an aquatic center where the children can swim daily instead of just once a week. ""The joy on the faces of those children -- when they see that they can learn, once they get it -- they are so happy with themselves,"" she said. ""And it's like all of them are my children. It's like I didn't lose my son."" Want to get involved?

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- U.S. presidential contender Barack Obama used a speech Thursday in Berlin --  the German city that once symbolized Cold War division --- to warn about the dangers of allowing new walls to come between the United States and its allies. Barack Obama presses the flesh in Germany after his speech in Berlin's Tiergarten Park. Obama highlighted what he sees as common transatlantic goals while also accepting the differences of the Bush years. He is on the latest leg of an international trip intended to bolster his foreign policy credentials at home and set out his vision for a new era of transatlantic cooperation. In an echo of former President Ronald Reagan's speech when he demanded the Berlin Wall be pulled down, Obama said: ""The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down."" Obama introduced himself to the Berlin crowd as a proud U.S. citizen and a ""fellow citizen of the world."" He said: ""This city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom. And you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life.""  Watch Obama in Germany » . He touched on issues that have generally divided Europe and the U.S. such as climate change as well as comparing Berlin's Cold War struggle with today's international challenges like fighting terrorism. ""People of the world - look at Berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one,"" he said. Obama said: ""While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history."" He said the fall of the Berlin Wall offered hope as the world faces up to international challenges such as terrorism, climate change and loose nukes . ""In this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them. That is why we cannot afford to be divided,"" Obama said. He also addressed differences between the U.S. and Europe but added: ""In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help make it right, has become all too common. ""In America, there are voices that deride and deny the importance of Europe's role in our security and our future. Both views miss the truth... ""In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more - not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the one way, the only way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity."" Turning to global warming, Obama said: ""This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet. ""Let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands. Let us resolve that all nations - including my own - will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere."" CNN's Christiane Amanpour said despite the pro-Obama crowd who gathered at the Victory Column in Berlin's Tiergarten Park hours before the speech, many had serious questions about his policies. Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Obama's Republican rival John McCain, said: ""John McCain has dedicated his life to serving, improving and protecting America. Barack Obama spent an afternoon talking about it."" Obama earlier played down suggestions he was delivering a campaign speech but conceded that his performance was intended as much for an American audience as for the gathering German crowds. He had originally hoped to speak in front of the iconic Brandenburg Gate, where U.S. President John F. Kennedy was photographed during a visit in 1963 shortly after the Berlin Wall had been built. Expressing solidarity with the people of the divided city during the same trip, Kennedy declared ""Ich bin ein Berliner."" The gate was also the site of a speech by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1987 in which he memorably urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to ""tear down"" the wall. But use of the landmark was apparently vetoed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who a spokesman Wednesday said disapproved of plans to co-opt it as a ""campaign backdrop."" CNN European Political Editor Robin Oakley said Obama enjoyed widespread popularity in Europe, partly because of his optimism and partly because he is not President George W. Bush.  Watch how Europe compares the two candidates » . But Oakley said Obama needed to prove to Americans that he could defend U.S. interests abroad. Republican rival John McCain's campaign team has frequently criticized Obama as being inexperienced on foreign policy and a recent poll suggested just 48 percent of Americans thought he would make a good commander in chief, compared to 72 percent for McCain. Germany's ties with the Bush administration have warmed since a fallout over the Iraq war, which Germany opposed. Germany and the U.S. have also disagreed over NATO member Germany's refusal to send troops into combat zones in southern Afghanistan. Oakley said European leaders would be seeking confirmation that Obama, if elected, would be a ""listening president."" In addition to Merkel, Obama is slated to meet with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and opposition leader David Cameron as well as French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Obama's arrival in Europe follows earlier stopovers in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Israel and the Palestinian territories. He says he is making the trip as a U.S. senator rather than a presidential contender.","U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama gives speech in Germany .

"(CNN) -- Abu Daoud, the man who claimed to be the mastermind behind the massacre that marked the 1972 Munich Olympics, has died, according to the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority. On September 5 of that year, Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes who were taken hostage. Daoud, also known as Mohammed Oudeh, died Friday night, the WAFA news agency reported Saturday. The former Palestinian politician and commander in the Fatah and Palestinian Liberation Organization movements was 73. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas sent his condolences to Daoud's family, WAFA reported. ""He wrote in his letter to his family, 'He is missed. He was one of the leading figures of Fatah and spent his life in resistance [against the occupation] and sincere work as well as physical sacrifice for his people's just causes,' "" the news agency quoted Abbas as saying. In the early hours of the attack in Munich, eight Palestinian terrorists entered the Olympic Village in the German city. They stormed the apartments housing the Israeli athletes and took control. Hours later, the world woke up to the image of a masked man on the balcony of the Olympic Village. From the Olympic Village, the Palestinian terrorists issued ultimatums, demanding the release of 200 Arab inmates from Israeli prisons or they would start killing the athletes in Munich, one every hour. Eventually, all the Israelis, five terrorists and one German police officer were killed in what would be remembered as ""Black September."" ""The hardest part was the ultimatums,"" Ankie Spitzer, wife of Israeli fencing coach Andre Spitzer, who was killed in the incident, told CNN in a 2005 interview.  ""Every time, you die a little bit because you think now it's going to happen to him."" The Games were put on hold for a few hours. In the Arab world, ""Black September"" was viewed as a triumph. Weeks later, the three captured Palestinian terrorists were freed by the German government after a Lufthansa plane was hijacked in the Balkans. The men got a heroes' welcome when they arrived in Libya. Ironically, Daoud was allowed back into the West Bank for several years by Israel, at a time in the 1990s when relations with Palestinians were improving. In 2006 -- around the release of Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" -- he gave several interviews in which he indicated he had no regrets about the Munich attacks. ""I regret nothing,"" he told Germany's Spiegel TV. ""You can only dream that I would apologize."" Daoud also published an autobiography, giving a first-hand look at the rise of the Palestinian resistance leading up to the attack at Munich. The book is titled ""Memoirs of a Palestinian Terrorist,"" as well as, ""Palestine -- A History of the Resistance Movement, by the Sole Survivor of Black September.""","Palestinian Authority news agency reports Abu Daoud dead at 73 .

"(CNN) -- The militants pulled into the northeastern Nigerian village of Chibok under cover of darkness, their target a girls' boarding school filled with students ahead of final year exams. Armed and wearing military uniforms, they told the girls they were there to protect them. The girls started to assemble in the yard as ordered to, not realizing the men were from Boko Haram -- the group whose name roughly translates as ""Western education is sin"" -- until it was too late. More than 200 were loaded onto trucks and spirited away: the group's leader later announced that he would sell them. Since the mass abduction on April 14, the world's attention has been focused on Chibok, but CNN was the first global news organization to send a team to the scene of the atrocity. The journey from the relative safety of Nigeria's capital, Abuja, to the remote countryside stalked by Boko Haram can take eight to 10 hours, but logistics and security concerns meant that it took CNN international correspondent Nima Elbagir's team four days to complete the trek. For most of the route, the road was tarmacked and the team constantly stopped at checkpoints manned by the military, police or vigilantes looking out for militants. But for the final 45 minutes the tarmac and checkpoints disappeared and the team swerved through the bleak, potholed landscape at full speed with flak jackets beside them. Read more: The road to Boko Haram's heartland . Some girls managed to escape Boko Haram, making a desperate dash for freedom after the militants loaded them into cargo trucks. ""We would rather die than go,"" one of those girls told CNN. With fear in her eyes and voice, the young woman, who asked not to be identified, described what happened on that horrendous night. Read more: Escaped schoolgirl describes ordeal . Families had sent their girls to Chibok Girls Secondary School for a desperately needed education but Boko Haram's attack left the school a burned-out shell. Chibok is part of Borno state, where 72% of primary-age children never attended school, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. The militants destroyed everything they could at the school. One of the girls who managed to flee said their attack had ended both her education and dreams of becoming a doctor. Read more: How Boko Haram cripples children's future . Outrage over the mass abduction has prompted a global campaign, calling for the girls to be freed through the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. But in Chibok the outrage is overlaid with despair. CNN's Nima Elbagir spoke to the mothers of two of the missing schoolgirls. They described hearing gunfire before discovering their daughters had been taken away. The kidnapping has left an indelible mark on Chibok. During the day, it looks like a normal village. But at night the fear and terror is visible. The women, elderly and children go to sleep -- and the young men stay awake, doing patrols, keeping vigil. The men arm themselves with whatever they can -- machetes, homemade bow and arrows, in the hope that they will be able to protect their families. CNN's team joined them. Read more: Boko Haram threat keeps village awake . Nima and her crew returned to Nigeria's capital, Abuja, safely. Around the world, the #BringBackOurGirls campaign continues and foreign governments including the United States, Britain, France, Israel and China have offered help to Nigeria's government find the girls. But the schoolgirls are still missing, their relatives still praying for their return and the residents of Chibok still haunted by the attack that left them cowering in the bush as Boko Haram plundered their village. Full coverage of CNN international correspondent Nima Elbagir's Chibok journey will screen on CNN International on Saturday 17 May at 2100 CET, Sunday 18 May at 0030 CET, 0400 CET and 1200 CET and Monday 19 May at 0730 CET.","On April 14, Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 girls from a school in Chibok, Nigeria .

"The disaster that wrecked a luxury cruise liner and killed at least six passengers has left officials and experts on maritime navigation searching for answers -- fast. But two days after the massive ship hit rocks and rolled spectacularly on its side, answers were in short supply. Why was the ship -- with 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- so close in to shore in an area where local sailors say the sea bed is pockmarked with rocks?  What happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground?   Why was no ""mayday"" distress signal sent? Costa Cruises issued a statement saying ""preliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship's Master, Captain Francesco Schettino."" ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" the statement added . Italian prosecutors announced plans to seize the ship's data recorders, which some refer to as ""black boxes.""  Authorities hope to complete an analysis revealing what happened within a few days. The ship hit rocks off the coast of Tuscany on Friday, leaving 20 people injured in addition to those killed, authorities said. According to the Italian Coast Guard, the Costa Concordia was simply too close inland. But what authorities, and the cruise line, can't answer is why. Capt. Cosimo Nicastro, spokesman for the Italian Coast Guard, said authorities ""know what the cause"" was: ""The water went on board."" ""Why he (the captain) went so close is why we are investigating,"" Nicastro said. Schettino, who is under arrest, denies the assertion that he had steered the ship too far inland. ""We were about 300 meters (1,000 feet) from the shore, more or less,"" Schettino said after the accident. There was a ""lateral rock projection,"" he said.  ""Even though we were sailing along the coast with the tourist navigation system, I firmly believe that the rocks were not detected, as the ship was not heading forward but sideways, as if underwater there was this rock projection,"" he said. But Nicastro insists ""every danger in this area is on the nautical chart.  This is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. ... all the dangers are known."" Schettino is  facing charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship, while passengers were still on board, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. But, according to ANSA, Schettino says he and his crew were ""the last to abandon ship."" Costa Cruises is owned by Carnival Corporation.  Carnival issued a statement  Saturday saying it was ""deeply saddened"" by the ""terrible tragedy."" ""We are working to fully understand the cause of what occurred,"" the statement said. Carnival officials did not immediately return a call Sunday from CNN requesting further comment regarding the wreck or the safety of its other cruise lines, such as Carnival Cruise Lines, Holland America and Princess Cruises. Local authorities and residents told CNN they believe that after sustaining damage from what it struck, the ship sailed at least half a mile north, and the captain turned it around toward land, where it toppled. Experts on cruise-ship safety say there is no way to know immediately what went wrong. ""Human error or navigational error is a real possibility,"" said Peter Wild, a cruise industry consultant and former navigating officer.  ""Those are the two most likely causes"" in general, he said, noting that a combination of the two could be to blame. But there are examples of cruise ships hitting uncharted rocks, he said. Chris McKesson, professor of naval architecture at the University of New Orleans, told CNN that Giglio, where the Costa Concordia wreck took place,  ""is probably pretty well-charted.  The Mediterranean has been traveled for some thousand years."" ""Looking at the pictures of the damage, it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute, and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss...  But just like when you're driving an RV or something, when you swing the nose to the right, the tail swings little to the left. If you look at the photos of the ship, you can see that the rock embedded in the side of the ship's left port side...as if exactly that happened. She swung her tail over and kissed that rock."" Cruise ships that travel on international voyages, include the Costa Concordia, are subject to the regulations of the International Maritime Organization, a U.N. agency. ""Passenger ships in operation today are subject to a vast array of regulations and standards covering every aspect of ship construction and operation,"" the IMO website says.  ""A number of incidents over the years have led to improvements in safety requirements,"" the site adds. Costa Cruises, in its statement Sunday, said it ""complies very strictly with all safety regulations and our personnel are committed, first and foremost, to guest safety and security..""  All crew members are trained in basic safety and emergency management, and their skills are tested periodically by Coast Guard authorities, the statement said. Survivors of the wreck, however, described crew members who appeared overwhelmed.  ""There wasn't anybody to help you,"" said passenger Vivian Safer. ""I mean, the passengers were loading the lifeboats by themselves."" The industry association representing cruise lines emphasized Sunday that disasters  are rare. ""Any given day in excess of 300,000 people are on board our ships, being safely carried to various locations throughout the world,"" said Michael Crye, executive vice president of the Cruise Line International Association. In general, if something goes wrong and a ship starts to take on water, ""You either take the ship back to a safe port, if it's possible to do that,"" Crye said, or ""if the ship is in imminent danger there are procedures and protocols for abandoning ship."" The captain has to make a series of decisions, Crye said.  He could leave the ship, if he delegates certain responsibilities, but the captain is in charge of the safety of the vessel and remains in charge until everyone on board is safe, Crye said. As for a mayday signal, Crye said the captain is required to report to authorities any ""marine casualty,"" a term that includes damage to the ship that can compromise its safety and ability to safely return to port.  The captain ""is a professional.  He must at that point weigh the risks of taking one course of action vs. another,"" Crye said. Taking place 100 years after the sinking of the Titanic, this disaster is ""remarkably similar,"" McKesson said.  ""Titanic similarly grazed an object on her side. In her case, it was an iceberg, and in her case as the water came in, she tore multiple compartments open.. ""The result of that accident in the engineering side was that we rewrote the ways that we design ships, and those bulkheads that separate the compartments run all the way up to the main deck of the ship. So, you can't get that cascading effect. And we design ships to withstand a certain number of those compartments being breached simultaneously."" Crye agreed that the damage to the Costa Concordia ""appears similar to the damage of the Titanic.""  But ""this was a grounding, not an iceberg,"" and ""in a well-traveled area close to shore -- not in the middle of the ocean."" It's too soon to know whether any new regulations are needed to avoid a disaster like this, said Crye.  But, he said, ""If corrected measures are necessary, I can assure you that we, alongside the Italian authorities, will be suggesting those changes be made.""","Costa Cruises says preliminary indications suggest possible ""significant human error""

"(CNN) -- Comedian Joan Rivers is ""resting comfortably"" in a New York hospital after apparently suffering cardiac and respiratory arrest during a procedure at a medical clinic Thursday. Her daughter, Melissa Rivers, issued a statement Thursday night after arriving at the hospital following a flight from Los Angeles. ""I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming love and support for my mother. She is resting comfortably and is with our family. We ask that you continue to keep her in your thoughts and prayers,"" she said. A law enforcement official told CNN that Rivers stopped breathing during throat surgery. Rivers, 81, was taken by ambulance in critical condition to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. The clinic address given by a New York Fire Department spokesman is a building that houses an endoscopy clinic where doctors perform minor procedures on patients. The clinic is a mile away from the hospital. ""This morning, Joan Rivers was taken to the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, where she is being attended to,"" hospital spokesman Sid Dinsay said in a statement. ""Her family wants to thank everybody for their outpouring of love and support. We will provide an update on her condition as it becomes available."" Rivers had been scheduled to perform her comedy act at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, Friday night. Michael Lucas, who was in the audience for Rivers' show at New York's Beechman Theater Wednesday night, told CNN that she joked about death. ""She said, 'You know I'm 81 years old, and I could drop dead at any moment and you would be so lucky because you will have a story to tell your friends for the rest of your life,'"" Lucas said. ""Then she mimicked people talking about what it was like to see her drop dead on stage."" Rivers was in fine form, he said. ""There was no sign (Wednesday) night that she was declining. Her show was over an hour long and she never stumbled or even paused to catch her breath."" In 2013, Rivers allowed cameras to record a health scare for her and her daughter's reality show, ""Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?"" Rivers said on the show that doctors found a spot on an X-ray after she had a persistent cough. ""We're just not going to be sad about this,"" Rivers said during the episode. ""We're gonna do jokes and be up until we know. That's how I deal with things. I'm not just gonna sit around the next couple of days and go crazy."" Rivers has been open about her health issues. She was diagnosed with osteoporosis in 2002 after a fall down some stairs left her with broken bones, and she became an advocate for screenings for women. She also admitted to not being as healthy as she could be. ""I try not to be, but I'm a terrible eater,"" she said. ""I wish I could say I eat super-healthy, but I don't. I love junk food -- it should be its own food group -- so I help my bones with supplements and medicine.""

"Finley Boyle, a 3-year-old Hawaii girl who suffered massive brain damage after undergoing a dental procedure last month, died Friday night, a hospice said Saturday. The girl died with her family by her side, said Kenneth L. Zeri, president and chief professional officer of Hospice Hawaii. ""There are few greater privileges in life than to accompany someone on their end-of-life journey, providing comfort and support not only to that person but also to their loved ones,"" the statement said. ""As with all of our patients, we were truly blessed to be able to be there for The Boyle Family and for Finley at the end of her journey."" Finley's parents are suing a Kailua, Hawaii, dentist, alleging negligence and dangerous conduct. The lawsuit, filed against Lilly Geyer and her practice, Island Dentistry for Children, alleges improper medications with incorrect dosages were administered to the girl on December 3, according to court documents filed this week. When routine surgeries go wrong . ""As a direct and proximate result of the medications administered to (Finley) by defendants, (Finley) suffered cardiac arrest during her dental procedure,"" the lawsuit says. It alleges that, as a further result of improper medications, Finley ""suffered severe and permanent brain damage."" Neither Geyer nor her attorney, John Nishimoto, responded to CNN's requests for comment. The Island Dentistry website states it has been permanently closed and directs patients to an e-mail address. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Hawaii's First Circuit Court, alleges that Geyer had no plan in place to respond to medical emergencies, such as the one Finley suffered. It seeks unspecified damages. Girl declared brain dead after tonsil surgery . Finley's mother, Ashley Boyle, said she first took her daughter to the dentist in November, when she was told her daughter needed six fillings and four root canals, she said. They returned in December to undergo the root canals, Boyle said. The parents allege that Finley was sedated and left unmonitored for 26 minutes. Finley was moved from a hospital to the hospice in late December. Finley's pediatric neurologist, Dr. Gregory Yen, said MRIs showed the girl suffered severe brain damage and that she was in a ""persistent vegetative state."" 10 shocking medical mistakes .","Girl's parents are suing a dentist alleging negligence and dangerous conduct .

"(CNN) -- Yes, it looks delicious. The peanut butter and chocolate goodness that is the essence of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups now comes in a jar. The announcement of Reese's new spreads came on Election Day - fitting given that the vote is still out on whether this creamy concoction will portend the death of Nutella. Daren Russ, brand manager for Food & Beverage Enhancers with The Hershey Company, said in a statement that the spreads ""offer an authentic Reese's experience to fans who are looking for delicious snack options throughout the day."" ""Since 1928, we have been delivering the perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter,"" he said. ""With the launch of Reese's Spreads, we are honoring our great heritage and bringing consumers a new, but still perfect, way to enjoy the Reese's brand."" The 13-ounce jar will compliment Hershey's existing spread flavors including chocolate, chocolate with almond and chocolate with hazelnut. It's that last combination that has the Huffington Post declaring ""It's only a matter of time before jars of Nutella get pushed toward the back of grocery shelves and begin collecting dust."" But here's why you shouldn't count Nutella out just yet: . 1. It's sparked crazes in the past . The hazelnut spread has literally had people hoarding it. CNN affiliate WABC-TV in New York reported in 2013 that students at Columbia University were costing the school some serious cash by spooning the not-so-cheap delicacy into carryout containers to take back to their dorm rooms. 2. The love is strong . According to its website, Nutella was first imported into the United States more than 25 years ago from Italy. Since then the fan base has spread (see what we just did there?) to the point that there are tons of sites, Pinterest boards and Tumblrs devoted to it. And, of course, there is a Buzzfeed list to tell you whether you're addicted to it. There's even a ""Nutella Love Song"" on YouTube, and trust us, this guy really loves the stuff. 3. The thought of a shortage set off panic . When the media reported that a March 2014 frost in Turkey was threatening the hazelnut crop, and could cause a possible Nutella shortage, the hoarding began again. All we can say is: Bring it Reese's.","New Reese's spread announced on November 5 .

"Theo Visser was thirsty. He got up from his seat during the half-time break in a soccer match to purchase a drink from the concession stand. ""There she was, standing behind the bar,"" he recounts, 58 years later. ""It was love at first sight."" Theo asked the young woman out to a movie -- and the rest, they say, is history. It's quite a shame, then, that Corrie Visser doesn't remember any of this. Or if she does, she can't say so. Corrie is one of 152 residents at Hogewey, a cutting-edge elder care facility on the outskirts of Weesp, the Netherlands, just minutes from downtown Amsterdam. 'Dementia Village' - as it has become known -- is a place where residents can live a seemingly normal life, but in reality are being watched all the time. Caretakers staff the restaurant, grocery store, hair salon and theater -- although the residents don't always realize they are carers -- and are also watching in the residents' living quarters. Residents are allowed to roam freely around the courtyard-like grounds with its landscaped trees, fountains and benches -- but they can't leave the premises. Their two-story dormitory-style homes form a perimeter wall for the village, meaning there is no way a resident can accidentally wander out. And if they do approach the one exit door, a staffer will politely suggest the door is locked and propose another route. Elderly Germans try to avoid care homes . Placing an aging family member here is far less expensive than round-the-clock, in-home care. It also takes an enormous amount of stress off family members who don't have ample time or proper training to care for their loved ones. Corrie has received a diagnosis of severe dementia, meaning she requires attention and support 24 hours a day. That clinical indication is necessary to gain admittance into Hogewey. The burden of caring for Corrie eventually became unmanageable for Theo and his daughters, so together, they made the decision to place her here. He says: ""It's perfect. I wouldn't know a better place for her. It's 100% good."" Nearly every day of the week, Theo drives 15 kilometers (10 miles) each way to spend a few hours with his 80-year-old wife. ""I do it for myself,"" he says. ""I need it for myself. She (still) recognizes everyone... so it's important I be here every day."" Although they can't chat with each other, Theo and Corrie will often sit for hours, holding hands and lovingly look into each other's eyes. Every so often, Corrie offers a smile, a laugh, a squeeze of the hand. At least part of her memory, it seems, is still intact, though she can't verbalize much these days. Like other residents of Hogewey, Corrie may not know exactly where she is, but she always feels right at home. That's precisely the idea. For Yvonne van Amerongen, one of Hogewey's founders, the need to create the small village was deeply personal. ""It was the moment my mother called me and told me my father had passed away suddenly,"" she recalls. ""Nothing was wrong with him. He just had a heart attack and he died. One of the first things I thought was, 'Thank God he never had to be in a nursing home.' That's crazy that I have to think that! I'm in the management of a nursing home and I don't want my father to come here."" Five things CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta learned at the center . Van Amerongen sat down with her colleagues in November 1992 to discuss how they could transform the typical nursing home into more worthwhile living. They created a 1.5 hectare (four-acre) complex, completed in 2009, that is home to 23 housing units and seven different ""lifestyle themes,"" such as crafts, culture, religious and urban. Art lovers get paintings on the walls and music is always playing while the religious get more conservative décor and Christian crosses on the walls. The simple goal: provide the most normal possible life, reminiscent of each individual's formative years. From the furnishing of her unit to the decorations and the type of food served, Corrie is led to believe that nothing in her life has changed. It's this sense of normalcy that they strive for day in and day out at Hogewey. Study finds loneliness linked to dementia . In some ways, this is similar to the manufactured reality depicted in the movie ""The Truman Show,"" where a man played by Jim Carrey discovers his entire life is actually a TV program. Everything he thinks is real is in fact a mirage, created by television producers for the viewing public's entertainment. Van Amerongen dismisses any accusations that she and her staff are duping their residents.  ""We have a real society here,"" she says. ""I don't think people feel fooled. They feel fooled if we just tell them a story that's not true and they know it. We're not telling stories."" But telling stories is exactly what some of the residents do, all day long, including Corrie's housemate, Jo Verhoef. Like all of Hogewey's residents, Jo's dementia is rapidly progressing. Her ""loop"" is getting shorter; the conversations she carries and the questions she asks are becoming more repetitive in a shorter amount of time. ""Do you know Steve Matthew?"" she asks, multiple times over the course of an hour. Of course, no one does, but each time she seems surprised that we haven't met. * . Steve may be a relic of Jo's past, a distant, foggy memory of a baseball player she says lived with her for a short time when she was younger. Or, he may be a figment of her imagination. Sadly, we'll never know. Brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind . Worldwide, 35.6 million people have dementia, according to the World Health Organization, with 7.7 million new cases being diagnosed every year. At that rate, the number of people with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. This will be an additional burden for governments already struggling to contain the runaway costs of health care. In Holland, everyone pays into the state health care system during their working years, with the money then disbursed to pay for later-in-life expenses - and that means living in Hogewey does not cost any more than a traditional nursing home. Could this innovative model work in other countries? Health care industry leaders in Germany, England, Switzerland and Japan are all beginning to take notice. At Hogewey, says van Amerongen, ""We have Dutch design, Dutch cultures, Dutch lifestyles, but the concept is to value the person, the individual... to support them to live their life as usual, and you can do that anywhere."" On a physical level, residents at Hogewey require fewer medications; they eat better, and yes, they live longer. On a mental level, they also seem to have more joy. It's a difficult thing to measure, but that is the most important thing here at Hogewey. So could this work in other parts of the world? That's the next question.","Dutch dementia facility shows new way of providing long term care .

"(CNN)Here's the hard reality about illegal immigration: Politicians can change policies. Judges can issue decisions. But the issue will not go away until Americans change their behavior. Trial lawyers have a favorite saying: ""When you have the facts on your side, you pound the facts into the table. When you have the law on your side, you pound the law into the table. When neither the facts nor the law are on your side, you pound the table!"" In November, when President Obama announced that he would take executive actions to re-prioritize the enforcement of immigration laws so that some illegal immigrants could obtain a three-year delay in their deportation proceedings and a temporary work permit, critics had neither the facts nor the law on their side. So they pounded the table. Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators charged that Obama was pushing an ""unlawful amnesty"" that threatened the republic. Yet most of the law professors and legal experts who weighed in, even the conservatives, acknowledged that Obama was acting within the power of the presidency. Critics didn't seem to have a legal leg to stand on. That is, until this week. In Texas, a federal judge temporarily blocked Obama's executive action and cleared the way for a lawsuit against the administration brought by that state and 25 others. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, a George W. Bush appointee with a history of taking conservative positions on immigration issues,  bought the plaintiffs' argument that Obama's executive actions would unfairly result in ""direct damages"" to the states. Hanen claimed that Obama's executive action could result in ""bestowing multiple and otherwise unobtainable benefits"" on those illegal immigrants who qualify for deferred action. This would include the undocumented parents of U.S.-born children. Yet, most so-called ""benefits"" — driver's licenses, college aid, medical care — come not from the federal government but from the states, and at their discretion. In all, Hanen's ruling went on for 123 pages. Still, he ducked the central question: whether the President had exceeded the authority granted to the office under the Constitution. Instead, the judge ruled that the administration had not complied with the Administrative Procedure Act, which calls for a longer notification and comment period from lawmakers and the public before taking action. Imagine if there had been a comment period before acting in the war on terror. Buildings would be smoldering, and we'd still be talking. The White House -- while saying that it would abide by the judge's ruling — also reiterated that the President was ""well within his legal authority"" to set enforcement priorities. The Justice Department intends to appeal the decision. This case could end up before the Supreme Court, where most of the justices have smiled on expanding executive power. The coalition of states that brought the lawsuit — which is led by Texas — includes Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. It figures that, when there's a mess, Texas will be in the middle of it. I lived there for five years — about a decade ago — while writing for the Dallas Morning News. And I smell hypocrisy. During my time in the Lone Star State, I often heard people complain about illegal immigrants. But I never heard them say a word about the employers who hire them to do jobs that Texans won't do such as tarring roofs in 100-degree weather or cleaning windows on skyscrapers. The folks doing the hiring are always the root of the problem, but — in a red state like Texas — you can't get Republicans to say that. It's safer for politicians to pick on people who don't vote than to risk antagonizing those who not only vote but also contribute money to campaigns. The states that brought this lawsuit are worried that, if Obama allows some illegal immigrants to remain in this country for three years, they'll have to pick up the tab for providing services. Where was this concern over the many years that these states were standing on the positive side of the ledger by benefiting from illegal immigrant labor — so much so that they turned a blind eye to the employers and businesses using it? How did these 26 states wind up with so many illegal immigrants? The undocumented didn't go there for the scenery. They went because someone was waiting there to offer them a job. We never talk about that, or do anything about it. And so, no matter what courts decide or politicians decree, the problem of illegal immigration will never go away. That's the truth that needs to be pounded into the table.","Judge blocks implementation of Obama's immigration executive actions .

"Ever since H. G. Wells' trailblazing novel ""The Time Machine,"" time travel has been a staple of science fiction. The idea of traveling through time is deeply fascinating: you get into a machine, press a few buttons, and step out not just somewhere else, but ""somewhen"" else. It's easy to imagine, but can it really be done? Yes it can, at least in a limited sense. Over a century ago, Albert Einstein showed that time is intrinsically elastic, capable of being stretched or shrunk by motion. Fly from London to New York and back, and you will leap a split second into the future of stay-at-home Londoners. The effect can easily be measured using atomic clocks and involves only billionths of a second -- too brief for a person to notice, and hardly the stuff of ""Doctor Who"" television series-style adventures. Read more: Scientists -- particles appear to travel faster than light . But time stretching can be magnified by increasing the speed. Close to the speed of light (about 300,000 kilometers per second), time warps become startling. Fly to the star Vega, 25 light years away, and back again at 99% of the speed of light, and when you return to Earth in 2062, you will have experienced only seven years travel time in the spacecraft. In effect, you will have leaped 42 years into Earth's future. So travel into the future is not only possible, we have done it, although so far in only paltry amounts. How about going back in time? That is far more problematic and remains an active area of research. Einstein found that not only speed affects time, gravity does too. Time runs a little bit faster on the roof, where gravity is imperceptibly weaker, than in the basement, for example. A really big time warp requires an intense gravitational field. Black holes are the best; near their surfaces time is slowed almost to a standstill relative to us. Indeed, black holes are black because outgoing light is trapped in slow motion. However, hanging out near a black hole is not only dangerous, it still only represents travel into the future; it gets you to the future quicker. Getting to the past requires something even weirder than a black hole -- a wormhole. Read more: The great time travel debate . Wormholes in space are shortcuts linking distant points -- a bit like that other sci-fi favorite, the star gate. Leap through one and you might come out on the other side of the galaxy a few minutes later. If wormholes exist, they could be adapted to make time machines that send you into the future if you traverse them in one direction, but into the past if you go in the other direction. Like a black hole, a wormhole would be a massive gravitational space and time warping object. But whereas a black hole represents a one-way journey to nowhere -- jump in and you can never get out -- a wormhole has an exit as well as an entrance. Do wormholes exist? Black holes certainly do, but nobody has yet glimpsed any sign of its cousin, the wormhole. Furthermore, some physicists are so uneasy about their potential for being portals to the past that they flat-out reject the very idea. The problem concerns those familiar time travel paradoxes, like going back in time and murdering your mother before you were born. Physicists call these causal loop paradoxes, and they affront our desire for the universe to be a rational and ordered system. If cause and effect get muddled up in time, what does that do for our notions of reality? Read more: 'Looper's' potential for real world time travel . In spite of these misgivings, there is nothing in Einstein's theory of space, time and gravitation to forbid journeying into the past, a possibility that Einstein himself hated. Not only wormholes, but several other mechanisms have been found that, according to Einstein's theory, can be used to travel back in time. All these proposals suffer from the problem of extreme impracticality, though. Building a human-sized wormhole, for example, would require harnessing vast amounts of peculiar quantum field energy and deploying gravitational stabilizing technology that would need the resources of a cosmic super-civilization. For many scientists, however, it is the principle that counts, not the practical engineering. And here there is an intriguing possibility. Few physicists think Einstein had the last word on gravitation, and some modern extensions of his work make an extraordinary prediction. The Large Hadron Collider -- the giant accelerating machine that created the Higgs boson -- might just make a tiny wormhole for long enough that its time-bending effects could be glimpsed.","Nearly 100 years ago, Albert Einstein showed that motion could stretch or shrink time .

"Washington (CNN) -- Top Democrats put the issue of climate change back in the spotlight Tuesday, debating legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions while announcing $3.4 billion in new clean energy funds. A key congressional committee began hearings on a ""cap-and-trade"" bill requiring emissions to be cut by more than 80 percent over the next four decades. Questions related to global warming have been among the most politically contentious in recent years. Democrats are generally more receptive to proposals designed to curb energy consumption in order to slow climate change; leading Republicans continue to express concern about the necessity and economic impact of such measures. President Obama has made the push for greater investment in a clean energy agenda one of his top domestic priorities. Attempting to move that agenda forward, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee kicked off hearings on the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act. Supporters say the bill would reduce nationwide greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a cap-and-trade program under which companies would buy and sell emissions credits. Almost one-third of the credits would be given away to the electric power sector through 2026 in an effort to diminish negative economic effects. Leading Democrats have expressed optimism that the bill would help stimulate the creation of new ""green energy"" jobs. The measure is similar to a climate change bill narrowly passed by the House of Representatives in June. Scientists ""tell us that we have a narrow window of time in which to avert the ravages of global warming,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. Boxer, who chairs the environment committee, called the legislation ""our best insurance against a dangerous future."" It is ""a responsible approach that sets attainable goals for gradual reductions in carbon emissions, and it protects consumers, businesses and workers as we move toward clean energy,"" she said. Committee Republicans tore into the measure. It is ""a tax, and it will mean more economic pain and suffering and fewer jobs,"" warned Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma. ""The victims of cap-and-trade can't just move on and get new, green jobs. The transition will mean leaving high-paying jobs, moving away from hometowns and significant reductions in lifetime earnings,"" he said. Administration officials testified on behalf of the bill, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson. In all, 54 witnesses are scheduled to testify on the bill over the next three days. Obama, meanwhile, unveiled what the White House called the largest energy grid modernization investment in American history. At a Florida solar energy center, the president announced $3.4 billion in Smart Grid Investment Grant awards. ""By facilitating the creation of a clean energy economy, building this 21st century energy infrastructure will help us lay a foundation for lasting growth and prosperity,"" Obama said. The White House said the awards, which are being funded through the $787 billion stimulus act, will fund ""a broad range of technologies that will spur the nation's transition to a smarter, stronger, more efficient and reliable electric system."" Among other things, the awards will help support the installation of ""smart meters"" designed to help consumers monitor and control their energy consumption. The awards, going to 100 private companies, utilities and cities, will be divided into grants ranging from $400,000 to $200 million. They will be matched by $4.7 billion in private sector funds. Vice President Joe Biden also highlighted the issue of global warming Tuesday, visiting a former General Motors plant in Delaware that is being converted to allow for the production of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The plant is being purchased by California-based Fisker Automotive for an estimated $18 million. The new climate change push is being made against a backdrop of broad public support for federal action to slow global warming. Six in 10 Americans support a cap-and-trade proposal to cut pollution, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey. Thirty-seven percent are opposed to such a plan. The survey indicates a generational divide, with 68 percent of Americans under age 50 supporting cap-and-trade, but those 50 and older split on the issue. ""This is one more example of the growing generation gap that is shaping politics and policy in this country,"" said Keating Holland, CNN polling director. ""Younger Americans voted for Obama and tend to welcome change. Older Americans were less enamored of change in the 2008 election, and senior citizens were the only age group that voted for John McCain."" The poll also suggests a partisan divide, with three in four Democrats backing the proposal and nearly six in 10 independents on board as well, but only four in 10 Republicans supporting ""cap and trade."" ""Independents believe in global warming and believe that the government can take steps to curtail the problem,"" Holland said. ""But the environment is not a big priority for independents, as it is with Democrats."" The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted October 16-18, with 1,038 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Senate Environment and Public Works Committee debates act to cut greenhouse gases .

"(CNN) -- The parties activists organized to watch President Barack Obama's immigration speech were supposed to be festive affairs. But Felipe Diosdado said he didn't feel much like smiling Thursday night, even though Obama's new plan will give him a chance to avoid deportation and find a better job. ""People are crying,"" he told CNN in a phone interview from Chicago. ""I can't celebrate this, because there are a lot of people left out."" The White House estimates nearly 5 million people will benefit from Obama's new executive action. But that's less than half of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, Diosdado said. Before the highly anticipated speech Thursday night, reactions were already mixed -- even among the millions of people directly affected by his announcement. The President's plan to bypass Congress is a controversial move that has riled Republican leaders who say Obama is overstepping his constitutional bounds. It has also come under fire from those who want a more extensive overhaul and drawn swift opposition from critics, who call it an unfair amnesty that rewards lawbreakers. After the speech, confusion surrounding what comes next showed no sign of slowing. Cheers erupted at a rally outside the White House. Some people seemed stunned; others, overjoyed. ""I want to cry tears of happiness,"" said Maya Ledezma, a 32-year-old mom from Mexico who watched the speech at a party in Maryland. Because her 6-year-old daughter is a U.S. citizen and she's been in the United States for more than five years, Ledezma is among the millions who Obama said can step out of the shadows if they submit to a background check and pay back taxes. After years of living in constant fear of being deported, she said Obama's announcement gave her hope that she will watch her daughter grow up and succeed. ""This is a great relief,"" she said, ""a victory, an obstacle that we have overcome."" 'My head hurts' At another watch party in Washington, Jose Luis Zelaya said his head was spinning. For years, the Honduran immigrant has been on the front lines of immigration activism in the United States, pushing for reforms in Washington while continuing his graduate studies at Texas A&M University, where he also ran for student body president. In 2012, he was elated after qualifying for Obama's program that stopped the deportation of the so-called Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. ""Now, maybe I will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me,"" he told CNN at the time. ""There is no fear anymore."" On Thursday, he hoped he'd be able to call his mother and giver her the same good news. But the parents of Dreamers weren't included in new rules Obama outlined. ""My head hurts, because my mother doesn't benefit from this. And I am where I am because of my mother. And everything that I do is because of her,"" Zelaya said. ""I just got off the phone with her, and those five minutes seemed so long. But she told me, 'We've got to keep fighting.'"" 'It's what we were waiting for' At first, Mario didn't believe it. Before Obama's speech, he told CNN he was trying not to get his hopes up. ""They've been talking about this for years,"" he said. ""I don't take it very seriously. My wife is happy about it. But we are always realistic."" On Thursday night, the 48-year-old undocumented immigrant, who asked that only his first name be used, said he'd listened to the speech with his family in their south Georgia home. ""I feel good, a little excited, not just for me, but for many others,"" he said. ""It's what we were waiting for."" Mario has been living in the United States for 14 years after leaving his home in Mexico in search of better job prospects. He found them, and he's worked on farms harvesting onions and packing pine straw for more than a decade. His 9-year-old daughter, the youngest of his three children, is a U.S. citizen, making him and his wife eligible under the new measure. And they plan to speak with an immigration lawyer and apply to use Obama's plan as soon as possible. Still, he said, they know everything could change with the stroke of a future president's pen. ""Nothing is impossible. Later they could change their policies and deport us more easily, or something like that. It's difficult because we don't know what ideas others will have,"" he said. Mario's 18-year-old daughter Celeste is among the more than half a million Dreamers who received deferred action under Obama's 2012 rule. But without relief for her parents, she told CNN last year it was ""like being out in the cold and me having the only blanket in the family."" After Thursday's speech, she said she was hopeful things might change dramatically soon. ""The fear of being separated won't be there anymore, and that's the biggest thing we just want to get rid of,"" she said. But she's still waiting. ""I won't be truly happy until I can see it happen,"" she said. ""One thing is to hear it, and the other thing is to actually see it."" Group of 'Dreamers' grows . For one of America's most well known undocumented immigrants, Obama's announcement was welcome news he'd been waiting decades to hear. Jose Antonio Vargas became an outspoken advocate pushing for an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws in 2011, when he revealed he was undocumented in a column for The New York Times Magazine. Because of an age cap in Obama's 2012 deferred action plan, Vargas didn't qualify. But on Thursday, Obama announced he was removing the age limit. After the speech, Vargas said he was thrilled. Now, he says he'll finally be able to get permission to return to the Philippines and visit his mother after 21 years apart. ""It's one of those things where I've been thinking about it all day, and it hasn't really sunk in,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I have been here since I was 12 -- 21 years. For somebody to just say, OK, now it is OK. You can get a work permit. You can get a driver's license. You can travel outside the country. ... It's a great night.""

"Certain products are definitely OK to rent. Like a car. Or a tuxedo. Or the cheapest room at a Motel 6 when you find yourself strolling down I-85 at midnight with no pants. Things are weird at home. But a Los Angeles-based company caught the internet's attention this week for renting something completely unexpected: wives. Yes, the Rent-a-Wife might just be as horribly misogynistic as it sounds. Because it's pretty much what you think it is: a housekeeping and odd jobs service where renters can choose a ""wife"" from three pricing tiers, ranging from the Starter Wife to the Good Wife to the Trophy Wife. The company's founder, Juliette Bresnahan, says most of her clients are actually women. So, who the hell knows? What really matters is that, clearly, if you just surf the Web long enough, you'll find lots of really weird stuff you can rent. So I did. Alas, when I started Googling ""rent a ..."" followed by each letter of the alphabet (minus vowels and X) to see what would autofill, this is what I found: . Rent-a-Bay: A self-service garage in Kent, Washington, Rent-a-Bay is where you can work on your own vehicle with the same professional conveniences of a mechanic. It's a good idea, but there's also a 100% chance I would kill both myself and others in the process of changing a spark plug. Rent-a-Center: This is a fairly well-known store for rent-to-own furniture and appliances. It's also not a bad rebuilding option for the Phoenix Suns. Rent-a-Dreads: This one sort of blew me away, for it has nothing to do with leasing a temporary dreadlock weave like the words might suggest. It's actually a term used in regards to female sex tourism. In the Caribbean and Central America, male sex workers are often referred to as Rent-a-Dreads. In America, a male sex worker is simply known as ""Dave with access to Craigslist."" Rent-a-Friend: This site claims to have ""Friends from around the world available for hire,"" perfect for anyone who just needs a buddy. Some of the activities they say people are using Rent-a-Friend for are sporting events, wine tasting and hot air balloon rides. ""Hi. I'm Gary. Would you like to ride in a balloon with me?"" ""Hi. I'm Tina. No."" Rent-a-Goat: This is just what it sounds like. You rent a goat and then let it eat unwanted plants and weeds. But, really, I just want to get one for my dog. ""Mikey, this is goat. Goat, this is Mikey. If you need me, I'll be inside shopping for friends."" Rent-a-Home: A house leasing company in Greensboro, North Carolina, somehow managed to come up first in my Google search. Which isn't very exciting. But right below it was Rent-a-Husband. Their slogan is ""For those jobs that never get done!"" which leads me to believe they specialize in renting out alcoholics who like watching football. ""My Rent-a-Husband was just as advertised! The garbage disposal is still busted, and he left the toilet seat up. Would definitely use again. Five stars!"" Rent-a-John: If you live in the Carolinas and need a temporary outdoor toilet that doubles as a sweat lodge, these guys have you covered. Rent-a-Kid: This is the title of a really bad Leslie Nielsen movie from 1995 about a guy who rents out orphans. I actually found it on YouTube and watched the entire thing when I literally could've been doing anything else with my time. Like riding in a balloon with Gary. Rent-a-List: Put that coffee down! This lead generator aims to help people in sales find potential customers to sign on the line that is dotted. A ... B ... C ... Always Be Cluttering people's inboxes. Rent-a-Midget: Lacking morals? Having a party? Looking for alternative entertainment? You're in luck. ""Barb, I have the perfect idea for Brian's bar mitzvah reception!"" Rent-a-Negro: Back in 2003, damali ayo -- who, officially, doesn't capitalize the first letters of her name -- created this (now-defunct) website as a form of ""Web-art-performance"" based around the fact that she felt like a ""professional black person"" to her white friends. Through Rent-a-Negro, she created a special mock rental form so white people could request services such as touching her hair, teaching them how to dance and speaking with their racist grandmother. She eventually turned her art experience into a book called ""How to Rent a Negro."" Because that's what I need on my shelf. Rent-a-Pet: This led to several articles about renting animals. On that note, my dog is now available for quinceañeras. Rent-a-Quote: Turns out, this is a term used to describe someone who will shamelessly provide a comment to the media on pretty much any topic. Usually, this person's motivation is money and/or exposure. I enjoy both. Call me. Rent-a-Ruminant: Ruminants are mammals that eat plants and then barf out the cud. Thus, we have yet another service for renting out goats. I wonder if my new friend Gary knows about this. Rent-a-Swag: Comedian Aziz Ansari portrays the character Tom Haverford on NBC's ""Parks and Recreation."" In the fifth season, he comes up with a business idea for renting expensive clothes to boys in middle school who, because they are still growing, have parents who won't buy them nice things. We had Rent-a-Swag growing up. It was called crappy hand-me-downs from my brother. Rent-a-Text: This just takes you to a site for textbook rentals. When I was in college, I once opened a textbook. It was exhausting. Rent-a-Van: It appears Enterprise strategically cornered the Internet market for when you absolutely, positively need an all-white windowless van. They're perfect for driving slowly down sorority row while breathing heavily. Chicks dig that. Rent-a-Wheel: This is the ""largest rent-to-own custom wheel and tire retailer in the nation."" Excellent. I've been thinking of tricking out my Saturn. Rent-a-Yurt: Ask anyone. Nothing is more fun than camping in a large round room. ""Ha! Ha! Whee! No corners!"" So, if you want to rent a yurt lodge somewhere in America, Yurt Lodging will help get you there. Because we all want a round room at the end of the day. Rent-a-Zilla: This search leads you to a specifically titled strip from a Web comic called MegaTokyo by Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston. It involves ninjas and jails and monsters. Kind of like my bris. But that's a long story. And I'm saving it for my balloon ride with Gary.

"(CNN)An anonymous letter bitterly insulting African-American officers was recently found in mailboxes at a Connecticut police station. It was written on official letterhead, CNN affiliate WFSB reported. It starts out with the words ""WHITE POWER"" in capital letters.  And it contains a line that reads, ""These Black Officers belong in the toilet."" It ends at the bottom with a repeat of the words ""WHITE POWER."" The letter was flagged to authorities by a police organization for minority officers, The Bridgeport Guardians. Though decidedly racist against all black officers, the letter singles out one in particular -- Clive Higgins, who a jury recently acquitted of using undue force in the kicking of a detained man lying at the feet of Higgins. Two other officers, one Hispanic and one white, were also involved. Those men -- Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor -- resigned from the force, pleaded guilty to the kicking charges and will serve three months in prison, local news site ctpost.com reported. The incident in May 2011 was caught on video and posted to YouTube. The unsteady shot begins with the nattering sound of a Taser, before the lens sways over to a man on the ground. Two police officers appear to try to cuff him, then both of them kick him. A third officer, African-American, pulls up in a squad car and launches one small kick at the detained man lying on the ground. Whoever wrote the racist letter apparently didn't like that Higgins was acquitted alone and threatened his life for not going along with his convicted colleagues. ""You better watch your back. We know where you live. Your face was all over the newspaper. Remember you have no duty weapon to defend yourself,"" it read. Local news site ctpost.com posted a copy of the letter online.

"Ali Muhammad Brown was focused on one thing, authorities say. ""My mission is vengeance. For the lives, millions of lives are lost every day...[in] Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, all these places where innocent lives are being taken every single day. ... So, a life for a life."" That is what law enforcement say Brown told a police investigator in New Jersey when he was interviewed in July. The U.S. government was doing ""evil"" within its own borders, too, Brown told law enforcement, according to court papers. Brown, a 29-year-old from Seattle, is the prime suspect in a killing spree stretching from New Jersey to Washington state. Between April and June, police say, Brown killed three people in Washington state, allegedly shooting them at close range late at night in quiet locations. Also in June, 19-year-old college student Brendan Tevlin was found inside an SUV in West Orange, New Jersey, dead of multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said. Police say they traced the gun used in all of the killings to Brown. Brown confessed, according to court documents, telling investigators he strictly follows the Muslim faith and had become angry with what he believed the U.S. was doing abroad. Sources tell CNN that Brown was born in the United States and has family in New Jersey. He was convicted of bank fraud in federal court in 2005 and served time in jail. The FBI tried unsuccessfully to link that case to fundraising for terrorists in Africa, said a former FBI official in Seattle. Authorities say one of Brown's co-defendants in that case fled to Somalia to fight with the militant group Al-Shabaab. Officials have not said Brown was motivated by a specific terrorist group, and the killings he's accused of committing happened before the U.S. bombing campaign on ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. ""Based on the statements he made, I believe you could prove that this is a terrorism offense,"" but that doesn't necessarily mean that Brown should be prosecuted in federal court, said Amy Jeffress, a former prosecutor and attorney with Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C. She served two years as chief of the National Security Section in the D.C. Attorney's Office, and oversaw investigations and prosecutions of international and domestic terrorism and espionage. As of now, Brown faces state murder charges which carry a life sentence, but authorities could bring more charges. Brown pleaded not guilty in his first court appearance in New Jersey.

"UK company Hornby's model planes and trains have been made in low-cost emerging markets for decades. Now, piece by piece, production is being brought back home. Hornby's iconic model plane kit, part of the company's Airfix range, will soon be made in the UK. The company will be making up to 1,000 of the kits a day.

""Airfix actually went to India, but the marketplace is changing now."" Read more: How the skies tell Head if business will be sunny or gloomy . Hornby's reversal is the latest in the trend of ""backshoring"" that has seen British businesses such as Topshop, Symington's, Caldeira, and DFS, all repatriating some manufacturing from China in the face of rising labor costs overseas. Canham says offshoring production has never been easy.

In China, private-sector wages rose 14% in 2012, compared to a 12.3% increase the previous year, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.

Longtime Rolling Stones background singer Bernard Fowler sang ""Will the Circle be Unbroken,"" while Dave Stewart played guitar. Jagger, 70, posted a personal statement about Scott's death on his website last week: ""I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me."" Scott, a lanky former model, became a celebrity stylist and eventually a designer. She designed costumes for films such as the 1996 remake of ""Diabolique,"" 2000's ""Mercy"" and 2007's ""Ocean's Thirteen."" In addition to her haute couture creations, she designed a collection for Banana Republic that was introduced late last year. Madonna, Allison Williams and Christina Hendricks were among her celebrity clients. But she was most closely associated with Jagger -- not just for designing the  rocker's duds for the Rolling Stones' 50th anniversary tour, which began in 2012, but for being his longtime companion. The couple had been dating since at least 2003. Jo Wood, the ex-wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, said the precarious finances of Scott's fashion business may have played a role in the apparent suicide. ""I think it might have been, for her, a question of losing face,"" the 59-year-old Wood told CNN in an exclusive interview last week. ""She was such a proud woman that, I think, to face that, well maybe that was the trigger.""

"It's no secret nowadays that some fashion bloggers wield just as much influence as magazine editors in shaping trends and sharing the latest news and images from the runways. Still, it takes more than a pretty face and fancy photography to make a blogger rise above the rest. ""Bloggers that have a particular angle with their content have a definite advantage over others,"" said Jennine Jacob, founder of Independent Fashion Bloggers, an online community where fashion bloggers share resources and build their brands. ""With the ones that stand out, when you read their blog you don't just see pretty pictures. You walk away with something."" It's what distinguishes hobbyists from professional bloggers, many of whom put in 10 hours a day to run their sites as full-time jobs and prefer titles such as editor, style expert or influencer. Some have agents or publicists, business plans, endorsements and licensing agreements with other brands. Some operate on a shoestring budget as they search for ways to monetize their sites. Many attend summits and conferences, such as the annual Independent Fashion Bloggers Conference in New York during Fashion Week, which wrapped last week, to learn how to grow their brands. A day in the life of a ""Man Repeller"" at New York Fashion Week . Call it what you want: voice, perspective, expertise. But the ones who have it are the ones you're probably already following.

"Eurostar plans to launch a ""state of the art"" fleet of trains that can carry passengers to the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, according to the company's boss. Nicolas Petrovic, chief executive of the European high-speed train company, expects the new carriers and routes to be online within the next three to four years, as the rail operator looks to rebuild and make a ""fresh start."" EXPLORE INTERACTIVE: How confident are you in the euro? Speaking with CNN's Nina dos Santos, Petrovic said the company would ""grab the opportunity of open access in Europe."" He added: ""What we really want to do is gain market share against the airlines."" The international train operator has built its success by bridging the gap between the UK and Europe, running services from London to Brussels and Paris. But after nearly two decades of monopoly over the Channel Tunnel, Eurostar is facing competition for the undersea rail line as German operator Deutsche Bahn prepares to launch a London to Brussels service. READ MORE: Model trains motor their way back home . Petrovic said he is not worried by the prospect of rivalry for the London to Europe routes. He added: ""We'll see who the customers prefer but in my view it will grow the overall market."" Eurostar tickets for an adult traveling from London to Paris cost £69 ($104) for standard class to £250 ($378) for business class. Petrovic told CNN that the company was looking ""very carefully"" at pricing, adding that the biggest cost to Eurostar's business is the levy on using the Channel tunnel. READ MORE: How American apple pie is warming struggling Spain . In June, the European Commission told Eurotunnel  -- the France-based manager of the Channel Tunnel -- to cut its charges for passenger and freight trains using the route. The Commission claimed the charges were too high and discouraged passengers from traveling by train while hurting the freight industry. Petrovic said: ""We have to pay per passenger a fee which is something like 30 euros...if you sell a ticket at let's say £79 or £69 return, a big chunk of that money is going to the tunnel so the European Commission said numbers should come down.

"Could an Amazon Prime membership become a first-class ticket to shopping across the Web? That seems to be what Amazon hopes. Amazon has announced it will extend some of the perks it gives Prime members, like free two-day shipping, on other websites. Tom Taylor, a vice president at Amazon, made the announcement Tuesday at Money2020, an online marketing conference in Las Vegas. The first such agreement will be with AllSaints, a British fashion retailer. ""Think about the possibilities,"" Rick Ascott, digital director at AllSaints, said at the event. ""I can see a day when Prime members will have access to sneak previews and first chance to shop our new collections."" Ascott said the partnership is aimed at getting new customers into AllSaints' virtual doors. Launched in 2005, Amazon Prime is a $99 annual membership that grants privileges such as faster shipping and access to the company's library of streaming movies and music. In addition to the fee, Amazon likes Prime members because they tend to spend more money on the site. The extended Prime benefits are part of Login and Pay with Amazon, an existing program the company has with outside retailers. Companies pay a fee to Amazon in return for making it possible for online shoppers to buy instantly using their Amazon accounts. Ascott said the relationship has been a productive one. Amazon customers who put items in their ""shopping cart"" have been 34% more likely to purchase them, he said, and spend 15% more than non-Amazon customers. But some retailers have been reluctant to give Amazon a bigger hand in how their business gets done on the Web. The company has been accused in the past of lowering its own prices to put the squeeze on competitors, even to the point of taking a short-term loss on some products. And tech blog Re/Code quotes unnamed retailers as saying they're not inclined to advertise their products on Amazon -- a component of the Login and Pay plan -- because they can't control the context in which their ads will appear. ""When we go to open a store in the mall, we're very careful about who is around us,"" one retail executive told Re/code. ""On Amazon, because they are serving up customized results, our stuff may appear next to some Joe Schmo or third party selling similar goods at half the price.""","Amazon will give Prime benefits to members on other sites .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Zaza Pachulia is a sporting hero in his home country -- the basketball player has gone from shooting hoops in the Republic of Georgia to playing in the NBA in Atlanta, Georgia. Standing at 6 feet 11 inches tall, Pachulia looks like he was born to play pro basketball. Indeed, the sport is in his blood: His mother was a professional basketball player in the Republic of Georgia and once played for the Soviet national team. Growing up in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi while it was still part of the Soviet Union, Pachulia followed her example. ""My mom used to be a basketball player so I was really into it,"" he told CNN. ""Plus of course my height made it easier for me to decide what kind of sport I wanted to play, so at the age of nine I went to my first basketball practice."" Five years later he was talent-spotted by the Turkish basketball federation, which was in Georgia accompanying the Turkish national team. Aged 14 Pachulia moved to Turkey to play with the development team for Istanbul club UlkerSpor. ""That was the biggest moment for my life and career, because in that situation, moving to another country for a 14-year-old kid, that was a serious thing,"" said Pachulia. ""Plus I'm the only child in my family so that was a tough call for my parents as well. With that move we basically made basketball our number one priority."" ""My goal was like to play in the NBA. I didn't want to leave my country, my people, my friends -- even my school. If I was going there I would go to reach that goal."" Pachulia nearly returned home the next year, following the death of his father, but he decided to stay in Istanbul. In 2000, aged 16, he graduated to the full team, becoming one of the youngest players in the Euroleague. In 2003 he entered his name in the NBA Draft and was selected by Orlando Magic. Since 2005 he has played for the Atlanta Hawks, but Pachulia retains strong ties with his homeland. Pachulia is involved in charity projects to help children in Atlanta and in his homeland to equip and train youth basketball teams. ""It's definitely important to never forget where you're coming from, where you were born and raised,"" he told CNN. ""After the season I always go back to my country and try to make the kids happy. That's the best feeling for me, when I see those smiling faces on the kids and you know how excited they are. I can tell you I feel the same way ... and that's a great feeling."" At the end of the NBA season, Pachulia also returns to his country -- where he is captain of the national team -- to play basketball. ""Every summer I go back to my country,"" he says.  [I have] so many friends and family members. It's so far from Georgia to Georgia that not everybody can afford to come here, people are working there or they can't leave family, so I miss them and they miss me."" ""I'm so nervous and excited to play for the national team. It's a great feeling in front of your fans, [in] the place where you were born and raised, and the friends come and see your game because you're not going to see them until next summer,"" he added. Last year, Pachulia bought an Atlanta restaurant and has introduced one of Georgia's most traditional products to the menu -- its wine. ""A lot of people don't know about my country but it's really old. [There's] a lot of history, a lot of tradition, especially from the wine side. Wine there is really one of the best in the world ... so that's why I wanted to give people a chance to try this Georgian wine."" ""I'm sure people will like it. There are some states actually selling it but we don't have any in Atlanta, Georgia, so we are really excited to be one of the first restaurants to have Georgian wine.""

"They come from all over the world wearing her apparel or even dressed as her lookalike. It is, after all, the first convention for an icon whose image of irrepressible cuteness can send its worshippers swooning. Hello Kitty is celebrating its 40th year in grand fashion in one of downtown Los Angeles' classiest museums, and there are so many exhibits and so much merchandise for sale in the Museum of Contemporary Art that Hello Kitty fans are finding it hard to say  goodbye. Even songstress Katy Perry made an appearance to receive a Hello Kitty tattoo on her finger. As celebratory as it is, the owners of Hello Kitty forbid any use of Happy Birthday Kitty salutations. Instead, they insist on calling the first ""Hello Kitty Con"" an anniversary party. Though the icon's official ""birthday"" is November 1, the faithful never use an age for her, explains Harvard professor Christine R. Yano, who's written a book about Hello Kitty. ""We are celebrating Hello Kitty's 40th anniversary, and it's just a global gathering of Hello Kitty fans from around the world to celebrate their love for Hello Kitty,"" said Dave Marchi, senior director of marketing for the Japanese firm Sanrio, owner of the character and its global merchandising. ""Hello Kitty means so much to so many people in many different ways,"" he added. ""But I think it's easily explained she's just an ambassador of happiness, and she connects with people emotionally so she's all about happiness and friendship and fun."" Hello billion of dollars in sales . Hello Kitty is also big business: she did more than $8 billion in retail business in 2013, Marchi said. That's a lot of T-shirts, purses, notes, stickers, backpacks, school supplies, pencils and so on -- all bearing the icon's image. And more is being added to the lucrative kitty with $30 tickets for adults and $20 tickets for children 6 to 12 for the festival. ""Hello Kitty is a citizen of the world, we like to say,"" said Janet Hsu, president of Sanrio Inc. ""I think her message of representing friendship, kindness, is really contagious and it's growing. "" Not surprisingly, enthusiasts are stampeding to the conference site, which includes the participation of the Japanese American National Museum in the nearby Little Tokyo neighborhood, where an exhibit shows the brand's influence on art and culture. ""This has been overwhelming,"" Hsu said. ""Over the course of the four days, we have sold over 25,000 tickets. We wished we could of actually had more people come, but the fire marshal gave us the no, no!, and it's just 100,000 square feet of just eye candy."" Alexis Hernandez, who's been collecting Hello Kitty items since childhood, said she felt like she was in a fantasy land. ""It's just amazing to walk around here and see only Hello Kitty,"" Hernandez said. The kitty appeals to men, too. Gary Slaughter, who traveled more than 100 miles from San Diego, became a Hello Kitty fan about two years ago when one of his friends introduced him to the character. ""Hello Kitty makes everyone happy. She makes me happy, so it was a natural thing,"" Slaughter said. Another gentleman, Allan Tea, got a free tattoo bearing the character's image on his bicep. ""Hello Kitty is forever. She really doesn't have no gender. As you can see from the Con, millions of people love her,"" Tea said. He also bought merchandise with an unusual pairing: Hello Kitty with a snake. ""What I got was a Hello Kitty wrapped around with a snake,"" Tea said. ""The reason I like the snake is because I'm a snake in the Asian culture (calendar), so I think it was a good fit with Hello Kitty."" Hello from another continent . Jessica Perez, 40, flew almost 8,000 miles from Lima, Peru, to attend the conference because she's been dreaming about this event. ""She's my friend, my companion. She's with me at home, at the office and people who know me know that I'm her fan,"" Perez said. The event comes two months after the Hello Kitty world was rocked with the revelation that the icon isn't a cat at all. The image is really a cartoon character of a little girl with strong feline features, according to Yano, who is visiting professor of Japanese studies at Harvard and an anthropologist at the University of Hawaii. The anthropologist's declaration was, let's say, ""cataclysmic"" for the international icon. Yano, who's among the guest speakers at the conference, tried to explain the soul of the character. She wrote a book last year entitled ""Pink Globalization: Hello Kitty's Trek Across the Pacific."" ""Hello Kitty obviously takes the form of a cat but in spirit, she more inhabits the presence -- and the internal of the heart-felt presence -- of a girl. A little girl. Your best friend. And now a kind of global icon celebrity,"" Yano said. ""Hello Kitty is supposed to be a perpetual third-grader. She's very friendly, she likes to travel, she likes her mother's apple pie, so she's kind of like a homebody but has an adventurous spirit,"" Yano said. Perhaps, it's a good thing that Hello Kitty represents a little girl and not a little cat. If it were a feline, its 40 years would equate to 177 human years old. Hardly a kitty any more.","Hello Kitty owner Sanrio sells 25,000 tickets to first 'Hello Kitty Con'

"(CNN) -- This week's Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, reaches a notable milestone as the tournament celebrates its 40th year -- the oldest WTA Tour event on the circuit. The tournament has been hosted in the grounds of Stanford University for the past 14 years, after various different venues in the North California area, and its roll-call of former winners reads like a who's-who of women's tennis. Martina Navratilova holds the record for most singles titles, with five between 1979 and 1993. Reigning U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters has four wins, with American legends Chris Evert and Lindsay Davenport and Billie Jean King with three  victories each. And, in recognition of reaching the landmark, tournament organizers have arranged a special presentation before the semifinals on Saturday July 31. Four former champions, each representing a different decade, will be paraded; inuaugural champion King (1970s), two-time champion Andrea Jaeger (1980s), Davenport (1990s) and defending champion Marion Bartoli (2000s). It was fitting that King won the initial tournament, as she had fought so hard for the introduction of the WTA Tour. And, the 1971 tournament at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium, in which King beat Rosie Casals in the final of an event then known as the British Motor Cars Invitational, was to become the first of 24 events that year that formed the first-ever WTA Tour calendar. The tournament became the Virginia Slims of California in 1974 and its venue moved around the San Francisco area before settling at the Oakland Coliseum between 1979 and 1996. The tournament has continued to grow and grow since moving to Standford, with Stanford Director of Tennis Dick Gould telling the local Mercury News website: ""It's been a great marriage and just about every great player from the last 14 years has played here. ""It's been a really great thing for not only Stanford, but for the Northern California community in general."" Australian Samantha Stosur is the top seed for the 2010 version, although injury means that the Williams sisters -- who both hail from the area -- will not be in action.","This week's Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California celebrates its 40th year .

"If you thought you were going to be reincarnated as a horse -- you'd probably want to be born here. That was the madcap idea which prompted an 18th-century French prince, Louis-Henri de Bourbon, to build the most spectacular horse stables in the world. Legend has it that the wealthy royal commissioned the luxurious Grand Stables in northern France because he believed he would be born again as a horse -- and not just any old royal box would do. At more than 180 meters long -- roughly the same size as two soccer fields -- the stables at Chantilly are not only a spectacular feat of architecture, they're also home to a famous collection of equine artworks and the rarest ponies on the planet. This weekend the Grand Stables -- and its adjoining Museum of the Horse -- will again be unveiled to the world as part of a $3.3 million makeover led by the fourth Aga Khan, both a business magnate and the spiritual leader of 20 million Nizari Ismaili Muslims. ""It will be one of the few museums in the world totally dedicated to the horse, in all aspects of life,"" His Highness Prince Karim told CNN of his grand project. Rescued relic . Built almost 300 years ago, in 1719, the Grand Stables was one of the most breathtaking buildings in the world, housing a whopping 250 horses and 300 hunting dogs on the manicured lawns and lakes of the opulent Chantilly Estate. In the evenings, Prince Louis-Henri would hold sumptuous dinners under the building's monumental dome, which soars 28 meters high. But by the turn of the 21st century, the stables and museum had become a dusty shadow of their former glory. ""It was the most stunning building built for horses in the world,"" Benoit Junod, director for museums and exhibitions at the Aga Khan Development Network, told CNN. ""The prince was a cousin of the king and I think he wanted to create something which would rival the Palaces of Versaille. ""But in recent years it was falling into disrepair -- there were problems with water seepage from the lake, the roof needed to be repaired."" That was until Prince Karim -- a renowned horse owner and breeder, perhaps most notably of Shergar -- invested his fortune in an ambitious project to transform the sad old relic into a world-leading equine exhibition. ""The mayor came to me and said, 'Would you join us in financing the saving of Chantilly's race course?' said the Aga Khan, who has had an office in the area for ""many many"" years. ""And I said, 'But I'm not interested in only saving the race course. I'd like to widen the spectrum to the whole of Chantilly.'"" Treasure trove . Venture inside the elegant museum and you'll discover a remarkable collection of hundreds of paintings, sculptures, and curios, depicting everything from mythical horses to racing thoroughbreds. The building's 17 garages, which originally housed elegant carriages in the 1700s, have been converted into gallery rooms and a café. ""We have a crazy mixture of everything from British artist Norman Thelwell's cartoons to major works of art by 15th-century renaissance painters,"" said Junod. ""You have a lot of horse museums around the world which deal with certain aspects -- such as racing or equipment. But nothing which has the ambition to tackle the extraordinary history and beauty of the horse in full."" But it's not just rare artworks attracting 160,000 visitors a year. Also referred to as the ""Live Horse Museum,"" the lush green estate is home to more than 30 breeds of horses -- including the only one of its kind in Europe. Among the cantering thoroughbreds and Shetland ponies is 10-year-old Dilraj -- the first and only Marwari horse to step foot on the continent. The Marwari are descendants of horses used by ancient Indian warriors, known for the courage in battle and distinctive inward-curving ears . Race to the top . Drifting in to the gallery rooms this weekend will also be the roar from the crowd at France's second biggest horse race -- the Prix de Diane, which is for three-year-old fillies. Sunday's prestigious race takes place on the pretty Chantilly course, nestled in front of the towering Grand Stables. It is a special day for the Aga Khan, who has had seven winning thoroughbreds in the competition -- the most of any horse racing owner. ""This year we don't have a runner -- I was hoping we would have but the filly's last race was not what we wanted,"" he said. ""Every time I've won it has been with a home-bred filly. The goal of my farm is to breed winners. I don't buy racing stock, the results are dependent on my breeding."" As Junod says, part of the appeal of the museum isn't just its multimillion-dollar setting -- it's also man's enduring fascination with these four-legged beasts. ""The horse has always been a strong, independent animal -- a friend of man, not a slave of man. And I think that's part of the reason why it still captures our imaginations today.""","Welcome to Chantilly's Grand Stables, world's most beautiful horse homes .

"(CNN) -- The Georgian President has praised the citizens of the former Soviet republic for the ""miraculous transformation"" of the country. Mikhail Saakashvili said his government had helped, but praised ""the talent and hard-working nature of the people"" for ""an amazing achievement,"" in an interview with CNN's Jim Clancy. Asked what Georgia's greatest resources were Saakashvili said:""The standard answer would be people and nature, but it is people and nature. This was a country that was considered to be failing years ago and [now] it is making it."" Saakashvili was re-elected as President of Georgia in 2008 after taking over from his predecessor Eduard Shevardnadze in 2004 following his leadership of the ""Rose Revolution"" protests. He said Georgia needs to ""bring back the best of the past, but also show the way to the future."" ""It's about education, healthcare, opportunities, democracy, social transformation, meritocracy which can reverse the old corrupt, planned society that we inherited from Soviet times,"" he added. Georgia gained independence in 1991 but relations with Russia since have been strained. In August 2008, Georgian troops entered the breakaway Russian-speaking region of South Ossetia, after sporadic clashes between ethnic Russians and Georgians. South Ossetia had declared independence from Georgia in the early 1990s. Georgia's move prompted Russian troops to enter South Ossetia and then push deep into the rest of Georgia. Each side blamed each other for the conflict but an eight-month European Union-commissioned inquiry concluded that both sides shared the blame for the conflict. Thousands of Georgians remain displaced and there is pressure on Saakashvili to repair relations with Russia. He told CNN that Georgia ""would be crazy to want hostilities with big, big Russia"" and it was ""the last thing any Georgian would want."" Another ongoing problem for the president are the numbers of Georgians -- especially young people -- leaving the country. World Bank figures record Georgia's population fell by a constant 1.2 percent (around 50,000) from 2004 to 2008. And Georgians have had to endure high levels of depravation for several years with over half the population living below the poverty line. But this is being addressed Saakashvili says. ""We had 52 percent living in poverty. Now it is 22 percent."" Saakashvili says Georgia will soon (before the end of his presidential term in 2013) have visa-free access to the European Union. ""I'm not afraid people will leave because I expect more to come back. This is the first former Soviet country where I think the entire political class has been replaced. And from that point of view Georgia is an attractive place for people to stay.""","Georgia President praises his own people for ""miraculous transformation""

"Keira Knightley is fine with taking a topless photo. Just don't screw it up with Photoshop or other digital manipulation. While talking about a set of Patrick Demarchelier photographs she did for Interview magazine (including one NSFW), Knightley told the The Times of London (subscription required) that she wanted the images to present her as she is. ""I've had my body manipulated so many different times for so many different reasons, whether it's paparazzi photographers or for film posters,""  the actress, 29, said.

"Men affiliated with terrorist organizations have crossed the United States' southern border and the Department of Homeland Security is splitting hairs by arguing otherwise, a House Republican is saying. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who made headlines this week by claiming that Border Patrol officers had told him at least 10 ISIS terror suspects had been captured crossing the border, backtracked Friday on his comments about their affiliation. But he said he stands by his claim that terrorists have entered the country. ""I should have been more careful talking about ISIS, as opposed to terrorist Turks or terrorist Syrians,"" Hunter told CNN after an event in his district. Hunter said he still won't reveal the source of his claim that at least 10 terror suspects have been caught, but that it came from ""folks that are on the ground"" and not Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson or any other appointees of President Barack Obama. ""The question is, is the administration parsing language when they say no actual ISIS fighters -- meaning guys in black pajamas with black flags and AK-47s -- have gotten across the border?"" Hunter said. ""What you have are people from terrorist countries, state sponsors of terrorism, that have in fact gotten across the border,"" he said. His comments came after U.S. officials acknowledged that four Turkish nationals who had crossed into Texas were captured on September 10 -- and that at least one had said he is affiliated with the Kurdish Workers Party, also known as the PKK. The State Department has listed that group as a terrorist organization at the government of Turkey's behest, though officials have been quick to point out that its members are now fighting against ISIS, rather than with the group. ""I don't buy the idea that just because they're the good terrorists, this is a good thing for the United States of America,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" with Wolf Blitzer on Friday night. He said he didn't know whether Hunter's claims about at least 10 ISIS-affiliated terror suspects crossing into the United States are accurate, but that ""to suggest that a terrorist, a person with ISIS, would never do so would be naive.""","Duncan Hunter backtracks on claim that ISIS-affiliated suspects have crossed into the U.S.

"One step, 128,100 feet, and millions of amazed gasps. In a moment that seems likely to live forever in the annals of derring-do, Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner on Sunday rode a balloon to the edge of space, saluted and stepped off a platform 24 miles high with as much ease as any of us mere mortals might step off a curb. The former soldier hurtled through the sky at up to more than 830 mph, breaking the sound barrier in a tumbling, gut-churning four-minute free fall before popping his parachute and making a running landing in the New Mexico desert. Then he fell to his knees and pumped his fists. ""Goosebumps ... Incredible!"" one Twitter user posted shortly after the jump. How claustrophobia almost grounded him . ""My dad told me of Maradona and Neil Armstrong, I will tell my children of Ronaldo and Felix Baumgartner,"" another user wrote, referring to Latin American soccer stars and the first man to walk on the moon. YouTube carried the jump live. At least 8 million people watched live, YouTube said. While the jump was spectacle enough on its own, it also could have important implications for spaceflight. Launching of Baumgartner's balloon-lifted capsule . The 100-pound pressurized flight suit and helmet Baumgartner wore to survive the lethally thin atmosphere and intense cold of near-space could also help save the lives of astronauts forced to bail out of a malfunctioning rocket on its way to space. ""It's hard to realize what happened because there's still so many emotions,"" Baumgartner said shortly after landing. ""I had tears in my eyes when I was coming back a couple of times because you're sitting there and you thought about that moment so many times, you know, how it would feel and how it would look like."" ""And this is way bigger than I had anticipated,"" he said. Dubbed ""Fearless Felix,"" the helicopter pilot and former soldier had parachuted from such landmarks as the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. Baumgartner and his team spent five years preparing for Sunday's jump, which had been postponed twice before because of weather. Not the only man to break the sound barrier that day . By most accounts, all the hard work paid off.  According to preliminary findings cited by Brian Utley, an official observer monitoring the mission, the 43-year-old Baumgartner flew higher than anyone ever in a helium balloon and broke the record for the highest jump. Still, even Baumgartner seemed taken aback when Utley detailed how fast he had fallen at one point -- 833.9 mph, or Mach 1.24, smashing his goal to break the sound barrier. ""I was fighting all the way down to regain control because I wanted to break the speed of sound,"" said Baumgartner. ""And then I hit it."" After a weather delay of several hours, he set off at 9:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) Sunday from Roswell, New Mexico, in breezy, clear conditions, strapped into a pressurized capsule that hung from a giant helium balloon. It took two hours to reach his target altitude. After running through a 40-step checklist, Baumgartner opened the hatch and climbed out onto a step the size of a skateboard. ""Guardian angels will take care of you,"" said Mission Control just before he jumped. ""The whole world is watching now,"" Baumgartner responded. He saluted and jumped. He experienced a few hitches. About three minutes in, he reported, ""My visor is fogging up."" Then he began to veer into a ""flat spin"" that threatened to send blood rushing to his head and leave him out of control. ""There was a period of time where I really thought, 'I am in trouble,' "" Baumgartner said, recalling how he considered pushing a button that would have released a drogue chute, slowing and stabilizing his descent -- and scuttling the attempt to break the sound barrier. ""But after a couple of seconds, I had that feeling I'm getting it under control. And I did,"" he added. ""And that's why I broke the speed of sound today."" Opinion: The space adventure you can't miss . After free-falling for about four minutes and 20 seconds, he deployed a parachute for the final mile or two down to Earth. ""There's the chute,"" said a specialist in Mission Control, and the control room broke into applause. As soon as Baumgartner landed, he dropped to his knees and raised his fists. The team at Mission Control in Roswell burst into applause. While he and his team had prepared diligently for the jump, his survival was no guarantee. In addition to the risk of spinning out of control, Baumgartner's life depended on the integrity of his pressure suit. The temperature when he jumped was expected to hit 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit or lower. And the atmosphere was so thin that his blood would have vaporized if he wasn't sufficiently protected. Testing that pressurized flight suit and helmet was one goal of the mission, as it could save an astronaut's life if a manned spacecraft malfunctioned. The outfit had sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate. Sunday's successful jump breaks the record set in 1960 by Col. Joe Kittinger, who fell from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission. Kittinger was a consultant on Baumgartner's effort, serving as the lone person from Mission Control talking to the Austrian throughout his attempt. Kittinger acknowledged the ups and downs of the years-long effort Sunday. The former aviator was all smiles in lauding Baumgartner, who he said ""did perfect,"" and all the others involved in making the mission a success. ""It was a team effort, and Felix did a fantastic job,"" Kittinger said. ""It was an honor for all of us to work with this brave guy.""

"A 20-year-old woman in India has alleged that she was gang-raped by a group of men this week after the head of a village ordered them to do so, police in West Bengal said on Thursday. The incident allegedly took place Monday in a tribal village in a very remote part of West Bengal, in India's northeast, police spokesman Prasanta Chowdhury said. Police have arrested 13 men for questioning in the case, and the alleged victim is undergoing medical treatment in a hospital, Chowdhury said. ""I think this is absolutely inhuman and it is completely outrageous and preposterous to say the least,"" said Manish Tewari, India's information and broadcasting minister. ""In a democratic country based upon the rule of law, no vigilantism can be permitted. West Bengal government must immediately arrest the accused and ensure that they are given the strictest punishment possible."" Other politicians expressed similar outrage, and condemned the incident. ""The entire village should be fined and a case should be filed on every one for raping, provoking the rapists and being involved in such a heinous crime,"" said K.C. Tyagi, a leader of India's regional Janata Dal (United) party. ""Shameful incidents are happening in our country... Unless law takes strict action and creates a sense of fear in people, such sad incidents will continue to happen,"" said Kirti Azad, a leader of India's main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party. ""It is very surprising that in a state governed by a female chief minister, a woman is being raped; it is very shameful."" Azad was referring to Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal's chief minister. Violent crimes against women have been in the spotlight in India since a 23-year-old woman was raped and beaten by several men on a bus in December 2012. The victim later died in a Singapore hospital. The shocking attack provoked outrage across India, leading to calls for improved safety and treatment of women. Since then, the Indian media have intensified their focus on rape cases. Attacks against foreign women have also been reported. The 2012 case also prompted lawmakers to change statutes to fast-track the arrest and questioning of anyone implicated in a rape.

"(CNN)A judge has vacated the conviction of a 14-year-old boy who was executed for allegedly killing two girls some 70 years ago in South Carolina. The judgment against George Stinney, the youngest person to be executed by an American state since the 1800s, effectively exonerates the boy, said family attorney Matt Burgess. A black teen in the Jim Crow South, Stinney was accused of murdering two white girls, ages 7 and 11, as they hunted for wildflowers in Alcolu, about 50 miles southeast of Columbia. Stinney, according to police, confessed to the crime. No witness or evidence that might vindicate him was presented during a trial that was over in fewer than three hours. An all-white jury convicted him in a flash, 10 minutes. ""Given the particularized circumstances of Stinney's case, I find by a preponderance of the evidence standard, that a violation of the Defendant's procedural due process rights tainted his prosecution,"" wrote Circuit Judge Carmen Tevis Mullen in her decision, dated Tuesday. She said that sentencing a 14-year-old to the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Earlier this year, attorneys for Stinney's family had asked for a new trial, saying the boy's confession was coerced and that Stinney had an alibi, his sister, Amie Ruffner, who claims she was with Stinney when the murders occurred. Ruffner, Stinney's sister, told CNN affiliate WLTX that she and Stinney saw Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, 7, the day they died. Stinney and Ruffner were tending to their family's cow near some railroad tracks close to their home. ""They said, 'Could you tell us where we could find some maypops?' "" Ruffner recalled. ""We said, 'No,' and they went on about their business."" The girls were found the next day in a water-logged ditch with injuries to their head. Mary had a 2-inch laceration above her right eyebrow and a vertical laceration over her left, according to a 1944 medical examiners' report. Ruffner told WLTX, police took Stinney and another of her brothers away in handcuffs while their parents were not at home. One brother was released, she said, while Stinney faced police questioning without his parents or a lawyer. The police ""were looking for someone to blame it on, so they used my brother as a scapegoat,"" Ruffner said.

"In what may be the epic battle of the summer, the White House and Republicans are assembling their armies and sharpening their bayonets for a political fight over the selling of Obamacare. On one side is the Obama administration, which is preparing to carry out the president's landmark health care reform law. It sees success directly linked to his legacy. On the other side are House Republicans, conservative groups, GOP governors and tea party affiliates. They are reading the latest polls and are determined to make the repeal or severe crippling of the Affordable Care Act their top priority before the 2014 midterms. ""It's a very important battle and both sides are trying to come out on top,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""The first stage was about whether this passes or not. ... Now the battle is over implementing it and there are all sorts of ways Republicans are trying to cause problems."" Zelizer said Republicans have been aggressively promoting the program's problems in the past few weeks. ""And the administration feels the pressure,"" he said. The next phase of the fight for the White House, according to administration officials, is a series of initiatives aimed at using social media, websites, on-the-ground efforts and targeting Spanish speakers and young people in particular to convince as many uninsured as possible to buy insurance when it becomes available on October 1. ""We've got to make sure everybody has good health in this country,"" President Barack Obama told Morehouse College's commencement ceremonies recently. ""It's not just good for you, it's good for this country. So you're going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people."" Meanwhile, Republicans are continuing to whittle away at the law's impact and are hoping that Obamacare's failure could become a rallying cry. ""It's going to be an issue in the 2014 midterm elections,"" said Sally Pipes, president and CEO of Pacific Research Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank and author of ""The Truth about Obamacare."" ""When 2014 comes and the percentage of Americans that have employer-based insurance find out they could lose their insurance and be dumped into an exchange there will be an uproar,"" Pipes said. Here's a glimpse into each side's playbook and the tactics they hope will win: . What the administration wants to doThis summer, the administration will launch several initiatives in its goal to sign up as many as seven million Americans over the next year. They will hit the Internet. They plan to roll out Healthcare.gov as the go-to site for those signing up for insurance under the law, leading up to open enrollment starting on October 1. They will take it to TV. The Health and Human Services Department will soon unleash a campaign to saturate the airwaves with ads pushing people to begin shopping for health care plans. They are making it easier to sign up. To make it easier for consumers to apply for coverage from private insurers under the Obamacare rules, the administration is touting a simplified online form that takes 21 pages and boils it down to three. They will target minorities and young people. These groups are some of those most affected by a lack of insurance. This strategy will leverage Spanish language ads, public education and outreach campaigns targeting recent college graduates, young and diverse faces on its website and a heavy emphasis on digital media. They are claiming it will be cheaper. The White House is pushing a recent surprise in California, where the cost of buying health insurance through the state's exchanges -- as required by the Affordable Care Act -- are coming in as much as half the price of what was initially expected. For instance, the state will charge an average of $304 a month for the cheapest silver-level plan in state-based exchanges next year. President touts Obamacare benefits for moms . Who will pay more under Obamacare? Young men . What Republicans want to doThe GOP will continue to beat the drum on just how bad Obamacare is for the country. They continue to keep it in the headlines. House Republicans have voted 37 times to repeal the law and some critics have suggested it's a waste of time. ""Well, while our goal is to repeal all of Obamacare, I would remind you that the president has signed into law seven different bills that repealed or defunded parts of that law. Is it enough? No. A full repeal is needed to keep this law from doing more damage to our economy and raising health care costs,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a recent press conference. They are linking Obamacare to the IRS scandal. Leading Republicans, such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, have also suggested suspending implementation of Obamacare until an investigation in completed into the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups. They are challenging it in the states. Several states with Republican governors and legislatures have threatened not to establish the required insurance exchanges -- and giving up millions in federal subsidies in the process -- in an effort to derail Obamacare. Opinion: Myths about Obamacare . Still, things are starting to get ugly. Repeated requests by HHS for more money from Congress to implement the law have been denied. Ranking Republicans are now calling the agency's inspector general to investigate whether Health Kathleen Sebelius violated appropriations and ethics rules when she reportedly tried to raise funds for Enroll America, an organization that is working to help put the Affordable Care Act in place. Those actions are now also under investigation by two congressional committees. The agency maintains she made ""no fundraising requests to entities regulated by HHS."" Public has questions . Caught in the middle is the American public. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in April showed 49% of those surveyed didn't know how Obamacare would affect them and roughly 40 percent were unaware that the law was being carried out. ""In our research looking at barriers faced by families accessing available public insurance for their kids we found that families were often very confused about the requirements and the processes for enrollment,"" said Jennifer Devoe, a family physician, and professor at Oregon Health and Science University of such programs as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. ""We also found confusion among families who believed their child to be covered when the child was actually uninsured, and vice versa."" A majority of Americans said they opposed the nation's new health care measure, three years after it became law, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday. But looking deeper, the poll also indicated that more than a quarter of those who oppose the law said they didn't support it because it didn't go far enough.","The summer of 2013 will see both sides square off in efforts to sell or roll back Obamacare .
The administration is hoping to start signing up people for health plans October 1 .

"Inspectors are looking into the cause of a coal slurry spill in West Virginia's eastern Kanawha County after it blackened six miles of a creek, officials with the state Department of Environmental Protection said Tuesday. More than 100,000 gallons of the coal slurry is believed to have flowed into Fields Creek, a tributary of the Kanawha River, officials said. Inspectors are testing the water to determine exactly how much leaked into the creek, the officials said. The spill at Patriot Coal was caused when a valve inside a slurry line malfunctioned, the state environmental protection officials said. Containment efforts by Patriot Coal began immediately, and cleanup activities are underway, said Janine Orf, a vice president at Patriot Coal. State EPA spokesman Tom Aluise said the water in the county was safe to drink, though West Virginia American Water has a ""do not use"" alert in place for pregnant women in the Kanawha Valley after an unrelated January 9 spill. Federal grand jury investigates West Virginia chemical spill . Word of the slurry spill comes as West Virginia is trying to recover from the January spill that leaked  4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM, into the water. The chemical, used to wash coal before it goes to market in order to reduce ash, leaked into the Elk River and from there into Charleston's water supply on January 9. The result was a do-not-use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water, some for more than a week. MCHM is so strong that it can be picked up even if there is no detectable amount in the water. That news continues to be of concern to residents, including U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller.

"Starting next year, the names of religious holidays like Christmas and Yom Kippur will no longer appear on the school calendar in Montgomery County, Maryland. Instead of Christmas break, students will have winter break. And when Yom Kippur rolls around, the calendar will simply state that there will be no school. This new calendar won't affect the days students have off, and they'll still be out of class on Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Christmas and Easter weekend. It's just that the names of religious holidays won't appear on the school calendar. The county's Board of Education made this decision Tuesday, pointing out that schools don't close for religious reasons but for secular ones, such as high absenteeism among students and teachers. The decision also arrived amid a push from leaders in the Muslim community to see their faith's holidays, such as Eid al-Adha, get the same treatment from Montgomery County schools as the Christian and Jewish observances. Though students who need to be absent because of religious reasons do receive excused absences, Muslim leaders have argued that's unequal treatment. ""Currently, the thousands of Muslim staff and students (within Montgomery County Public Schools) have to choose between their education and observing their religious practices,"" says a statement on the website of the Equality for Eid Coalition, which has been advocating for Montgomery County to close school on Muslim holidays. ""They either skip school (an excused absence) to celebrate Eids or they skip their religious observances to attend school. Many choose to do the latter. However, this is not a choice that, for the most part, our Christian and Jewish neighbors face on their high holidays."" Plus, there's the question of equality. ""Sometimes I don't like it because everybody gets their days off and whenever I have celebrations, I don't get off,"" 9-year-old student Mussa Siddique told CNN affiliate WBFF. That said, the Board of Education's decision to scrub the school calendar of all religious holiday names isn't what the coalition was hoping to see. ""By stripping the names Christmas, Easter, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, they have alienated other communities now, and we are no closer to equality,"" Saqib Ali, a co-chairman of the Equality for Eid Coalition, told The Washington Post. ""It's a pretty drastic step, and they did it without any public notification."" But to board member Rebecca Smondrowski, who also spoke with the Post, ""this seems the most equitable option."" Montgomery County isn't the first district to remove the names of religious holidays from its school calendar; Maryland's Baltimore City Public Schools have done something similar. One parent in Baltimore County, Tracey Pettingill, told WBFF that she disagrees with Montgomery County's decision. ""I believe religion is what holds our nation together, and I think it's the glue that keeps our society together, whether you're religious or not,"" Pettingill said. Her son, Devon Jones, saw it as an attempt at political correctness. ""They're trying to be politically correct so they don't offend anybody,"" he said. ""But let's be real here; they're going to offend a few people. People always get offended.""","Montgomery County will remove names of religious holidays from the school calendar .

"(CNN) -- Anthony Wichman probably rather would have told the story of the one that got away. Instead, the 54-year-old Koloa, Hawaii, man won his one-hour battle with a 230-pound Ahi tuna -- but only after the fish nearly drowned him and left him clinging to his capsized boat. The Coast Guard said it rescued Wichman by zeroing in on his cell phone signal about 10 miles southwest of Port Allen, Kauai, Friday morning. While gasping for air, the stranded fisherman called his daughter, Anuhea Wichman. She told CNN affiliate KHON her father hooked the tuna and got it onto his 14-foot boat after about an hour. ""He gaffed it once in the back, and the second gaff went straight into the fish's eye and that caused the fish to take a final dive. And he dove straight down, and the line wrapped around my dad's ankle and pulled him overboard,"" Anuhea Wichman said. When she answered his phone call, she said, ""All I could hear was him hyperventilating, and I could hear him puking."" He managed to say ""sinking"" and ""Coast Guard."" After that call, the Coast Guard reached him on the phone and worked with 911 operators to determine his position. A rescue diver dropped from a helicopter and helped hoist him aboard. See also: Waterproof phones and tablets make a splash . Wichman suffered only a few bruises and a rope burn, KOHN reported.

"From Arizona to New York, alleged thieves are turning those tiny iconic plastic interlocking bricks you grew up with into cold, hard cash. On New York's Long Island on Friday, a 53-year-old woman was arraigned on grand larceny charges for allegedly stealing about $60,000 worth of Lego sets and trying to sell them on eBay, the Nassau County Police Department said in a statement. Gloria Haas was arrested Thursday after allegedly stealing 800 sets of the 80-year-old toys from a Long Island storage facility and moving them to a facility in another town, police said. She had intended to sell the toys on eBay, officials said. It was not known whether Haas has an attorney and she was not immediately available for comment Saturday. Authorities are not saying, but alleged thieves could be capitalizing on the enduring popularity of the simple little bricks which generated $1.1 billion in profits last year for the Danish toymaker. ""The Lego Movie,"" which was released in February, made $69 million in its opening weekend and has grossed more than $250 million so far, according to Box Office Mojo. In Phoenix, police arrested four people allegedly involved in an elaborate Lego theft scheme, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. After the arrests, police spent 10 hours Friday loading onto trucks more than $250,000 worth of Lego sets stored in a garage, KPHO reported. At least $40,000 worth of the Legos are believed to have been stolen, CNN Phoenix affiliate KNXV reported. ""It's hard to believe that two or three people could be taking that much product out of the store, and yet they were,"" officer James Holmes told KNXV. A real estate professional, another man and two women were arrested in connection with the scheme, according to KHPO. It was not clear Saturday whether they had attorneys. Police said one man bought expensive Lego sets at a discount from shoplifters and resold them online. Each of the play sets taken were valued at $100 or more, police said. The suspect allegedly recruited accomplices to go to Toys R Us stores to steal Lego sets, KPHO reported. The boxes in which the toys came would be damaged and turned over to the online seller, who would return to the store and buy a new set, the station reported. The online seller later allegedly used the real receipt for the purchase to return the damaged box set. He pocketed the money and sold the stolen Lego sets online to collectors, KPHO reported. The suspects were arrested on charges that include organized retail theft, trafficking in stolen property, fraudulent schemes and illegal control of an enterprise, police said. CNN left a message Saturday for officer Holmes.","Gloria Haas, 53, is charged in theft of about $60,000 worth of Lego sets, police say .

"Where did our country go? Americans are known around the world as a good and compassionate people -- with a soft spot for children. And, although you wouldn't know it from watching a ghastly detention drama currently playing out in the Southwest, law enforcement and the legal system have built-in safeguards that acknowledge the simple fact that children are different from adults, and thus cannot be treated the same. The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement seem to have forgotten that. These agencies are currently warehousing hundreds of children from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador who have, in recent months, streamed across the Texas-Mexico border. According to media reports, the group is a mixture of unaccompanied minors sent by their parents, toddlers traveling with their mothers, and children who are alone and trying to reunite with their parents in the United States. These youngsters are a long way from home and many appear to have gotten this far by jumping aboard passenger trains that run from the Mexico-Guatemala border to the northern cities of Mexico, and then joining up with ""coyotes"" (smugglers) who brought them across or, in some cases, merely pointed the way. Once they arrived, they were taken into custody by U.S. immigration officials. According to immigration attorneys who represent some of these children, many are being held in freezing holding cells intended for fewer inhabitants and shorter stays. These aren't jail cells as much as temporary holding rooms nicknamed ""hieleras,"" or ice chests. CNN has reported that the border facilities lack ""enough food, beds or sanitary facilities to provide for the children."" These are the lucky ones. Federal immigration officials have loaded hundreds of others on buses and transported them across state lines, only to drop them at bus stations in states like Arizona with nothing more than a notice to appear before an immigration judge -- a scribbled piece of paper representing a feeble attempt at accountability, which most of these people are likely to ignore as they wander off and fade into society. President Barack Obama called it ""an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response."" And Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said his department other agencies would work together to ensure a ""rapid government-wide response in the short-term and to undertake broader, longer-term reforms to address the root cause behind these recent migration trends."" Anyone still think the border is -- as President Barack Obama and other administration officials have repeatedly assured us -- more secure than it ever has been? It's a mess. U.S. officials don't have the faintest idea of what to do with the influx, even though they had advanced warning that this crisis was coming. Texas Gov. Rick Perry told radio host Sean Hannity this week that public safety officials in his state had informed the federal government about a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border as early as 2012. The Department of Homeland Security appears to have not adequately addressed the problem. And now, with more than 1,000 children coming across the border every day according to government reports, it must. Why are they coming? They're fleeing countries like those in Central America that are quite literally falling apart, with little or failed infrastructure in the military or law enforcement, and thus unable to fend off encroachment by Mexican drug cartels looking for new outposts from which to operate. That is the best theory about why the surge is occurring. The most far-fetched theory comes from restrictionists and nativists who insist that what enticed these children from Central America to cross the U.S.-Mexico border is an expectation that Obama is poised to use his executive power to grant a kind of ""amnesty"" to millions of undocumented. If people in Central America believe that, they could be the only folks in this hemisphere who do. Obama has never been particularly interested in proposing an immigration reform plan to Congress. And he has spent the last few years resisting calls to use executive power to act unilaterally to stop deportations. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had taken just about every position one can take on the immigration issue, but recently said he would work with Obama to allow undocumented young people to stay in the United States. Now that has been defeated in the primary election by a conservative in his home district in Virginia, immigration reform is all but dead. Besides, from all appearances, the border kids aren't immigrants. They're refugees. They're here because they couldn't be anywhere else, and they had no choice but to come. We're supposed to take in people like this, and offer them safe haven. This country has a right to protect its borders, and to decide who enters and who doesn't. But once our officials apprehend and take custody of a group of people -- let alone a group of children -- they're responsible to do right by them. That isn't happening in the Southwest. We have standards, and procedures, and hoops to jump through for those who might claim refugee status. We don't just drop human beings at a bus station, and run in the other direction. There are nations that would handle a situation like this in such a cowardly manner. This isn't one of them. So where did our country go? And how do we get it back?","Ruben Navarrette: Detention of children from Central America at border is beneath U.S.

"Imagine sitting at a conference roundtable and being able to look out on the turquoise sea for inspiration. At lunch, you steal away to sunbathe on deck. That night, after a featured speaker presentation, you'll watch a cabaret. Tomorrow, you'll spend a few hours on Grand Cayman. This is what a corporate retreat should look like, some meeting planners say, and companies, large and small, are catching on. They're choosing cruises as venues for corporate meetings, events and conferences. Eight percent of companies surveyed by research firm PhoCusWright last year listed cruise ships as their first choice for a meeting venue -- up from 6% in 2009. Interest is growing partly because, when comparing apples to apples -- including meals, entertainment, presentation equipment and meeting space -- an all-inclusive cruise ship event saves 20 to 30% on cost, according to cruise event services company Landry & Kling. Cruising builds in the social and excursion time needed to get a clear head, generate fresh thinking and share new experiences with colleagues. ""There have been a lot of organizations that deleted or deferred meetings and want to do something to get their momentum back up,"" says Jo Kling, co-founder and CEO of Landry & Kling. ""Taking people to an environment they don't go often or have never been shifts the perspective all together. They're not in a (dark) hotel ballroom ... thinking, 'Here we go again.'"" Business has picked up nicely since the 2008 economic downturn and the ""AIG effect"" socked the meeting industry, Kling says. Her company expects to double its 2010 business next year. Companies have access to amenities on cruise ships they might not otherwise be able to afford for a retreat-- nightly entertainment, happy hours, floral arrangements, audio/visual equipment, and personally chosen meals rather than preplanned banquet platters. ""It just disappears from your budget altogether,"" Kling says. Corporations working with good cruise lines also need fewer on-site staff to run events, says Sandra Daniel, CEO of FIRE Light Group, an incentive travel and marketing firm. ""The contracts for cruise programs are often more liberal than hotel contracts on attrition clauses and less restrictive cancellation fees,"" she adds. ""Most participants appreciate that they have the opportunity to see many destinations, some of them exclusive to the cruise line, but only need to unpack once."" And to top it off, pricing is usually in U.S. dollars, even when traveling abroad. The types of events held on cruise ships run the gamut, but are mostly incentive trips for salespeople in the insurance, financial, direct selling and manufacturing fields. Cruise ships are also venues for continuing education courses, product launches and national meetings. Landry & Kling's list of cruise customers includes Microsoft, Aflac, Harley-Davidson, Land O'Lakes, Mastercard International and MetLife. Companies can book part of a ship or arrange a full, private charter, depending on their size. Meetings at sea may not be such a good fit for large association meetings, which may require hundreds of breakout rooms. Cruising has become increasingly accessible for companies in the last decade as ""loads of new ships"" have entered the market, Kling says, with about 27 gateways in the U.S., including Boston; New York; Norfolk, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Galveston, Texas. About 70% of people live within a five-hour drive of a cruise port, she adds. To accommodate increasing demand, Landry & Kling launched Seasite.com, an online portal dedicated to cruise meetings and events, to allow corporate planners to send custom electronic Requests For Proposals to five cruise lines and negotiate directly for group pricing. But the movement is still small. About 25 to 35% of Royal Caribbean's business is group business, and corporate groups are a small piece of that, says Lori Cassidy, the cruise line's director of charters and incentives. (She wouldn't say exactly what percentage is corporate business.) But cruise lines are interested in attracting more corporate business because the lead time is longer, allowing them to commit their space well in advance, Kling says. ""You are starting to see more cruise lines reaching out to corporate America. We have a fleet of 22 ships that were purposefully built with conference centers,"" Cassidy says. Corporate trips on Royal Caribbean are mostly three- to five-night programs in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe, with some shorter cruises out of South Florida. Meeting planners express concerns about seasickness and the inability to get on and off at leisure. Daniel says the first is rarely an issue with today's large, smooth-moving ships. Cassidy and Kling say the latter is an advantage. ""It's a captive audience. There's nowhere for (attendees) to go,"" Cassidy says. As a result, the environment is more comfortable, the speaker won't disappear, and attendees won't skip sessions to golf instead. Everyone goes their own way for dinner during many hotel retreats, but not on a cruise ship. Laura LaBelle, chief operating officer of modeling agency Barbizon USA, said her company opted to host two 2,000-person events on a cruise ship out of its base of Tampa, Florida, instead of holding its usual land-based Los Angeles and New York events, because it could offer a similar event for about half the price. The response from participants has been great, LaBelle says. ""Families had it much easier. They enjoyed going to shows and dressing up."" Corporate meeting planners should do their homework before committing to a group cruise program, Daniel says. For example, some cruise ships have lower quality food and smaller rooms than a land hotel. Organizers should pay attention to how long they will be in port at various destinations and how long they are at sea in between stops. ""There are many cruise lines out there, some of which can provide a 5-star experience. They need not be the wild spring break on-board experience that some may fear,"" she adds. ""If you are accustomed to land meetings and have never tried a cruise, it might be something worth considering."" Kling agrees. ""(Cruising) is not going to replace hotels, but it's certainly a nice alternative once in a while,"" she says. ""It excites people."" Have you participated in a business cruise? What did you think of the event? Share your comments below.","Meetings on cruise ships give participants a fresh outlook, event planners say .

"Police in Barcelona have arrested 39 members of a suspected Chinese mafia and freed 30 young Chinese women whom they allegedly forced into prostitution, a senior officer of the Catalan regional police told CNN Wednesday. The arrests occurred earlier this week after a long investigation. It was the biggest strike to date against Chinese-run mafias involved in forced prostitution in the northeast region of Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona, said the senior officer, Xavier Cortes, head of the Catalan police unit that fights human trafficking. In recent years, the Chinese crime syndicate had crowded out others from the prostitution market in the fashionable Eixample district of Barcelona by using forced prostitution and charging below-market rates, Cortes said. The women were forced to work in unsanitary conditions and in marathon sessions, seeing eight clients in a row for an hour each, he said. After initial arraignments, a judge ordered 33 of the suspects to remain in prison. Six others were released but remain under investigation, and must check in regularly with authorities, Cortes said. Police are searching for six additional suspects, Cortes said. A total of 17 brothels were dismantled. The 30 women were initially placed in special assistance centers run by a non-governmental organization, but some have now left to live with friends in Barcelona, he said. The suspected Chinese mafia also was involved in document forgery, said Joaquim Frances, of the Catalan police organized crime unit, at a news conference Wednesday in Barcelona. ""In addition to prostitution, the gang also was involved human trafficking,"" Frances said. ""Barcelona was the hub used to later send these people to the United States, Australia and Canada.  So for a time, they were kept against their will in Barcelona or nearby until they were provided with documents in order to travel to these countries."" In numerous raids, the police seized forged passports from many countries -- what Cortes called ""perfect and very dangerous false documents"" -- as well as the machinery to make them. The Chinese mafia also was involved in drug trafficking, and police seized some weapons in the raids, Cortes added. The Catalan police broke up a forced-labor scheme involving Chinese clothing sweatshops in 2009, freeing several hundred victims and arresting more than 100 suspects. But across the nation, police and non-governmental organizations say the biggest problem of modern-day slavery in Spain is forced prostitution, involving not just Chinese women, but also women from Latin America, North Africa and Eastern Europe. Last year, Spanish police broke up a ring that tricked Brazilian men into coming to Spain and then forced them to work as male prostitutes.","The Chinese mafia cornered the prostitution market with lower rates, officials say .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- They gathered in the tens of thousands -- presidents, prime ministers, royals, celebrities and ordinary South Africans -- all united to say farewell to a man hailed as a global symbol of reconciliation. In what has been billed as one of the largest gatherings of global leaders in recent history, representatives from around the world joined street sweepers, actors and religious figures to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. From President Barack Obama to Cuba's Raul Castro, praise came from all sides in a four-hour memorial service at Johannesburg FNB stadium for the revered statesman, who died Thursday at age 95. ""We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again,"" Obama said in a speech to roaring cheers. ""To the people of South Africa -- people of every race and every walk of life -- the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us,"" he said, calling him a ""giant of history."" Gray skies and pouring rain throughout the service did little to dampen the mood. Huge poster pictures of Mandela hung around the stadium. In that same place 23 years earlier, Mandela had delivered his first speech after he was released from prison, hailed by supporters as the hope of a new South Africa. Also known as Soccer City, the stadium was where Mandela made his last public appearance at the World Cup final in July 2010. On Tuesday, many people carried banners honoring ""Madiba,"" Mandela's traditional clan name. Others were draped in materials covered with his face or the green, yellow, black, red and blue colors of the South African flag. Some had skipped work and lined up for hours to secure seats so that they could pay their respects to a man who's considered a moral compass and South Africa's symbol of the struggle against racial oppression. ""There is no one like Madiba. He was one of a kind,"" South African President Jacob Zuma said. ""Everyone has had a Mandela moment when this world icon has touched their lives."" 'Tata Madiba' The memorial service began with a marching band playing the national anthem. The joyous cries died down as speeches from Mandela's family and friends, members of the African National Congress, as well as a fellow Robben Island prison inmate, began. Anguished faces listened quietly as a sorrowful chant to ""Tata Madiba"" filled the air. ""Tata"" means ""father"" in Mandela's Xhosa tribe. 'The world has lost a beloved friend and mentor' Mandela's gift for uniting foes across political and racial divides was still evident at the service. Walking up the stairs onto the stage to deliver his speech, Obama shook hands with Castro, an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century. He earlier gave a warm greeting to Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, kissing her on both cheeks, despite recent tension between the two countries over reports the U.S. government was spying on her communications. Obama, who like Mandela was his nation's first black president, has cited Mandela as his own inspiration for entering politics. He said his death should prompt self-reflection. ""With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask: How well have I applied his lessons in my own life?"" Obama said. ""It is a question I ask myself, as a man and as a president. We know that like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice -- the sacrifices of countless people, known and unknown -- to see the dawn of a new day."" The presidents of Namibia, India, Cuba and South Africa were also designated speakers, as were Roussef and Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao. ""South Africa has lost a hero, they have lost a father. The world has lost a beloved friend and mentor,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said to loud cheers. ""Nelson Mandela was more than one of the greatest leaders of our time, he was one of the greatest teachers. And he taught by example."" The stadium, which can seat around 90,000 people, was not full, and speeches were hard to hear at times. But the celebratory mood was evident as thousands clapped and waved South African flags throughout the service. Presidents and celebrities . Foreign guests included British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Prince of Wales, French President Francois Hollande and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. ""It means a lot because it really is to say goodbye to an extraordinary man and to commemorate someone who did so much not just for South Africa, but also for the world in terms of the inspiration that he gave,"" Cameron told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and members of The Elders, a group of retired statesmen founded by Mandela and others, were also in attendance, including former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The crowds cheered loudly and clapped as a huge screen showed famous faces, such as F.W. de Klerk, the last leader of white South Africa, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to end apartheid. Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, and his former wife Winnie Mandela embraced and kissed as they arrived. The world of entertainment also was well represented, with South African actress Charlize Theron and U2's Bono in attendance. Celebrity guests also included model Naomi Campbell. Are you there? Send your photos and video . Tight security . With 91 heads of state attending, security was tight. Working off plans developed for years in secret, the South African government planned to use an elite military task force, sniper teams and canine teams to help secure the stadium, CNN's Arwa Damon reported Monday. In addition, helicopters and military jets frequently flew overhead. U.S. officials said they were satisfied with security arrangements. The event rivaled other significant state funerals in recent decades, such as that of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965 and the 2005 funeral of Pope John Paul II, which attracted some 2 million people to Rome -- among them four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers and the leaders of 14 other faiths. Security was also stepped up outside Mandela's home, where crowds danced under umbrellas. Some even enjoyed the rain, jumping into puddles. ""We want to respect our father of the nation, our father of the country. That is why we left work to pay that respect to him,"" one South African told CNN. Send us your stories, memories and photographs of the Nobel Peace prize winner and former South African president . State funeral on Sunday . Crews had worked overtime Monday to prepare the stadium for the service. The government set up overflow locations at stadiums and other facilities throughout the country. With private vehicles banned from the area around the stadium, the government pressed buses from around the country into service and stepped up train service to move the crowds. In Soweto township, where Mandela lived before he was imprisoned for 27 years, people waited for three hours for buses to take them to the stadium. Unfazed by the wait, they sang and danced. While Tuesday's memorial is the first major event honoring Mandela since his death, it won't be the last. A state funeral will be held Sunday in Mandela's ancestral hometown of Qunu in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. Other speakers at Tuesday's service included Mandela's friend and fellow anti-apartheid activist Archbishop Tutu . ""We promise God that we are going to follow the example of Nelson Mandela,"" he said to loud cheers. Mandela family members, including his grandchildren, also spoke. Paying tribute to his uncle, Gen. Thanduxolo Mandela said his family has gone through waves of grief, sorrow and anguish after his death. But ""today, more than any other feeling my family holds is thankfulness for that wonderful life,"" he said, also giving thanks for the outpouring of respect from around the world . ""This universal show of unity is a true reflection of all that Madiba stood for -- peace, justice, unity of all mankind. Let us pledge to keep Madiba's dream alive.""

"Two stolen paintings by the French artists Paul Gauguin and Pierre Bonnard hung in an Italian man's home for nearly 40 years -- without his knowing just how valuable they were. Now worth millions of euros, the artworks were stolen from a family house in London in 1970 and then abandoned on a Paris-to-Turin train. Italy's Culture Ministry unveiled the two paintings Wednesday after they were recovered by police specialized in finding stolen art, following an ""incredible"" series of events. The paintings were put away in the Italian Railways lost and found storage facility. The man, a factory worker for the car company Fiat, paid 45,000 Italian lire (roughly 22 euros or U.S. $30) for the pieces at auction in 1975. The man was an art lover, but he had no idea of the real value of the paintings, police said. The man, whom police did not name, hung the works in his Turin home before taking them to Sicily when he retired. Italian heritage police were alerted last summer when a friend of the worker grew suspicious of their value. ""There are all the elements for a nice novel; it is very unique,"" Gen. Mariano Mossa, head of the Italian Heritage Police, said at a news conference. Locked up in a safe . Police soon matched the works with those stolen in London. A notice of the theft had appeared in The New York Times on July 6, 1970. The Gauguin painting -- ""Fruits on a Table or Still Life with a Small Dog"" -- is said to date to 1889 and is believed to be worth between $13.7 million and $41 million, police said. The Bonnard painting is titled ""La Femme aux Deux Fauteuils"" (""Woman with Two Armchairs""). Gauguin was a post-impressionist artist, and Bonnard is regarded as one of the greatest colorists of modern art. It was still unclear to whom the paintings would be returned, as the couple they were stolen from have died, apparently leaving no heirs. For now, they will remain in a police safe.

"New York (CNN) -- Former NBA star Jayson Williams pleaded guilty to aggravated assault Monday in the 2002 shooting death of his chauffeur, according to the New Jersey Attorney General's Office. Under the plea deal, Williams faces a mandatory sentence of 18 months in prison without the possibility of parole. Williams was scheduled to be retried on a manslaughter charge stemming from the shooting death of limousine driver Costas Christofi. Sentencing for Williams is scheduled for February 23. Prosecutors said they will recommend that Williams be sentenced to five years in prison on four charges of attempting to cover up the fatal shooting. He was convicted of those charges in 2004. Williams was tried in 2004 on eight counts, including aggravated manslaughter. A jury acquitted him of three of the more serious shooting counts, found him guilty on four ""coverup"" charges, and was unable to reach a decision on the second count of reckless manslaughter. The trial judge, Edward Coleman, declared a mistrial on that count, and the state decided to move forward with a retrial on that charge. Williams is free on $250,000 bail with conditions that require him to check in daily with probation officers and not consume alcohol. Williams recently filed a motion to dismiss the charge on which he was to have been retried, arguing that it constituted double jeopardy because the same evidence used at his first trial would be presented at the retrial. However a three-judge appellate panel agreed with Coleman's reasoning that ""this isn't really a second prosecution, it is a continuation of the same prosecution."" Christofi was shot to death on February 14, 2002, in the bedroom of Williams' plush New Jersey estate. The 55-year-old driver had been hired to drive the former New Jersey Net and several friends to dinner after a sporting event in Pennsylvania. Afterward the group, including four members of the Harlem Globetrotters team, went back to Williams' home. The prosecution contended that Williams was recklessly handling a 12-gauge shotgun when it discharged and that he and two others tried to make it look as if Christofi had shot himself. In January 2003, Williams paid Christofi's family $2.75 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit. Williams, who retired about 10 years ago because of a leg injury, played nine seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets. During his basketball career, Williams was known for his rebounding skills. He averaged 8 points and 12 rebounds per game for the 30 games he played in the 1998-1999 season, according to the National Basketball Association's Web site. Last week, in an unrelated case, authorities charged Williams with one count each of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle while impaired, the Manhattan District Attorney's office told CNN. Those charges allege that Williams was driving a black Mercedes sport utility vehicle fast when he hit a tree at 3:15 a.m., a New York police spokesman said. William's bail was set at $10,000 and he was ordered by Judge Melissa Jackson to wear a monitoring bracelet. Calls to Williams' attorney were not immediately returned.","Williams pleads guilty to aggravated assault in shooting death of his chauffeur .

"(CNN)It is an unmistakable voice, that of Oliver Sacks, neurologist. ""Precise, probing, and epigrammatic"" is how Wired writer Steve Silberman once described it. And soon, the world learned Thursday, it  may be silenced. In a New York Times essay that received instant acclaim for its poignancy, beauty and determination, the renowned scientist and doctor revealed that he has incurable cancer. ""Over the last few days, I have been able to see my life as from a great altitude, as a sort of landscape, and with a deepening sense of the connection of all its parts, "" he wrote in the Times. ""This does not mean I am finished with life."" ""On the contrary, I feel intensely alive, and I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight,"" wrote Sacks, 81. ""Oliver Sacks has cancer. Damn. He writes about it as beautifully as you would expect,"" Twitter user Ian Leslie wrote. It's not Sacks' first bout with the disease. Nearly a decade ago, he was diagnosed with  ocular melanoma that eventually left him blind in one eye and served as the basis for one of his books, ""The Mind's Eye."" ""Although the radiation and lasering to remove the tumor ultimately left me blind in that eye, only in very rare cases do such tumors metastasize. I am among the unlucky 2 percent,"" he wrote in the Times. ""I feel grateful that I have been granted nine years of good health and productivity since the original diagnosis, but now I am face to face with dying. The cancer occupies a third of my liver, and though its advance may be slowed, this particular sort of cancer cannot be halted."" The British-born Sacks, who is on the staff of the New York University School of Medicine, is perhaps best known as the inspiration for the doctor portrayed by the late actor Robin Williams in the 1990 film ""Awakenings."" The film is based on Sacks' 1973 book of the same name, recounting his experiences treating patients who long been in a catatonic state after contracting ""sleeping sickness."" In his long career, he has made a practice of marrying clinical practice with narrative storytelling. ""If we wish to know about a man, we ask 'what is his story -- his real, inmost story?' -- for each of us is a biography, a story,"" he wrote in his 1985 book, ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat."" ""Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us -- through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations,"" he said. ""Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives -- we are each of us unique."" The habit that endeared him to many also brought criticism from some who accused him of being exploitative. Disability advocate Tom Shakespeare once called him ""the man who mistook his patients for a literary career."" But little of that was evident Thursday as fans reacted to the news, seizing on the eloquence of the essay and hoping for yet more from Sacks before he goes. In his essay, Sacks says he plans to ignore politics and leave debate over climate change to the next generation, and instead focus on living ""in the richest, deepest, most productive way I can."" ""I feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for anything inessential. I must focus on myself, my work and my friends."" For fans, there is good news among the gloom. Sacks will publish an autobiography in the spring and in his Times essay says he is nearly done with several other books.","In a moving essay, neurologist Oliver Sacks reveals he has incurable cancer .

"Traitor or patriot? Low-level systems analyst or highly trained spy? Slammed by top U.S. government officials and facing espionage charges in the United States, former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden described how he sees himself during an interview with NBC ""Nightly News"" broadcast Wednesday. And he defended his decision to leak documents about classified U.S. government surveillance programs. We've heard from Snowden a few times before, but the NBC interview with anchor Brian Williams inside a Moscow hotel was his first on an American television network. Here are 10 key points from the interview with the 30-year-old former NSA contractor: . 1. Snowden thinks he's a patriot. ""I think patriot is a word that's thrown around so much that it can be devalued nowadays,"" he said. ""Being a patriot doesn't mean prioritizing service to government above all else. Being a patriot means knowing when to protect your country, knowing when to protect your Constitution, knowing when to protect your countrymen, from the violations of and encroachments of adversaries. And those adversaries don't have to be foreign countries."" That assessment drew a sharp response from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who spoke with NBC earlier Wednesday. ""Patriots don't go to Russia. They don't seek asylum in Cuba. They don't seek asylum in Venezuela. They fight their cause here,"" Kerry said. ""Edward Snowden is a coward. He is a traitor. And he has betrayed his country. And if he wants to come home tomorrow to face the music, he can do so."" 2. Snowden says he was trained as a spy. U.S. President Barack Obama famously referred to Snowden as a hacker last year, and other officials have described him as a low-ranking analyst. That's misleading, Snowden said. ""I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine,"" Snowden said. ""Now, the government might deny these things. They might frame it in certain ways, and say, oh, well, you know, he's a low-level analyst. But what they're trying to do is they're trying to use one position that I've had in a career, here or there, to distract from the totality of my experience."" 3. Russia isn't where he expected to end up, but he's managing. ""I personally am surprised that I ended up here,"" Snowden said. ""The reality is I never intended to end up in Russia. I had a flight booked to Cuba onwards to Latin America, and I was stopped because the United States government decided to revoke my passport and trap me in the Moscow airport."" There's a culture gap, and it's been an adjustment. ""But even though I didn't choose to be here, even though circumstances really trapped me here, I can adapt. I can live life as an American more or less. That's the beauty of the Internet is that we're no longer tied to our communities by physical connections,"" he said. 4. Like a lot of us, he's been spending his free time watching old episodes of ""The Wire."" ""I'm really enjoying it,"" he said, though he added that the second season is ""not so great."" 5. He's not happy about some things the Russian government is doing. Snowden says he has no ties with the Russian government, and he isn't happy with some of its policies. ""It's really frustrating for someone who's working so hard to expand the domain of our rights and our privacy to end up stuck in a place where those rights are being challenged in ways that I would consider deeply unfair,"" he said. There's no good reason, for example, for a recent law requiring bloggers to register in Russia, he said. ""I can't think of any basis for a law like that, not just in Russia, but any country,"" he said. ""The government shouldn't regulate the operations of a free press."" So why doesn't he do something about it. ""There's so much that needs to be defended here in Russia, but I'm limited by my inability to speak Russian, and so on. It's an isolating and frustrating thing."" 6. It only takes a cell phone for spy agencies in the United States and other countries to find out a lot about you if they want to. And that's even if you're just Googling something simple, Snowden said, like a sports score (Williams told Snowden he'd recently searched for the score of a New York Rangers game). ""The NSA, the Russian intelligence service, the Chinese intelligence service, any intelligence service in the world that has significant funding and a real technological research team can own that phone the minute it connects to their network,"" Snowden said. They can turn on a phone remotely if it's off, he said. And even a detail like a Google search for a sports score can reveal a lot about you. ""You probably speak English. You are probably an American. You are interested in this sport. They might know what your habits are,"" Snowden said. 'Where were you in the world when you checked the score? Do you check it when you travel? Do you check it when you're at home? They could tell your pattern of life. Where are you doing these activities? When do you wake up? When do you go to sleep? What other phones are around you? Are you with someone who's not your wife? Are you someplace that you shouldn't be?"" 7. He wants to return to the United States someday. ""If I could go anywhere in the world, that place would be home,"" he said. But he responded with a series of questions rather than specifics when asked what he missed about home. ""What don't I miss? What would you miss? What wouldn't you miss?"" he said. ""I miss my family. I miss my home. I miss my colleagues. I miss the work."" 8. So why doesn't he come back to the United States to face charges? Snowden says that's a fair question, but an ignorant one. Because he was charged under the Espionage Act, Snowden says he has no chance to make a public defense of his case. ""You are not allowed to argue based on all the evidence in your favor because that evidence may be classified,"" he said. ""When people say, 'Why don't you face the music?' I say, 'You have to understand the music is not an open court and a fair trial.'"" 9. Why did Snowden leak classified documents? He says he had no choice. ""The reality is, the situation determined that this needed to be told to the public. The Constitution of the United States had been violated on a massive scale,"" Snowden told Williams. ""Now, had that not happened, had the government not gone too far and overreached, we wouldn't be in a situation where whistleblowers were necessary."" The U.S. government, Snowden said, is using the threat of terrorism ""to justify programs that have never been shown to keep us safe but cost us liberties and freedoms that we don't need to give up and our Constitution says we shouldn't give up."" 10. He says he tried to go through official channels before leaking information but met dead ends. Among the people he contacted, Snowden said, was the NSA's general counsel office. ""I reported that there were real problems with the way the NSA was interpreting its legal authorities,"" Snowden said. ""And the response, more or less, in bureaucratic language was, 'you should stop asking questions.'"" On Thursday, the NSA released what it said was a copy of an e-mail exchange between Snowden and its general counsel office. Snowden's e-mail asked for clarification of training course material and ""did not raise allegations or concerns about wrongdoing or abuse,"" according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.","Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden speaks to NBC's Brian Williams .
He says he considers himself a patriot, and that he was trained as a spy .

"Within hours of becoming a national hero, a viral video star and the top topic on Twitter, Charles Ramsey talked about having trouble getting sleep. It wasn't because of all the excitement that followed his knocking down a Cleveland neighbor's door, freeing three women and a girl who police say were held hostage for years. Instead, Ramsey told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, it was about knowing he had lived for a year near the captive women on the city's West Side. ""Up until yesterday the only thing that kept me from losing sleep was the lack of money,"" the restaurant dishwasher said on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff,"" said Ramsey. ""Just do the right thing."" Ramsey recounted Monday night's drama, when he heard a girl scream ""like a car had hit a kid."" He ran from his living room, clutching a half-eaten McDonald's Big Mac, to the house and helped free a woman identified as Amanda Berry. ""Amanda said, 'I've been trapped in here. He won't let me out. It's me and my baby."" Who are the three women freed in Cleveland? Ramsey and a man named Angel Cordero broke down the door, CNN affiliate WEWS reported in an earlier interview heard around the world. Ramsey told CNN he had never seen Berry before Monday, and at first, he could not place the name. ""Berry didn't register with me until I was on the phone, like wait a minute, I thought this girl was dead."" ""She's like, 'This (expletive) kidnapped me and my daughter,'"" he told the 911 operator, according to WEWS. Why the Web loves Ramsey . After police arrived, Berry explained there were other women inside. When police came out with them, Ramsey told the station, ""it was astonishing."" Berry was last seen after finishing her shift at a Burger King in Cleveland in 2003 on the eve of her 17th birthday. The other two women are Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, who disappeared at age 14 in 2004, and Michelle Knight, who vanished in August 2002, at age 21, according to police. Ramsey told CNN he is no hero and should not receive any reward. ""You've got to put that being a coward and 'I don't want to get in nobody's business,'"" he said. ""You got to put that away for a minute."" 'I barbecue with this dude' While Ramsey's quick action in the largely rundown neighborhood made him a hero, his colorful descriptions to WEWS helped make him dream fodder for the Twitterverse. Explaining that he had no idea Ariel Castro, his neighbor, may have had other people inside his home, Ramsey said, ""I've been here a year. You see where I'm coming from? I barbecue with this dude. We eat ribs and whatnot and listen to salsa music... ""He just comes out to his backyard, plays with the dogs, tinkers with his cars and motorcycles, goes back in the house. So he's somebody you look, then look away. He's not doing anything but the average stuff. You see what I'm saying? There's nothing exciting about him. Well, until today."" Castro ""got some big testicles to pull this off, bro,"" Ramsey told WEWS.  ""Because we see this dude every day. I mean every day."" He added, ""I knew something was wrong when a little, pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms. Something is wrong here. Dead giveaway."" In one of the top tweets about Ramsey, comedian Patton Oswalt wrote, ""Dear Charles Ramsey: I am not a little pretty white girl, but I totally want to run into your black arms. #hero."" Hodge's restaurant in Cleveland posted a message on Facebook saying, ""we're extremely proud of our employee Charles Ramsey for not turning his back on the young women. He's a true Cleveland hero. Our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with the women, their families and their friends."" Restaurant owner Chris Hodgson told CNN that Ramsey goes above and beyond in his duties. ""You give him something to do, and he'll do more,"" he said. ""We always look forward to seeing him, because you know he's gonna bring a smile to your face."" Hodgson said people have offered to raise money for Ramsey, but the employee would end up giving it to the victims and their families. The company is working with other restaurants to plan fund-raisers for the families, Hodgson said. For its part, McDonald's Corp., on its Twitter account Tuesday, said, ""Way to go Charles Ramsey -- we'll be in touch."" Despite his assertions, Ramsey and Berry were praised as heroes by John Walsh, former host of  TV's ""America's Most Wanted."" At an awards dinner for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, Walsh said he called Ramsey on Tuesday to tell him that. ""You are the guy who decided in 30 seconds to go up and spring a woman from a house of hell that she's been in and was desperate to get out that door with her 6-year-old daughter,"" Walsh recalled saying. Ramsey said he was raised to help women in distress, said Walsh. Ramsey interview goes viral, gets autotune treatment . Breathless 911 call . Ramsey's demeanor comes across clearly in his 911 call. ""Hey bro,"" Ramsey tells the 911 operator.  ""Check this out. I just came from McDonald's right? So I'm on my porch eating my little food, right? This broad is trying to break out the f-----g house next door to me, so there's a bunch of people on the street right now and s--t. So we're like, 'What's wrong, what's the problem?' She's like, 'This m--------r done kidnapped me and my daughter ...  She said her name is Linda Berry or some s--t. I don't know who the f--k that is, I just moved over here, bro. You know what I mean?"" He then answers the 911 operator's questions about the woman, what she looks like, and what she's wearing. Ramsey tells the operator an address which he says corresponds to Berry's location, not Ramsey's home address.  ""I'm smarter than that, bro. I'm telling you where the crime was, not my house,"" he says. ""Are the people that she said did this, are they still in the house?"" the 911 operator asks. ""I don't have a f-----g clue, bro. Like I said, I just came from McDonald's."" The operator then asks him to check whether Berry needs an ambulance. ""She needs everything. She's in a panic, bro. She's been kidnapped, so, you know, put yourself in her shoes."" ""We'll send the police out,"" the operator responds.","I'm no hero, Charles Ramsey tells CNN .

"Los Angeles (CNN)One of seven patients infected by the deadly superbug bacteria CRE is blaming a manufacturer of the medical scope used in his endoscopic procedure at a Los Angeles hospital, the patient's attorney said Thursday. The accusation was made on the same day the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety advisory about how the scope's design may impede effective cleaning. The patient, an 18-year-old high school student whose name wasn't released, is planning to sue one of the scope's manufacturers, said attorney Kevin Boyle. The student was ""very, very close to death,"" Boyle said. ""He's not doing well now."" That manufacturer, Olympus, is one of three that the FDA has identified as makers of the scope. Olympus said the firm provides instructions, guidance and supplemental educational materials on how to conduct effective cleaning of its endoscopes, also called duodenoscopes. ""While all endoscopes, including duodenoscopes, require thorough reprocessing after patient use in order to be safe, the Olympus TJF-Q180V requires careful attention to cleaning and reprocessing steps, including meticulous manual cleaning, to ensure effective reprocessing,"" which is a reuse of the same device, said Mark A. Miller, the company's executive director of communications and marketing. In addition to instructions and guidance given to every customer, Olympus makes available supplemental educational materials on cleaning the devices. Miller said. ""Olympus is monitoring this issue closely including today's safety communication from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We are working with the FDA, relevant medical societies and our customers regarding these concerns,"" Miller said. Meanwhile, the other two manufacturers identified by the FDA, Fujifilm and Pentax, couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. Understanding CRE, the 'nightmare' superbug . In all, seven patients at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center have caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments for bile ducts, gall bladder or pancreas, and two of them have died, a hospital spokeswoman said. The deadly bacteria CRE, or carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, was a contributing factor in the deaths, but the exact cause of those deaths wasn't immediately disclosed, a hospital spokeswoman said. The medical center is contacting 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the deadly bacteria. The 18-year-old patient went to the UCLA hospital for a suspected leaking pancreas in 2014, Boyle said. But the outpatient endoscopic procedure didn't reveal a leaking pancreas, and the youth returned home, Boyle said. Later, the young man was taken to a hospital again, where he remained for more than 80 days, Boyle said. The patient also spent time in intensive care, Boyle added. The attorney declined to state whether the second hospital visit was at the same UCLA facility. The attorney also said Thursday the patient doesn't blame the UCLA hospital for his infection. The UCLA hospital was scheduled to hold a press conference Thursday afternoon at 5:30 p.m. ET on the superbug incident. The patient was released from hospitalization, but within the last two weeks, he returned a third time to a hospital, where he remains, Boyle said Thursday. The attorney also declined to identify that hospital. Boyle alleges that in mid-2014, Olympus altered the design of the endoscope and removed a cleaning channel but didn't change the cleaning protocol. The scoping procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ERCP, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy said. The medical procedure is used to, among other things, unblock bile ducts and take care of pancreas issues. ""It is estimated that more than 500,000 ERCPs are performed each year in the U.S.,"" the society said. ""From what we know, over the past few years, there have been fewer than 100 known cases of transmission of these problematic bacteria through ERCP."" The ERCP procedure involves a duodenoscope, a flexible, lighted tube that is threaded through the mouth, throat, stomach and into the top of the small intestine (the duodenum), the FDA said. The device contains a hollow channel that allows the injection of contrast dye or the insertion of other instruments to obtain tissue samples for biopsy or treat certain abnormalities. The device also has a movable ""elevator"" mechanism at the tip, the agency said. Even meticulously cleaning the devices before high-level disinfection ""may not entirely eliminate"" the risk of transmitting infection, the FDA said. ""Reprocessing is a detailed, multistep process to clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable devices. Recent medical publications and adverse event reports associate multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in patients who have undergone ERCP with reprocessed duodenoscopes, even when manufacturer reprocessing instructions are followed correctly,"" the FDA said. ""Although the complex design of duodenoscopes improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ERCP, it causes challenges for cleaning and high-level disinfection. Some parts of the scopes may be extremely difficult to access and effective cleaning of all areas of the duodenoscope may not be possible,"" the FDA said. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt and John Bonifield contributed to this report.","A patient, 18, is hospitalized with a deadly CRE superbug infection, attorney says .

"(Life by DailyBurn) -- Hold onto your foam fingers, football fans. There's a new league in town, and it's all about fast and furious fitness. Combining weightlifting, bodyweight movements, gymnastics and more, the National Pro Grid League has drafted some of the most able-bodied athletes in the world, split them into eight teams, and is letting their strength, strategy and collective badass-ness determine the score. The best part: Grid doesn't discriminate. Men and women compete against and alongside each other, players over 40 are integral to the mix, and all-around athletes and specialists can each make a difference when it counts. So how does the team sport plan to change the face of fitness? DailyBurn went Grid-side as the New York Rhinos faced off against the Los Angeles Reign to witness the action at the first match of the inaugural 2014 season. DailyBurn: 5 beginner-friendly CrossFit workouts . Welcome to the big leagues: How Grid started . Sure, the idea of team functional fitness isn't exactly new. If the CrossFit Games come to mind when watching Grid athletes clean, jerk and kip at lightning speeds, it's no coincidence. The league's founder and commissioner is Tony Budding, a 10-year CrossFit executive who left the mega-brand to create a true co-ed spectator sport with greater mass appeal. DailyBurn: How fit are you, really? Taking cues from the NFL and NBA, in April 2014, Budding kicked things off with a football-esque Grid League Combine (athletes were selected via invite and application), which put hopefuls through every imaginable fitness test, from squats to handstand walks. Next came a traditional style draft in July, where coaches from the eight squads selected the best men and women for their rosters â€” factoring in not just their combine performance and fitness resume, but also personality and overall ""fit"" for the team. Once the teams were stacked, players were off to team training camp (albeit some no more than a week long), followed by pre-season scrimmages to get familiar with the ins and outs of league play, because no, it's not exactly intuitive. Unlocking the Grid: How it works . The action takes place on a 94-by-50-foot grid, split up into eight quadrants (four for each team) plus a start and finish area. Every team roster must consist of 20 athletes -- 10 men and 10 women, and on game day, only five men and five women are selected to start the match (including one 40-plus athlete of each gender). If anything goes wrong, injury or otherwise, three athletes are on standby on each team's bench. The two-hour match pits two teams against one another in 11 different races that progress across the grid. Races -- some of which are coed, some of which are male or female-only -- can include anything from handstand push-ups, burpee box jumps, rope climbs and double-unders for time. Then there's the ""clean ladder,"" where athletes must lift progressively heavier loads as they move down the grid (topping the scales at 340 pounds!), with the weight of each player's lifts added together for a combined team score. For each battle, the winning team gets two points (exception being the last race which counts for three points), and the losing team gets one. If the squad doesn't complete the challenge, they walk away with zero points for that race. When all is said and done, the team with the highest number of points at the end of the match gets the W. Of course, it's not just about brute strength and top-end speeds. There's plenty of strategy involved: Players can tag in and out to keep pace during each race or if they're incapable of completing one more rep. But don't consider a minute on the sidelines much of a break. ""When you're competing as an individual you can find your own pace and if you mess up, you have a longer time to make up for it,"" says Annie Thorsidottir, captain of the New York Rhinos. ""But on the grid, everything is so fast and high-intensity that you need to move fast while you're out there. If you start slowing down, it's time to rotate and change out. You need to be moving full speed, all the time."" Rhinos co-captain Mat Fraser, who also earned second place at the 2014 CrossFit Games, says the relentless speed is something Grid athletes, himself included, will need to adjust to. ""It's just all-out until the tank is empty. I have never done 20 burpees over a box that fast... "" Fraser says of the 9th race, one of the more challenging from his first match. ""When I hit that finish line -- I usually try to stay standing -- but I just flopped down. There was nothing left."" It's this high-octane format that brought spectators to their feet in the last few seconds of each battle at Madison Square Garden. It's also what might just hold the attention of fans for seasons to come, says New York Rhinos coach Ian Berger. According to Budding, there's plenty of potential for the players, too, stating that one of the many goals with this new league is to make functional fitness something the best in the world can finally make a living at. ""The icing on the cake is that my parents competed at Madison Square Garden when they were athletes,"" said Fraser, whose parents were professional pairs figure skaters. Faster together: The road ahead . In this abbreviated first season, teams will play three matches each, giving fans 12 live events total (and ideally adequate time for the league to work out any remaining kinks). In 2015, teams are slated to play 12 matches apiece; in 2016 and beyond: 16 matches. Playoffs will commence in September, and will culminate in the Grid League Finals in Las Vegas, to be aired on NBC Sports on October 3. The ultimate prize: the Pinnacle trophy (and a coveted place in Grid history). Until then, fans can watch regular season match-ups on NPGL.com via web broadcast. Or, check out the 2014 schedule to find an event near you. For 2015, expect eight more teams to join the league, including the Carolina Crush and others to be announced later this year.

"The United States has expressed ""deep concern"" about mob violence reportedly targeting international NGOs operating in Myanmar's restive west. In a statement released Thursday, the U.S. Department of State highlighted what it viewed as ""the continued lack of adequate security forces and rule of law on the ground in Sittwe,"" the capital of Rakhine state. Rakhine, located along Myanmar's west coast, has been at the center of an ongoing sectarian conflict between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, which has seen hundreds of people killed and tens of thousands more made homeless. Census controversy . An upcoming census planned by the central government has triggered further unrest amid fears it could exacerbate tensions between the state's majority Buddhist population and the Rohingya -- a stateless Muslim minority not recognized as citizens or one of the country's 135 ""official"" ethnic groups. Myanmar's government has come under increased pressure to take action to ease the unrest, and recently sent more troops to the region. The attacks this week in Sittwe, which targeted the offices and facilities of a number of international aid agencies working in the city, were triggered by reports that a foreign aid worker had treated a Buddhist flag disrespectfully. The worker in question, a staffer with the Europe-based humanitarian group Malteser International, had removed the flag from its building.  Many flags have been hung on buildings across the state ahead of the census as a sign of opposition to the Rohingya population -- who are widely viewed as intruders from across the border in Bangladesh. In a statement posted on their website Friday, Ingo Radtke, Secretary General of Malteser International, wrote: ""Malteser International is committed to the humanitarian principles and therefore the absolute ethnic and political neutrality of our work is our highest priority. We therefore avoid any form of political, religious or ethnic partisanship. That is the reason why our program coordinator has removed the Buddhist flag which -- in the local context -- might be seen as a symbol for a political positioning. She did not act in any degrading manner or express any cultural misconduct."" Aid groups 'bias' But foreign aid groups have come under fire in Myanmar for allegedly showing bias towards the Rohingya. Last month, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) was banned from operating in the volatile state following protests by ethnic Rakhine nationalists against the organization and other international NGOs. Myanmar's government said the organization had been banned for consistently showing bias towards the state's Muslim minority and breaching the terms of its agreement to operate in Rakhine, where it provided services to tens of thousands of patients. MSF said it was ""deeply shocked by this unilateral decision."" As the major NGO healthcare provider in Rakhine, it ran clinics in nine townships across the state, ""treating anyone who was unable to access the medical care they required,"" including tens of thousands of vulnerable people who had been displaced into camps by recurrent communal violence.","U.S.: Lack of ""adequate security forces and rule of law on the ground in Sittwe""

"Apple's latest tablet comes in a smaller, pocketable, gripable, adorable new travel size. But the iPad Mini is more than just a smaller face -- it's a whole new product with its own killer features and disappointments. Joining the iPhone and 10-inch iPad in Apple's iOS lineup, the 7.8-inch iPad enters a crowded market of 7-inch tablets. Here's a closer look at the Mini and how it stacks up against its competitors. The body . Applying the patented Apple shrink-ray wasn't the only change to the iPad body. The unibody shell is smooth and rounded on the back and edges -- more so than the 10-inch iPad. The lack of sharp edges makes it more confortable to hold in your hands. The iPad Mini is also thinner and lighter than the 10-inch iPad. The device weighs 0.68 pounds and is 0.28 inches thick. That's thinner than the iPhone 5. Being lighter means your arm doesn't get tired as fast (which is good because the new mini Smart Cover isn't the sturdiest stand). What else is so great about being small? Portability. Taking the 10-inch iPad outside of the house can be a bit of a slog. While it's a great replacement for bulkier laptops, it's still larger than a book. This little guy was built for reading books in cafes, watching movies in hammocks and playing games on the bus during the morning commute. After extensive pocket testing, we found the iPad Mini fits in most back pockets, from baggy khakis to skinny jeans (just don't sit down). It's easy to hold it with one hand, though some daintier mitts might find palming it a bit more difficult. Toss it in a purse, a saddle bag or the glove compartment. In many ways, this size feels more natural for a content-consumption device than the larger iPad. The competition . While the 10-inch iPad dominates tablet sales around the world, the iPad Mini is the new kid in the mid-sized tablet market. A crop of 7-inch tablets on shelves start at $199, including Amazon's Kinlde Fire HD, Google's Nexus 7 tablet and Barnes & Noble's Nook HD. The iPad Mini is different from these devices in a few key ways: It has a slighter larger and wider 7.8-inch screen, better hardware specs in most categories (screen resolution is a notable exception, which we'll revisit later), access to the simple and refined iOS operating system and Apple's vast selection of quality apps and content. It also has a much higher price tag. The iPad Mini starts at $329 for the 16GB Wi-Fi only version. The top of the line iPad Mini is 64GB, can connect over Wi-Fi and cellular connections, and costs $659. When choosing, you'll have to consider how important the Apple features are to you. Is the extra space and Apple ecosystem worth the extra $130? Avid readers and shoppers might get more out of a Nook or the Kindle Fire tablet, which is tightly tied into the Amazon store. (If you're only interested in reading, don't count out the amazing 6-inch, e-ink Amazon Paperwhite tablet.) The iPad Mini also has a bit of friendly competition from its own big siblings. Apple is still selling multiple generations of 10-inch iPads: the iPad 2 and the newer iPad with ""Retina Display"" (Apple's term). That Retina iPad was upgraded last month to the fourth generation with a faster processor and a better camera. The choice between Apple products largely depends on what you're going to use the device for. If it is a laptop replacement, sticking with the faster, larger, higher-resolution 10-inch iPad with Retina is still your best bet. The exception might be situations where the smaller size is a must-have feature, such as working in the field. The price difference between the iPad 2 and the iPad Mini is negligible -- the iPad 2 is only $70 more -- so that decision comes down to size preference and specs like camera resolution. The iPad Mini has better cameras -- the same ones found on the newest 10-inch iPad. The screen . This might be a sticking point for some buyers. The iPad Mini screen is basically the iPad 2 screen shrunk down to 7.8 inches. The two devices have the same number of pixels (1024-by-768), but the iPad Mini just packs them into a smaller space. The iPad 2 has 132 pixels per inch, the iPad Mini has 163 pixels per inch. There are a few reasons Apple might have gone this direction. The benefit of using the iPad 2's display size is that all the apps designed to work on the iPad 2 will work perfectly on the iPad Mini, do developers don't have to redesign their products. Also, the full retina display found on the latest iPad would likely have been a huge drain on battery life. (We didn't do official battery tests on the Mini, but we didn't need to charge it once in three days, even after streaming this Pearl Jam documentary on Netflix, testing out various apps and surfing the Web frequently.) Touchscreen technology has marched on since the iPad 2. The third- and fourth-generation iPads both have 2048-by-1536, 264 pixels-per-inch Retina screens. All three of the main competing 7-inch tablets -- the Kindle Fire, Nook and Nexus 7 -- also have higher-resolution screens. If you've never used a higher-resolution display, you might not even notice. But if you're already using a device with a better screen, the iPad Mini can look a bit grainy. It's like eating at In-N-Out Burger and then trying to go back to McDonald's. What is great about the display is how it fills the front of the device. The edges around the touchscreen, called bezels, are incredibly thin on the left and right sides. Apple also tweaked the software so that the screen is less sensitive to an errant thumb resting on the front of the device. Other specs . The screen isn't the only thing the iPad Mini got from the iPad 2. It is using the same processor, the A5. This processor is now two generations old, but it also doesn't have to power a big retina display, so it continues to feel speedy. There are two speakers for some decent stereo sound (not one as originally thought, according to an iFixit teardown), and the iPad Mini uses the new lightning connecter port. The cameras on the iPad Mini aren't as good as the iPhone 5, but they are exactly the same as what you'll find on the newest iPad. Taking a photo on the 10-inch iPad has always seemed awkward, but holding up an iPad Mini to take a quick video feels a bit more natural.","The iPad Mini hits the spot with its perfectly portable size, but the price tag is high .
Buyers could be disappointed by the lack of a retina display on the Mini .
iPad Mini is great for consuming content, but 10-inch iPad is still best as a PC replacement ."
"(CNN) -- Officials in Hoover, Alabama, were sending buses early Wednesday morning to pick up stranded motorists. In the first run, two school buses were sent to transport as many as 100 people to local shelters, said Rusty Lowe of the Hoover fire department. The buses will make several runs. [Breaking news update 1:08 a.m. ET Wednesday] . About 50 Atlanta school children were still stuck on buses early Wednesday morning. The students had gotten on buses to get home shortly after noon Tuesday, but treacherous road conditions coupled with gridlocked traffic has made it impossible. Kimberly Willis Green, spokeswoman for Atlanta Public Schools, said she did not have an estimate on the number of children stuck in Atlanta schools overnight. Atlanta-based Home Depot opened up 26 stores in Alabama and Georgia for stranded travelers. Spokesman Stephen Holmes said some of those who sought shelter spent time watching movies in store break rooms. ""At one store, they even opened up an indoor garden area to be a quiet area to open for reading,"" he said. [Last update 10:37 p.m. ET Tuesday] . Ice and snow bring chaotic commutes to much of South . (CNN) -- Cars stuck in ditches beside icy roads. Thousands of children stranded at schools that parents can't reach. Drivers camped out at gas stations with no way to get home. As a winter storm slammed into a broad swath of the South on Tuesday, authorities warned drivers to stay off the streets. ""This is a very dangerous situation,"" Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said. ""People need to stay at home. They need to stay there until conditions improve."" Motorists in major metropolitan areas including Atlanta sat trapped in gridlock as schools and offices shut down, unleashing hordes of vehicles onto slushy roadways. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed urged residents to stop driving for at least a day to give crews a chance to clean up. ""The next 24 hours, I really need folks to stay home,"" he told CNN affiliate WSB. ""Go home, give us some time."" While Northerners may laugh at their Southern friends' panic over a dusting of snow, the threat is real: With relatively few resources to battle snow and ice, public works crews may have a difficult time keeping up with any significant accumulation. Add to that the fact that millions of Southern drivers aren't used to driving on snow or ice, and things got messy -- fast. Snowflakes like you've never seen them before . Students stuck at schools . In Alabama, where freezing rain made driving perilous, at least five people were killed in weather-related traffic accidents Tuesday, state Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Steve Jarrett said. Bentley declared a state of emergency and said he had activated 350 National Guard troops to help respond to the storm. Emergency officials warned drivers to stay off the roads and urged people stuck in their cars to stay inside. ""The weather right now, the temperatures and the wind chill, if you step out of your car, are very dangerous,"" said Art Faulkner, the state's director of emergency management. In Birmingham, Melanie Wilson tried to drive after she got a message that her children's school was closing Tuesday morning. ""Immediately, I almost had an accident,"" she said. ""The school buses were at the bottom of our hill and you could tell the drivers were not sure they should try to make it up the hill. We're not sure where the ball was dropped. We heard it was going to be a light dusting with little accumulation."" She ditched her car after it spun out on a steep hill, and trudged through the snow to pick up her children and make it home safely. ""The children enjoyed it,"" she said. ""It was beautiful, a winter wonderland. It was lovely except for worrying about everybody else who can't get home to their families."" Governor: Teachers will take care of kids . The severe weather has forced 4,500 students to spend the night in various school buildings in Hoover, Alabama. And there were 800 students stuck in schools in Birmingham, Alabama, officials said. ""Staff is staying with them, feeding them,"" Birmingham City Schools Superintendent Craig Witherspoon said. ""High schools are showing movies."" Bentley urged parents who are unable to reach their children to remain calm. ""I know the anxiety there,"" he said. ""I want to reassure all the parents that if you trust your teacher to take care of your child during the day, they will be taken care of tonight."" At the Alabama Waldorf School, about 20 students were spending the night at a nearby home late Tuesday after state officials urged parents not to drive in the snow. ""They're doing really well,"" Administrator Lisa Grupe said. ""They're just having an extended play date. ... We all looked like ducks walking in the snow together."" On Twitter, a second-grade teacher said there were still about 150 students and 50 staff members stranded at Greystone Elementary School in Hoover, Alabama, because of ""horrible"" road conditions there. Not that they were all complaining. ""Very exciting day,"" teacher Carol McLaughlin tweeted late Tuesday afternoon. ""... The kids are being real troopers. : ) I think they think it's an adventure."" McLaughlin, even posted a picture of some kids out playing in the snow. Traffic gridlock traps motorists . In the Atlanta suburbs, school buses were stuck in traffic for hours. Hundreds of students were stranded at schools waiting for their parents to pick them up. Commutes that normally take minutes became nightmarish treks that lasted for hours. CNN affiliate WSB captured dramatic footage of parents reuniting with children after being stuck on a school bus for hours. In downtown Atlanta, streets were clogged as cars became trapped in gridlock after at least an inch of snow had fallen. ""Government, schools, and business closing at the same time and releasing everybody out into the city was a mistake that we all were a part of,"" Reed told WSB. For one stranded motorist -- it really was a situation of life and death. Police in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs said an officer helped a woman give birth on the side of Interstate 285. Traffic jams on snow-covered roads had stopped the woman from making it to the hospital and blocked paramedics from reaching her. That's when a police officer stepped in, helping deliver the baby girl Tuesday evening, Capt. Steve Rose said. As snow, sleet and freezing rain pelted much of the state, authorities warned of dangerous driving conditions and said the roads would likely get worse. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency as the storm hit. ""I'm about to lose my mind, literally,"" one woman trapped in traffic told WSB. ""It's horrible."" Mhari Patterson tried to make the 10-mile commute to her home outside Atlanta, but gave up after six hours, when she arrived at a RaceTrac gas station parking lot. There were about 80 other cars waiting out the storm there, she said. ""All of the area roads are frozen,"" she said. ""There is no way to get home."" Until things clear up, Patterson said she planned to spend the night at the gas station. Airlines cancel flights . The storms also snarled air travel across the country. Airlines on Tuesday canceled more than 3,100 flights within, into or out of the United States, with hundreds each at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Houston's George Bush International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks cancellations due to both weather and mechanical problems. It wasn't just the South shuddering. Midwesterners and others more accustomed to bitter weather are, too. All told, about 140 million people in 34 states were under some sort of winter weather warning or advisory, from snow and ice to bitterly cold wind chills, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Sleet and freezing rain began falling early Tuesday in East Texas, which along with Louisiana, was the first area to be affected by the winter storm. ""This town is shutting down,"" New Orleans cab driver August Delaney said. Mayor Mitch Landrieu declared a state of emergency and warned residents to stay off the roads. Robert Latham, the state's emergency management director, warned residents to expect power outages as well. ""We're looking at a part of the state that has a large number of pine trees,"" Latham said. ""I can tell you that as ice accumulates on pine trees, limbs will break. Trees will fall. Power will be out."" A rough commute . It usually takes Krystle Venuti Moore 10 minutes to drive home from her job at a mall in Kennesaw, Georgia. On Tuesday, it took her five hours, even though there wasn't much snow. It's quite a change from how storms were handled in her native New Hampshire, where she lived until she was 15. ""My family thinks it's hilarious,"" she said. There was one perk in the lengthy commute: ""watching the community and people helping each other out."" She saw high school students on ATVs offering rides to stranded motorists. And someone pushed her car when it got stuck. But it wasn't all positive. She saw drivers foul up traffic as they spun out after driving too fast, and even when she got close to home, she had to park a mile away and walk. The worst part? Normally in five hours, ""I could have driven to Florida,"" she said, ""someplace warm.""","4,500 students will spend the night in Hoover, Alabama, schools .

"British Prime Minister David Cameron called Monday for a new law to give police the temporary power to seize a passport in case a British citizen is suspected of trying to travel to support ISIS. Cameron told lawmakers meeting in the House of Commons on Monday there were two gaps in Britain's fight against the threat of terror at home. The first pertains to suspects traveling abroad, he said. ""Passports are not an automatic right,"" he said. ""We will introduce specific and targeted legislation to fill this gap by providing the police with a temporary power to seize a passport at the border, during which time they will be able to investigate the individual concerned. ""This power will include appropriate safeguards and oversight arrangements."" Work to prepare legislation to allow this will begin immediately, Cameron said. As well as stopping would-be jihadists, Cameron said Britain also needed measures to prevent the return of foreign fighters. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups. ""It's abhorrent that people who declare their allegiance elsewhere are able to return to the United Kingdom and pose a threat to our national security,"" Cameron told lawmakers. ""We are clear in principle that what we need is a targeted, discretionary power to allow us to exclude British nationals from the UK. We will work up proposals on this basis with our agencies, in line with our international obligations, and discuss the details on a cross-party basis."" Cameron said existing arrangements on aviation security would also be enshrined in law. ""Airlines will have to comply with our no-fly list arrangements, give us information on passenger lists and comply with our security screening requirements. If they do not do this, their flights will not be able to land in Britain,"" he said. New powers to bolster older restrictions . The Prime Minister said Britain's intelligence agencies and police believed that stronger powers were also needed to manage the risk posed by suspected extremists already in the UK. Cameron said he would introduce legislation giving British authorities new powers that would strengthen their ability to track suspected supporters of ISIS, by providing ""enhanced use of exclusion zones"" or ""relocation powers."" The powers would be in addition to existing terrorism prevention and investigation measures, or TPIMs, which allow restrictions on terror suspects, including overnight residence at a specified address, GPS tagging, reporting requirements, and restrictions on travel, movement, association, communication, finances, work and study. Threat level raised . The UK government raised its terror threat level Friday from ""substantial"" to ""severe"" -- the fourth of five levels in response to events in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS militants have seized a large swath of territory. ""That means that a terrorist attack is highly likely, but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent,"" Home Secretary Theresa May said. The ""root cause"" of Britain's terror threat is ""Islamist extremism,"" Cameron said Friday. The execution of American journalist James Foley is clear evidence that ISIS' fight in Iraq and Syria ""is not some foreign conflict thousands of miles from home that we can hope to ignore,"" he said. ISIS is unlike other Islamist extremist groups in its primary focus not to find a country that can be its base of operations, but to create its own country. And the group has had ample success in that regard, given the vast reach already of what it calls the ""Islamic State."" While it's been widely reviled internationally, ISIS has managed to attract some support among Muslims and drawn foreign fighters, like the masked man with an apparent British accent who took part in Foley's beheading. Even without specific threats in the West, ISIS' track record in Syria and Iraq -- where it was known to massacre minorities, forcefully institute Sharia law and stage executions and stonings -- suggests it may be capable of anything. Cameron said the group  poses a ""greater and deeper"" threat than Britain has known before. Cameron said military force is among the tools that can be used against ISIS, while adding that aid, diplomacy and political influence should also be part of Britain's response. While the threat level just went up Friday, Britain's national policing lead for counterterrorism, Mark Rowley, said that police have been escalating their efforts to combat the jihadist threat for months. He claimed 69 arrests in the first half of 2014 for offenses ranging from funding ""terrorist activity through to the preparation and/or instigation of terrorism acts and traveling abroad for terrorist training."" U.S. terror threat level . U.S. officials said last week there were no plans to raise the United States' terror threat level. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he did not anticipate the threat level would rise anytime soon, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said there was no specific threat against the United States. ""The U.S. and the U.K. are in constant touch to discuss the threats we face and steps we can take separately and together to address them. We're not going to comment on specific new domestic measures the Prime Minister proposed today other than to say we will continue to work together closely in the days, weeks and months ahead,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a written statement Monday. ""For our part the U.S. Government will continue to take vigorous and prudent steps informed by the latest intelligence, building on our established security measures and potentially through additional efforts, both seen and unseen, to combat any terrorist threat,"" she said.

"(CNN)Several times in recent months, America has been treated to a spectacle that New Yorkers grew accustomed to -- and sick of -- a long time ago: an outburst from ex-mayor Rudy Giuliani that is equal parts ugly, thoughtless and divisive. ""I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America,"" went the latest outburst, delivered to a group of fellow Republicans at a Manhattan restaurant.  Obama, said Giuliani, ""doesn't love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country."" The White House barely even acknowledged the outburst, in part because Giuliani, a failed candidate for president, has become more of a cable television rabble-rouser than a serious national political figure. Consider what happened in 2008, when Giuliani and Obama were both on the ballot for the highest office in the land. Obama went on to become president; Giuliani, by contrast spent nearly $50 million and lost every caucus and primary he entered before dropping out with a grand total of only one delegate, a modern record for electoral futility. In other words, it would be more accurate to say America -- as expressed by the will of the voting public -- doesn't love Giuliani. But that won't stop him from sounding off again in the future. Last November, on ""Meet the Press,"" Giuliani waded into the racial tensions that racked Ferguson, Missouri, by blaming the police killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on black communities -- all black communities. In a stunning exchange with author and scholar Michael Eric Dyson -- one of many advocates complaining about the use of excessive police force -- Giuliani said: ""The white police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other 70 to 75% of the time."" Exactly who he meant by ""you"" wasn't explained; it didn't have to be. Giuliani's favorite political math equation is long division: Separate the public into ""us"" and ""them"" (e.g., ""He doesn't love you. And he doesn't love me"") and then pose as champion of half the people.  And if there are racial overtones to the divisiveness, so be it. ""Why don't you cut it [street violence] down so many white police officers won't have to be in black areas?"" he said to Dyson, an academic and author who has no power or responsibility to end violence anywhere, but happens to be black. After a national furor, Giuliani slightly backed away from his outburst about Obama, grudgingly acknowledging that the twice-elected President of the United States is, indeed a ""patriot."" We live in a country that survey researches say is more divided by party and ideology than at any time in decades. To understand why we continue to talk past one another, look no further than the Giulianis of America, who eagerly feed on fear and anger instead of developing a positive vision for the country.","Rudy Giuliani said he does not believe the president loves America .

"Women swap secrets about lots of things, but pee problems can seem like TMI. This is one time we should follow a reality star's lead: Kris Jenner discussed her leakage on ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians."" The truth is, even young, fit women (who haven't popped out six kids like Kris has) have urologic troubles. And with all the simple solutions out there, there's no reason to hold it in. Read on for reassurance and to get relief down there. 'I dribble when I laugh, run, sneeze, cough' This is a classic sign of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which one-third of women experience, according to the American Urological Association. ""The issue is typically weakness in the sphincter, which controls the opening to the bladder, or in the pelvic floor,"" the muscles and ligaments that hold pelvic organs in place and support the bladder, says Dr. Kathleen C. Kobashi, head of the section of urology and renal transplantation at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle. Pregnancy, childbirth, age, and chronic constipation can all weaken those muscles. You're also more likely to have SUI if you're a heavy exerciser, a smoker, are overweight or have a genetic predisposition. No matter what the cause, you don't have to put up with leakage. Start with pelvic-floor exercises, a.k.a. Kegels, twice a day. A quick refresher from Missy Lavender, founder and board president of Women's Health Foundation: . -- Relax your glutes, thighs, and vaginal muscles. -- Squeeze your pelvic-floor muscles up and in for five counts, like you're trying to stop peeing mid-stream; relax for five. Repeat 10 times. They can work in the moment, too: Contracting when you feel a sneeze coming on can block urine from escaping, says Dr. Karen Noblett, professor and division director for urogynecology at the University of California--Irvine. If Kegels don't help, a doctor may prescribe a urethral insert, a vaginal device called a pessary, or medication. A procedure can also be done to insert a supportive ""hammock"" under the urethra. Health.com: Gotta go? 13 reasons for urine trouble . 'I get way too many UTIs' You're in good company. Up to a quarter of women with a history of urinary-tract infections (UTIs) are likely to have a recurrence within six months, according to a study in the ""Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Canada."" ""A woman's urethra is short and close to the vagina and rectum, where bacteria live,"" Dr. Noblett says. That makes it easy for them to travel up into the bladder, where they can cause symptoms such as urine that burns or is cloudy or bloody; back, belly, or side pain; and urges to go when you don't have to. Often, recurrent UTIs are linked to having sex. Being in perimenopause or menopause can make you more vulnerable to them, too. UTIs are usually treated with antibiotics. Even if you're positive you have one, though, head to your gyno rather than asking her to call in a prescription -- you might really have interstitial cystitis, which has similar symptoms, but can't be treated with antibiotics. Plus, there's been a major jump in cases of UTIs that are resistant to the two most common antibiotics used to treat them, and taking the meds when you don't need them increases this resistance. A simple culture can confirm it is a UTI and determine what kind of antibiotic you need. Luckily, little lifestyle tweaks can make you less prone. A few loo basics: Peeing before and after sex and wiping from front to back after a bowel movement all help remove UTI-causing bacteria. What about cranberry juice? Experts now agree that it probably won't knock out an infection. The good news: Drinking 5 ounces of real cranberry juice (not the cocktail kind) twice a day may give you an edge in dodging recurrent infections, a new review of research reveals. Health.com: 10 ways to keep your bladder healthy . 'I had a kidney stone -- and I live in fear of more' While men are their main victims, the incidence of kidney stones in American women has nearly doubled in the past two decades, a new study shows. These hard masses form when certain chemicals in pee become too concentrated. The resulting stone can cause excruciating symptoms (like back pain and vomiting). No one knows exactly why stones form, but dehydration and diet may play a role, especially in those with a family history. Obesity is also linked to them. If you experience extreme lower back pain along with nausea, vomiting, or a fever, head to the ER -- you could have a serious infection, says Dr. Charles D. Scales Jr., a clinical scholar in UCLA's department of medicine and urology. For lesser symptoms, call your doctor. And prevent stones by drinking lots of water, lowering your sodium and meat intake, and getting the daily recommended 1,000 milligrams of calcium. If that doesn't work, your doc can prescribe drugs to help you feel better, fast.","Doing Kegel exercises twice a day will help prevent bladder leakage .

"It lived about 100 million years ago, weighed four tons and likely was at the very top of its prehistoric food chain. Researchers from Chicago's Field Museum, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University announced Friday the discovery of Siats meekerorum, a dinosaur that stretched more than 30 feet long, in eastern Utah. Given its size and other characteristics, they believe this creature ruled its ecosystem in the middle of the Cretaceous, a period known as the last in the so-called ""Age of Dinosaurs."" It's not known if Siats meekerorum existed alongside Tyrannosaurus rex; fossils found from the same patch of Utah's Cedar Mountain Formation shows it did share the land with tyrannosaurs. But relatively speaking, these tyrannosaurs were much smaller (and below the 7 or so tons of later T. Rexes) and definitely down on the predatory food chain. ""At least 98 million years ago, we know that (tyrannosaurs) were small and somebody else was top dog in the neighborhood,"" said Peter Makovicky, The Field Museum's dinosaur curator. ""(Siats meekerorum) is a large dinosaur,"" he adds. ""And we have no evidence -- nor do the teams that worked in this area prior to us -- of anything bigger."" Its size and appearance alone are reason enough to excite paleontologists. But there are a few other facts that make this find noteworthy, said Makovicky. One is that Siats meekerorum helps to fill in a roughly 30-million-year gap in the geologic record in North America, a period for which relatively little is known about dinosaurs on the continent. Another: Its closest carchardontosaurian (the family it hails from) kin hailed from elsewhere in the world, suggesting there was more movement and dispersion of dinosaurs at a time the continents had largely already drifted apart than had been thought. ""Until 10 years ago, we thought this was a time period when North American dinosaurs were isolated,"" Makovicky said. ""The evidence is growing that was not actually the case. Dinosaurs were quite good at spreading around the world."" Name means 'cannibalistic monster' Desert heat of 110 degrees Fahrenheit -- so hot that Makovicky's dog burned his paws -- is bad enough. But for a paleontologist, working in this oven all summer without any big finds? That's definitely a lot worse. But with a few days in the 2008 field season, Lindsay Zanno from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences spotting something she and her colleagues, including Makovicky, found curious. The group returned the next year, opening up a bigger area, but still had more work to do once the season ended. Finally, with the help of a jackhammer, they finished unearthing their discovery in 2010, according to Makovicky. He said, initially, these experts would have speculated the new creature was related to T. rex or Ankylosaurus, both of which roamed what is now North America. South Carolina team finds new hammerhead shark species . The more they dug, literally and figuratively, the paleontologists realized the species belonged to the carchardontosaurian family, with relatives like the giant Giganotosaurus, a carnivore that dates to the Late Cretaceous period and has been found in Argentina. The name for the new dinosaur, Siats meekerorum, refers to a cannibalistic monster in mythology of Utes, a Native American people who lived where it was found. ""This dinosaur was a colossal predator second only to the great T. rex and perhaps Acrocanthosaurus in the North American fossil record,"" said Zanno, the lead author of the study in Nature Communications announcing the discovery, in a press release. New legless lizards found in California . And it hasn't been an isolated breakthrough. Makovicky notes that, since Siats meekerorum, their crews found two other dinosaur species nearby from the same period that likewise are related to others from different continents. Zanno expects more such fresh insights in the years to come. ""Siats is just the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""Our teams are unearthing a lost dinosaurian ecosystem right here in the badlands of North America.""

"Gilad Shalit is free. The first of 1,027 Palestinians have returned home, and in Egypt observers are cautiously applauding the oft-criticized leadership that secured the deal; it's a more hopeful note in a democratic transition that has otherwise been checkered. For Israel and America, the culmination of drawn-out and somewhat oblique negotiations possibly signifies a more positive future in relations with a new leadership that had until now been viewed as a potentially destabilizing force for peace in the Middle East. In the days since murmurs of a fruitful end to the negotiations began to circulate, Egypt has reiterated its commitment to honoring its accords with Israel. In reflecting on the months since Hosni Mubarak stepped down on February 11, it is clear that the interim government and de facto president, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, have in effect done their utmost to maintain a Mubarak-era status quo. The question, is how long will this last? And will Egypt continue to be the ally of America in a region caught in a dependency that often undermines its longer-term interests and the will of its people? Under the Mubarak regime, relations with Israel were strong, albeit concealed. The 1978 Camp David treaty was a deal between leaders (former president Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin) that many Egyptians opposed. Economic ties between the two states steadily increased under the tutelage of Mubarak's business associates, who stood to profit from them; and military cooperation, for example on Gaza, was deep. Yet many Egyptians continued to harbor deep-rooted animosity towards the neighboring state. The former regime, well aware of this, gave people enough space to air their grievances — Egypt's protest movement emerged in part from the tradition of demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians, which the government allowed. At the same time, the Mubarak regime worked to keep its relations with Israel as low profile as possible. Mubarak is now gone, most of his business associates have been put behind bars, and the defacto rulers of the liberated Egypt are left to grapple with the question of Israel. For the ruling military council, adhering to the Camp David Accords comes at a cost, but until it finds a better alternative to the aid it receives from the United States for sticking to its end of the deal -- a package that includes military training, resources, financial aid, intelligence support, as well as regional security guarantees -- it is worth the price. With no viable alternative, the problem, or question perhaps, arises in what pressure a new parliament, and the new-found public voice, might assert to change that status quo. Outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo last month, protesters, many of them young activists, set the Israeli flag on fire, scaled the embassy walls, and demanded an end to relations with ""the Zionist state."" But unlike the people of Gaza, few Egyptians appear to be celebrating the release of hundreds of prisoners held in Israel. Rather, on Twitter and on the ground, they are describing it as yet another ploy by the ruling military council to consolidate its power. ""They just want to show that they can negotiate and oversee foreign policy,"" someone tweeted. ""This is a dirty game to secure power,"" another said. Although it is indisputable that the majority of Egyptians -- even the Muslim Brotherhood -- do not want to go to war, their grievances towards Israel, and then America, run deep; as deep, perhaps, as their grievances towards the former regime. The likelihood of the military council -- or a future Cabinet of ministers and its president -- being able to maintain the status quo that long reassured America and its friends, is highly unlikely. Rather, in the new Egypt, which is struggling to get on solid footing, there will be fleeting moments of hope, but also, many more moments of protest when the people stand up and use the leverage they have uncovered in organized street movements to challenge the regime. Many of the gripes will be internal -- including minimum wage, inflation, and economic opportunities -- but enough will involve Egypt's relations with the world. In Egypt today, we are witnessing a population that has found its voice, and the confidence and right to assert it. We are also witnessing a public that understands what organized protest can achieve. There is no taking or turning that back. For global powers and neighbors that have long relied on Egypt as a constant and stable partner and force, that era is gone. In the new Egypt, and the new Middle East, the will of the people is the force to reckon with, and just as they fought for the ousting of Mubarak, they will also fight for a government of their own choosing. In that government, there will be at least as many adversaries to the regional status quo as there are supporters -- and in that too, there will be no turning back.","Egypt has reiterated its commitment to honoring its accords with Israel .

"KANO, Nigeria (CNN)A military plane on Tuesday dropped a bomb on mourners in a Niger village on the border with Nigeria, killing 37 people and wounding 20 others, residents and a regional security source in Niger told CNN. ""A military jet on an operational mission against Boko Haram targets accidentally attacked a funeral gathering in Abadam Faransa, killing several people,"" the security source said Wednesday on condition of anonymity. Resident Abatcha Kaloma, who assisted with the burials of the dead, said 37 people were killed and 20 were wounded, figures backed up by a community leader who didn't want to be named. It was unclear which nation's military carried out the bombing, but residents blamed Nigeria, a charge it denied. Air Commodore Dele Alonge, a spokesman for the Nigerian Air Force, said the military didn't conduct air raids in that area Tuesday. The security source wouldn't say where the plane was from. Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria have in recent weeks stepped up a coordinated offensive against Boko Haram, which is based in Nigeria. Chad and Nigeria have used fighter jets as part of a regional alliance to defeat the Islamist group that has recently escalated its deadly attacks on Nigeria and its neighbors. The incident took place around 6:30 p.m. outside the home of a local official who died hours earlier. Boko Haram, whose name translates as ""Western education is sin,"" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Its tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. Niger became more of a target after its decision to join the regional alliance fighting the Islamist group. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this story.","Nigeria denies it flew any sorties in the area on day in question .

"As pollsters, it's our job to keep a finger on the pulse of the American electorate. As women, we also take an interest in finding out what female voters are actually thinking. It's never as simple as commentators want you to think. We know that Democrats like to reduce women down to single-issue voters. They like to talk about ""the women's vote"" as if it's a monolith. As common as those talking points are, they offer a pretty unsophisticated view of women and what women want. Recently we did a poll for the Republican National Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee of 1,206 women voters in battleground congressional districts. These are the districts that will see competitive races for seats in the House of Representatives this fall. So what does our polling show? First, women's priorities run the gamut, but the most important issues involve jobs and household finances. Second, the vast majority of women are upset with the status quo and express feelings that range from anger to apathy. No one, however, is satisfied. To put that into a political context, that's bad news for the party that holds the White House. Democrats should be especially concerned, because their only discernible appeal to women voters has been ""Republicans don't like you."" It's a line devoid of substance, at a time when women voters desperately want action on issues of substance. For years Democrats have fixated on a contrived ""war on women"" to connect with female voters. But that routine won't get them far today, given their abysmal effort to improve the lives of working families. Contrary to what Democrats' rhetoric would suggest, the economy, government spending and health care rank as women's top priorities. And current policies aren't cutting it. The survey also found that only 25% of women in these districts believe the country is headed in the right direction, while 67% say it's on the wrong track.  A majority (53%) also disapprove of President Barack Obama's job performance. On the economy, women are still looking for real solutions that offer women better work opportunities and will actually start growing our economy for all workers. They also endorse changes to our tax and retirement laws to allow them to keep more of what they earn and to help small business owners pursue their goals. Opposition to Obamacare among women is high, with 55% opposing the Democrats' signature health care law. Just 41% support it. Importantly, those who oppose Obamacare feel much more strongly about it than those who support it. Forty-three percent strongly oppose the law, compared to just 22% who strongly support it. That's a significant enthusiasm gap that works in the favor of the Republican Party, the party that believes we can do better than Obamacare. In other words, when our candidates oppose Obamacare and support real health care solutions, they are likely to find support among women. In the poll, women said they agree with some basic principles about health care, including the statement, ""We need to start over and create real heath care reform that allows us to choose the plans we want, the doctors we need at the cost we can afford."" They reject the typical Washington one-size-fits-all approach and identify with the statement in the poll that ""Obamacare doesn't allow women to make health care decisions for their families."" None of this is to say Republicans will have an easy go of it in November 2014 or 2016. There was a clear ""gender gap"" in 2012, with Obama winning the votes of a majority of women. That gap will not be erased overnight. Yet in the last midterm election, in 2010, women favored Republicans over Democrats for the first time in modern history. Many of those same dynamics are at play in 2014. Republicans do have an opportunity. When they make their case to voters, in this cycle and the next, the majority of female voters will be open to candidates who can present substance and solutions. Simply saying ""they don't like women"" is a vapid political strategy that will not be effective for the other side. For female voters, ideological debates also aren't seen as helpful. By and large they practice the politics of pragmatism. They're looking for leaders who are measured and solution-oriented in their approach. The party that represents the status quo will be unacceptable to the majority of women voters. The party that provides meaningful, workable alternatives will have the advantage among women voters. Republicans are the party best positioned to take on that role. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Republican pollsters say Democrats like to simplify issues when it comes to women .

"(CNN)A tense encounter on the road. Gunshots cutting across a neighborhood cul-de-sac in Las Vegas. That's what ended the life of Tammy Meyers -- the latest face of road rage in America. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions in the case. Here's a look at some of them: . Authorities have identified the alleged gunman as Erich Milton Nowsch Jr., who was arrested after a tense standoff Thursday. He will face murder and two other felony charges, according to court documents. The other two counts are attempted murder and discharge of a firearm from a vehicle. She's a 44-year-old mother of four and grandmother of one, described by her husband as ""a beautiful woman"" who loved him, ""her kids and ... a lot of other people."" ""She never did anything bad to anybody,"" her husband Robert Meyers said. Nor did she put up with nonsense, he added, explaining that ""if she was in the Marines, she would have been a master sergeant."" And, Robert Meyers added, ""She hated bullies."" Giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson. The two went to the parking lot of a nearby school, where the teen got behind the wheel. Then they switched places, with Tammy Meyers driving back home. Yes. And Lt. Ray Steiber, a Las Vegas homicide detective who is heading the investigation into Meyers' death, suggested this isn't unusual. He notes that Nevada requires first-time drivers ""to log nighttime driver hours"" to get their license. ""When I taught my children how to drive, there were certain aspects of driving that they needed to learn,"" Steiber said. ""And one of them was driving at night."" Nothing much out of the ordinary at the actual lesson. It's what happened afterward that's key. As the mother drove her daughter home, she was still giving her daughter a lesson on how to merge lanes and turn properly on a public roadway, when she spotted a ""vehicle speeding up rapidly behind her,"" Steiber said. That vehicle, a sedan, pulled up behind her and then to the side of her. It was then that Meyers' 15-year-old daughter ""reached over while her mom was driving and honked the horn,"" the detective said. ""She was getting a driving lesson, so she figured that this person was speeding and ... needed to be corrected,"" said Steiber. ""Right or wrong, she beeped the horn."" That got the other driver's attention: He pulled in front of the Meyers' car, stopped, then walked back toward the mother and daughter. He said something to them -- exactly what hasn't been stated publicly -- but Meyers and her daughter aren't believed to have responded, according to the detective. Tammy Meyers' husband told HLN's Nancy Grace that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter. She went back home, and told her teenage daughter to go into the house, wake up her brother Brandon and ask him to get into the car. Brandon Meyers, 22, brought a registered gun with him. Tammy Meyers was scared and upset, Steiber said of the woman's feelings at the time. She then drove back out of her neighborhood to the scene of the confrontation to see if she could find the man she'd clashed with, the detective said. Robert Myers said his son and wife were trying to move the car. They didn't want the car to be recognized in front of their home. But the other car, described as a gray or silver sedan, saw them, he said. Robert Meyers texted: ""My wife and son drove away from home, bad guys following. She lost them and upon coming home turned on street, bad guys are right in front. ""After that, bad guys open fire different location. My wife got home, told her son to take cover and after he saw his mom shot he opened fire three times maybe four."" That's a judgment call and may depend, in part, on what transpired earlier. ""Yes, maybe in a make-up world she should have stayed home. Please remember statement from this animal, 'I'm going to kill you and your daughter,' "" said Robert Myers. Steiber said only that police don't think Tammy Meyers did anything wrong criminally. Her husband, who was out of state at the time, has said, ""My wife paid the ultimate price for it because of the mistakes she made."" Las Vegas detectives have given a slightly different version of events than Meyers' husband, saying the mother drove home to pick up her armed son and went back out to look for the suspect and his car. According to Steiber, ""at one point Mrs. Meyers was following what we consider a suspect vehicle. And then, at another point, they broke apart and Mrs. Meyers went home."" The detective said that the second encounter happened at least 5 minutes after Meyers went home the first time and everything unfolded ""within a couple blocks"" of each other. She and her son got out of her car. Then, a sedan pulled into her cul-de-sac from which someone started firing. Meyers' son, Brandon, shot back, Steiber said. The car with the shooter then backed out and drove away. It was then that Brandon Meyers discovered ""his mother, who was standing off to the side and behind him, had been struck by gunfire,"" Steiber said. It's right after that, at 11:22 p.m., that relatives and neighbors first alerted police. No one is denying that Brandon Meyers used his gun. Still, Steiber said that police believe a bullet from the sedan driver's gun -- not that of her son -- killed Tammy Meyers. As the standoff unfolded Thursday, the victim's husband approached reporters. ""Are you all happy? You made my wife look like an animal ... and my son. There's the animal, a block away. Are you happy?"" Robert Meyers said, obviously agitated. Speaking at a vigil Tuesday, he said ""There were mistakes. ... But this particular mistake was made to keep a bigger mistake from happening."" ""My son is not an animal,"" Robert Meyers said. ""My son is a hero in my book."" The 22-year-old says he was just trying to protect his family. ""Everyone can think what they have to think,"" Brandon Meyers said. ""I did it for a reason, and I'd do it for anyone I loved."" Road rage: Cameras and guns only add to the problem . They're hurting. A week after the shooting, Tammy Meyers still hadn't been buried. But loved ones did hold the candlelight vigil, one that Robert Meyers said was meant ""to show my respects to my wife and to let her kids get some of this grief off (their chests) and heal."" ""It's going to take a lot more than this to do it,"" he added. Yes. Robert Meyers alluded to such criticism -- specifically related to the difference between the family's initial accounts and the timeline later related by police -- in a Facebook post. ""I was told one version of what happened to my wife ... and I never said anything different than (what I was) told,"" he wrote late Wednesday night. ""If all of you people ... think I was a fraud and lied about facts, I'm truly sorry."" In the same Facebook post, Meyers said all money raised for the family via GoFundMe -- an account that Meyers said a friend started -- will be returned. The related GoFundMe page has been shut down. But Robert Meyers told reporters that his family knew the accused gunman. ""We know this boy. He knew where I lived,"" he said. Calling it an ""open and ongoing investigation,"" Steiber said authorities are still piecing together exactly what happened and who is responsible. Police are using video and other evidence to try and get ""an accurate timeline and an accurate depiction of what occurred,"" Steiber said. ""That takes time."" The detective did say that authorities don't have any reason to believe that this incident is tied to anything else. Police believe it was ""an isolated incident involving road rage that ended in a tragic murder,"" he said. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Erich Milton Nowsch faces three felony charges, including murder .

"Some lawmakers are rethinking their support of controversial anti-piracy bills that led to some websites shutting down in protest. The protest was in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) bill, a piece of proposed legislation that is working its way through Congress. A Senate committee approved a similar bill in May called the Protect IP Act (PIPA), which is now pending before the full Senate. The protest seemed to change the minds of lawmakers, including those that had strongly backed the bills in the past. ""We can find a solution that will protect lawful content. But this bill is flawed & that's why I'm withdrawing my support. #SOPA #PIPA,"" Republican Sen. Roy Blunt wrote on his official Twitter page. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who was an initial co-sponsor of PIPA, reversed his position. ""I have decided to withdraw my support for the Protect IP Act. Furthermore, I encourage Senator Reid to abandon his plan to rush the bill to the floor. Instead, we should take more time to address the concerns raised by all sides, and come up with new legislation that addresses Internet piracy while protecting free and open access to the Internet,"" Rubio wrote on a Facebook post. Rep Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, an original co-sponsor of SOPA,  also said he had changed his view. ""Thank you for your concern about #SOPA. I have asked to have my name removed from the bill. However, the economic impact of IP theft is real and a solution is needed,"" Terry wrote on Facebook. Later Thursday, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky joined the newly minted opponents of the bill. He had not previously voiced an opinion on the legislation. ""While we must combat the online theft of intellectual property, current proposals in Congress raise serious legal, policy and operational concerns,"" McConnell said in a news release. ""Rather than prematurely bringing the Protect IP Act to the Senate floor, we should first study and resolve the serious issues with this legislation."" Share your thoughts on SOPA and PIPA on iReport . Wikipedia, one of the websites that shut down on Wednesday, returned Thursday with the message: ""Thank you for protecting Wikipedia. We're not done yet."" Clicking on that message takes a Wikipedia viewer to a thank you letter and instructions on how to continue fighting against anti-piracy bills that critics say could amount to censorship. ""Your voice was loud and strong,"" the message said. ""Millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open Internet."" (Why Wikipedia went down at midnight) On Wednesday, instead of the usual encyclopedia articles, visitors to Wikipedia's English-language site were greeted by a message about the decision to black out its Web page for an entire day. However, users were able to access its mobile site on some smartphones. Boing Boing, a blog that took part in Wednesday's online protest but returned on Thursday, said the U.S. Senate was considering legislation that would ""certainly kill us forever.  The legislation ... would put us in legal jeopardy if we linked to a site anywhere online that had any links to copyright infringement."" ""In the past, the media industry has often gone after particular infringers -- people who have downloaded stuff off the Internet and sharing it. And now they're going after websites that link to these things,"" Rob Beschizza, Boing Boing's managing editor, said Wednesday. ""The bill is supposed to let copyright holders get court orders against them, and there's all sorts of various measures for getting sites blacklisted or blocked. ""The problem is that the measures are so wide-ranging and so open to abuse that we're worried that sites like ours could be brought down by frivolous claims,"" he said. While not blacking out its home page, search giant Google joined the cause by covering its famous logo with a black rectangle and urging visitors, ""Tell Congress:  Please don't censor the web!"" SOPA's supporters -- including CNN's parent company, Time Warner, and groups such as the MPAA -- say that online piracy leads to U.S. job losses because it deprives content creators of income. The bill's supporters dismiss accusations of censorship, saying the legislation is meant to revamp a broken system that doesn't adequately prevent criminal behavior. But SOPA critics say the bill's backers don't understand the Internet's architecture, and therefore don't appreciate the implications of the legislation they're considering. The controversy over SOPA and PIPA has turned into an all-out war between Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Media companies have united in favor of the bills, while tech's power players are throwing their might into opposing them.  (Hundreds turn out for SOPA protest in New York) ""Both SOPA and PIPA are threats not just to the U.S. economy, and not just to all the jobs that this tech sector creates, but if they had existed, Steve Huffman and I could have never founded Reddit,"" said Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded the site. Millions visit Reddit to submit interesting links from websites, discuss them and vote on them, he said, calling it ""sort of a democratic front page of the web."" Reddit also went dark Wednesday morning and was back Thursday. One member of Congress, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, who opposes the bills, said the unprecedented blackouts had ""turned the tide against a backroom lobbying effort by interests that aren't used to being told no."" Issa is pushing for consideration of his own plan, the OPEN Act, addressing the matter. (OPEN Act: An experiment in digital democracy)","SOPA, PIPA bills lose support on Capitol Hill .

"(CNN) -- As Hewlett-Packard manages a tectonic shift in its business, thrifty consumers can expect to shake down more deals on gadgets. HP is set to replenish the supply of TouchPad tablets this week, spokeswoman Bryna Corcoran said in a statement on Sunday. The company began selling TouchPads for $99 and $149 last week in order to quickly shed inventory. HP will also drop the price on the Pre3 smartphone to $75, which will not be sold in U.S. stores, a second spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. While the electronics giant has ceased production on the products, the ""next batch"" of TouchPads is being retrieved from a warehouse, Corcoran wrote. HP is seeing high demand for the bargain-priced tablets, which first retailed for $500 last month, and has struggled to keep its inventory alert system online. Corcoran described the sudden demand for the TouchPad as ""kind of bittersweet."" In a statement, HP offered the following explanation for discontinuing the products: ""WebOS devices have not gained enough traction with consumers."" While HP intends to stop making devices that run the company's downtrodden mobile operating system, Richard Kerris, an HP vice president, wrote in a message to developers on Friday saying his team plans to continue developing the software. HP CEO Leo Apotheker has said the company has explored licensing deals for webOS with other electronics manufacturers. Bargain hunters are scheming on blogs and social media websites to share tips on how to score discounted TouchPads. The two TouchPad models have shot to the top spots on Amazon.com's list of best-selling electronics. The fire sale has spread to Europe. The Pre3, which debuted in the UK and France less than a week ago, is now priced at $75, €59 or £49, the spokeswoman wrote in e-mails. It previously cost about $500 in Europe. The device will be unlocked, allowing people in the United States to connect to AT&T's or T-Mobile's networks. HP will not allow customers to return the device, the spokeswoman wrote. The news was reported earlier by PCMag.com. The Pre3 smartphone, with its slide-out keyboard, is the flagship in Palm's handset product line that HP acquired last year, and runs webOS, the same software used in the TouchPad.","HP plans to sell more discounted TouchPad tablets this week .

"(CNN)The cold gripping much of the eastern United States is bitter, it's sprawling, and it's deadly. And it's apparently not going away -- at least for any length of time -- anytime soon. From a frozen Niagara Falls to endangered Florida oranges, there's no shortage of evidence about how cold it has been over the past few days. But the worst such examples come in places like Tennessee, where 10 deaths have been blamed on the harsh winter weather, according to that state's emergency management agency. Four of the deaths stemmed from car accidents, and five were tied to hypothermia, which is abnormally low body temperatures that can cause confusion, sleepiness, slowed speech or reactions, and can be fatal if not treated quickly. The 10th death was a dialysis patient who was unable to get to treatment. Tennessee is hardly the only state affected. Some 185 million people are felling the deep freeze, with wind chill warnings and advisories posted for Thursday and Friday in more than 20 states. The National Weather Service notes that temperatures on Thursday were 25 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in some locales, where some records should smash like an icicle. Even Deep South states like Georgia and Alabama, and even Florida -- known more for sweltering than shivering -- have hard freeze and freeze warnings in effect. And no one should expect beach days in the immediate future. Instead, the weather service says, ""Get ready for an even more impressive surge of Arctic air later this week as another cold front drops south from Canada."" ""There are indications"" its forecast adds, ""that this could be some of the coldest weather since the mid-1990s for some parts of the Southeast U.S., Mid-Atlantic, and central Appalachians."" Things should warm up some over the weekend. But that doesn't mean East Coast residents can break out their swimsuits, what with yet more snow predicted Saturday and Sunday in places like Boston and a return to frigid temperatures next week.

"(CNN) -- North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test and more ballistic missile tests if the U.N. Security Council doesn't withdraw its condemnation of Pyongyang's rocket launch earlier this month, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. A photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency showing the recent rocket launch. The U.N. Security Council ""should promptly make an apology for having infringed the sovereignty of [North Korea] and withdraw all its unreasonable and discriminative 'resolutions' and decisions adopted against [North Korea],"" a spokesman for the North's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""The measures will include nuclear tests and test-firings of intercontinental ballistic missiles,"" the unidentified spokesman said. The statement also said Pyongyang will start building a light-water nuclear power plant and begin production of nuclear fuel. The Security Council condemned the April 5 rocket launch as a violation of a 2006 resolution that bans North Korea's ballistic missile activity. North Korea, angered by the Security Council's unanimous vote, has threatened to walk away from the six-party talks aimed at disarming the country of nuclear weapons. It has said it will restore its disabled nuclear reactor. The six-party talks -- involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States -- have been aimed at persuading North Korea to scrap its nuclear program. North Korea has begun reprocessing fuel rods, its Foreign Ministry said Saturday, according to state-run media. ""The reprocessing of spent fuel rods from the pilot atomic power plant began as declared in the Foreign Ministry statement dated April 14,"" a ministry spokesman said. ""This will contribute to bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self-defense in every way to cope with the increasing military threats from the hostile forces.""","N.

"Jon Whiteford had a secret so macabre, that when a Kentucky sheriff's deputy showed up to question him about it, he pulled out a handgun and killed himself. About three years ago, he deep-froze the body of his mother, Faye Whiteford, law officers said. They don't think he killed her. She appears to have died of natural causes at the age of 96 in spring of 2011, Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Thursday. Since Jon Whiteford is dead, there are no charges against him. But law officers want to know what he can no longer tell them so they can complete the puzzle of what happened to Faye Whiteford's body from the time of her death until they found her remains this April -- tied up in tarp in the yard of a ramshackle home. The picture they have painted so far based on conversations with witnesses and acquaintances has the makings of the stuff of a grotesque novel. Behind the 8-ball . As Faye Whiteford lay bedridden in their home in Science Hill for the last years of her life, her son sunk into a financial morass. He took care of her but was also dependent upon her Social Security and retirement benefits. When she died, he didn't want to lose that income, the sheriff's office said. So he concealed her death and postponed her funeral. He purchased a freezer where he kept her remains, the sheriff said. Talking with him about her was a tough topic. ""We didn't know she had passed away, and we were afraid to ask,"" Al Fried, one of Jon's close friends, told CNN affiliate WLEX. But it seems the two friends did speak about the financial implications of her death. ""I guess he was afraid to report that his mom died because of what I said about the funds disappearing,"" Fried said. His mother's retirement checks were not enough to save Jon Whiteford from getting behind the eight ball. The family home went into foreclosure. ""He was forced to move out of his home somewhere around Christmas of 2013,"" the sheriff's office said. Whiteford found a house to rent in another county, but was in disrepair, not fit to live in without some work. Law officers believe he took his mother's body there. And as the winter was a bitter, it would remain frozen if left outdoors. In the meantime, Whiteford moved next door to his mother's former home, into the house owned by a friend who did not live in it. Inquisitive law officers . Eventually, authorities wondered why there were no signs of life from his mother, and a fraud investigation into the Social Security benefits began. On March 29 this year, a deputy decided to go question Jon Whiteford. Some three weeks after his suicide, police brought in dogs trained to sniff out human remains, but they caught no scent of Faye Whiteford's body. During the investigation, detectives came across the property Jon Whiteford had rented and decided to check it out. There, a detective found a body tied up in tarp lying partially under a wooden box at the edge of the driveway. It was Faye Whiteford's. The sheriff's office is looking for witnesses to answer many of the questions about what happened to her that her son would not.","When a sheriff's deputy arrived to question Jon Whiteford, he killed himself .

"The fire that engulfed a limousine on a bridge over the San Francisco Bay in May -- killing five members of a bachelorette party, including the bride-to-be -- was the result of friction between the car's drive shaft and the rear floor board, investigators said Monday. They ruled the fire an accident and said no criminal charges will be filed. Nine passengers were traveling in the limousine as it crossed the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge on night of May 4, including 31-year-old Neriza Fojas, who was celebrating her upcoming wedding. Driver Ricky Brown told CNN two days later that as he drove over the bridge, one of the passengers knocked on the partition separating him from the back and said ""smoke."" He thought she was asking to smoke a cigarette, he said, so he told her to wait just a few minutes because smoking wasn't allowed inside the vehicle. After 30 seconds, she knocked again, Brown said. That's when he smelled smoke and pulled over. Cell phone video shot by another driver shows the limo at the side of the bridge, the back engulfed in flames and the front in smoke. A ""catastrophic failure"" of the limousine's rear suspension system allowed the rapidly spinning drive shaft to come into contact with the floor pan, Capt. Mike Maskarich of the California Highway Patrol's Redwood City office said. As the fire grew, it ignited the back seat, creating black smoke and flames that filled the passenger compartment, Foster City Fire Chief Michael Keefe said. The smoke and fire blocked access to the rear doors, leaving passengers with only one exit -- the small opening into the driver's compartment, he said. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Monday his office looked for anything that could have constituted a crime but found nothing. ""We've explored all possibilities, and the conclusion is that this is a horrific tragedy,"" he said. Whatever went wrong with the suspension system happened after the limo started crossing the bridge, investigators said. Video of the vehicle going through the bridge's toll plaza does not show it riding low to the ground. The investigation showed, however, that the limousine was carrying two more people than allowed. It was rated for seven passengers but was carrying nine. The owner of the limousine company will be fined $7,500 for failing to operate safely, because there weren't enough seat belts for all nine passengers, said Brig. Gen. Jack Hagan, director of the safety and enforcement division of the California Public Utilities Commission, which oversees passenger carriers like limousines.","The limousine's suspension system suffered a ""catastrophic failure""

"A Texas woman got a quadruple Valentine's Day gift this year, giving birth to four babies -- two sets of identical twins. Ace, Blaine, Cash and Dylan Montalvo were born at the Woman's Hospital of Texas in Houston to Tressa Montalvo, 36, and her husband, Manuel, 43, of Houston. Ace and Blaine were first, born at 8:51 a.m. and weighing 3 pounds, 10 ounces, and 3 pounds, 15 ounces, respectively, the hospital said. Cash and Dylan were a minute later and weighed 2 pounds, 15 ounces and 3 pounds, 6 ounces. All four were born by cesarean section. ""We tried to stick to the A-B-C-D theme when naming them,"" Tressa Montalvo said in a statement the hospital released. The twins were not the result of fertility treatments, the hospital said. Tressa Montalvo learned she was carrying twins at 10 weeks. A third heartbeat was found at a later doctor's visit, and the Montalvos were referred to a maternal fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Brian Kirshon. ""We couldn't have been more surprised when Dr. Kirshon told us we were having four babies and that they were two sets of twins,"" Manuel Montalvo said. Each pair of twins shared a placenta, the hospital said. Identical twins result when a fertilized egg splits into two embryos. Twins occur in about 2% of all pregnancies, according to the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Of those, 30% are identical twins. The odds of having two sets of twins at once is about 1 in 70 million, said Dr. Alan Penzias, associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. The boys were all born at 31 weeks' gestation, so they face some health risks, as their immune systems aren't fully developed, said Krista Cato, a nurse in the pediatric intensive care unit of Children's National Medical Center in Washington. Manuel Montalvo said he and his wife were trying to have ""one little brother or sister"" for their 2-year-old son, Memphis. ""We didn't expect it,"" Tressa Montalvo said. ""We were trying for just one and we were blessed with four. ... We planned the pregnancy -- I guess we just succeeded a little too much."" Still, the Montalvos say, they are planning on trying again. ""We want a girl,"" Manuel Montalvo said.","Ace, Blaine, Cash and Dylan Montalvo were born on Valentine's Day .

"Game developer Bethesda Softworks is ready to take role playing to the next level by adding voice commands via the Kinect controller to its wildly popular video game, ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"". Skyrim, the second highest grossing game of 2011, takes players on an epic campaign as a warrior born with the blood and soul of a dragon. The game offers many adventures and quests, and players are free to roam and accept challenges as they wish. The Kinect functionality in Skyrim will be available in five languages -- English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. The English version is expected to be released during the week of April 23 with the other versions following close behind. Called ""Project Adam,"" Bethesda began formulating the idea of merging Kinect's voice capabilities to ""Skyrim"" shortly after the game's release in November. Pete Hines, vice president of marketing and public relations for Bethesda, told CNN.com in an exclusive interview before the official announcement that the developer wanted to add functionality that didn't exist in the original release. ""When you do things, like when you are on the map, you uncover a lot of map markers and quests to go to a particular place. [With Kineck] you can use voice commands to do things very easily, to jump to different cities on the map,"" Hines said. ""Even doing things in inventory like sorting by weight, by value -- that functionality doesn't exist in 'Skyrim' as it is. With Kinect, it unlocks a lot of new options."" Hines said the development team also wanted to enhance gameplay. Voice control naturally leant itself to ""Shouts,"" special vocal powers that the players have access to in the game. ""You have your full arsenal of Shouts available using Kinect without having to stop, go to a menu, pick the one you want to use, and go back in the game and use it,"" he said. ""You just say the Shout, and as long as you have the ability, your character will just use it on the fly."" Kinect will also let players use voice commands to arm weapons, activate spells and tell your companions what to do. The commands are designed to be intuitive, and Matt Barlow, general manager of Xbox Marketing, said Kinect support will add more than 200 voice commands to the game, providing a new level of access for fans that goes beyond the controller. ""Working closely with the talented team at Bethesda, they have done an amazing job of honoring the core gameplay functionality fans of ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" know and love and using Kinect for Xbox 360 voice control integration to complement and strengthen the core experience without changing the fundamental game mechanics,"" Barlow said. While two other games (""Mass Effect 3"" and ""Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13"") also use the Kinect for voice control, Barlow said allowing players easy access to menus and inventories, and to quickly create and load saves during gameplay is unique to ""Skyrim."" However, don't get the idea you'll be waving your arms around in front of Kinect as you fight a dragon. Combat and casting magic will still be done through the handheld Xbox 360 controller. But simple actions that could be done through menus will be available easier with the Kinect. ""(Totally replacing the handheld controller) would be a whole other can of worms,"" Hines said. ""Doing combat and swinging your sword and all that stuff without a controller would dramatically change the game. We're trying to enhance the experience as we designed it with some additional functionality."" Hines said the Kinect functionality will be an update to the existing game that will automatically download when Bethesda is ready to release it sometime later this month. Players won't have to do anything to enable the voice commands and will have the option to turn the Kinect functionality off if they choose. The idea to merge Kinect with Skyrim came from one of the game's designers after the its release last year. During a ""game jam,"" where game designers are given a week to work on whatever they want as long as it is related to the title, Ricky Gonzales, a programmer on ""Skyrim,"" came up with the idea of using voice commands to do things within the game. ""He deserves a lot of the credit for putting the time in to get it to work and then working with Microsoft on some of the extra bits that they helped us out with,"" Hines said.","""Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" coming to the Kinect system .

"Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long-running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s Balkan wars. Appellate judges at a U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands on Thursday reinstated the second genocide charge, ruling that the tribunal improperly dismissed the count in June 2012. Karadzic, whose trial began in 2010, also faces nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The reinstated charge accuses Karadzic of trying to permanently remove Bosnian Muslims and Croats from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992. The charge was thrown out last year after the prosecution rested its case, with the tribunal ruling that there wasn't enough evidence for a genocide conviction on that particular allegation. But the appellate judges Thursday ruled that the evidence of serious abuse against Bosnian Muslims and Croats -- including detaining them in overcrowded, squalid conditions where they were starved and left vulnerable to disease -- could be shown to be genocidal acts. The judges cited allegations that Karadzic and officials loyal to him decided on a plan to rid Bosnia of Muslims, in part by killing a third of them and converting another third to Orthodox Christianity. Thursday's decision came exactly 18 years after the notorious 1995 Srebrencia massacre, for which Karadzic faces the other genocide charge. Nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995. Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multiethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict. On Thursday, more than 400 victims of the massacre were to be reburied at a memorial center in Potocari in Bosnia and Herzegovina, adding to the more than 5,000 victims already buried there, the country's state-run news agency FENA reported. Victims of the massacre have been buried at the site periodically as officials locate and identify more victims in mass graves. ""Sadness and pain, I have no words. It is so hard,"" said Fadila Efendic, who was set to bury her son Fejzo at the site Thursday, according to FENA. ""This is beyond any human comprehension what they did to us and what we are experiencing."" The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia. Karadzic was removed from power in 1995, when the Dayton Accord that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office. Karadzic was captured in 2008 after more than 13 years of hiding in plain sight in Belgrade. He had adopted an elaborate disguise that included long hair and a full beard, and was practicing alternative medicine in the Serbian capital. His former military commander, Ratko Mladic, was captured in 2011 and is also on trial for charges including genocide. Both men would face life in prison if convicted. The court cannot impose the death penalty. Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic also faced charges connected with the Balkan wars, but he died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague.","The reinstated count accuses Radovan Karadzic of trying to remove Muslims from Bosnia .

"Elon Musk unveiled his much anticipated plans for the Hyperloop by releasing his 57-page technical white paper titled ""Hyperloop Alpha."" The Hyperloop is intended to become the ""fifth"" mode of transportation -- a tube under or over the ground that would transport a dozen or so people in individual pods. The actual size will likely depend on technology, but the idea is to provide exceptionally fast service to the traveling public between cities under 900 miles apart. The innovation could move people from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 30 minutes with the pods traveling up to 800 miles per hour. It all sounds pretty cool and very space age. (Jetsons, anyone?) Is it too good to be true? Yes, for now. And Musk knows it. But that doesn't make the idea any less relevant. The white paper properly draws attention to the future. Indeed, from a layman's perspective, Musk seems to lay out a plausible path for the applied technology needed to bring the Hyperloop into reality. Recall that steam railroads were almost as pie-in-the-sky before Scottish inventor William Murdoch invented the first workable prototype steam locomotive in 1784. The idea of propelling humans at ""break neck"" speeds of between 25 or 35 miles per hour, let alone 50 miles per hour or more by 1850, was considered the stuff of fancy. Hyperloop isn't the only transportation idea out there . In more contemporary times, stunning transportation infrastructure projects have achieved feats unthinkable until technological breakthroughs made them possible. France's Millau Viaduct is the tallest bridge in the world, with its roadway suspended 890 feet (270 meters) above the valley of the River Tarn and one of its towers rising to 1,124 feet (343 meters). But the historical reality is that economic hurdles may prove more important than the technological ones. In the longer term, the Hyperloop will have to deliver a service the traveling consumer will want and be willing to pay for before it can create the revolution Musk envisions. On this point, the Millau Viaduct provides critical insights into what could make the Hyperloop a success. Constructing the bridge was technically impossible just decades earlier, and improvements in technology on the margin slowly made the concept feasible. New developments in materials and computer-controlled construction techniques brought it into the realm of possibility and profitability. The potential profitability may well be the more important element. The bridge was built by a private construction company, Compagnie Eiffage, under a 75-year concession that would be paid by tolls. In other words, the company had enough confidence in the practical benefits of the bridge that it was willing to commit to a half billion to the project.  Those practical benefits would have to be paid for by consumers through tolls. Without the tolls, the project would likely not have gotten off the ground, even though it was technologically feasible and it could cut travel times by as much as four hours. Thus, while the Hyperloop may be theoretically if not be technically feasible now, the real long-run hurdle for Musk and the project's developers will be whether the new transportation system provides a tangible benefit significant enough to a large enough swath of the traveling public that its costs will be justified by the benefits they receive. Hyperloop vs. world's fastest trains . Notably, using similar technology, 12 bridges with higher road decks have been built since the opening of the Millau Viaduct (although it still retains the record as the highest bridge). Mega-projects are often judged by their technical merits. But these projects need to do more than satisfy the egos of engineers and futurists. Their social impact and practical importance depend crucially on their ability to deliver broad-based benefits in tangible ways that become the foundation for long-term sustainability. Musk has done an admirable job of setting the stage for a useful public discussion. Now we should be more focused on the long-run economic merits of his proposal instead of the short- term technical hurdles.","Elon Musk released a white paper about Hyperloop, a fast mode of transportation .

"(CNN) -- Police in Boulder, Colorado, have told the father of JonBenet Ramsey that they are back on the case. Former D.A. Mary Lacy cleared the Ramsey family from an ""umbrella of suspicion"" last year. The Boulder Police Department is again the lead agency looking into the 1996 slaying of the 6-year-old beauty pageant contestant, a Ramsey family attorney told CNN. The move comes less than a month after a new district attorney in Boulder County said he would decide whether the unsolved case should go back to the Police Department. The district attorney's office has had responsibility for the investigation since 2002, and new District Attorney Stan Garnett said in January he planned to take a fresh look at the case.  Watch Garrett hand the case over » . Lin Wood, attorney for JonBenet's father, John Ramsey, said Monday that Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner sent a letter to Ramsey as a courtesy to let him know the case was back with the Police Department. Beckner also said that a multiagency task force including some of the region's most experienced investigators would be created to advise police, Wood said. Boulder police are holding a news conference later Monday. Although the Ramsey case has not generated news since last year, tips and information regularly come in to authorities. Whoever is handling the investigation is charged with checking them out and deciding whether they are worth pursuing, Garnett said. The case is one of the nation's most famous unsolved murders. On December 26, 1996, John Ramsey discovered JonBenet's body  in the basement of the family's Boulder home. The girl had been strangled and beaten. A ransom note was found on the stairs of the home, demanding $118,000. Early in the case, Boulder police said John and his wife, Patsy Ramsey, were under ""an umbrella of suspicion"" in her death. But they were never formally named as suspects, and a grand jury refused to indict them. Patsy Ramsey died in 2006 after a lengthy battle with ovarian cancer. In July, Garnett's predecessor, Mary Lacy, issued a public apology for the suspicion surrounding the Ramsey family after a test performed using new technology showed that DNA found on JonBenet's underwear and under her fingernails belonged to an unidentified man. The test results, Lacy said, were ""powerful evidence"" that allows investigators to think the Ramsey family were victims, not suspects. That same third-party DNA exonerated John Mark Karr, a one-time teacher, after he was arrested in Thailand and brought to Colorado. Authorities said Karr told a University of Colorado professor in e-mails that he was involved in JonBenet's death. He told reporters after his arrest that he was with the child when she died, although he called her death an accident and said he loved her. Lacy was widely criticized, including by then-Gov. Bill Owens, for the handling of Karr's arrest. Boulder police also have long faced criticism over their handling of the investigation.  Watch CNN's Nancy Grace on the story » . But, Garnett said recently, ""I've been very impressed by the Boulder P.D. They are a fine department now and have handled a number of cases very well. ... They've done a very nice job."" The department has 24 investigators, four times as many as the DA's staff, he added. Garnett was elected prosecutor in November to replace Lacy, who could not run again because of term limits. Before he was elected, he was a trial lawyer for 22 years, according to the district attorney's Web site.","JonBenet Ramsey case goes back to Boulder police .

"Robot dinosaurs, Lego men and Spider-Man -- all could become Dubai's newest residents as the city is set to house a slew of new theme parks. On the roster is everything from big brands like Legoland and Six Flags, to new concepts set to make a splash. Literally in the case of Pearl of Dubai, slated to be the world's largest underwater park when it's completed (the tentative date is 2020, to correspond with the Dubai World Expo). Size is a theme for many of the parks on the list. One proposed project, IMG World of Adventure, hopes to usurp Ferrari World as the world's largest indoor theme park. It will include four zones, including The Lost Valley -- a Jurassic Park-themed segment -- as well as two zones dedicated to characters from Cartoon Network and Marvel Comics, respectively. ""We want this park to be one of the center points in the future of Dubai,"" explains Adam Alexander Page, the vice president of marketing for IMG Group, the developer behind the project. ""As such, you don't want to build something that won't get global attention, and if that means it's big, that's what you do. There's no point in building it small."" What's in a name? Many of Dubai's developers plan to rely heavily on pop culture and name recognition in bringing people to their parks. This is especially true of the planned Dubai Parks, planned in an expanse 60 kilometers (37 miles)  from Dubai International Airport. A theme-park conglomerate, Dubai Parks will house a Legoland, as well as a Bollywood-themed park and the Hollywood-themed Motiongate Dubai. ""Movies have become the kind of entertainment that binds people, young or old, across the globe, because they all watch the same movies,"" notes John Gerner, a theme park consultant and the managing director at Leisure Business Advisors. ""It used to be that if you were to develop a theme park, you'd take an indigenous theme unique to the area and build on that. Now, it's almost the opposite. You take an international concept known around the world, like Marvel."" Thinking different . Aside from the financial incentives, developers cite Dubai's willingness to think outside the box as part of the appeal of setting up in the city. ""Dubai has an overabundance of vision,"" says Patrick Douglas, the CEO of Reef Worlds, an underwater design company. Pearl of Dubai will be a five-acre underwater park with a Lost City of Atlantis theme. In addition to luring scuba divers and snorkelers, the underwater attraction will also act as a huge artificial reef, designed to attract and nurture aquatic life. ""We're building for two clients: One has credit cards, the other has fins,"" jokes Douglas. When first pitching the sustainable tourism venture, he approached properties in the Caribbean, all to no avail. ""I told them, we'd build these sites, they wouldn't have to put up any money up front, and if they happened to make money from them -- which we knew they would -- we could talk about a revenue share. We didn't get any traction,"" says Douglas. Dubai, however, was a different story. ""They get it. They can conceive of it and they can produce it,"" he says. The Orlando of the Middle East? While Dubai is currently home to a handful of theme parks -- most notably Wild Wadi and Atlantis The Palm's Aquaventure -- the city has yet to establish much of a track record in the industry. Many projects announced prior to the 2008 crash were assigned to the scrap heap afterwards. ""In our industry, there tends to be more announcements of theme parks than those actually built,"" warns Gerner. ""It's a quandary for analysts like myself. Typically we look at new projects as a share of the existing market, so it's very hard to evaluate the potential for going into somewhere entirely new."" Then again, building an entertainment industry from scratch isn't unprecedented. Gerner points out that Orlando, Florida was virtually unknown until the 1970s when Disney World moved in. ""Dubai wants to become an international tourist destination for leisure, one that serves not just the greater region, but the entire world. Whether they'll be successful, that's a big question, but that's their goal,"" says Gerner. Read more: Building the new Louvre .

"The House recently approved the budget designed by Rep. Paul Ryan, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Ryan claimed that his budget is balanced and ""harnesses the power of economic freedom and respects the dignity of every person."" But the problem is that it fails on basic math and will likely put Washington back in the budget wars. Moreover, it signals that Ryan has big ambitions, including running for president. Will Ryan's budget plan help him succeed? It's hard to say. Americans want members of Congress to work together. In a CNN poll after Obama's State of the Union address, 67% said they want ""bipartisan compromise with Congress on major issues."" Ryan's budget rejects compromise in favor of appealing to hard core Republican values. The House's passage of Ryan's budget indicates that we are being dragged back into ideological battles that most Americans reject. This budget won't go anywhere in the Senate, as it breaks last year's fragile compromises that avoided a government shutdown and threatened a dangerous default of America's debt.  Passing this budget also means Congress will pass very few or no appropriations bills, with lawmakers posturing and casting symbolic votes as the 2014 midterm elections approach. Unlike the current budget deal that was reached last fall, which cuts defense and domestic spending equally, Ryan would increase military spending and provide large tax cuts for millionaires, with deep cuts in non-defense spending footing the bill. But the House cannot cut enough discretionary spending to fund Ryan's budget.  So it attacks Obamacare, Medicare and Social Security, with a plan to increase the Medicare eligibility age and turn it into a voucher program. Breaking America's health and income security programs is the long-term political game for Republicans.  The smarter ones know they cannot achieve budget balance and more tax cuts for the wealthy by cutting only domestic discretionary spending, which is just under 17% of the total federal budget .  So they attack entitlements. How can Ryan claim that his budget is balanced?  By invoking what used to be called ""voodoo economics"" -- assuming budget cuts and unfair tax cuts will unleash economic growth and generate adequate tax revenue. Former Reagan administration economist Bruce Bartlett has criticized this approach as ""just another way for Republicans to enact tax cuts and block tax increases. It is not about honest revenue-estimating; it's about using smoke and mirrors to institutionalize Republican ideology into the budget process."" Of course, Paul Ryan isn't stupid, so why the phony budget math and the return of voodoo economics? Because it serves his presidential ambitions. Ryan's budget satisfies two wings of Republican true believers -- budget balancers, and anti-tax zealots who want not only no new taxes, but further tax cuts for the wealthy.  These groups used to fight with each other about deficits, but modern Republican politics have united the two positions. Since Ryan's budget will not likely pass the Senate, it is really an attempt to strengthen him in the 2016 Republican primaries, where candidates will ignore basic math and pretend they can balance the budget solely through spending cuts and still have money left over for regressive tax cuts. This is a key Republican battle, and the shocking response is that other Republican conservatives say Ryan didn't go far enough.  Sarah Palin called Ryan's plan a ""joke,"" because it does not deal adequately with ""wasteful government overspending."" When it comes to basic math, the Republican budget debate reminds one of the movie, ""Dumb and Dumber,"" or ""Phony and Phonier."" And compared to Sarah Palin, Paul Ryan might in fact look like a reasonable budget analyst.  But his ideas are deeply dangerous.  Even if you think balancing the budget is the most important economic challenge we face (it isn't) the numbers simply don't add up. True budget balancers and fiscal conservatives, who would be looking for both spending cuts and increased revenue, have virtually been driven out of today's Republican Party.  This happened in Kansas where moderate Republicans worried that deep tax cuts would harm the state's finances and gut basic services like education.  But they were defeated in primary elections by more strident Tea Partiers, backed by the deep pockets of the Koch brothers and other big money interests. So Ryan's budget is best viewed as his opening shot in the 2016 presidential contest.  To win the nomination, he must appeal to the most uncompromising elements in his party.  Sanity once again is playing second fiddle to intra-party Republican battles, and those battles could drag all of us back into the divisive and unproductive budget wars of the past several years.","The House recently approved the budget designed by Rep. Paul Ryan .

"Conventional wisdom has it that President Barack Obama's campaign four years ago was a political masterpiece. Yes, the Republican brand was in the toilet; the economy had cratered; his real opponent, George Bush, was a political pariah; and the country despaired for a new direction. Still, we recall the Obama campaign as a crushing force, brilliantly harnessed, riding the tide of history. So why is his re-election campaign such a mess? Team Obama has turned the candidate of hope and change into a ferociously political animal. They've discarded their most valuable asset, his stature. The outsider who flew above the hated, polarized politics of red and blue now does nothing but campaign and polarize. The Obama who was ""one of us,"" apart from Washington, is increasingly and, to his detriment, ""one of them."" We first picked up this change in sentiment a few weeks ago in our Purple Poll of 12 key swing states when we asked independent voters who ""is just another politician?"" Obama edged out Romney by 4 points.  The candidate of soaring ideals has tumbled to Earth, muddied and mired in politics. Yet Team Obama has proved it can still effect change: Consistently, they make their situation worse. This past week, the Obama who supported gay marriage when running for Illinois legislature, then flipped against it as candidate for president, flopped once more to serve his re-election. The president's reversal did not just evolve. Its politics became transparent. Though same-sex marriage was not ""right"" earlier, it suddenly became a matter of conviction. With the Democratic Convention approaching, the president needed to energize his base and defuse the likelihood of a platform war over same-sex marriage.  Miraculously, at that moment, he found the courage to do the most politically useful thing. Many of us who support the president's new position still found the politics as subtle as neon.  The maneuvering became the message.  The latest CBS/New York Times Poll reveals 67% of those interviewed said the president made his decision ""for political reasons."" Less than a quarter of voters believe he acted on principle. Americans have started to connect a swarm of dots, revealing politics as the pattern.  Even when this president crosses oceans, Americans see him putting politics first. Recently, in perhaps the most damning YouTube moment yet in a presidential race, Barack Obama was captured putting domestic politics ahead of foreign policy.  He was caught on an open microphone, telling outgoing Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that he would be more amenable to Russian interests on the issue of missile defense if he survived the November elections. ""This is my last election,"" Obama said. ""After my election, I have more flexibility."" The president's mask slipped. The politician beneath was revealed.  Voters, including the president's core female supporters, got to see what they had only suspected: Obama's priorities aren't necessarily theirs. While our economy was melting down, Obama spent his first two years compulsively advocating a health care plan. While moms struggle to stretch their family budget and fill the gas tank, Obama's crusading for birth control and same-sex marriage.  And now, as storm clouds from Europe's exhaustion and California's failure begin to roll into our heartland, trapping our economy without exit, the president offers tacit acknowledgment that this is the best he can do:  His campaign is about everything but what will save us. The latest CBS/New York Times Poll says 50% of voters believe the president is doing a good job.  The problem?  They don't think it is the job he should be doing.  Only 43% of Americans are voting for him. Republicans have never been able to paint Obama as a flip-flopper, despite a litany of evidence. Candidate Obama supported ""pay as you go budgeting,"" but the economic meltdown excused him from his commitment, allowing him to propose a decade of trillion-dollar deficits. He spent a trillion dollars on health care, but explained it was a practical strategy to save money. In the same moment, he has urged both expensive stimulus and deficit reduction. Still he has been excused, as a practical man, with long and short-range fiscal tools on his workbench. He reviled the Bush tax cuts and the ""tired and cynical philosophy,"" behind them. Then he pragmatically extended them, calling his pirouette a ""substantial victory for middle class families"" who would otherwise have suffered a tax increase. The Obama running for re-election is for everything and nothing at once, a creature of calculation. His oratorical skills are seen not as gifts that elevate him above the elite political class, but tools that enshrine him as its leader. Obama has become what he came to Washington to change:  He is politics. There is a good chance the Obama campaign is about to disintegrate, if only briefly. Obama is about to walk through ""the valley of death,"" where candidates lose their way and are tested on an arid march. In this familiar story, the campaign that could do no wrong can do no right: Pundits who have predicted an Obama victory reverse course and insist Romney is a sure bet. Republicans should restrain their exuberance.  The race will certainly tighten again if this president fixes a fundamental and possibly fatal political mistake: . Obama is asking America to be a polarized, angry country, where we are at war with each other, tearing at our own throats.  Romney is asking us to be a country at peace with itself. Unless Obama changes course, he will not make it through the valley.  This is a race Romney wins.","Alex Castellanos: Why is Obama's team running such an inexpert re-election campaign?

"Kurdish fighters from Iraq will enter the besieged Syrian border city of Kobani soon to reinforce fellow Kurds who are defending against ISIS, a Peshmerga general told CNN on Tuesday. ""The Peshmerga have been ready for a few days, then had logistical problems, but they no longer do,"" Brig. Gen. Halgurd Hikmat said of the Iraqi Kurdish forces. He added that ""we now have an agreement with Turkey on this."" The fighters were en route Tuesday, a Ministry of Peshmerga official who wouldn't give his name because of operational security reasons told CNN. One group traveling by air landed in Turkey early Wednesday, according to media reports. Earlier, the official with the Ministry of Peshmerga -- effectively the defense ministry for the semiautonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq -- said 161 Peshmerga fighters were making the trip. The troops have weapons ""that will be of good help to our brothers in Kobani,"" said the official. Another group of fighters was traveling on the ground, according to Turkey's semi-official Anadolu News Agency. That group is armed with heavy weapons, Anadolu reported. A senior adviser to Kurdish President Masoud Barzani tweeted Wednesday that the fighters would eat breakfast in Kobani with Syrian Kurdish fighters. The Peshmerga militia generally defends the Kurdish region in northern Iraq and has battled ISIS in that nation. Turkish officials were not immediately available to comment. But Turkey has previously said it will allow the Peshmerga to pass through its territory into Syria to join the fight for Kobani, which lies on the Syrian-Turkish border. Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayan al-Arab, is a largely Kurdish town defended by a Kurdish-Syrian militia. With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into Kobani is through Turkey. Hikmat would not confirm how the Kurdish fighters from Iraq would join the Kurdish defenders in Kobani but said they would bring weapons and would participate in the fighting. The weapons would be Saddam Hussein-era gear collected in Iraq, not new coalition armaments, Hikmat added. Iraqi forces, Peshmerga claim gains against ISIS . ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, captured portions of Syria and Iraq this year in its bid to establish what it says is an independent Islamic nation. ISIS began attacking Kobani in September. The Ministry of Peshmerga official also said Tuesday that the Peshmerga would be in Kobani on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Major shift for Turkey . Turkey's decision to let the Peshmerga traverse Turkish territory to reinforce the Kurdish fighters in Kobani represented a major policy shift. The Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, have ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against the government of Turkey, where about 20% of the population is Kurd. Turkey, the European Union and United States consider the PKK a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said both the Syrian Kurdish and ISIS militants were ""terrorists."" The Turkish government also has bristled at the United States' efforts to parachute weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters. But while Turkey did nothing to intervene in Kobani, Kurds protested in Turkish streets. More than 30 people were killed in cities around Turkey this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups as well as Turkish police. Turkey announced October 20 that it would allow Iraqi Peshmerga to travel into Kobani through Turkey.","Some Kurdish fighters from Iraq have arrived in Turkey, media reports say .

"Heavily armed men descended on the school as the girls slept. Bullets flew as guards fought back, but they lost. The men, Boko Haram militants, herded more than 100 students onto buses, vans and trucks and drove off, flanked by motorcycles, authorities said. That was Monday. By Wednesday, just eight of the 129 abducted school girls were still missing, according to the Nigerian military. It was not immediately clear how the girls became free. Their conditions were also not clear. ""They forced us into trucks, buses and vans, some of which were carrying foodstuffs and petrol. They left with us in a convoy into the bush,"" said a student among the girls who escaped and who declined to be named for security reasons. ""A group of motorcyclists flanked the convoy to ensure none of us escaped."" At one point, one of the trucks broke down and the girls on that vehicle were transferred to another one, the student said. The broken down truck was set on fire, she added. When another vehicle broke down and the men tried to fix it, ""some of us jumped out of the vehicles and ran into the bush. We later found our way back to Chibok,"" she said, referring to the northeastern town where her school is located. One of the alleged attackers has been captured, and a military search-and-rescue operation is ongoing to ""ensure the safety of the remaining students,"" Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said Wednesday. Boko Haram, which translates as ""Western education is sin,"" is an Islamist militant group waging a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, particularly in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. The group is known to have carried out deadly attacks on other schools in the northeast. In a clip released by the group on March 23, leader Abubakar Shekau threatened to launch raids and abduct girls from schools. ""They took away my daughter and my niece ... and we fear for their safety in the hands of these merciless people that take delight in killing and destruction,"" said the mother of one of the abducted girls. ""I don't know what to do. The whole family is confused and we have turned to prayers, which is all we have."" In early March, Borno state's government closed all its 85 secondary schools and sent more than 120,000 students home after increasing Boko Haram attacks. The Nigerian government is struggling to control the bloodshed between the mainly Muslim north and Christian south that has claimed more than 3,000 lives since Boko Haram came to prominence in 2009, according to Human Rights Watch. Rescue teams are fanning out in the forest . Rescue teams, aided by surveillance helicopters, were moving deeper into the vast forest that extends into neighboring Cameroon and other states in the region, said Ali Ndume, a senator representing southern Borno state, in which Chibok is located. ""Soldiers and the Civilian Joint Task Force, as well as volunteers from the area, are now combing the forest to rescue the schoolgirls. They are aided by surveillance helicopters to locate the kidnappers' position,"" Ndume said. The teams ventured into the woods after a broken down truck believed to have been part of the kidnapping convoy was found abandoned at the edge of the forest, which suggests that the abductors took their hostages into the woods on foot, he added. A military official involved in the rescue operation also confirmed a broken down truck was found in the brush. ""We are now trying to locate the whereabouts of the abducted girls,"" said the military source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the issue. Before the military's announcement that most of the students had been freed, Borno Gov. Kashim Shettima told reporters about 14 girls had escaped. He pledged 50 million naira, around $300,000, to any person or persons who could provide information that would lead to the rescue of the girls. 'Pain, sorrow and anguish' for families . Distraught parents of the abducted girls anxiously waited for news, many of them crowded outside the burned home of the Chibok district administrator. The gunmen burned homes and businesses in the town as they fled with the girls, witnesses said. ""We are calling on the government to do everything possible to track these people and save your daughters from them. They should not allow our daughters' dreams to be shattered by these murderers,"" said the mother of one abducted girl. A statement from the office of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, said he ordered security forces ""to deploy maximum efforts"" in rescuing the girls and welcomed reports of some rescues. ""President Jonathan deeply regrets the pain, sorrow and anguish brought upon many Nigerian families in recent days as a consequence of recurring security challenges which the nation is contending with,"" the statement said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the girls' ""immediate release,"" according to a statement from Ban's spokesperson. He is ""deeply alarmed about the increasing frequency and brutality of attacks"" against schools in northern Nigeria. ""The targeting of schools and schoolchildren is a grave violation of international humanitarian law. Schools are, and must remain, safe places where children can learn and grow in peace,"" the statement said.","Only eight of the 129 school girls abducted are still missing, says the military .
The girls were seized by suspected Boko Haram militants .
The students were loaded onto buses and trucks, says one who escaped .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Nationwide outrage continued Monday in China over the government's response to a deadly bullet train collision last weekend, even as operations resumed on the affected high-speed rail lines. A bullet train was struck from behind Saturday night by another train near Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, killing at least 38 people -- including two American citizens -- and injuring almost 200. The first train was forced to stop on the tracks due to a power outage and the impact caused six cars to derail, including four that fell from an elevated bridge. Although Chinese reporters raced to the scene, none of the major state-run newspapers even mentioned the story on their Sunday front pages. A user of Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, first broke the story and increasingly popular social media outlets then provided millions of Chinese with the fastest information and pictures as well as the most poignant and scathing commentaries. By the time the railway ministry held its first press conference more than 24 hours after the collision, the public had seen not just reports of passengers trapped inside dark trains or images of a mangled car dangling off the bridge -- but also bulldozers crushing mangled cars that had fallen to the ground and burying the wreckage on site. ""How can we cover up an accident that the whole world already knew about?"" said a defiant railway ministry spokesman Wang Yongping. ""They told me they buried the car to facilitate the rescue effort -- and I believe this explanation."" Wang was terse when reporters asked him to explain the fact that a toddler girl was being pulled out of the wreckage alive 20 hours after the accident -- and long after authorities declared no more signs of life in the trains. ""That was a miracle,"" he said. Blaming lightning strike-triggered equipment failure as the cause of the accident based on preliminary investigation, Wang put on a brave face on the safety of China's controversial high-speed rail. ""Chinese technologies are advanced and we are still confident about that,"" he said. While some state media echoed Wang's sentiment, many netizens questioned his every statement from the death toll to the cause and called him the face of a ministry mired in allegations of corruption and ineptitude. ""This land is a hotbed for the world's most sprawling bureaucracy and most cold-blooded officials,"" user ""chenjie"" wrote on Sina Weibo. Netizens also dug up an old video clip showing the railway ministry's chief engineer proudly telling state television in 2007 that China had developed modern technologies to ensure bullet trains never rear-end each other. The quick sacking of three top local railway officials in Shanghai -- who were in charge of the affected rail lines -- failed to placate the public, either. The announced new Shanghai railway chief prompted more scorn than applause, as the replacement -- the railway ministry's chief dispatcher -- was once demoted for his role in another fatal train accident in 2008 that killed 72 people. In a user-generated opinion poll on Sina Weibo on the government's handling of the accident, more than 90 percent of the 30,000 respondents chose the option ""terrible -- it doesn't treat us as humans."" Now the world's second-largest economy, and flush with cash, China has built the world's longest high-speed rail network -- boasting more than 8,300 kilometers (5,100 miles) of routes -- in a few short years. The government plans to pour over $400 billion into rail projects in the next five years. The massive investment and rapid construction have long raised public doubts on the new lines' safety and commercial viability. The skeptics' voices became louder after the former railway minister -- a champion of high-speed rail -- was sacked for corruption early this year. Even the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail -- the ministry's newest and proudest project -- has broken down several times since its much-touted launch less than a month ago. ""It's not the faster, the better,"" Sun Zhang, a railway professor at Tongji University in Shanghai and a long-time railway ministry consultant, told CNN last month. ""We have to take safety, economics and environmental impact into consideration."" ""Strategically we can talk about a great leap forward in the industry, but tactically we have to do things step by step,"" he added. Back online, many users -- already jittery about safety in their daily life -- now view China's high-speed rail, long considered a symbol of the country's fast rise, as a metaphor of its troublesome approach to development. ""This is a country where a thunderstorm can cause a train to crash, a car can make a bridge collapse and drinking milk can lead to kidney stones,"" user ""xiaoyaoyouliu"" posted on Sina Weibo. ""Today's China is a bullet train racing through a thunderstorm -- and we are all passengers onboard.""","China's equivalent of Twitter becomes the main source of news as state media are slow to report the crash .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a transportable solar power station that tracks the sun like a sunflower and cools itself by pumping water through its veins just like a plant. The Sunflower Solar Harvester, developed by the Swiss company Airlight Energy, can do all that and in the process produce heating, desalinated water, and refrigeration from the 12kW of energy it provides from just 10 hours of sunlight - enough to power several households. Aimed at off-grid communities in remote regions, the all-in-one 10m-high system -- whose components can be transported in a single container and reassembled in situ - has been in development for more than two years and could be on sale as early as mid-2017. Integrated system . ""It's an integrated system so it supplies both electricity and heat,"" head of research at Airlight Energy, Gianluca Ambrosetti, told CNN. ""You can use this heat to drive a cooling system too, if you need refrigeration."" He said the system will appeal to those that have multiple requirement and a lot of sunlight. ""It's not going to work so well if you have a lot of requirements and you have the climate of, say, Germany."" Nevertheless, off-grid regions from as disparate and far-flung places as North Africa, the Middle East, the United States, Chile and Australia have expressed an interest in the technology. ""Then there are those regions that have good solar radiation and high fossil fuel prices such as Japan which is not an obvious place for this sort of system, but where we see a lot of potential,"" Ambrosetti said. Water-cooled . At the core of the technology are IBM-designed water-cooled solar panels whose microchannels carry away the heat produced by the reflector mirrors. The flower-like array of reflectors concentrate the sun's energy more than 2,000 times onto the six panels which each hold 25 photovoltaic chips. The heat is carried away by the water at a rate that keeps the microchips at their optimum temperature, making the Sunflower Solar Harvester one of the most efficient solar energy producers around. Developers say that it needs just a quarter of the panels to produce the same amount of power as conventional systems. Everything about its design is aimed at bringing down costs; what would normally require large and expensive solar mirrors is achieved with metallised foil of the type found in food packaging like potato chips. The concave shape of the reflectors is kept in place by a light vacuum, a useful failsafe if the cooling system fails. Rather than overheating the solar cells, the operator can simply release the vacuum to diffuse the reflected sunlight. Remote appeal . While the company is not claiming the technology will completely replace fuel-powered generator sets -- which can often produce 10 times the power of one solar sunflower -- Ambrosetti said it could be possible to run some remote facilities with an array of the parabolic mirrors. ""You would, of course, not have just one Sunflower but several so you can scale it up quite easily,"" he said. ""Hospitals, for instance, are quite energy intensive -- if you needed 1.2mW to run a hospital you'd need 100 sunflowers. ""But if you were in a small camp hospital with minimal refrigeration requirements for medicines, it could be set up in a remote location and just one dish could satisfy quite a lot of those needs."" The system produces around 20kW of thermal power from 10 hours of sunlight, enough say the developers to power a low-temperature desalinator in coastal regions. Sea water vapor would pass through a polymer membrane and condense in a separate chamber, to produce as much as 2500 liters of fresh water per day. Vascular system . Ambrosetti said the cooling system drew its inspiration from nature where vascular systems operate to carry away excess heat. ""We are still a long way from commercialization, but what we can do is to tap into its potential. We plan to set up early adopter projects that would be running by 2016,"" he said. ""We aim to have four or five dishes in various locations around the world to show the potential of the system so people can really start to touch it with their hands."" Ambrosetti said the system was likely to appeal commercially to green residential and commercial developments. ""It's biggest potential is in making integrated systems where you can provide several things at once such as heating, cooling and electricity,"" he said. The project also recently got nominated as the top ""solar wonder"" of the world by Greenpeace: . Read more from Tomorrow Transformed: . Wind farms of the future go underwater .

"This week is Computer Science Education Week,  which is being observed around the United States with events aimed at highlighting the promise -- and paucity -- of digital education. The climax of the festivities, for me anyway, will be the opportunity to address members of Congress and their staffers on Wednesday in Washington about the value of digital literacy. I've been an advocate of digital culture for the past 20 years, and this feels like the culmination of a lifetime of arguing. Yes, I was once the one getting laughed out of both cocktail parties and editor's offices for suggesting that someday people would be using word processors to send one another messages over telephone lines. But the vindication I feel for being right about our digital future is tempered by an equally disheartening sense that we are actually missing an opportunity here. I have never been as enthusiastic about the promise of digital technology itself as about  the human potential unleashed by these new tools. Yet I fear this promise is increasingly undermined by our widespread unwillingness to seize the abilities they offer us. Although we live in a highly digital age, digital literacy is not a priority among us. And as a result computer science is not a priority in our schools. My talk to Congress may not change this overnight. There are many structural impediments to bringing any new curriculum into America's public schools. The multi-year process through which school district decisions are made is incompatible with the development cycles of the Internet startups hoping to meet the demand for digital education. Teachers fear their own inexperience with code may disqualify them from becoming competent instructors. And there's not enough money for the education we already have, much less the education we would like to offer. But I'm hoping we can get motivated enough to catch up with, say, Estonia (where they teach code to kids) and begin developing a society capable of thriving and competing in a digital world. So to that end, here are the 10 things I plan to say in my 10 minutes on Capitol Hill: . 1. When we got language, we didn't just learn how to listen, but how to speak. When we got text, we didn't just learn how to read, but how to write. Now that we have computers, we're learning how to use them -- but not how to program them. 2. Programming a computer is not like being the mechanic of an automobile. We're not looking at the difference between a mechanic and a driver, but between a driver and a passenger. If you don't know how to drive the car, you are forever dependent on your driver to take you where you want to go. You're even dependent on that driver to tell you when a place exists. 3. Not knowing how our digital environments are constructed leads us to accept them at face value. For example, kids think the function of Facebook is to help them keep in touch with friends. Even a bit of digital literacy helps us see that Facebook users are not its customers, but its product. 4. ""Computer class"" can't be about teaching kids to use today's software; it must be about teaching kids to make tomorrow's software. 5. The failure to teach computer science isn't just impeding kids' understanding of the digital world, but also crippling our nation's competitiveness in business. We outsource programming not because we can't afford American programmers, but because we can't find American programmers. 6. America's military leaders are scared: They have no problem finding recruits who want to fly drones, but have few who want -- or are ready -- to learn how to program them. One Air Force general told me he believes America's competitive advantage on the cybermilitary frontier is one generation away from being lost. 7. We are putting in place a layer of technology, culture, and economics that we'd darn well better do consciously. The technology we build today is the operating system of the society of tomorrow. Right now, painfully few are participating in this -- and usually the choices are made by the highest bidder. 8. Computer Science is not just a STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math -- subject, but a liberal art as well. Being able to think critically about digital media environments means being able to think critically about our world. 9. Kids are already doing algorithms, the basic building blocks of computer programming. Once they learn long division, they are ready to start programming. 10. The resources are out there: Codecademy.com is just one of many free tools (including CSUnplugged.org and Scratch.org) that any teacher can pick up and implement -- if he or she can muster the autonomy to do so. It may just happen that computer education, like the Internet itself, will depend on distributed authority and the bottom-up, enterprising nature of human beings working together.","Douglas Rushkoff: It's Computer Science Education Week, aimed at promoting digital literacy .

"Four people died and 22 remained missing after the collapse of three buildings in the historic center of Rio de Janeiro, Mayor Eduardo Paes said Thursday, according to CNN affiliate TV Record. It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse of a 20-story building and adjacent 10- and 4-story buildings on Wednesday night. Officials said they were investigating both the possibility of a gas leak and a structural failure. Sergio Cabral, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, declared three days of mourning for the victims, while state-run Agencia Brasil reported Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff expressed her solidarity with the people of Rio de Janeiro, ""especially with the families of those who were affected by this catastrophe."" Earlier, civil defense officials in Rio de Janeiro corrected an erroneous earlier report that five bodies had been recovered. Rescue workers continued to dig through the rubble Thursday afternoon. Are you there? Send your images or video . The accident came at a delicate time for Rio de Janeiro as the city prepares to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games two years later. The buildings were  just steps from the emblematic Municipal Theater, where U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech last year. Residents told TV Record that they heard the collapse begin before seeing the buildings come down. ""I started to hear a crackling. I thought they were gunshots. When I looked up, I saw the top floors falling,"" maintenance worker Julio Cesar de Oliveira Brandao said. A fire broke out after the buildings fell, Agencia Brasil reported. The entire area -- a bustling commercial center during the day and a popular drinking spot at night -- was closed off Thursday. Cars parked on the street were covered in dust, and there was a strong smell of gas in the area, fire officials said, according to the news agency. The lobby of one of the buildings contained a bank branch and a bakery, Agencia Brasil reported. Witnesses told Band TV that neighboring buildings swayed, as if there had been an earthquake. One witness said people were inside one of the buildings when it collapsed. Electrical engineer Jorge Drauss told TV Record he was drinking juice at a nearby diner when he saw small stones falling from the top of one of the buildings. ""I thought it was someone making a hole for air conditioning,"" he said. ""From one moment to another, the building began to fall.""","Officials increase the number of dead to 4, with 22 people missing .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two-thirds of Americans think that the Republicans in Congress are not doing enough to cooperate with President Obama, according to a new national poll. But a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey, released Wednesday, also indicates the public believes the Democrats should be the ones to take the first step toward bipartisan cooperation and they want the Democrats to give up more than the GOP to reach a consensus. Sixty-seven percent of respondents say the GOP is not doing enough to cooperate with the White House, up 6 points from last April. Americans appear split on whether the president is doing enough to reach out to Republicans, with 52 percent saying Obama is not doing enough to cooperate with the GOP, while 47 percent say he is doing enough to reach across the political aisle. The 52 percent who say the president's not doing enough to encourage bipartisanship is up 16 points from last April. ""That's a big change from last spring, when Obama was still in the honeymoon phase of his first term,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Congressional Republicans were familiar to Americans, but Obama was new to them, so his early attempts to reach out to the GOP continued to resonate even after it became clear that bipartisanship was not within easy reach."" Even though more people think Republicans are not doing enough to reach bipartisan consensus, 54 percent believe the Democratic party should take the first step toward developing bipartisan solutions to the country's problems, the survey says. Forty-two percent say the GOP should take that first step. Just over half of those questioned say the Democrats should give up more ground to achieve bipartisanship, while 43 percent want to see the GOP make more compromises. ""Americans feel the ball is in the Democrats' court,"" Holland added. ""They may not be held responsible for the problem, but since they are in charge of the government, Americans appear to think they are responsible for the solution."" According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the government in this country is broken, but the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what's broken can be fixed. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Sixty-seven percent of respondents say GOP not doing enough to help President Obama .

"Cholera, a deadly diarrheal disease, has been rare in the United States since the early 1900s, but in the developing world, where access to clean drinking water is more difficult, it is still a serious problem. Dr. Rita Colwell has studied cholera for nearly 50 years, and has written more than 700 publications and received at least 40 honorary degrees. The former director of the National Science Foundation and former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Colwell is currently a distinguished professor at both the University of Maryland, College Park and Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health. CNN spoke with Colwell about her research and how she and her team helped develop an incredibly simple method to help the people of rural Bangladesh have cleaner, safer drinking water. The following is an edited portion of that interview. A medical miracle: Saving cholera victims . CNN: Tell me about cholera. Colwell: Cholera is ... transmitted by water. The bacteria that causes the disease ... (naturally occurs) in the aquatic environment. That's a discovery that my laboratory made some 25 to 30 years ago.  When ingested, it attaches to the intestine and a toxin is most frequently produced.  The result is severe vomiting, diarrhea and if a person doesn't have their fluid replenished, dehydration and eventually death (results). CNN: Is there an antibiotic for cholera? Colwell: You can take an antibiotic. It's generally susceptible to tetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and other antibiotics.  There's been a discovery some years ago of what's called oral rehydration therapy, ORT, whereby a mixture in water of table salt, bicarbonate of soda and table sugar is mixed in appropriate concentration and sipped.  This replenishes the fluid loss and is very effective in treating cholera. CNN: That's interesting that it doesn't seem people die from the bacteria attacking their systems, but rather the dehydration effects. Colwell: That's predominantly the case.  The toxin can have other effects but mainly it's the sodium-potassium transport mechanism that gets interfered with. Bangladesh has two major epidemics every year: spring, which is right about now, and fall: September, October, November. This occurs year after year with almost no exception due to the fact that, as we have shown, the bacteria are associated with plankton.  As the plankton become abundant, they bloom in the spring and fall, after which the cholera bacteria become abundant in the water and the disease occurs. CNN: Are cholera outbreaks connected to global warming? Colwell: Temperature is a major regulator of the abundance of the cholera bacteria.  The study that was carried out by Carla Pruzzo in Italy, with which we collaborated, was an analysis of plankton samples that had been stored for the past 40 years at a marine laboratory in England. They'd been collecting samples every year for 40 years and so we analyzed the samples, and what Dr. Pruzzo and our team found was that as the water temperature is increasing, the numbers of vibrios (small, comma-shaped bacteria) and the number of cases of diseases caused by vibrio, namely cholera, have been increasing.  It has been directly related to the warming of the sea temperature. CNN: Can you describe the method you developed in Bangladesh to control cholera? Colwell: Having done an enormous amount of research showing the ecology of the cholera bacterium, (we found) it was definitely tied to plankton.  The cholera bacteria is part of their natural flora.  It occurred to us that by simple filtration to remove the plankton, we would filter about 99% of the bacteria, leaving just a few suspended in the water. So then, we hypothesized, we could reduce cholera significantly by educating women who collect water for their household to use cloth filtration. Probing the mysteries of probiotics . We found that sari cloth that comprised the dresses that women wear, if folded about four times, gave a very nice mesh filter, with small enough pore size to trap plankton.  A three-year study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and Nursing Institute that involved about 50 villages and over 150,000 people, and sure enough, by having women filter their water collected from the ponds and rivers every day, we showed about a 50% decrease in cholera.  A very simple step, and very important. CNN: How did you get the message out to everyone that they should be doing this? Colwell: We worked with the women in the villages and we trained them, essentially as extension agents ...  to go to the villages every week with a meeting for the women of the village to explain to them why it's good to filter, how to filter, and the difference it would make to the health of their children. So with this constant reinforcement, we found that indeed, they did filter because they found that their children didn't get sick.  And that, of course, was a big incentive.  The project ended about six years ago, but we went back to see if they were still filtering, and we found 75% of them were. CNN: So, do you think that clean water is the key to controlling waterborne diseases like cholera?  Or, do you think it's getting people the education about better sanitation? Colwell: It's a combination of sanitation and safe water. ... We do not have cholera in the United States.  We have not had it since about 1930 when filtered, chlorinated household water was made available.  Similarly in Europe, back in the 1890s and 1900s, cholera epidemics were devastating.  In fact, cholera played into outcomes of major wars when troops became debilitated by the cholera bacterium.  So, a combination of proper sanitation and filtered, chlorinated, safely distributed water-- not just cholera, but at least two dozen diseases transmitted by contaminated water can be prevented. CNN: What could we do as a nation to help this effort to getting education about sanitation and clean drinking water to more developing countries? Colwell: I think education for both proper sanitation and for filtering water is very badly needed. I also work with Safe Water Network, which is a philanthropic organization that delivers kiosks ... that provide filtered water on a larger scale. We need to think of water availability depending on the environment and the conditions on which the water can be made available. It's not all one-size-fits-all.  For example, filtration in a major city probably isn't as effective as chlorinating the water and having it distributed safely, which many cities in developing countries do. ... But for the remote villages, they don't have that kind of access, so their simple filtration is really, really helpful.

"A police officer who fatally shot a 93-year-old woman at her home in Texas is defending his use of deadly force and lashing out at the City Council that fired him. Stephen Stem was dismissed from the Hearne Police Department on Saturday. He argues his termination was unjust. ""The knee-jerk reaction to terminate Mr. Stem was not about whether Ms. Golden chose to create and perpetuate a life-threatening situation. That is a clear and indisputable fact. ""Rather, the city's decision was about appeasing certain members of the community who want to make this case about Ms. Golden's age, the fact she is African-American, or the fact she is a woman. ""None of those factors played a role in Stem's decision to use deadly force,"" Robert McCabe, Stem's attorney, said in a statement Sunday. His comments come as Texas Rangers continue an investigation into why Pearlie Golden, a longtime resident in this small town of about 4,600 people between Dallas and Houston, was shot multiple times at her home Tuesday. A man believed to be a relative of Golden's made a 911 call asking for help from police, Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said. ""What I understand is (Hearne police) were called out because a woman was brandishing a firearm,"" Siegert said. ""An officer asked her to put the handgun down, and when she would not, shots were fired."" Hearne City Attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said Stem told Golden to drop her weapon at least three times. Stem fired three times, and Golden was hit at least twice, he said. She was transported to a hospital, where she died. ""Police not only have a duty to protect themselves from imminent harm, but also innocent citizens who rely on them 'to protect and serve,' "" Stem's attorney said in his statement. The case eventually will be presented to a grand jury, which is standard procedure when dealing with officer-involved incidents, according to Russ, the city attorney. ""I would expect people to be upset about this, a young police officer shooting a 93-year-old lady,"" Russ said. ""I'm upset about it. Most of our citizens are upset, but at the same time, I don't believe all the facts have come to the surface yet.""","Police officer Stephen Stem fatally shot Pearlie Golden, 93, last week .

"Baseball pitching great Roger Clemens was found not guilty Monday of lying to Congress during an investigation of steroid use among major league players. The case against Clemens involved one count of obstruction of Congress, three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury. He was not charged with illicit use of performance-enhancing drugs, but his denial of such use was part of the case against him. A federal jury found him not guilty on all six counts. Clemens wiped his eyes after the verdict was announced, then hugged his likewise emotional sons. His lawyer, Rusty Hardin, meanwhile, gave a thumbs-up to the jury before leaving the courtroom. ""Mr. Clemens, you're free to go,"" Judge Reggie Walton said. Minutes later, Clemens thanked his family, lawyers and others who have supported him during the trial and in the years since he was accused of using illicit performance enhancing drugs. ""I put a lot of hard work into (my) career,"" he told reporters, choking up on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington. ""I appreciate my teammates that came in, and all the e-mails and phone calls."" Hardin thanked the jury, and lavished praise on his client for his demeanor and character. ""It has been 4½ years since we listened to a picture that doesn't match up at all with the man we have grown to know and love,"" the lawyer said. ""He is not only a seven-time Cy Young winner, he's a hell of a man."" NL MVP's suspension overturned . Members of the U.S. attorney's office in the District of Columbia said little about the verdict Monday afternoon, beyond thanking the jury and investigators in a brief statement. ""We respect the judicial process and the jury's verdict,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. Six days earlier, federal prosecutor Courtney Saleski told jurors in closing arguments that Clemens ""wanted to protect his brand, he wanted to protect his livelihood,"" in denying the use of steroids during a 2008 investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives into the problem. The Clemens defense team disputed whether the government had made its case, telling the jury all the evidence came through a former personal trainer, Brian McNamee, who had incentive to lie. ""You saw Brian McNamee, the only witness in the history of the world who says he gave or saw an injection of that man,"" said defense attorney Michael Attanasio. ""One person in the entire world."" During closing arguments, the defense cited the lack of corroborating witnesses. It took about eight weeks for the prosecution and defense to question 46 witnesses, and the most direct conflict came among expert witnesses as to how to interpret a collection of discarded medical items that allegedly linked Clemens to steroid use. The pitcher did not take the stand in his defense. Soiled medical wrappings, cotton balls, drug vials and hypodermic needles that McNamee kept were interpreted differently by each side. Witnesses for the government said genetic material linked with Clemens suggested it was impossible for McNamee to fabricate the evidence. But defense witnesses on the same topic said storage in a beer can for years allowed commingling and contamination of materials, making reliable conclusions impossible, and the evidence nearly worthless. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said a big part of Clemens' defense was, in essence, putting Congress on trial -- claiming they were never serious about using whatever testimony was given to shape future legislation. ""He was basically saying, Congress was putting on a show. They didn't care,"" Toobin said of Hardin. ""They just wanted Clemens to come up there, they weren't planning to do anything with the testimony."" This was the second trial for Clemens. About a year ago, a mistrial was declared before the case reached the jury. The government's lawyers played video evidence the judge had already banned. Prosecutors said it was an editing mistake, but the Clemens defense team suggested prosecutors were unprepared and had gotten off to a bad start. The verdict comes six months after Barry Bonds got two years of probation and 30 days of house arrest for obstruction of justice in a federal steroids-related case and days after federal prosecutors dropped all remaining charges against former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, less than two weeks after his corruption trial ended in an acquittal and mistrial. ""It was not a great case, but this is a real blow to the Justice Department,"" Toobin said of prosecutors' case against Clemens. Lance Armstrong banned from world Ironman events over doping probe . Known as ""The Rocket,"" Clemens was among the most accomplished pitchers of his generation, earning seven Cy Young awards as his league's best pitcher and 11 All-Star appearances before retiring in 2007. He was known for his blazing fastball -- his 4,672 strikeouts are the third most of any Major League pitcher -- as well as his excellence over all stages of his 24-year career. But the Texas native made news for a different reason in 2007, when he was among a number of baseball stars -- along with others including Bonds, Gary Sheffield and Jason Giambi -- in an investigation by Major League Baseball into the illicit use of performance-enhancing drugs. That investigation was led by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell. Yet despite being accused by his longtime former trainer, Clemens has consistently and strongly denied using steroids. That includes comments he made during the 2008 congressional hearing delving into the Mitchell Report and later in reaction to his six-count indictment. Hardin, the now-49-year-old pitcher's lawyer, bemoaned how people labeled his client arrogant because he denied using performance-enhancing drugs. He insisted Monday that Clemens -- who will become eligible for entry into baseball's hall of fame next year -- ""from (age) 16 to 45 was the same person."" ""I hope those in the public that made up their mind (about Clemens' steroid use) before there was a trial will now back up and entertain the possibility of what he's always said: Using steroids and HGH is cheating, and is totally contrary to his entire career,"" said Hardin.","Clemens' lawyer says his client has always believed steroid use is ""cheating""

"(CNN)Remember that awkward Eddie Murphy moment during the ""Saturday Night Live"" 40th anniversary special on Sunday? According to Norm Macdonald, Murphy's return after 30 years to the show that made him famous was supposed to be so much more. In a series of tweets Wednesday, Macdonald explained that he attempted to talk Murphy into portraying Bill Cosby during the ""Celebrity Jeopardy"" sketch. Macdonald set the scene with the many superstars involved in the special, which included former cast members and some of the show's most popular (and infamous) hosts and musical guests.

Macdonald said he thought he had Murphy on board to do one of his most famous impressions, but alas, it was a no-go. Instead, Murphy was introduced by Chris Rock and offered a few words about his time on the show. It clocked in at just over a moment and struck some viewers as odd and awkward, as there had been so much buildup to the return.

"At the start of a big week for the Higgs boson, the most sought-after particle in all of physics, scientists in Illinois said Monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion. The scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year. What is the Higgs boson and why is it important? Their announcement came two days before researchers at the Large Hadron Collider under the Alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. ""Our data strongly point toward the existence of the Higgs boson,"" Rob Roser, a spokesman for one of two independent experiments at the Tevatron, said in a statement. ""But it will take results from the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe to establish a discovery."" Read more: The woman at the edge of physics . Finding the Higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass, one of the open questions in physicists' current understanding of the way the universe works. The particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist Leon Lederman reportedly wanted to call his book ""The Goddamn Particle."" But he truncated that epithet to ""The God Particle,"" which may have helped elevate the particle's allure in popular culture. More science news from CNN Light Years . The results from the Tevatron, stemming from the two different experiments, suggest that if the Higgs boson does exist, it would have a mass between 115 and 135 GeV -- about 130 times the mass of the proton. Before the Tevatron closed, the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a four-mile circumference in opposite directions. Traveling at a fraction below the speed of light, the particles would crash into each other, creating conditions similar to those at the dawn of the universe for scientists to observe. But so far, neither the results from the U.S. collider experiments nor from the the Large Hadron Collider, located 328 feet underneath the border of France and Switzerland, have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery. ""It is easier to look for a friend's face in a sports stadium filled with 100,000 people than to search for a Higgs-like event among trillions of collisions,"" said Luciano Ristori, a physicist at the U.S. facility. Attention now turns to the latest analysis of data from the $10 billion European machine, the world's most powerful particle smasher. ""We now have more than double the data we had last year,"" Sergio Bertolucci, the director for research and computing at CERN, said last month. ""That should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the 2011 data are still there, or whether they've gone away. It's a very exciting time.""

"(CNN) -- A large pop-up box will greet Facebook users logging on to the social-networking site on Thursday, asking them to modify their privacy settings. The company says the changes will help streamline privacy controls that have confused many of its 350 million users and were sprawled over six separate pages. What is getting the thumbs-down . Complaints have started flowing in, focusing on three areas: . The changes treat as ""publicly available information"" the following: your name, profile picture, current city, gender and networks, and the pages you're a fan of. Until now, you had the option of restricting much of that information. That option has been removed. The ramifications, as the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation sees them: . ""For example, you might want to join the fan page of a controversial issue (like a page that supports or condemns the legalization of gay marriage), and let all your personal friends see this on your profile, but hide it from your officemates, relatives or the public at large."" You cannot do so now. The foundation says: ""These changes are especially worrisome because even something as seemingly innocuous as your list of friends can reveal a great deal about you. In September, for example, an MIT study nicknamed 'Gaydar' demonstrated that researchers could accurately predict a Facebook user's sexual orientation simply by examining the user's friends list."" Facebook counters that a user's friends list can be made nonviewable. But it is either viewable by all or by no one. Another source of consternation is Facebook apps, such as the quizzes developed by third parties that many users are fond of taking. Until now, Facebook provided an option so you could specify that your information not be shared with others when one of your friends adds such an app. But now, whenever a friend adds an app, your ""publicly available information"" becomes accessible to the developer. So why did Facebook undertake the changes? The Weblog TechCrunch explains it this way: If a user retains the ""Everyone"" option, the information is accessible by the Web at large. ""In short, this is Facebook's answer to Twitter. ... That means Facebook can leverage it for real-time search, and can also syndicate it to other places, like Google and Bing. The feature has been available in the site's privacy settings since last summer, but most people didn't use it (and probably didn't even know it was there). The new privacy launch today puts this as the default option for many users."" The changes have met with mixed reaction. By early Thursday, more than 2,700 users had approved of the changes on the Facebook blog. But about 700 people said they were unhappy. ""The new setting[s] are ridiculous,"" commented user Victoria Anne Archer. ""I have less control than before and my friends are visible to everyone ... I can't hide them ... but I have no choice ... because if I select only friends ... then NO ON[E] CAN FIND ME!"" What is getting the thumbs-up . The most commended aspect of the new settings is that they allow users to micromanage who can access every bit of information on the site. One way to do so is to separate your friends into lists and grant those lists varying levels of accessibility. For example, if you would rather your bosses not know what you do on downtime, you can place them on a specially created list. In addition, a user can specify accessibility post by post. After each status update you type or photo you post, you can pick from a drop-down menu whether you want that item visible to everyone, to just your friends, or to friends of friends as well. How to access the changes . The new controls will be available under the ""Settings"" link at the top right of every page, in addition to being available in the dialogue box. For each section -- profile information, contact information, applications and search -- users will be asked to pick from three options about who can access the information: Friends, Friends of friends, or Everyone. The changes do away with ""regional networks,"" which let users designate themselves as residents of a geographic area. But Facebook is retaining school- and company-based networks. It is worth noting that many users will find their privacy options set at ""Recommended settings"" by default. If you retain those, your information will be available to everyone. If you would rather the site not share your information publicly, you will need to click through each section and restrict it to ""Friends"" only. This applies for photos as well. A user will have to specify album by album how much access to grant others. In addition, you will have to go under ""Search"" and specify whether you want Facebook to make your information available to users who look for you on Facebook and on the Web.","Pop-up on Thursday asks Facebook users to change their privacy settings .
Some users dislike how much information is made public to non-friends unless they make changes .
More popular is the new ability to decide on every post who gets to see it .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- She's been called ""beautiful,"" ""hot"" and ""sexy"" but when it comes to tennis, the most apt description for Maria Sharapova has to be ""tough."" The Russian rallied from a set down three straight times to reach this year's French Open final and then prevailed in Saturday's thrilling three-hour finale against rising star Simona Halep, 6-4 6-7 6-4. ""This is the toughest grand slam final I've ever played,"" Sharapova, who was contesting a ninth such match, summed up as she collected her trophy. Even after losing the second set and hitting a flurry of double faults, Sharapova still had the edge. She's almost a sure thing in third sets on clay, having triumphed 20 times in a row. It's been six years since the 27-year-old was defeated after capturing the first set in a clay-court match, too. But if Halep maintains this form, it won't be long before she opens her grand slam account. Smaller and with less power than Sharapova, the Romanian nonetheless almost did the unthinkable -- toughing out the now five-time grand slam champion. Her manager, Virginia Ruzici, remains the last Romanian to win a grand slam, in Paris in 1978. Sharapova famously uttered in 2007 that she felt like a ""cow on ice"" playing on clay but the French Open has now become her most productive grand slam -- it's the only one she's won more than once and it's the only one she's won after two serious shoulder injuries in 2008 and 2013. ""If somebody had told me at some stage in my career that I'd have more Roland Garros titles than any other grand slam, I'd probably go get drunk,"" Sharapova later told reporters. ""Or tell them to get drunk, one or the other. ""I feel that I worked to get to this position."" Her victory over the fourth seed made it 50 wins altogether at Roland Garros, good enough for seventh among the women in the Open Era. ""Sharapova is already considered one of the best competitors ever in my view,"" tennis analyst Pam Shriver, a former top-three player in singles and doubles, told CNN. ""Just take alone what she has done since her shoulder surgery, how she regained her form not only post surgery but post service (woes) when most matches she was serving 10-15 double faults. ""Also think about clay and her never-give-up attitude with clay."" While Halep cried in her chair after the match, there were tears of joy for Sharapova, who made the now familiar climb up to her box in celebration. Halep's mood, however, quickly changed. ""I was crying at that moment for a few minutes, and then I was smiling because I said that it was my first grand slam final, and I have to be happy, to smile, because I did everything on court,"" Halep told reporters. ""I played very good tennis, very good level. So I'm really proud about these two weeks."" Sharapova is routinely listed as the world's richest female athlete with a thick dossier of high-profile sponsors and with Saturday's check of more than $2 million, she also moved into second place in career prize money on the WTA tour behind Serena Williams at upwards of $30 million. Once the American fell in the second round, Sharapova became the significant favorite. She has been virtually unbeatable on clay since the start of 2012 when facing opponents apart from the American. Stretched to deciders by Samantha Stosur, Garbine Muguruza -- Williams' conqueror -- and Eugenie Bouchard on her way to the French final, it looked like Sharapova would drop another opening set when Halep held an early 2-0 lead on a second consecutive sweltering day in the French capital. But Sharapova won the next five games to assume control, only to drop serve. That's when the drama began. Long games were the norm, pushing the duration of the opener to nearly an hour despite the routine 6-4 score. A drubbing appeared to be on the cards in the second when Sharapova quickly established a 2-0 advantage. The double faults -- overall Sharapova hit a dozen after mostly keeping those unforced errors down this fortnight -- combined with a more solid Halep soon got things level. One of the finest rallies of the tournament -- 20 shots -- won by Halep earned her a break point at 4-4 and when she took it, a third set loomed. A net-cord winner at 30-40, though, allowed Sharapova to break back. The to-and-fro ensued to the crowd's delight. Halep broke for 6-5, was pegged back to 6-6, then reversed a 5-3 deficit in the tiebreak to ensure a first third set in a women's final at Roland Garros since 2001. The 22-year-old's backhand, likened to that of male finalist Novak Djokovic, and movement, compared to Roger Federer, were in full flow -- and in the mental toughness department, she was matching Sharapova. ""She has very strong mental (game),"" Halep said. ""In important moments she's hitting very strong. I think I'm also good mentally. I'm very strong, and I tried just to stay very close to her during the match. I did very well."" By the time it was 1-1 in the third, there had been six straight breaks. The turning point might have been the fourth game, when Sharapova escaped to hold for 2-2. The former champion would never trail again, breaking for 5-4 after Halep said she was affected by a call that went against her and winning the final game with ease. Djokovic and Rafael Nadal play in, on paper, a blockbuster men's final Sunday. They'll be hard pressed to top Saturday's offering.","Maria Sharapova wins her second French Open crown with victory over Simona Halep .

"In the future, women may be able to buy birth control pills alongside ibuprofen and cough drops if the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is adopted. The group is recommending that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter without a prescription in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States. Approximately 50% of all pregnancies are unplanned, a rate that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to reproductive health research. Women in their 20s are most at risk. ""Access and cost issues are common reasons why women either do not use contraception use or have gaps in use,"" according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Many developed countries still require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but many other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. The movement to push birth control over the counter is nothing new, says Dr. Daniel Grossman, who volunteers as vice chairman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Gynecologic Practice Bulletins. In the early 1990s, a paper in the American Journal of Public Health argued that oral contraceptives should be available without a prescription. What's different now, Grossman says, is that a large body of evidence documents the safety and effectiveness of the pill, as well as research showing that women are interested in receiving it over the counter. Free contraception may prevent abortions . ""I want it between the condoms and pregnancy test kits,"" said Kirsten Moore, president and CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, a group advocating for reproductive freedom. ""I want it there so it's giving the message: if you're sexually active, use protection."" As with any drug, there are risks associated with oral contraceptives. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists acknowledges that the pill can increase a patient's risk of blood clots and stroke, especially if she is obese or smokes. And selling the medication over the counter would reduce the chance that a woman would be screened by a doctor. But the group also says studies have shown that women may be able to self-screen for these conditions using a simple questionnaire. The physicians group argues that the risks must be put in context with the risk of blood clots or stroke with an unintended pregnancy. ""The comparison isn't taking the pill or not taking the pill,"" Moore said. ""It's taking the pill or not taking the pill and risking becoming pregnant."" Grossman says he's most concerned about the costs that may be associated with over-the-counter oral contraceptives. Although the Affordable Care Act requires coverage of birth control prescriptions, insurance companies may not cover over-the-counter medications. If the product isn't sold at an accessible price for consumers, Grossman said, ""It's going to replace a prescription barrier with a cost barrier."" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says similar incidents show that moving birth control over the counter will probably increase use. When nicotine patches and gum went on sale over the counter, attempts to quit smoking using those products nearly doubled, statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. And sales of emergency contraception doubled in the year after Plan B One Step ""morning-after pill"" went over the counter, according to the advocacy group OCs OTC. New York schools offer morning-after pill to students . Another benefit to offering birth control without a prescription is that it may provide greater access to populations that otherwise would not take advantage of these medications. ""Over-the-counter access will greatly reduce the systemic barriers, like poverty, immigration status and language, that currently prevent Latinas from regularly accessing birth control and results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy,"" the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health said in a statement. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists hopes its recommendation will motivate a pharmaceutical company to take the next step, Grossman said. A company with a prescription medication patent would have to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration to begin the over-the-counter approval process. In order to do that, the company needs to have research on its birth control product's safety as an over-the-counter medication. These studies would have to prove to the FDA that the right people will choose to take the medication -- meaning otherwise healthy women who want to avoid pregnancy -- rather than the people who shouldn't purchase it -- meaning those at high risk of blood clots or stroke. In a statement, the FDA said it is willing to meet with any pharmaceutical company that may want to switch its product to over-the-counter status. In Philippines, a 14-year fight for birth control . A few other obstacles stand in the way of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recommendation becoming reality. The battle to make emergency contraception available without a prescription was long and full of political pitfalls, Moore said. The first application to allow Plan B to be sold over the counter was denied; after about three years of debate, permission was given only for women over the age of 17. ""Any company is looking at the way the FDA handled emergency contraception and saying, 'I'm not taking that bait,' "" Moore said. Even if a company were to step forward, this would be ""uncharted territory"" for the FDA, Grossman notes. The agency has never approved a chronic over-the-counter medication -- one that's taken daily for an unlimited amount of time. (Although consumers sometimes take aspirin or antacids daily, they are not labeled for that kind of use.) There will also undoubtedly be arguments against the recommendation, whether they stem from fears over encouraging risky behavior, concerns about about patient adherence or religious beliefs. Still, Grossman said, consumers could see birth control medications sold over the counter in less than five years. ""It is a pretty bold move on the part of ACOG,"" he said. ""I really respect that the organization decided to make this statement after reviewing all the evidence. It's not very common where you hear a physician organization say, 'We think there should be a change so that our patients don't have to see us anymore.' ""","Physicians group recommends oral contraceptives be sold over the counter .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The GOP congressman from South Carolina who shouted out during President Obama's health care address to Congress insisted Thursday that his outburst was ""spontaneous."" Rep. Joe Wilson shouts, ""You lie!"" after President Obama denies the health plan would cover illegal immigrants. Rep. Joe Wilson shocked many observers Wednesday night when he shouted, ""You lie!"" after the president denied that health care legislation would provide free coverage for illegal immigrants. Some people using Twitter suggested that Wilson's retort was planned and pointed to a comment the lawmaker posted on Labor Day: . ""Happy Labor Day! Wonderful parade at Chapin, many people called out to oppose Obamacare which I assured them would be relayed tomorrow to DC,"" the tweet from Wilson's account said. However, on the way to his office Thursday morning, Wilson said his outburst wasn't planned. ""It was spontaneous. It was when he stated, as he did, about not covering illegal aliens, when I knew we had those two amendments, and I say that respectfully,"" Wilson said. He was referring to two amendments on one version of proposed health care legislation, which he said would have provided for verification of citizenship. Both of the amendments were defeated, he said. Fact check: Will plan cover illegal immigrants? Wilson also cited a report by the Congressional Research Service that he said showed the health care proposals would include illegal aliens. ""And I think that is wrong,"" he said. ""We need to be discussing issues specifically to help the American people. And that would not include illegal aliens. These are people -- I'm for immigration -- legal immigration. I've been an immigration attorney. But people who have come to our country and violated laws, we should not be providing full health care services,"" he said. A CNN review of the Congressional Research Service report found that the health care legislation does address illegal immigrants. It says that noncitizens who can be considered ""resident aliens"" under tax law, which doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, would be required to buy health insurance. Yet the proposal clearly says that federal subsidies would go only to U.S. citizens and immigrants who are in the United States legally. Republican congressional leaders told Wilson on Wednesday night that they wanted him to tell the White House that his comments were ""inappropriate,"" Wilson said Thursday.  Watch the lawmaker describe his call to the White House » . Shortly after Obama's speech, Wilson called the White House and issued a statement apologizing for his ""inappropriate and regrettable"" comments. According to Wilson, administration officials said they appreciated his call and emphasized the need for ""a civil discussion."" ""I certainly agree with that,"" Wilson said. Obama told reporters at a Cabinet meeting Thursday morning that he accepted Wilson's apology.  Watch the president say he appreciates the apology » . Democrats and Republicans have criticized the South Carolina congressman for what they described as disrespect for the president.  Watch the outburst and the chamber's response » . Wilson's shout wasn't the only demonstration of displeasure that Republicans made during the speech. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, wore a sign around his neck that said, ""What bill?"" And when Obama asked Republicans to share their ideas to overhaul health care, a small group raised up a stack of papers above their heads. iReport.com: ""You are disrespectful, sir"" After the speech, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate last year, called Wilson's outburst ""totally disrespectful"" and said he should apologize. McCain told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" there was ""no place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately."" Other Republicans also criticized Wilson, along with the expected Democratic condemnation. ""It was crude and disrespectful,"" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. ""I think the person who said it will pay a price."" House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said, ""I was always taught that the first sign of a good education is good manners. I think that what we saw tonight was really bad manners. ""And having a spirited debate is one thing, exercising bad manners is another. That was beyond the pale -- and I would hope that he would publicly apologize on that same floor to the president of the United States for that insult.""

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- France will soon rejoin NATO's military command more than 40 years after it left, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has aligned France more closely with the U.S. France was a founding member of the alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid frictions with the United States. France has continued, however, to contribute troops to NATO missions and to participate in NATO's political bodies. Analysts expect that when France takes over the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union next month, Sarkozy will try to boost the EU defense dimension. Some nations, particularly the United States, have been suspicious of a greater EU defense initiative, seeing it as an attempt to undermine NATO. Sarkozy's move, which he has signaled for months, could be seen as an attempt to reconcile the two sides and help the United States warm to the idea of the European Union having its own security organization. ""Basically, the tradeoff is that they no longer suspect French motives in pushing for a greater EU defense dimension because of Sarkozy's willingness to make France a fully participating member of NATO,"" said Robin Oakley, CNN's European Political Editor. From its earliest years, NATO's transatlantic ties were strained because U.S. analysts warned that if the European allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance, they risked losing the support of the United States, according to NATO. The European allies felt the United States was trying to dominate NATO, and the resulting frictions led French President Charles de Gaulle to withdraw from NATO's military structure in 1966, according to NATO. That decision meant no French forces could be under permanent allied command and that France would have no participation in defense planning. In 1995, France rejoined NATO's military committee, which advises NATO's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO's strategic commanders. While France was still not a part of the military command, it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities, including KFOR in Kosovo and ISAF in Afghanistan. Some 5,000 French troops are currently committed to NATO operations and France contributes 13.8 percent of its military budget to the alliance, according to the French Foreign Ministry. The Center for European Reform, an EU think tank, said Sarkozy's move will end a ""ruinous quarrel"" between Europe's two main security organizations -- NATO and the EU defense initiative. ""Sarkozy has broken a long-standing taboo in French foreign policy and opened the possibility of a dramatic improvement in EU-NATO cooperation,"" the CER said in December, after the president hinted at the move he made Tuesday. The European security and defense policy, or ESDP, has its origins in the 1990s, when EU leaders decided Europe needed its own military and civilian capabilities for security. So far, the ESDP is still just a framing of common defense policy which might one day lead to a common defense, according to the European Union. The ESDP does not involve the creation of a European army, the EU says.","France to rejoin NATO's military command, French President Sarkozy announces .

"In downtown Austin, dozens of new technology companies are about to be born. More precisely, they'll be born at a new incubator and workspace called Capital Factory. It sits on the top floor of a glass-encased modern office building.  With windows providing a 360-degree view of the city, everything that makes Austin one of the fastest growing cities in the country can be seen from its more than 200 desks. Capital Factory is a collaboration between the Austin Chamber of Commerce and Josh Baer -- a man who has become so integral to the city's start-up scene that he's known as the ""Austinpreneur."" Baer originally founded Capital Factory in 2009 as a start-up accelerator focused on helping young companies get started and attract investors. In May, the chamber selected it to run the 22,000-square-foot space that Baer hopes will make a city with an already thriving tech scene even better by creating a downtown hub. ""It's a focal point, a center of gravity,"" he said. ""When companies look to move to Austin, this is the first place they should stop."" It's also a natural extension of the altruistic, entrepreneurial spirit that Baer advocates and Austin, host city to the annual South by Southwest Interactive Festival, embraces. Capital Factory isn't designed to make a lot of money; Baer said he mostly hopes it breaks even. But a successful Capital Factory could mean dozens, and eventually hundreds, of new companies will call Austin home. Myriad start-ups will vie for the opportunity to move into a lush workspace they could never afford on their own.  Those that are chosen will join ""anchor companies"" like Jason Cohen's WP Engine, which was one of the first companies to move in to the space. Cohen's  Web-hosting company is growing rapidly and he said renting seats for his staff of 20 in Capital Factory was a no brainer. ""For a growing company like us, it'll take, like, 40 people before this is more expensive than getting our own space,"" he said. The idea behind the factory, Baer said, is that hundreds of people from dozens of start-up companies working in  proximity to each other will lead to stronger businesses. Cohen's company will be one of the biggest; the average size of the start-ups is expected to be 2-5 people. From Cohen's perspective, the more people and companies the better. ""The fact that they're all kind of smooshed up together and going through the same crap, the highs and the lows, and the questions and the dilemmas in a space where we could bounce ideas off each other -- that alone is worth the price of admission,"" he said. ""It's an experience you could never get in any other way."" That co-working environment is at the heart of Baer's plan to help Austin's tech sector continue to thrive. With an unemployment rate under 6%, Austin is a bright spot in what has been a gloomy national economy. Tech start-ups have played a huge role in keeping the Austin economy strong, with more than 4,000 companies employing more than 100,000 people. Baer believes that a space like Capital Factory will give Austin-based companies a new advantage when it comes to hiring in the future. The No. 1 problem for many tech start-ups is recruiting great engineering talent.  Baer said Capital Factory will be the edge Austin needs. ""We're going to be bringing in just a pipeline of talent and we're going to be teaching them the skills that they need,"" he said. ""They're going to walk in here and say 'Wow, this place is amazing. I want to  work here. Which companies are here?' "" Technology start-ups may be nothing new to Austin, but Baer's Capital Factory takes a new approach to fostering them. Partners and mentors include South by Southwest, the local Chamber of Commerce, the University of Texas, New York-based entrepreneurial-education company General Assembly and Baer's own network of 20 mentors. For Baer, it's about making the home that he loves even better. ""At the start of it, this is around community,"" he said. ""It's creating the kind of place and the kind of environment that I want to live and work in."" Baer came to Austin in 1999, recruited directly out of Carnegie Mellon University at the height of the first dotcom boom. For someone who would go on to build a network of tech leaders, the timing couldn't have been better. Now he leverages associations from those days to create an entire network of mentors in Austin. With Baer's urging, dozens of successful Austin CEOs now take it upon themselves to help the next generation. They do this through Baer's start-up accelerator, as well as at his Start-Up 101 class at the University of Texas. ""There were entrepreneurship classes and business classes, but our class is more of a practicum for student entrepreneurs. They're already working on start-ups, now they get credit for doing that,"" he said. Baer even holds weekly office hours at an Austin coffee shop, offering start-up advice to anyone who asks. That level of commitment has made Baer the young generation's face of Austin entrepreneurship.  It's hard to find a start-up in Austin where the players don't know him, and maybe even harder to find a CEO who doesn't like him. Scott Robinson of Austin-based Insperity made a point to attend the launch of Capital Factory, and he didn't mince words. ""I might go so far as to suggest he's been as influential on this generation of entrepreneurs in Austin as Michael Dell was in his era,"" he said.","Capital Factory aims to attract, keep tech startups in Austin, Texas .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Just before midnight Wednesday, Ukraine's president declared a truce in his tumultuous nation, as well as the start of negotiations aimed at not only preventing further bloodshed but forging a lasting peace. The statement -- agreed upon with leaders of Ukraine's three top opposition parties -- seemingly offered a respite from the violence and acrimony that's marred the last few weeks. Still, there have been talks before. There was a breakthrough as recently as four days ago, when protesters agreed to move out of Kiev's City Hall and unblock downtown streets. Then it collapsed in a bloody mess Tuesday on the streets of Kiev. So will this attempt be any different? One thing that has changed is the scale of the violence: Authorities say at least 26 people -- protesters and police alike -- were killed in fierce clashes centered around Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square. The international outrage also has ratcheted up. After weeks of behind-the-scenes work and general calls for a peaceful resolution, Western leaders ramped up their pressure on Wednesday. As U.S. President Barack Obama said, ""We're going to be watching closely."" He and other Western leaders offered pointed remarks -- and floated possible sanctions -- against Ukraine's embattled government for its part in the recent violence. ""We hold the Ukrainian government primarily responsible,"" Obama said, ""for making sure that it is dealing with peaceful protesters in an appropriate way, that the Ukrainian people are able to assemble and speak freely about their interests without fear of repression."" If there is a truce, it wasn't evident overnight Wednesday in central Kiev. Persistent explosions rattled the night sky, the apparent product of protesters' fireworks, security forces' stun grenades and whatever else. Demonstrators continued to pick up pavement and rocks, then throw them at police. Security forces themselves responded, including in some cases throwing Molotov cocktails in protesters' direction. ""The government would like the world to believe that those on Maidan are just terrorists and extremists to justify the bloodshed,... that those on Maidan are armed with firearms and rioting,"" Kiev protester MaiaKiev told CNN iReport. ""But it's not a riot ... It's a revolution of dignity."" Both sides appear dug in . The situation began in November, when the opposition hit the streets angry about Yanukovych's backpedaling from a trade pact with the European Union. That move and Russia's offer the following month to buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas played into the storyline of Ukraine being a proxy for battles between Russia and the West. Yet this dispute goes beyond international affairs. It's also about who controls Ukraine's future and how, as seen in the opposition's pressing for constitutional reforms shifting powers from the president to the parliament. The government's response to the dissent -- including a sweeping, if short-lived, anti-protest law in January -- further inflamed the opposition. While the protests in Maidan have been a constant, there have been ebbs and flows in the unrest. The most sudden shift came on Tuesday, two days after a seeming breakthrough. Riot police plowed through the streets with water cannons, stun grenades, night sticks and, in some cases, armored personnel carriers. Protesters fought back, with some clawing paving stones from the streets and firing Molotov cocktails attached to fireworks from an improvised air cannon. They even set fire to the headquarters of the headquarters of the ruling Party of Regions. Overnight Tuesday, the situation had become a standoff. The security forces maintained on alert and so did demonstrators, refusing to budge from their physical position in the center of Ukraine's capital as well as their political positions. A ring of fire continued to burn along barricades around their camp in the city center. Their cries against President Viktor Yanukovych are continuing too -- accusing him of scuttling an European Union trade pact to cozy up with Russia, resisting reforms that might curb his power and stubbornly, heavy-handedly dealing with the opposition. As to the Ukrainian government, while security forces held back Wednesday, its officials did not. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara said an opposition march Tuesday ""ended with massive riots and aggressive and excessive attacks against the Ukrainian police."" The head of Ukraine's security service was even more forceful, accusing protesters of taking over government offices nationwide and looting 1,500 weapons and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, among other misdeeds. ""These are concrete acts of terror,"" Oleksander Yakimenko said in a statement announcing an anti-terrorism operation apparently targeting protesters. ""Radical and extremist groups are now a real threat."" Yakimenko spoke hours before the announcement of the truce, which two of the opposition leaders -- Vitali Klitschko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk -- later confirmed. Klitschko, a former world-class boxer who now leads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party, said the next round of talks will take place Thursday. Until then, Yanukovych has promised that there will be no further attempts to disperse protesters in Maidan, according to a statement on Klitschko's party's website. ""Today, a key goal is to stop the bloodshed that authorities have provoked and unleashed,"" Klitschko said. ""Now we will see how Yanukovych will stick to his word after promised sanctions from the West."" Ukraine's top military man replaced . One man who won't be part of the government's anti-terrorism campaign is Ukraine's armed forces chief. Col. Gen. Volodymyr Zamana has been replaced, according to a statement Wednesday on the president's website. No reason was given for the dismissal of Zamana, who according to his official bio started in the Soviet military, then rose through the ranks of Ukraine's military before getting the top job in February 2012. U.S. General Philip Breedlove, the military commander for NATO -- the 23-nation alliance including not just Western Europe and the United States, but Ukraine's neighbors Poland and Romania -- called ""upon the new military leadership in Ukraine to open a dialog (sic) with us to bring this situation to a peaceful resolution."" In his CNN interview Wednesday, Ukraine's foreign minister insisted that -- despite what he characterized as protesters' provocations -- police have ""strong instructions"" to avoid using ""offensive means."" And Kozhara rejected reports that the army, whoever leads it, has been authorized to fire on protesters. ""Under no conditions (will) the Ukrainian army ... be used in resolving this political crisis,"" the minister added. Over the course of a few hours overnight Wednesday, Ukrainian troops moved into defensive positions around bases and weapons depots, according to a U.S. defense official familiar with the latest intelligence. The move is seen by the United States as an effort to ensure the military's facilities remain secure. U.S. won't issue visas to 20 Ukrainians . After some well-reported infighting about how engaged they'd been in the crisis, Western officials were vocal on Wednesday not just condemning the violence but threatening action. The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland are set to to travel to Kiev on Thursday to survey the situation, before briefing their European Union colleagues in Brussels. After that, they and their U.S. allies could impose sanctions against Yanukovych's government -- especially if there is even more violence. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso vowed European officials will ""respond to the any deterioration on the ground"" with ""targeted measures against those responsible for violence and use of excessive force."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that Yanukovych must decide ""between protecting the people that he serves -- all of the people -- ... versus violence and mayhem."" ""We are talking about the possibility of sanctions or other steps with our friends (in) Europe and elsewhere in order to create the environment for compromise,"" Kerry said. Later Wednesday, a senior State Department official told reporters that the United States wouldn't issue visas for 20 senior members of the Ukrainian government and others responsible for Tuesday's violent crackdown on protesters. Calling the violence from both government forces and protesters ""completely unacceptable,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron challenged Ukraine's leaders to make the public's safety their first priority. ""President Yanukovych has a particular responsibility to pull back government forces and de-escalate the situation,"" Cameron said. Such measures could affect individuals but not likely the larger situation short term, said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Military action seems highly unlikely, and Russia appears poised to help Ukraine's government if economic sanctions were imposed, he said. ""We really don't have very good options to introduce,"" Haass told CNN. iReport: Protester describing bloodied people being rushed to medics .

"(CNN) -- As a longtime political operative, I know firsthand how a vote here or a vote there can make a huge difference in a close election. And as Vice President Al Gore's former campaign manager, I understand the impact U.S. Supreme Court decisions can have on electoral outcomes. These two reasons are why I'm outraged by what's going on in Ohio. This week, the Supreme Court, on the eve of early voting, ruled that efforts by Ohio Republicans to restrict early voting days were acceptable. This gets rid of what's called the Golden Week in Ohio -- the period when voters can register and cast their ballot at the same time. It ended convenient voting hours, when Ohioans could vote after a long day at work -- as late as 9 p.m. It also ended voting on one of the two Sundays before Election Day when many folks head to their polling place after church. These have been hallmarks of the Ohio voting system, but the Supreme Court and Republicans have yet again changed the rules in the middle of the game -- all to create barriers between people and the ballot box. And unfortunately it's not just Ohio where Republicans have doggedly tried to restrict or cut early voting days or hours. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP have reduced and limited the early voting period, including weekend voting. In North Carolina, the Republican governor and legislature took away a week of early voting. And in Georgia, a GOP legislator lamented a county's move to expand early voting, saying he would ""prefer more educated voters"" over black early voters. Think this doesn't have any real impact? Think again. In 2012, a third of voters cast a ballot before Election Day, in person or by mail -- more than double the rate during the 2000 election. All told, more than 18 million voters cast an early in-person ballot when President Obama was re-elected. Voting shouldn't be a challenge. It should be as easy and accessible as possible. We shouldn't require forms of ID that folks don't have, we shouldn't restrict days or hours that allow working people a chance to both do their job and exercise their democratic right, and we damn well shouldn't be throwing up new obstacles midstream. When obstacles are thrown up, we should have protections for voters. That's why I was so frustrated when the Supreme Court last summer gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby v. Holder. The Supreme Court ruled that there's no need for national oversight when localities and states with a history of racially discriminatory voting laws make voting rule changes. I'm not alone with my frustration. A recent poll from Lake Research and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that nationally, 69% of the American public favors restoring the VRA, with only 10% opposing. Voters of both parties, all races, and every region across the country favor a congressional proposal to restore the Voting Rights Act. I'm hopeful that Republicans and Democrats will, in the lame duck session after the 2014 elections or in the beginning of the next session of Congress, hammer out legislation that restores oversight and protects voters. As Democrats, we believe in giving every eligible citizen the opportunity to vote -- whether it's early because they can't take off work on Election Day or absentee because they might have plans to be out of town. And we believe this for two reasons. First, when more people vote, Democrats win. That's because more Americans agree with us on the big issues and the big questions -- like who's got my back? But second, it's because our democracy is better when more people have skin in the game. Our democracy relies on participation and we've never done better by excluding folks. If there's one thing we can count on, it's that the GOP is going to continue to come up with last minute schemes to make it more complicated, more confusing, or just plain more difficult for honest, hardworking citizens to vote on Election Day or before. It's up to us to stop them.","Supreme Court ruled Ohio could restrict early voting; other GOP states have also done it .

"Boston (CNN) -- A federal judge on Thursday denied a petition of James ""Whitey'' Bulger to consolidate two pending racketeering cases against the reputed mobster, ruling in favor of prosecutors' requests to dismiss the lesser 1994 indictment in an effort to focus on 19 murder charges. Interim defense attorney Peter Krupp had requested the merger, which prosecutors argued was meant to complicate the more severe charges that Bulger faces. Krupp had accused federal prosecutors of dropping the less serious charge in order to ""game the system"" and allow a different judge to hear the case. The racketeering indictment, filed in 1995, had been assigned to U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf. The murder charges are part of a case brought in 2000 and assigned to a different judge. ""The government's apparent forum shopping is contrary to the public interest and undermines public confidence in the judicial process,"" Krupp argued. ""The government's actions, choosing to pursue a new indictment, rather than a superseding indictment before this Court, reflect a manipulation of the case."" he said. Wolf ruled against Krupp's request during the first of two hearings Thursday afternoon in Boston. In a second hearing, Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler appointed prominent defense attorney J.W. Carney Jr. as Bulger's public defender after it became clear the accused mobster lacked the resources to pay for his own attorney. Carney said the case represented ""a daunting task, but we're up for it."" Prosecutors -- who said FBI agents seized more than $822,000 in cash from Bulger's Santa Monica, California, apartment -- said he should have picked up his own legal tab. ""He has every incentive to lie and stick the taxpayers with the bill for his defense,"" prosecutors wrote in court papers filed Tuesday. They said Bulger has admitted to stashing more money away with ""people he trusted"" but would not name, and suggested that Bulger's brother William could pay for a lawyer. Clad in an orange jumpsuit and flanked by two security guards, Bulger was escorted off a helicopter at Logan International Airport in Boston and then ushered to a van that brought the alleged mobster to court. The helicopter brought Bulger to Boston from a jail in Plymouth, Massachusetts, where he was being held. His arraignment is set for July 6. Bulger's attorneys have also argued that leaks about the case endanger the former fugitive's right to a fair trial on murder charges. ""If it is now possible -- and Mr. Bulger seriously questions whether it will be possible -- for Mr. Bulger to receive a fair trial, law enforcement leaks of nonpublic information must end, with disclosures of information limited to the judicial process,"" Krupp wrote. In an affidavit unsealed by a judicial order, U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said the leaks issue was a ""grave concern."" She said law enforcement agencies must ensure no information is released prior to introduction in court. Ortiz also indicated she may call for an investigation into the matter. Prosecutors say the 81-year-old Bulger was the boss of South Boston's Irish mob before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. At the same time, he was an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the basis for the Oscar-winning crime drama ""The Departed."" Bulger was arrested last week in California, along with his longtime girlfriend, 60-year-old Catherine Elizabeth Greig. She has been charged with harboring a fugitive. His brother, William, is a former president of the University of Massachusetts and a state Senate leader. He was forced to step down from his university job after then-Gov. Mitt Romney, now a Republican presidential candidate, accused him of being evasive during congressional testimony about the whereabouts of his brother, ""Whitey."" Bulger lived ""a relatively comfortable lifestyle"" for the 16 years he was a fugitive, taking numerous gambling trips to Las Vegas, according to a government document filed in his case.  Prosecutors say Bulger waived his Miranda rights after his arrest and told agents who were taking him back to Boston that he had been ""a frequent traveler as a fugitive,"" according to the government. ""Bulger acknowledged visiting Las Vegas on numerous occasions to play the slots and claimed he won more than he lost,"" the filing said. ""Bulger also admitted traveling to San Diego and then crossing over into Tijuana to purchase medicines."" Bulger also told the feds that he traveled back to Boston ""on several occasions while 'armed to the teeth' because he 'had to take care of some unfinished business,'"" the document said.  Bulger refused to tell the agents any details of his Boston visits, it said. CNN's Sheila Steffen and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","A judge appointed J.W.

"Is Wendy Davis a liar? Turns out the Texas senator and gubernatorial hopeful had some help paying for her Harvard Law School education (though she never said she didn't). Turns out, too, that Davis' two children spent most of their time back in Texas while Davis got that education (though she never said they hadn't). She claimed she was 19 when she divorced, but the truth appears to be that she was separated at 19 and divorced at 21 (busted!). And though she's told stories about the difficulties of time spent living in a trailer with her daughter, a recent Dallas Morning News article might lead us to ask, is that so bad?! She lived in that trailer ""only a few months."" For these errors, Davis has been branded a liar, a whore and a terrible mother.  No matter, one could argue that her embellishments are no worse than those of the average politician, or, for that matter, any 50-year-old recounting details of events that happened some 30 years earlier-- not that anyone's asking male politicians whether their wives helped pay for their education, or who watched the kids while they were off supporting the family. ""So Abortion Barbie had a Sugar Daddy Ken,"" tweeted Fox News pundit Erick Erickson, referring to Davis' filibuster last year of an anti-abortion bill. Tea Party Republican Todd Kincannon tweeted, ""Wendy Davis has solved America's student loan crisis! Just find a dumbass to pay off your loans in exchange for sex."" Bristol Palin weighed in with a somewhat less vitriolic but no less pointed jab at Davis and her then-husband's decision to have her daughters stay home with him in Texas while she attended law school: ""Gosh,"" wrote Palin, ""children are sooo inconvenient, huh?"" While Davis has conceded that she inaccurately represented, if only slightly, a few facts concerning her background — or, at least, allowed the media to do so for her — the controversy surrounding her candidacy isn't about whether or not she is too untrustworthy to serve as governor as her detractors would have you believe. It's about whether she's too female. Consider that male politicians, and men in other big jobs, leave their families for days or weeks at a time in order to earn their best living. Or that it's not unusual for husbands to go through school with support, financial and otherwise, from their spouses. And let's be honest: Would people accept Davis as a legitimate candidate for Texas governor if she had skipped school in favor of staying home with her kids? If she had not become a lawyer or a senator but instead spent her days driving carpool?  No. No more than we'd consider asking our male candidates how they had the audacity not to choose to be stay-at-home dads. This isn't a debate over Davis' values, but rather a reminder that she is a woman, and that a woman's place is at home. The digs here aren't about her character or her politics. They're about her gender, and the fact that voters continue to want their female candidates smarter, sharper and more unimpeachable than their male ones -- and to have stayed home with the kids, too.  This is a prejudice that's not even rooted in truth, since a number of studies have found that children raised in single-father homes fare just as well as those in single-mother homes. Still, this controversy could be the best thing that's happened for Davis, and for female politicians in general. With every blatantly misogynistic conservative view spewed into the discourse, female voters become more acutely aware of, and angry about, society's enduring sexism. And that matters. The GOP's ""war on women"" has directly impacted votes, and not in a small way. In a Gallup poll conducted shortly before the 2012 election — and not long after events like Todd Akin's comments about ""legitimate rape"" and the right-wing smearing of attorney and activist Sandra Fluke — 60% of women said government policies on birth control would be extremely or very important in influencing their vote. So go ahead, Kincannons and Palins of the world. Smear away. Call Wendy Davis or any other female politician a ""whore"" and a ""bad mother"" enough and American women will start to wonder what you think about them. Which, of course, isn't very much.","Peggy Drexler: Wendy Davis, running for governor in Texas, had discrepancies in her bio .

"The Philadelphia abortion doctor who was convicted of first-degree murder for killing babies that were born alive in his clinic has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for running a pill mill out of the same clinic, according to a U.S. attorney's office statement. Kermit Gosnell, 72, pleaded guilty to prescribing and dispensing narcotics from June 2008 to February 2010. He wrote fraudulent prescriptions for hundreds of thousands of prescription pills -- including 600,000 pills containing oxycodone -- to cash-paying customers who showed no medical need, according to the Monday release from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Gosnell, along with his staff, allowed customers to purchase prescriptions under multiple names, pay in cash and give tips to the clinic's staff, according to the release. Gosnell horror fuels fight for abortion laws . Gosnell wrote more than 2,300 prescriptions for controlled substances in January 2010 alone, charging up to $150 for each, according to the release. Gosnell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, distribution and aiding and abetting the distribution of oxycodone and maintaining a place for the illegal distribution of controlled substances. In May, Gosnell was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for killing babies at his West Philadelphia abortion clinic by cutting their spinal cords with scissors. He was sentenced to life without parole in exchange for waiving his right to appeal the convictions.  Prosecutors had sought the death penalty. The medical clinic owned by Gosnell had been growing increasingly reckless, according to a 2011 grand jury report. Gosnell and nine other employees at the Women's Medical Center were charged with crimes for the illegal practices at the clinic. Eight people involved at the Gosnell's clinic have pleaded guilty to various charges, including four to murder. CNN's calls to Gosnell's attorney were not answered.

"(CNN) -- Five Somali men were sentenced Monday to life plus 80 years in prison for engaging in piracy and related offenses in last year's attack on a U.S. warship in the Indian Ocean, federal officials announced Monday. ""Today marks the longest sentence ever given to a pirate in U.S. court, following the first time in over 190 years that an American jury has convicted a defendant of piracy,"" Neil H. MacBride, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. ""Today's sentences should send a clear message to those who attempt to engage in piracy: Armed attacks on U.S.-flagged vessels carry severe consequences in U.S. courts."" In November, a federal jury in Virginia convicted the Somali men -- Mohammed Modin Hasan, Gabul Abdullahi Ali, Abdi Wali Dire, Abdi Mohammed Gurewardher and Abdi Mohammed Umar -- of piracy, attack to plunder a vessel, act of violence against persons on a vessel, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with a dangerous weapon on federal officers and employees, conspiracy to use firearms during a crime of violence, and multiple firearm counts, including the use of a rocket propelled grenade. Citing evidence and trial testimony, the statement said the five men left Somalia in three vessels -- two small ones and a larger one -- looking for a merchant ship to pirate. On April 1, 2010, Hasan, Ali and Dire boarded one of the smaller boats and set out to pirate what they believed to be a merchant ship, while Gurewardher and Umar remained on the large ship, the statement said. Using assault weapons and a rocket-propelled grenade, the men opened fire on what they later discovered was no merchant ship but the USS Nicholas, a 450-foot U.S. warship whose home port is in Norfolk, Virginia. The Nicholas, in turn, sank the boat that carried out the attack and captured the pirate mother ship that launched it. MacBride estimated that Somali pirates currently hold 650 to 800 people hostage and that the annual cost of piracy could reach $12 billion. That would include the costs of ransoms, military operations to provide protection to shipping lanes and insurance policies that cover piracy, he said. The sentencing occurred in Norfolk before Judge Mark Davis, MacBride said. He called the sentences, which do not include the possibility of parole, the longest ever given out to pirates. The pirate statute, which dates to the early years of this country, carries a mandatory life sentence. Pirate attacks have become a frequent hazard for sailors off Somalia, which has had no effective central government since 1991.","Each of the defendants was sentenced to life plus 80 years .
They are longest sentences ever meted out to a pirate in a U.S. court .
It's also the first time in 190 years that a U.S. court has convicted a defendant of piracy ."

"(CNN) -- For a while now, crazy situations, hunger pangs and frustrating hours behind the wheel have been making life slightly miserable for Florida commuter Joe Panyanouvong. The attorney who regularly makes the 84-mile journey between Orlando and Tampa on Interstate 4 is ready for a solution. ""I have made this trip many times during peak hours for work and leisure. It can feel like a parking lot at times,"" said Panyanouvong. ""During heavy traffic it's taken me as long as 2.5 hours to get from Orlando to Tampa."" He recalls one day when -- despite departing Orlando early to get a head start on a business trip -- traffic and farm animals got the best of him near U.S. Route 27 and Interstate 4. A cow had wandered past a fence onto the road, causing tie-ups and headaches. ""I ended up missing lunch because of that cow,"" Panyanouvong said with a laugh. ""I don't like missing lunch and I especially don't like getting stuck in traffic due to wandering farm animals or any other reason."" For generations, much of the nation has been forced to use cars, buses or pricey aircraft to travel to nearby cities. But this year, Washington opened the door to what may be a historic turning point in regional travel. The Department of Transportation awarded $8 billion among 31 states to begin developing America's first nationwide high-speed intercity passenger rail service.   Panyanouvong said he loves the idea of jumping on a train, turning on his computer and getting some work done on his way to Tampa, ""without having to worry about traffic or driving."" But the idea is much bigger than convenience, say supporters, who believe high-speed intercity rail will cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil, reduce climate-changing pollution and fatten wallets by triggering economic development. Soon, Americans might find themselves rocketing along ribbons of rails at 200 mph in sleek, painted passenger cars -- never stopping until they arrive at destinations awake and refreshed. The federal funding served as a down payment to develop the groundwork for 13 new high-speed rail corridors in the United States, including an Orlando-Tampa route. ""High-speed rail in America is long overdue and President Obama understands we can't build the economy of the future on the transportation networks of the past,"" said Federal Railroad Administrator Joseph Szabo. Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, these new dollars represent a historic investment in the country's transportation infrastructure. It will help create jobs and transform travel in America, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation official. See where the proposed high-speed trains are going . ""High-speed rail will also revolutionize the way Americans travel by reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, lowering harmful carbon emissions, fostering new economic development and giving travelers more choices when it comes to moving around the country,"" said the official. Despite these promises from the government, high-speed rail comes with its share of opponents, who say it is too expensive and won't save energy. Some even question if it will ever be built. ""Even in a strong economy, building high-speed rail makes little sense, offering minimal reductions in travel times at exorbitant costs,"" said Ronald Utt, who is the Herbert and Joyce Morgan senior research fellow for the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation. ""For instance, one has to wonder what exactly motivated the review team to endorse the proposed $1.1 billion investment in the Kansas City-St. Louis-Chicago route, which would allow customers to reach their destinations 10 percent faster than they could by driving between Chicago and St. Louis,"" said Utt. Utt said the $1.25 billion federal investment in a $3.2 billion project to build a high-speed rail line between Orlando and Tampa would reduce travel time between the two cities to less than one hour, compared to about 90 minutes by car. He said other projects have similar travel time differences. Randal O'Toole, a senior fellow with the CATO Institute, said it is far more cost-effective to save energy by encouraging people to drive more fuel-efficient cars than to build and operate high-speed rail. ""Moreover, in places that do generate electricity from renewable sources, it would be more cost-effective to use that electricity to power electric or plug-in hybrid cars than high-speed rail,"" O'Toole said. ""A Department of Energy report adds that boosting train speeds to 110 mph will reduce the energy efficiency of the trains, making them less energy efficient than automobiles."" A report from the United States Government Accountability Office also highlights potential issues with high-speed rail plans in the United States. ""Passenger rail service, especially services at higher and high speeds, will require new safety rules, constant public capital investment and operating subsidies, and balance with freight rail service and the rest of the national transportation system -- and currently only some of these elements are in place,"" according to a GAO report. While the recent federal funds may serve as a catalyst for many projects and have generated high public expectations, the planning necessary to meet the many concerns outlined above has not yet occurred, the GAO report said. ""Given the funding, I would say that it is fairly likely that at least a few moderate-speed rail projects will eventually be completed,"" said O'Toole. ""But the California high-speed rail project remains fairly unlikely considering that more than three-fourths of its costs are not yet funded. Florida probably has a 50-50 chance of completion since about half its costs are funded."" High-speed rail also has many supporters. The United States Conference of Mayors, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and America 2050 --  a coalition of regional planners, scholars and policy-makers -- back high-speed rail plans. The U.S. High Speed Rail Association is also among the supporters. ""Experts in the oil industry have been saying for a number of years now that there is not enough oil left in the ground to continue our current level of consumption, not to mention no way to meet growing demand, and we can expect half as much oil available to us in the next 20 years,"" said Andy Kunz, president and CEO of the rail association. ""If we are to continue economic development and prosperity, we will need to greatly reduce our daily oil consumption, and high-speed rail is the only possible solution that can scale up to meet the growing demand of American mobility while greatly reducing our oil consumption,"" said Kunz. High-speed rail supporters say the industry would stimulate the economy by creating millions of jobs across numerous sectors. ""Based on our company's 45 years of experience with high-speed rail in Japan, bringing high-speed rail to the United States will translate into jobs,"" said Mike Finnegan, an executive with US-Japan High Speed Rail and US-Japan Maglev. ""Importantly, these jobs pay well and they cannot be shipped overseas."" ""The $8 billion investment in high-speed rail for America is just the beginning,"" said Szabo. ""We know that it won't be built overnight, but the federal government is committed to the long-term development of the program. Of course, the Department of Transportation will fund projects that have the best chances to succeed and have instituted rigorous requirements to ensure successful completion of these projects."" So if and when high-speed rail does move forward in the United States, how would it be built and what type of technology would be used? The Department of Transportation says funding for the program is ""technology neutral"" and does not place preference on the type of technologies used to build high-speed trains. Instead, it is allowing states and regions to choose the technology, as well as routes and station locations that meet their needs. Most high-speed rail lines in the United States will be upgraded using existing freight rail rights-of-way, but the project in Florida and portions of California will be built on newly constructed high-speed rail lines, said Nazih Haddad, the chief operating officer for Florida Rail Enterprise. Trains could reach up to 168 mph on Florida's high-speed line. Estimates from the U.S Department of Transportation say speeds could reach up to 220 mph for some portions of California's rail lines, while most other regions would top 110 mph. Maglev train technology, which is popular in many scientific circles around the world for its high speeds, is one mode of high-speed rail that is not catching on in the United States because of its high cost, according to the Department of Transportation and rail industry insiders. Maglev is a train technology in which magnetic forces lift, propel and guide a vehicle over a guideway. It follows guidance tracks with magnets and does not use steel wheels or steel rails usually associated with trains. A well-known high-speed Maglev system operates commercially at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport in China. Its train reaches speeds of 268 mph and is much faster than the high-speed trains proposed in the United States. Japan and Germany also use Maglev train systems. See how the Maglev train works . So what's the time frame? One Department of Transportation report said high-speed rail lines in portions of California may not be completed until 2026.   For Joe Panyanouvong and the millions of Americans searching for solutions to ""traffic headaches,"" the answers appear complex and in some cases, highly debatable and costly. Panyanouvong will have to wait until at least 2015 until he has a chance to chuck his car and ride the rails from Orlando to Tampa. Nonetheless, he said he'll be ready. ""I would rather keep my 2002 Nissan Maxima at home.""","Washington awards $8 billion among 31 states to develop high-speed rail service .

"To paraphrase ""The Social Network,"" if Abraham Lincoln had invented Facebook, he would have invented Facebook. But in a tall tale that would have made the Great Emancipator proud, a blog post saying that he did just that was making the rounds Wednesday. And some online media outlets were quick to take the bait. Blogger Nate St. Pierre, a consultant who works with blogs and other Web businesses to help grow their sites, posted a fantastic yarn Tuesday about stumbling upon a tombstone in Wisconsin that ultimately led him to the Lincoln Museum in Springfield, Illinois. There, he discovered an 1845 patent filed by Honest Abe for a sort of personalized newspaper in which ""every Man may have his own page, where he might discuss his Family, his Work, and his Various Endeavors."" Each page would feature a profile picture at the top left. The user's name, address and profession would appear at the top. On a sample page, Lincoln shared two poems he ""liked,"" a short story about the Pilgrims and details about what he did that day (went to the circus). ""Put all that together on one page and tell me what it looks like to you,"" St. Pierre wrote. ""Profile picture. Personal information. Status updates. Copied and shared material. A few longer posts. Looks like something we see every day, doesn't it?"" In short: Lincoln envisioned a paper version of Facebook, 160 years before Mark Zuckerberg. Except for the fact that none of it is true. ""I just wanted to have fun with it,"" St. Pierre said Wednesday. ""I've done this before. Every couple of years, I do a hoax. I knew this would go big but didn't expect those dozens of outlets to just run with it without 30 seconds of fact-checking."" For careful readers, St. Pierre's post is sprinkled with what should have been plenty of red flags. For one, he writes that his search began after he discovered an apparent friendship between Lincoln and legendary huckster P.T. Barnum. You know, the guy widely believed to have said, ""There's a sucker born every minute"" and ""You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time."" (Both of those quotes, by the way, may not have actually been said by Barnum.) He even quotes Wikipedia's entry calling Barnum ""an American showman, businessman, scam artist and entertainer, remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes."" The tombstone in question supposedly belonged to a carny who brags on it about how he ""bluffed"" Lincoln and Barnum in a poker game. And photos like the one shown on the page Lincoln supposedly created wouldn't appear in newspapers for several more decades. ""I just did it for fun: an homage to P.T. and his hoaxes ... and Abe's tall tales,"" St. Pierre said. ""Just something fun like that for the modern day."" But he also wanted to make a bigger point: ""That the Internet would fall over itself to be first and share without checking."" In the first 24 hours after he posted, the article was shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times, St. Pierre said, adding that his personal blog got more than 50,000 visitors. Forbes magazine posted a story under the headline ""Abraham Lincoln Filed a Patent for a Dead-Tree Facebook in 1845."" By Wednesday morning, that story had been pulled. ""A Forbes contributor took Nate St. Pierre's story at face value,"" a spokeswoman said in an e-mail. ""Once Forbes realized it was a prank, the article was pulled from the site."" Tech blog ZDNet did the same. As of Wednesday afternoon, the story was still online, with a note saying that it's a hoax and with some, but not all, of the fake information crossed out. (Hey, a page view is a page view, right?) At tech blog The Next Web, a story was followed by another pointing out that the too-good-to-be-true story was, in fact, too good to be true. The first line of the original story? ""You can't make this stuff up, folks."" Next Web writer Drew Olanoff said the story was popping up elsewhere online when he posted it under the site's ""Shareables,"" section, which features mostly fun, light-hearted stories. ""While it probably should have been marked as fiction by the author, who is obviously extremely imaginative, these things do happen,"" he said in an e-mail. ""I'm sure it got him the attention he was seeking."" For his part, St. Pierre said, he enjoyed watching tech bloggers on Twitter first share the story but then argue amongst themselves about who got fooled first. ""Dude, you both got punked,"" he said with a laugh. And while St. Pierre's story was made up, he may have gotten a little closer to the 16th president's true nature than he realized. Lincoln never envisioned creating a way for his contemporaries to share cute pictures of their cats, much less play FarmVille (which no doubt would have seemed less exotic in rural 19th-century America). But he did become the only U.S. president in history to hold a patent for an invention. According to the Smithsonian, Lincoln filed in 1849 for a patent on a tool designed to lift ships off of sandbars. That tool, much like Abe's proto-Web startup, never became a reality.","Blog post about Abraham Lincoln and Facebook fools the Web .

"Obamacare has survived a Supreme Court appeal, a government shutdown and ongoing challenges by opposing politicians. With few exceptions, every American must have health insurance by March 31 or pay a penalty fee. That's right: The marketplaces that are central to the Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- launched on October 1, despite the shutdown showdown and the much-anticipated premiere of ""The Walking Dead."" The government has since reopened, and Obamacare is still the law. For most people, Obamacare won't make a direct impact. People who have health insurance through their employer, or through Medicare or Medicaid, can continue to get it that way. Obamacare coverage gap: The poor caught in between . But the more than 48 million Americans without health insurance have to enroll in one of the insurance marketplaces by December 15 in order to have their coverage start on January 1. The historic rollout has been overshadowed by technical issues and pessimistic predictions about how many people are really clamoring to sign up. Here are five things that have happened since the launch of Obamacare: . 1. Sign up on Healthcare.gov hasn't been easy . The launch of Obamacare was disappointing for many people who actually wanted to use the government website to enroll in health insurance. Technical problems with the federal website, HealthCare.gov, made signing up online difficult for some users. The high volume of traffic to the insurance exchange portal contributed to these problems. ""I am the first to acknowledge that the website that was supposed to do this all in a seamless way has had way more glitches than I think are acceptable,"" President Obama told KCCI, a CNN affiliate in Des Moines, Iowa. A senior administration official told CNN that techs are working around the clock to get the site working better. But there also has been some confusion over user passwords. When CNN called the government help line, we were told passwords established in the first week of October were no longer valid and new passwords were needed to access the site; the Department of Health and Human Services told us that information was inaccurate. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen tried to enroll in Obamacare as an experiment. It took more than a week for her to create a login and password. When that finally worked, error messages plagued her efforts when she tried to log in. Almost two weeks went by before she succeeded in logging in and proceeding with an application. An insurance industry source told CNNMoney's Tami Luhby that insurers are receiving faulty information about new customers, including duplicate forms, and missing and garbled information. They are in discussion with regulators and the administration to address these issues. Next week, congressional oversight hearings will begin, where politicians will ask questions about why the rollout had so many problems. 2. State sites seemed to fare better . While 36 states are using Healthcare.gov as the gateway to sign up new insurance customers, 14 states and the District of Columbia are running their own sign-up sites. While HealthCare.gov has stumbled, many of these individual states are doing better. The Department of Health and Human Services says it won't release enrollment figures before November, but CNN has gotten a window on enrollment by canvassing the states running their own sign-up sites. As of Friday afternoon, at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans. More than half of those -- 134,000 -- are in New York state. Operations are also running relatively smoothly in Washington state and Kentucky, which each reported more than 45,000 new sign-ups. CNN reached its sign-up figures by combining what states report as ""enrolled,"" and what they're calling ""almost enrolled."" The latter group has completed the process but has not yet made an initial payment. Also note: The numbers don't include those who have sought assistance or enrolled over the phone or via paper application, and not all the states responded to data requests. Not every state has had smooth sailing. Hawaii's marketplace didn't fully open until October 15, two weeks late. In California, the Los Angeles Times has reported repeated problems with the part of the website where people can check whether their doctors are part of a network. 3. Overall enrollment numbers are unclear . Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters said the administration has not set monthly enrollment targets. But this week the Associated Press reported it had obtained an internal September 5 memo that said Health and Human Services expected about 500,000 people to enroll in new plans this month. At the current pace, enrollment would nearly reach that figure in the 14 states and District of Columbia alone. Still, it's unclear how many people have actually obtained health insurance since October 1. CNN has created a map with the latest numbers for individual states that are releasing enrollment information. 4. The cost of care has become more clear . Before the insurance exchanges went live, it was unclear how much health care was going to cost consumers in each state. The Manhattan Institute has released an online map showing insurance premiums before and after Obamacare based on age and sex. The law's impact varies widely state to state. In Oregon, for example, rates for 40-year-old men have increased 24%. In Ohio, they have dropped 22%. The White House says that once tax credits are factored in, about 6 in 10 individuals will be able to find insurance for less than $100 a month. ""In some states, insurance markets were already regulated to not allow insurers to discriminate against the sick. In those states, premiums will fall, like in New York, where premiums will fall by as much as 50%,"" said MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who helped design the law. ""In other states insurers were freely allowed to discriminate against the sick. In those states, by ending the discrimination, we're going to raise premiums in states like Wisconsin, or some of the Southern states."" Overall, Gruber said, rates are going up for the young and healthy, and down for older people and people who are sick. Is Obamacare cheap or pricey? The verdicts are in . When you do choose a plan, you should be aware of what doctor choices you have under your coverage. To reduce premiums and other costs, many insurers have chosen to limit the selection of doctors in certain exchange plans. Large academic medical centers, which are often more expensive, are excluded from such plans. ""The sticker price will be lower if the number of options are lower,"" Joe Mondy, a spokesman with Cigna, which is participating in five state exchanges, told CNNMoney. ""The issue is how many options can you do without?"" 5. The shutdown came and went -- without changing much . The government shutdown had no effect on users trying to sign up for Obamacare because money designated for the launch was approved in a previous session of Congress and didn't have to be approved again. Yet it was partly because of the Affordable Care Act that the shutdown continued so long in the first place. Republicans attacked the law on several fronts, demanding first that the government defund Obamacare, and then that it be delayed for a year. But when the government reopened, the GOP came away with just a small concession related to Obamacare: two additional reports from the Department of Health and Human Services. Republicans had wanted tighter income verification procedures for health insurance applicants. What they'll get is a report detailing the income checks the insurance exchanges will use, and a second report that reviews how effective the verification procedures are. The Republican party is still calling for an investigation into the HealthCare.gov website's problems. Opinion: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy .","Obamacare was largely unaffected by the government shutdown .
You have to enroll by December 15 in order to start your coverage on January 1 .

State sites' success varied but seemingly did better than the federal site ."
"Bitcoin, the emerging if still somewhat mysterious digital currency, may be coming soon to a high-tech ATM near you. Kiosks that allow people to buy the virtual coins, or exchange them for cash, will be installed within the next month or so in Seattle and Austin, Texas, according to Robocoin, the Las Vegas-based company that makes the machines. They will be the first such ATMs in the United States. Robocoin has installed machines in Vancouver, British Columbia, with more in Canada, Hong Kong, Europe and Asia in the works. The emergence of public ATMs, the company says, is a step toward making Bitcoin, a currency that's not backed by a government or bank and has no physical assets to prop up its value, a more comfortable buy for mainstream users outside the Webcentric circles where it currently thrives. ""We think it's a huge breakthrough when it comes to bringing accessibility to the consumers,"" Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley said. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in value. Currently, a single Bitcoin is worth about $636. That value was as high as $1,000 in December as investors began leaping into the currency. Some traditional businesses, including online retailer Overstock.com, some Subway sandwich shops and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, have begun accepting Bitcoin. But the anonymous nature of the currency also has linked it with less reputable outlets. Bitcoin and other digital ""cryptocurrencies"" have been the de facto payment system on underground websites that deal in drugs, weapons and other illegal merchandise. Last week, the anonymous owners of black-market website Silk Road announced that hackers had stolen $2.7 million worth of Bitcoin. In separate incidents, several online Bitcoin exchanges have been taken down by hackers who exploited a flaw to create fake transactions. Kelley wants his company's machines to help the currency shed its shadier associations, even if that means alienating some supporters who like the mostly anonymous nature of Bitcoin exchanges. ""We're trying to move Bitcoin, put it in the mainstream, bring it to the masses,"" he said. ""To do that, some things have to go by the wayside, and one of them is anonymity."" To create a Robocoin account, a user enters their mobile phone number at one of the kiosks. The machine sends a code to that phone and, after the user enters the code, they are asked to scan the palm of their hand. ""Your phone is your user ID and your palm is your password,"" Kelly said. The user is then asked to insert a driver's license or other government-issued ID, further personalizing their account as well as providing Robocoin an opportunity to verify the user's name against government watch lists for terrorists or others who may not legally do business in the machine's home country. Then, the user takes a photo at the kiosk, which must be verified as a match with the picture on their ID card. Once their account is verified, a process Kelley said takes two to five minutes, they are free to buy Bitcoins at the kiosk.

"A mirror that Michael Jackson looked into as he dressed in his final months and onto which he scribbled a message to himself sold for $18,750 at auction in Beverly Hills this weekend. Julien's Auctions sold 524 items that furnished the 100 North Carolwood mansion in Los Angeles' Holmby Hills neighborhood, significant because it was where Jackson and his three children lived in the months before his death.  Jackson did not own the furnishings. Some items brought higher prices because of their infamy in crime scene photos shown in this year's trial of Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, but others were valuable because Jackson and his family left their mark on them. A chalkboard may have cost a few hundred dollars, but it sold for $5,000 because of what his children wrote on it.  The note, handwritten on the black board attached to a 26-inch-tall ceramic rooster, reads ""love Daddy/ I (heart) Daddy/ Smile it's for free."" It sat in the kitchen where Jackson would eat lunch each day with Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson.  It was not known which child wrote the chalk note, but Julien's Executive Director Martin Nolan said his research suggested it was from Paris, who was 11 when her father died. The mirror with a message is on a Victorian-revival-style armoire from Jackson's master bedroom, presumably where Jackson looked each day as he dressed.  He used a wax pencil to remind himself:  ""Train, perfection March April Full out May."" The note is significant, considering that Jackson was battling the calendar as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" concerts set to premiere in London in July 2009. Dr. Murray's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on Jackson to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep, which led to Murray administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life. Murray was sentenced last month to four years in the Los Angeles County jail for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's June 25, 2009 death. Other items were macabre, not inspirational. A small table that sat next to the bed where Jackson spent his last living hours in a desperate search for sleep sold for $5,000. The ""French occasional table"" was listed for between $300 and $500.  It was a centerpiece of several key crime scene photos at Murray's trial, because several bottles of sedatives were found on it. The oriental rug on which paramedics tried to revive Jackson sold for $15,360, although the auction catalog placed its value at between $400 and $600.  It, also, is prominent on photos shown at the trial. Julien's backed away from selling the bed in which Jackson received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother, Katherine Jackson, Nolan said. The auction house's re-creation of the bedroom where Jackson died -- euphemistically called ""the medicine room"" by the company -- features a bed-sized memorial covered with love notes from Jackson fans instead of the death bed. The most expensive items sold were a $35,200 watercolor painting of floral still life by Maurice Utrillo and a $46,875 oil painting of fishing village by Adelsteen Normann. Jackson's relationship with Julien's turned sour in the last months of his life when he filed a lawsuit to stop the sale of furnishings from his Neverland ranch. The singer sued the auction company, claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from Neverland after he sold the ranch.  The suit was settled in April 2009 when Julien's canceled the auction and later returned the items to Jackson.","A chalkboard with a message of love from Jackson's children sells for $5,000 .

"A now defunct suburban Philadelphia swim club has agreed to a settlement more than three years after being accused of racism and discrimination for denying children from a largely minority day-care center access to their facility, the U.S. Justice Department said. Under the terms of the deal with the Justice Department and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, the Valley Club of Huntingdon Valley -- which filed for bankruptcy in November 2009 and had its property sold for $1.46 million the following June -- agreed to payouts to more than 50 children who were part of the Creative Steps Day Care Center, their counselors and Creative Steps itself. The distributed money includes whatever ""remaining assets"" from the sale of the club's property to Congregation Beth Solomon of northeast Philadelphia are leftover, once closing costs and associated fees have been covered, the Justice Department said Thursday in a press release. The settlement also sets aside $65,000 to create a leadership council made up of former Valley Club members, Creative Steps counselors, campers and their families. ""No one may be denied the right to use a swimming pool because of their race or the color of their skin,"" said Thomas E. Perez, the assistant attorney general heading the federal department's civil rights division. Creative Steps, a day-care center based out of northeast Philadelphia, had paid the Valley Club $1,950 in June of 2009 so its children could access its pool over the summer. ""I was excited,"" Alethea Wright, founder of Creative Steps, told CNN at the time. ""The children were excited, and parents were excited."" But when the young day campers came to the club for the first time, ""the children reported hearing racial slurs while enjoying the pool,"" the Justice Department said Thursday. Marcus Allen, who was 12 at the time and a camper with Creative Steps, recalled some club members asking, ""Why are these black kids here? They might steal from us."" ""It's kind of sad that people are still thinking like this,"" Allen said then, with tears streaming down his face, ""I thought those days were over."" On July 3, 2009, ""the club refunded the day camp's membership fee and prohibited the children from returning to swim,"" the Justice Department said. The club later issued a response denying that race had anything to do with its decision to exclude the children, contending instead that ""we underestimated the capacity of our facilities."" Around that time, Wright repeatedly lambasted the club for its tepid response to the accusations and said the children in her care were ""emotionally damaged"" by the incident. A few months later, in November 2009, the swim club filed for bankruptcy because of legal bills and liabilities tied to its decision to cancel swimming privileges for the day-camp children. The following January, the U.S. Justice Department opened its investigation into the racial discrimination allegations. The settlement detailed Thursday closes a key chapter in the saga, with one Pennsylvania official saying she hopes the entire, public ordeal makes it less likely discrimination will happen in the years to come. ""Our hope is that this case serves as prevention for years to come and a reminder that discrimination is illegal, and has no place in Pennsylvania,"" said JoAnn Edwards, executive director of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. In 2010: Synagogue top bidder for swim club embroiled in discrimination suit .","A mostly minority day care paid a suburban Philly swim club for access, then was denied .

"The man expected to become Italy's next prime minister won't pound the bully pulpit like Silvio Berlusconi. He won't claim to be the Jesus Christ of politics, or praise Barack Obama's ""tan"", and it's highly unlikely you'll bump into him at an all-night bunga bunga party. No, Pier Luigi Bersani is seen as a safe pair of hands -- and now, after a lifetime in politics, the 61-year-old leader of the center-left Democratic Party is hoping to hang on to a lead in the polls that bombastic three-time former premier Berlusconi had all but wiped out in the dying days of the campaign. A cigar-puffing ex-communist and pillar of the Italian left, Bersani campaigned on the promise of ""A Just Italy"" -- but as he knows, it will take far more than words to fix Europe's fourth-largest economy. Italy in crisis . From top to bottom, Italy is a mess. Berlusconi, its last elected prime minister, quit in disgrace in 2011 and is now on trial for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl. Italy has the third highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the first world, and only Haiti and Zimbabwe grew less from 2000 to 2010. Italy ranks 72nd in corruption -- behind Ghana and Saudi Arabia -- and at an estimated €140 billion euros in yearly turnover, organized crime is the country's biggest industry, according to one business association report. Italy ranks a woeful 73rd in the Ease of Doing Business index, 80th in gender equality, and income equality is growing. Mario Monti, who was appointed to run the country after Berlusconi's departure, has forced through a bitter package of cost-cutting measures to save the country from financial ruin, snuffing out any hope of short-term growth. Italy's economy has shrunk for a staggering six straight quarters, and its 11.2% unemployment rate is the highest since they began keeping records in 1999. And while Monti may have some say in the new Italian government, it is career politician Bersani who will bear the burden of pulling Italy out of the mire. From school teacher to party leader . Bersani was born in Bettola, a village in northwest Italy, in 1951. The son of a mechanic, he studied philosophy and wrote his thesis on Pope Gregory I at Bologna University, according to his campaign website. The lifelong Catholic has been married to Daniela Ferrari since 1980 and has two daughters. Bersani abandoned a brief stint as a schoolteacher in favor of local politics, joining the Communist Party in the historically left-leaning region of Emilia-Romagna. The Communist Party folded at the end of the Cold War but Bersani continued his way up the ranks in the leftist parties that followed, becoming the president of the Emilia-Romagna regional council in 1993. Bersani served in cabinet for three center-left governments between 1996 and 2008, most recently as the minister of economic development, when in a break with his communist roots he embarked on a series of free market reforms aimed at making Italian industry more competitive. Last December, voters in his Democratic Party had the opportunity to choose a younger, more vibrant politician to carry the torch for the Italian left in the upcoming election in the form of Matteo Renzi, the brash 38-year-old mayor of Florence. But while Renzi's following is growing, he was seen as too much of a modernizer for an Italian left long dominated by ex-communists, according to Geoff Andrews, an Open University senior lecturer and expert on Italian politics. ""Renzi is seen as a Blairite, but it's never been a Blairite left in Italy, and I don't think he was trusted by some of the party faithful,"" Andrews told CNN. Bersani, the popular party veteran, trounced Renzi in the primary by almost 22 points. But his nomination might also say as much about Italy's current political climate as it does about the candidates. ""After years of Silvio Berlusconi, voters need a rest,"" says Beppe Severigni, an Italian journalist who spoke to CNN during an 11-day train journey across the country to gauge voters' moods ahead of the election. ""Italians are nervous, anxious and exhausted, the mood is the same everywhere. After so long on the roller coaster people want a safe pair of hands, and Bersani is banking on that."" A more just Italy? If elected, Bersani has pledged to continue with Monti's unpopular budget-cutting reforms and sees them as a necessary evil, but he says Europe's strict focus on austerity measures is preventing Italy from growing. ""The rigor and credibility that Monti has brought into the world are for us a point of no return,"" he told CNN, several weeks before the election. ""[But] we believe that a stimulus is necessary to the European and the Italian economy."" Bersani will also pursue civil unions for gay people, immigration reform, and €500 million worth of government-funded university scholarships, according to the Democratic Party website. He says he will retain an unpopular property tax that his rival Berlusconi has promised to repeal, and refund, in its entirety -- a promise Mario Monti called ""a poison meatball,"" according to The New York Times. One of Bersani's main goals will be to enact labor reforms to make it cheaper for businesses to hire, but experts say his allegiance to Italy's labor unions could complicate any attempts at change. ""Italy has a lot of protected industries and interests, and Bersani has a lot of ties to CGIL, Italy's largest labor union,"" said Open University's Geoff Andrews. ""He is somebody from the old school left, and it's unlikely he's going to take a strong fight to the unions."" Can Bersani govern? According to Andrews, winning the election is just the beginning of Bersani's problems. Even if Bersani wins the election, recent polls have him falling well short of a majority of the vote. Most experts believe in order to govern he will need to try to cobble together a coalition with the more centrist Monti, whose austerity measures are deeply unpopular with factions of Bersani's current alliance. And even if Bersani and Monti manage to strike a deal, Berlusconi could get enough votes to make life difficult for the coalition once it's in office. His return to power may be unlikely, but the fact Berlusconi looms large in the election -- just 15 months after resigning as Italy hit rock bottom -- is a testament not only to his domination of Italian politics over the past 20 years, but also to the left's inability to capitalize on his scandals, according to Andrews. ""There's a lot of pessimism about the next government, and the problem Bersani's got has been the failure of the left to deal with Berlusconi,"" Andrews said. ""They're all sort of living in his shadow."" Italy has had more than 60 governments since World War II, and desperately needs a stable government to nurse its battered economy back to health. But while Bersani has sold voters on his promise of ""politics that tell the truth,"" the truth is that the election may only be the start of the battle for control of Italy's future -- and it's hard to keep the man everyone calls ""Il Cavaliere"" down for too long.","Center-left Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, 61, expected to win election .

"In a phone conversation that came as little surprise, President Barack Obama called Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper Wednesday afternoon to explain why he had rejected the Keystone oil sands pipeline project. In a statement released by Harper's office, the president is quoted as saying that the decision was not a decision based on the ""merits of the project"" and that TransCanada, the company looking to build the pipeline, could reapply for permission after a new route had been developed. The statement went on to say that Prime Minister Harper ""...expressed his profound disappointment with the news. He indicated to President Obama that he hoped that this project would continue given the significant contribution it would make to jobs and economic growth both in Canada and the United States of America."" But crucially, the statement also said that the prime minister reiterated to President Obama that Canada will continue to work to diversify its energy exports. In fact, in a sign of warming relations, Harper is scheduled to make a high-profile trip to China in February.  Canada is proposing to build a pipeline of its own through western Canada that would make oil exports to China faster and cheaper. In recent months, Harper has pushed more forcefully for the Northern Gateway pipeline project to get underway, calling it in the country's ""national interest"" as it works to develop markets other than the United States for its crude oil exports. The Gateway project, like the Keystone Pipeline proposal, is facing significant protests from environmental and community groups.","Canada's prime minister will travel to China in February .

"In 2009, Shanghai participated for the first time in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the tri-annual survey of the world's school systems. And when Shanghai's teenagers proved their math, science, and reading were much better than their peers in the United States, Germany, and Japan, the world was shocked and awed. Here, much more so than the 2008 Beijing Olympics or Shanghai's skyscrapers or China's double-digit growth, was proof positive that the future belonged to China. The latest PISA results released this week show that Shanghai schools are still number one, but, as I argued after Shanghai's first placing in 2009, the triumph comes at too great a cost. The dog-eat-dog and winner-take-all mentality of China's school system isn't just making children unhappy and unhealthy -- it's also causing cheating and bribery, leading to an unfair and unequal school system. The teachers . A tour of any Shanghai junior high school offers an easy explanation as to why Shanghai placed first on the PISA. They may be crammed and overcrowded, but the halls are clean and tidy, classrooms packed with attentive and focused students, and meeting rooms filled with university-educated and highly-motivated teachers trading notes on how to better design their 45-minute lesson. The incentives to succeed bind the school together, and guide it.  Teachers are paid about 10,000 yuan a month ($1,640), which makes them solidly middle-class in Shanghai. In their PISA performance, Shanghai's students show ""a high level of resilience,"" which is to say that poor students do better than expected. That's in large part because the Shanghai government is committed to leaving no child behind: It funds all schools equally, partners high-performing schools with low-performing ones and offers fast-track promotions to administrators who can turn around bad schools. In one Shanghai junior high school I visited, teachers stayed after school to tutor failing students -- and the head teacher there honored those teachers in school assemblies. But these teachers can drive Audis if their students do well enough on tests:  Yes, administrators can give teachers bonuses, but the real money is in grateful parents and moonlighting at for-profit cram schools (after school tutoring programs). And the head that honored teachers who tutored failing kids told me that in her experience, the best indicator of a student's school performance is his/her socio-economic background. She said the tutoring of poor kids is just a bandage, a way to get them through the system and not have them drag the school down. The parents . Because Shanghai's schools are so good, Shanghai parents have to pay -- even if it's not exorbitant tuition fees. Shanghai's real estate market is notoriously expensive, but it's downright unaffordable in the neighborhoods of Shanghai's very best public elementary schools, and when families can't use real estate to buy into the best schools, they try to bribe their way in. This culture of bribing public school officials means I can't maintain friendships, make new ones, and date -- a girl I dated in 2010 told me she'd give me 200,000 yuan ($32,800) to get her sister into my school. And because Shanghai's elementary school classrooms have 30 or 40 students, parents trip over each other in the mad rush to take teachers out to dinner and offer gifts in the hope that their only child gets a little more attention. The bribery is on top of every other advantage that Shanghai's wealthy parents have bestowed upon their only child: Weekend piano, math, and English classes, private tutoring, summer camp in America, vacations in Europe and above all a born-to-succeed attitude. The students . For the students, the race is to see who can enter Shanghai's best two universities -- Fudan University and Jiao Tong. But it's just not the prospect of a good job that drives students on. Scoring highly on tests in Shanghai is like scoring a lot of touchdowns in Texas -- it's what wins you social respect, and soon comes to define your identity and self-worth. There's substantial social science research  -- popularized in books such as Daniel Pink's Drive  --  that suggests performance-based incentives are bad for students and teachers. Incentives do not just make students stressed, lonely, and unhappy -- they also kill student's innate curiosity, creativity, and love of learning. And high-stakes testing has led to a culture of cheating in China.  Last year, when authorities tried to stop cheating, a riot broke out -- parents were angry that their children were being singled out when everyone was cheating. The best model? In the excitement over Shanghai's PISA victory we tend to forget the real lesson to be learned: How Finland can be the real model for education reform in the world. Finland, which ranked 12th in the 2012 math rankings, may not be number one, but, in my experience from visiting the country, it's succeeded in equipping all Finnish students with the tools to succeed in the knowledge economy without sacrificing their childhood, curiosity and creativity. After Shanghai children leave school at 4 p.m., they go on to cram school and do homework until bedtime. In stark contrast, when Finnish children leave school at noon, they just go play for the whole day. That Finnish students do almost as well as their Shanghai peers on PISA suggest that long school days, cram schools, and homework are not really about helping students learn -- it's more about pleasing anxious, demanding, and hyper-competitive parents. Of course, there's a rising tide of Chinese parents who care more about their child's well-being than his or her test score. And these wealthy and well-educated parents who understand the costs and sacrifices of Shanghai's PISA victory are emigrating abroad or opting for new private Western-style schools that have sprung up in major Chinese cities. That's bad news for Chinese education reform because those who are in the best position to make a stand are instead voting with their feet.","Shanghai schools came top in the OECD's internaional education rankings .
Shanghai's triumph comes at too greater cost, argues teacher Jiang Xueqin .
Cheating and bribery are problems at Chinese schools, he says.

"Lax oversight at the Internal Revenue Service allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups, resulting in lengthy delays in the processing of their applications for federal tax-exempt status, according to a report by the agency's inspector general released Tuesday. The report found that for more than 18 months beginning in early 2010 the IRS developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities, which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax-exempt status. ""The IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention,"" according to the report. President Barack Obama called the report findings ""intolerable and inexcusable."" ""The federal government must conduct itself in a way that's worthy of the public's trust, and that's especially true for the IRS. The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity.  This report shows that some of its employees failed that test,"" the president said in a statement released late Tuesday. Opinion: The real risk of the IRS scandal . Obama said he has directed U.S. Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew ""to hold those responsible for these failures accountable."" IRS officials, according to the report, did not consult anyone beyond the agency about the development of the additional screening criteria. They believed that the criteria they came up with was a screening shortcut meant to help with the influx of applications, the report said. The agency's top watchdog found that the criteria used to flag potential political applications resulted in substantial delays and the request of unnecessary information from the groups. Among the criteria used by IRS officials to flag applications was a ""Be On the Look Out"" list, or a BOLO, which was discontinued in 2012, according to the report. The criteria on the BOLO included: . -- Whether ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriots"" or ""9/12 Project"" was referenced in the case file. -- Whether the issues outlined in the application included government spending, government debt or taxes. -- Whether there was advocating or lobbying to ""make America a better place to live."" -- Whether a statement in the case file criticized how the country is being run. -- Whether it advocated education about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The investigation by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the IRS was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications. Obama struggles with rocky start to second term . ""Whether the inappropriate criterion was shorthand for all potential political cases or not, developing and using criteria that focuses on organization names and policy positions instead of the activities permitted under the Treasury regulations does not promote public confidence that tax-exempt laws are being adhered to impartially,"" the report said. The IRS welcomed the Treasury inspector general's report, saying that it agreed that aspects of its original approach in handling the influx of tax-exempt applications was inappropriate. ""The IRS is required by law to determine if organizations are engaging in a legally permissible level of political activity. Centralizing these cases was necessary to achieve consistent treatment,"" it said in a statement. The developments came hours after U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the Justice Department had launched a criminal investigation into whether the IRS politically targeted some conservative groups. ""The FBI is coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters related to the IRS,"" Holder said at a briefing. In a written response included in the report, the IRS commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents, but rather inefficient management. IRS in the spotlight: What's a 501(c)(4)? ""We believe the front-line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political and partisan viewpoint,"" the commissioner wrote. The report found that all of the applications that were sent to the Determinations Unit ""experienced substantial delays in processing."" ""Although the processing of some applications with potential significant political campaign intervention was started soon after receipt, no work was completed on the majority of these applications for 13 months,"" it said. The report's findings indicate that of the 298 cases reviewed by the IRS inspector general as potential political cases not eligible for tax exempt status: 72 contained the name ""tea party,"" 11 contained ""9/12"" and 13 contained the word ""patriots,"" according to the report. There were 202 cases that did not contain any such reference. Of those applications still open for review, 160 cases were open from 206 days to more than three years -- through two election cycles. Among the recommendations made by the Treasury inspector general: The IRS better document reasons why applications are chosen for review, develop a process to track requests for assistance, develop and provide training to employees before each election cycle and immediately resolve outstanding cases. The report also called on the Department of Treasury to develop guidelines to explain social welfare activity -- the primary factor in obtaining tax-exempt status. ""Although the IRS has taken some action, it will need to do more so that the public has reasonable assurance that applications are processed without unreasonable delay in a fair and impartial manner in the future,"" the report said. Lois Lerner, director of tax-exempt organizations for the IRS, acknowledged Friday that the IRS had targeted some groups for further review because they had those words in their names. She said the activity took place at the IRS office in Cincinnati, which handles applications for 501(c)(4) status. Opinion: IRS abuses power in targeting tea party . But documents suggest at least three other IRS offices did the same. Letters provided to CNN show IRS officials in Washington and California contacted conservative groups to demand more information before approving the groups' requests for tax-exempt status. The American Center for Law and Justice, a legal group representing numerous conservative organizations, provided CNN with four such letters: one each from IRS offices in Washington; Cincinnati; El Monte, California, and Laguna Niguel, California. The IRS did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the letters. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that he's ""confident"" no one at the White House was involved in the practice. Asked about complaints by some Republican lawmakers for the past couple of years that conservative groups were being unfairly targeted, Carney said he is ""sure some people knew about the stories. But we were not aware of any activity or any review by the inspector general."" Some Republicans criticized the president for not speaking out on the issue immediately. He said he learned about it through news reports Friday. The Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS, announced it will hold a hearing Friday. Slated to testify are Steve Miller, the acting IRS commissioner; and the Treasury inspector general investigating the complaints, J. Russell George. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations -- which he chairs -- now needs to expand an investigation already under way. That one has focused on the IRS's ""failure to enforce the law requiring that tax-exempt 501(c)4s be engaged exclusively in social welfare activities, not partisan politics,"" Levin said in a statement. The IRS' announcement about targeting of some conservative groups raises questions over its impartiality in doing so, he added.

"In many ways, shooting a engaging short video for Instagram or Twitter's Vine is harder than making a longer video. Smartphone users have become pros at arty shots of food and sunsets, but brief video clips require a different skill set. It's not easy to tell a compelling and coherent story in 6 seconds (Vine's limit) or even in 15 (Instagram's). As Instagram adds the ability to embed its photos and videos in outside blogs and websites -- a feature long requested by users -- we asked some experts for advice on how to make interesting, super-short videos. So whether you're shooting gratuitous clips of puppies or advanced stop-motion animations, here are eight tips for making your little videos as slick and shareable as possible. And do you have a creative video to show off? Tag it #cnnireport on your post. Be picky about your subject . A video takes up more of your followers' time than an image. Be discerning about what subjects are video worthy. Not everything that makes a great Instagram will translate well to video. For example, food shots are an Instagram staple, but it's harder to make a salad or bowl of pho look appetizing in motion. CNN.com video producer Brandon Ancil suggests beginners start with the tried and true: ""There is NO WAY you can mess up a mini-video with adorable subjects."" Grab the nearest dog, cat, baby, bunny, deer or grandma and record them being cute. If you're going for atmospheric shots -- leaves in the wind, waves on a beach -- don't linger too long on one shot without adding to the narrative. Brandon Loper and Jack Bibbo, filmmakers at the production company Avocados and Coconuts, recommend keeping it short or moving the story along with with a variety of shots. Plan ahead . Part of the challenge of shooting video on Vine and Instagram are the strict time limits. Another is the requirement that you shoot the videos from within the apps. There is no importing video you've already shot on either tool (though technically you could record a screen playing an existing video, but some would classify that as cheating). To make the most of these compact timeframes, plan ahead. If you're crafting a story with multiple shots, figure out what they're going to be ahead of time. On Instagram, you can delete your most recent clips, while on Vine, you have to start over. Neither tool lets you change the order of clips, so make sure you shoot in sequence. Combine shots to tell a story . It is possible to tell a story in 6 to 15 seconds. Commercials have been cramming entire narratives into 15 seconds for years. Weave in quick edits and a variety of shots by making each clip just 2 seconds long. The guys at Avocado and Coconuts recommend starting with an establishing shot. If you're doing a surfing video, you can open with a wide shot of the ocean and beach, then move to a close up of a surfboard or a sign with the name of the beach -- something that has a little more information and can move the story forward. Add some tighter shots of someone waiting for a wave, catching it, and end with a wide shot of them back on the beach. Ready, steady, go . Shooting with smartphones means your video may be shakier than usual. Both Instagram and Vine are plagued by a rash of jerky, dizzying videos filled with fast pans and constant movements. Stop moving. Set the phone down on a steady surface or, even better, mount it on a tripod. If you're holding the phone, Ancil recommends locking your arms by extending them straight in front of you to minimize movement. If you must move while shooting, walk heel to toe, rolling the foot from back to front, in order to have a smoother shot. Loper says one other option is to move with the subject, so that even if the background  or foreground are in motion, the subject stays in one place in the frame. Try. Stop. Motion. Some of the best things to come out of the short-video boom are the incredibly creative animations and stop-motion videos that people have cooked up. Vine automatically loops its 6-second videos, meaning your little creation will play over and over. This has opened up the format to a variety of innovative and weird content. To make a stop-motion video, place the camera on a tripod or otherwise secure it so that it doesn't move when you hit start and stop repeatedly. Set up your scene -- say, a ball of Play-Doh -- on a solid surface. Hit start and stop as quickly as you can, then make small, incremental changes to the scene and repeat until you've hit your time limit. A time-lapse video requires more time and patience, as well as better battery life.

There's no way to add a separate audio track in Vine or Instagram. When combining multiple shots, the ambient noise can add to the ambience of the video (ocean waves, birds, cars) or it can just come off as choppy, loud and distracting.

Personal videos of breaking news and stop motion videos have been early breakout stars of social media, but there will be a flood of groundbreaking content on Vine and Instagram in the coming year.

"Flesh-eating bacteria amputee Aimee Copeland now uses the latest technology in prosthetic hands to chop vegetables, pick up tiny items like Skittles, and comb and iron press her hair. With the bionic hands, Copeland is looking forward to cleaning her house -- she's a neat freak, she tells CNN -- and cooking her own food. She's something of a foodie but has been able to eat only microwaveable foods, she adds. ""I really want to be able to get back in the kitchen and start cooking some delicious vegetarian meals for myself,"" she said as she used the hands in a demonstration for media outlets this week. ""It just mimics so well a natural hand that it really just reminds me of before the accident, how I would have done things,"" she added. ""I never thought I would actually be able to hold a knife and cut something. That's just incredible."" Family counters flesh-eating bacteria with faith . The ""i-limb ultra revolution"" hands can cost up to $120,000 each, said a spokesman for manufacturer Touch Bionics. Copeland demonstrated the prosthetic hands at the firm's office in Hilliard, Ohio, showing how hand positions can also be remotely set with an iPad application using a blue-tooth connection. The ""bioism"" software can also be downloaded to an iPhone and iPod, the spokesman said. On May 1, 2012, Copeland, a University of West Georgia graduate student, was outdoors with friends at the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta when the homemade zip line she was holding snapped. She fell and got a gash in her leg that required 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Doctors performed amputations to save her life. She lost parts of all limbs: her hands, a leg and a foot. After the surgery, her family home in Snellville, just east of Atlanta, added a 1,956-square-foot ""Aimee's Wing,"" donated by a builder. In other upcoming milestones, Copeland, whose story raised the nation's awareness of flesh-eating bacteria, will receive a service dog this summer, when she will work with amputee children in a wilderness camp. She is hoping to receive a prosthetic leg later this year as well. Walking will be a dream come true, she said. Copeland is working to complete her master's degree before the end of the year.

"Territorial tensions between China and Japan have flared after a close encounter between their military jets in disputed airspace over the East China Sea. The neighboring rivals accused each other of potentially triggering a dangerous incident, after two pairs of Chinese fighter jets were scrambled and flew unprecedentedly close to a Japanese OP-3C surveillance plane and a YS-11EB electronic intelligence aircraft Saturday. The fly-bys occurred in airspace claimed by both countries as part of their ""air defense identification zones,"" while China carried out joint maritime exercises with Russia at the weekend. Japan claims the flights were part of a routine reconnaissance mission near a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both nations, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. Meanwhile, China's Ministry of National Defense described the move as a justified enforcement of the country's air defense zone. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it was the closest that Chinese jets had come to Japanese aircraft -- passing about 30 meters from one plane and 50 meters from another. ""We believe this proximity and behavior does not follow common sense,"" he said. He said the flight crews reported the Chinese planes were armed with missiles. ""The crews were on edge as they responded."" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Monday that Japan had lodged a protest to China through diplomatic channels over the incident. ""This should never happen,"" he said. Beyond meeting the Japanese aircraft, the Chinese jets took no further action, and the Japanese pilots returned to base. READ MORE: China's 'air defense identification zone,' explained . In response, a statement from China's Ministry of National Defense blamed Japan for the incident, saying that the Chinese and Russian navies had issued ""no-fly"" notices in the area ahead of the maritime drill. According to the statement, carried by Chinese state media, the ministry had since lodged a complaint with Japan and called on it to ""stop all surveillance and interference activities."" ""Otherwise, all the consequences that might be caused will be borne by the Japanese side,"" read the statement. Tensions in recent years over China's increasingly assertive stance towards territorial claims escalated in November when it unilaterally declared an ""air defense identification zone,"" or ADIZ, that included stretches of disputed territory. An ADIZ is essentially a buffer zone outside a country's sovereign airspace, in which nations request that approaching aircraft identify themselves. The United States and Japan have both declared such zones around their territories. Both countries immediately challenged China's declaration of its ADIZ in November, with the United States sending two unarmed B-52 bombers through the airspace without notifying Chinese authorities. The disputed island standoff regularly sees the coast guards of China and Japan tail each other around the island chain. While the islands are uninhabited, their ownership would allow for exclusive oil, mineral, and fishing rights in surrounding waters, and their status has been a regular flashpoint in Sino-Japanese relations.

"SANTIAGO, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- This Caribbean city already known for cigars, furniture, chocolate and coffee may become a magnet for Americans seeking controversial stem cell therapy for life-threatening illnesses if a Florida cardiologist has his way. Dr. Zannos Grekos, a Florida cardiologist, says he's had success with stem-cell therapy in the Dominican Republic. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved this stem cell therapy in the United States because no clinical trials to prove its effectiveness have been done. But Dr. Zannos Grekos says his company, Regenocyte Therapeutic, has successfully used adult stem cells to treat patients with heart and lung disease. Grekos said he and his associates draw blood from a patient in Florida and then send it to a laboratory in Israel that produces what his company calls ""regenocytes."" The company defines regenocyte as ""a stem cell that has been activated to become a target organ."" ""These procedures work,"" he told CNN, standing inside a hospital room at the Clinica Union Medica del Norte in Santiago. ""And it's substantiated by objective data that we are collecting."" But Grekos' procedures have not been reviewed by other researchers, and leading scientists involved in U.S. stem cell research efforts say Grekos is simply wrong. Dr. Irving Weissman, president-elect of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, told CNN, ""There is no such cell. There is nothing called a 'regenocyte.' "" ""As a stem cell scientist who works in the field of regenerative stem cells, I am disappointed and shocked that somebody would prey on a family that has an untreatable disease with the promise of a therapy that has no scientific or medical basis,"" Weissman said. Grekos has a busy practice in Bonita Springs, Florida, outside Naples, and runs a company that promotes and administers stem cell therapies in Santiago, a noisy, crowded industrial city in the central Dominican Republic. He told CNN that in the past 18 months, about 100 patients have received adult stem cell therapy at a Dominican hospital. Most of them have been patients with severe heart disease, while the rest have suffered from chronic lung illnesses, he said. He said the Israeli laboratories can produce between 40 million and 80 million stem cells from a patient's blood sample. ""Then they also activate them and educate them to become the end organ to any tissues we are looking to regenerate,"" Grekos said. Grekos said he makes no promise of results to his patients. He is collecting data from his procedures and has been in contact with a Florida hospital to independently review his findings, but that hasn't happened yet, he said. He said he wants to present his data to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of 2009, then ask the federal agency to accelerate its approval process. But Weissman said the FDA will not accept data from a physician if the doctor has a financial interest in the outcome. ""It is simply not done,"" he said. The procedure is costly. Grekos said he charges $64,500 -- none of it covered by insurance. He said the cost is driven by the expense of processing the stem cells, and providing clean rooms and couriers who hand-carry the cells to Israel and back. A year ago, Barbara McKean of Naples, Florida, paid Regenocyte Therapeutic more than $54,000 for stem cell therapy in the Dominican Republic after suffering from chronic lung disease. She said she believes the therapy was worth the expense. ""Right away, the next morning, I felt a sense of well-being that I hadn't felt in a long, long time,"" McKean said. ""I know that I am living proof that this does work,"" she added. ""I know that."" McKean's family physician, Dr. Robert Folsom, confirmed to CNN that she had been suffering for many years from an advanced state of COPD, an incurable lung disease. Folsom told CNN he was ""quite incredulous"" after seeing her condition improve. The chief medical officer of the American Lung Association, Dr. Norman Edelman, said he does not doubt the sincerity of patients who believe they have been helped by stem cell therapy. But he added, ""There's an enormous placebo effect in almost all of these cases."" ""I have looked for the scientific efficacy of this approach, and can find none,"" Edelman said. Folsom, who said he has been McKean's family physician for many years, disputed any suggestion that her apparent recovery stemmed from a ""placebo effect"" -- an improvement sometimes seen in patients who are given an inert substance in clinical trials. ""I know about the placebo effect, and her improvement does not seem to be a result of that,"" he said. Grekos said his patients ""are getting better"" under his treatment, but he has not yet applied for clinical trials in the United States because of the high cost. He shrugs off the criticism from people who doubt his claims, saying he -- and not they -- are on medicine's cutting edge. Stem cell experts who reject his methods ""need to be better educated,"" he said.","Florida cardiologist is administering stem cell therapy in Dominican Republic .

"When we think of terminal cancer patients, we don't imagine someone like Brittany Maynard. She is 29 years old. In photos from her wedding, and in snapshots of her boating and rock climbing, she looks young, vigorous and happy. And yet soon, according to her own self-imposed schedule, she will take a handful of pills that will end her life. Since revealing her plans on a website and in a column this week for CNN, the Oregon woman has become the new poster child for the ""death with dignity"" movement, which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms. Maynard is one of a small but growing fraternity of such people in the United States and, due to her age, one of the most unusual. There were 71 physician-assisted deaths last year in Oregon, one of five states where the practice is legal. The median age of those people was 71, and none was under 35. Since Oregon passed its Death with Dignity Act in 1997, fewer than 1% of its 752 doctor-assisted deaths have been people Maynard's age. In neighboring Washington, where physician-assisted death has been legal since 2009, 3% of those patients who died last year were under 45. ""It is extremely rare. Luckily, it's very rare for young people to get a terminal illness in the first place,"" said Katrina Hedberg, state health officer and epidemiologist with the Oregon Public Health Division. ""A lot of times people think if you don't look sick from the outside then you must not be. And that's not always the case."" Maynard was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in January, barely a year after she and her husband were married. After several surgeries, doctors said in April that her brain tumor had returned and gave her about six months to live. She moved from California to Oregon to take advantage of that state's law and says she plans to end her life soon after her husband's October 26 birthday. Since being posted Monday to YouTube, a video detailing Maynard's decision has more than 3 million views. News outlets everywhere have reported her story, which has sparked online discussions around humans' right to choose how we die. ""Because (Maynard) is young and vibrant and articulate, she has generated a lot of attention,"" said George Eighmey, a board member of the Death with Dignity National Center, which advocates for physician-assisted death for terminal patients. In recent days the center has received calls from around the country, he said, including from people with illnesses who want to move to Oregon. Three states -- Oregon, Washington and Vermont -- have ""death with dignity"" laws that allow terminally ill, mentally competent residents to voluntarily request and receive prescription drugs to hasten their death. Judicial decisions in two other states, Montana and New Mexico, authorize doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses in such circumstances, although the rulings haven't become state law. When assisted suicide is not the answer . Under Oregon's law, doctors treating ""death with dignity"" patients prescribe doses of barbiturates, Hedberg said. The patients then decide on their own whether to take them, and when. Oregon public health records show the pills typically render a patient unconscious in a few minutes, with a median time of 25 minutes between ingestion and death. The so-called ""death with dignity"" movement is opposed by many religious and right-to-life groups, which consider it assisted suicide. But polls have shown that most Americans support having a say in how they die, especially if the process is described not as doctors helping a patient ""commit suicide"" but as ending a patient's life ""by some painless means."" ""I think there is something of a movement here,"" Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at NYU's Langone Medical Center, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""When you push Americans to say, 'Do you want choice on this matter?' I think a lot of them are going to say yes."" When surveyed about why they wished to end their life, Oregon's terminally ill patients said they most feared losing their autonomy as their illnesses worsened. Maynard may feel the same way. ""I've had the medication for weeks. I am not suicidal. If I were, I would have consumed that medication long ago. I do not want to die. But I am dying. And I want to die on my own terms,"" she wrote on CNN.com. ""Having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important. It has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear, uncertainty and pain.""","Brittany Maynard, 29, plans to take medication soon that will end her life .

"It was a simple ceremony on the northern bank of Washington's Tidal Basin, attended by only a few people. First lady Helen Taft and Viscountess Chinda, wife of the Japanese ambassador to the United States, planted two Yoshino cherry trees, part of a gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Japan to the United States. One hundred years later, those two trees -- still standing -- and thousands more will be at the center of Washington's annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, starting March 20 and continuing through April 27. Diplomats still honor the friendship symbolized by the gift of the cherry trees. At press conference Thursday, Kazuhide Ishikawa, the charge d'affaires of the Embassy of Japan, emphasized his country's commitment to   ""deepening our bond and friendship for another 100 years."" Nature may cooperate with the festival schedule this year: A National Park Service official predicted the peak of the blossoming will be between March 24 and 31, when 70% of the buds will open. The buds usually last 10 to 14 days. The Japanese traditionally celebrate the spring blossoming of the flowering cherry trees, and the Japanese government and citizens have made many gifts of cherry trees to welcoming cities around the world. Wherever cherry trees thrive and are beloved, look for cherry blossom festivals as an annual rite of spring. (Whether or not nature's calendar will coincide with the festivals is always an unknown.) Washington . The U.S. capital's first festival was held in 1927 and lasted three days, featuring schoolchildren doing a tree-planting re-enactment. The event became two weeks long in 1994, and this year there will be five weeks of food, arts, cultural and outdoors events in honor of the 100th anniversary of the gift of the trees. The Liaison Capitol Hill is offering room rates starting at $199 that include a commemorative cherry blossom branch (legally supplied by the hotel), a box of chocolates, picnic goodies and Metro passes. The hotel's restaurant, Art and Soul, is owned by renowned chef Art Smith, known as personal chef to Oprah Winfrey and ""Top Chef Masters""contestant. Other hotels around Washington and suburban Virginia and Maryland are offering cherry blossom and springtime package deals. Call (877) 44BLOOM (887-442-5666) or go online to book a reservation. Brooklyn, New York . The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which claims a more diverse collection of Japanese flowering cherries in one place than anywhere in the world outside Japan, celebrates cherry blossom season April 1-29. The four weeks of Hanami, the Japanese tradition of experiencing every moment of the cherry blossoming process, include weekend tours of the garden's Japanese plant collections and specialty gardens, and a packed weekend of celebrations April 28-29. San Francisco . San Francisco's Japantown will host the 45th annual Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival, including food, culture, martial arts and music, on April 14-15 and April 21-22. The pageant to choose the Cherry Blossom Queen and her court will be held April 14. The festival will recognize the one-year anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Festival organizers will also pay tribute to the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the Military Intelligence Service, comprised mostly of Japanese Americans who fought in World War II. The 442nd (which absorbed the 100th in 1944) became the most highly decorated unit for its size and length of service. Vancouver, British Columbia . Leave it to Vancouver to organize a Cherry Blossom Umbrella Flash Mob Dance on April 14, complete with a pink festival umbrella (if you register for the umbrella and a gift bundle costing $10). Details about the in-person rehearsal and an instructional video are online. The dance is but one part of the city's annual Cherry Blossom Festival, to be held April 5-28. Vancouver, which has more than 40,000 cherry trees gracing its streets, officially welcomes spring with this month-long celebration of the cherry blossom. The festival includes dance, demonstrations by Japanese chefs, haiku, painting and outdoor events. The city began planting cherry trees in significant numbers in the early 1930s after the mayors of Kobe and Yokohama presented Vancouver with 500 Japanese cherry trees to honor Japanese Canadians who served in World War I. Fukuoka, Japan . The most dedicated of cherry blossom lovers will head to Japan to celebrate the blossom as the Japanese do. Japan travel expert Duff Trimble lived in Fukuoka for three years and spent a lot of time running and biking in Maizuru Park and Ohori Park, where cherry trees blossom. ""The ruins of Fukuoka Castle had the more typical concentration of cherry trees on top of the ruins and was one of the most popular cherry blossom-viewing areas in Fukuoka,"" says Trimble, whose Toronto-based Wabi-Sabi Japan runs custom-guided Japan adventures. ""During the hanami (flower viewing) season, it was full of revelers celebrating the onset of spring. These hanami parties are always quite boisterous."" Trimble would often continue from Maizuru Park into Ohori Park, which also had a number of cherry blossom trees in the spring. For lodging, Trimble recommends the Grand Hyatt Fukuoka, the traditional Hotel Okura and With the Style, a boutique hotel.","U.S. capital celebrates 100 years of cherry blossoms .

"(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the ""invisible life"" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday. E. Lynn Harris touched fans with his courage and his kindness, friends say. Harris, 54, died Thursday night while on a business trip to Los Angeles, California, said Laura Gilmore, his publicist. Harris wrote a series of novels that exposed readers to characters rarely depicted in literature: black, affluent gay men who were masculine, complex and, sometimes, tormented. Keith Boykin, an author and friend, said Harris encouraged the black community to talk openly about homosexuality. ""We have a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy in the black community,"" Boykin said. ""E. Lynn Harris encouraged people to ask and to tell."" How Harris broke ground . In books like ""Invisible Life,"" ""A Love of My Own,"" and his New York Times best-selling memoir, ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,"" Harris virtually invented a new genre: books that depicted black gay men living double lives. Though Harris wrote primarily about black gay men, some of his biggest fans were black women. His books became staples in black beauty salons, bookstores and book clubs. ""It was hard to go on a subway in places in New York or D.C. and not see some black woman reading an E. Lynn Harris novel,"" Boykin said. Harris was an unlikely literary pioneer. He was a former IBM executive who decided to write about his life. He started off in 1991 selling books from the trunk of his car to African-American beauty salons and bookstores. He eventually became one of the nation's most popular writers with an estimated 4 million of his books in print. Tina McElroy Ansa, author of ""Taking After Mudear,"" met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book ""Invisible Life."" She said they were both so poor they only had enough money to buy each other's book. Ansa said she took Harris' ""Invisible Life"" home and was stunned by the time she reached page 20. She came across a scene where Harris depicted two black men playing in the snow with one another. She immediately dropped the book, called Harris and told him she had never read such a scene before. ""I had never seen homosexual love in African-American men portrayed that way,"" she says. ""It was playful, loving, and it wasn't hidden."" Years later, when Harris became successful, he thanked Ansa for her early encouragement. ""He gave me a string of pearls,"" Ansa said. In 2000, Harris told the magazine Entertainment Weekly how important ""Invisible Life"" was for him. ''When I wrote ""Invisible Life,"" it had to be the first book out of me -- it helped me to deal with my own sexuality,'' Harris said. ""'For me, my 20s and early 30s were spent just hiding and running, because there was no one to tell me that my life had value and the way I felt was okay.'' Standing room only at his book events . ""It's heartbreaking; he had such a generous spirit,"" said Tananarive Due, author of ""Blood Colony."" ""When I was just starting out, he flew me to an event out of his own pocket and put me up just because he thought more people should know my work,"" Due said. Harris was as generous with his fans as he was with his friends, some said. They describe an author who held dinner parties for aspiring writers at his home, loved meeting and hugging fans at book readings, and never seemed to let his fame change him. ""You could get trampled at an E. Lynn Harris reading,"" Ansa said. ""People loved him."" Due said Harris would answer up to 200 e-mails from his fans each day. She said Harris had been a cheerleader in college ""and a spirit of joy followed him through his life."" ""He genuinely loved being around people and remembered names,"" Due said. ""I remember seeing him at an event in Florida, and one woman in the crowd raised her hand and he said, 'Oh, Mary, you were here for my hardcover book signing.'"" Nonetheless, Harris had his share of personal pain. He was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas. In his 2003 memoir, he wrote about enduring abuse by his stepfather and an attempted suicide in 1990. And he had critics. Some said Harris was a mediocre writer who stumbled on a winning literary formula. Boykin says Harris was stung by some of the criticism. ""He always said 'I'm not a James Baldwin,'"" Boykin said, referring to the openly gay black author from the 1960s. ""He was writing accessible literature for the masses."" Boykin said Harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics, but people within the black community. ""He was hurt by some of the criticism from some black gay men who felt he wasn't portraying them accurately and others who thought he was telling too much,"" Boykin said. In a 2003 Detroit Free Press interview, Harris said he resisted becoming an advocate for gay rights. ""It's such a small part of who I am, "" he said. ""It's what I do when I'm with my partner that puts this label on me. Most of my friends are straight. I tend to have a regular life, if you will."" Due said there has traditionally been a lot of pain associated with homosexuality in the black community. Harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books. ""He really helped let the air in,"" Due said. ""He helped us all breathe a little better.""","Pioneering author broke taboos in the black community .

"(CNN) -- In his youth, Ronald Lindsey planned to enter the priesthood, so fervent was his devotion to God. But these days, Lindsay is devoted to protecting a person's right to ridicule, criticize -- even lambaste God. Super Bowl Sunday Praying for a Hail Mary was painted by  Dana Ellyn. You might say he is a blasphemer's savior. The devout Catholic turned non-believer leads a movement that is all about protecting people's rights to speak irreverently about religion. Criticizing God is an act punishable by death in several nations. In America, blasphemy laws remain on the books in six states, though they are largely arcane and not enforced. But everywhere, it seems to Lindsay, scoffing at God is not socially acceptable. People are willing to tolerate the harshest statements about the president of the United States, he said. But talk about Jesus or Mohammed -- that's a whole different ball game. ""We think religious beliefs should be subject to examination and criticism just as political beliefs are,"" said Lindsay, 56, who heads the Center for Inquiry in Amherst, New York, an organization that claims about 100,000 followers worldwide. ""But we have a taboo on religion."" Outraged by nations that want to execute blasphemers and propelled by a deep belief in the freedom of expression, Lindsay is forging ahead with his ""nothing is sacred"" movement. Wednesday marks the first organized observance of Blasphemy Day, a series of events, exhibits and lectures unfolding in a host of mostly North American cities that are part of a larger Campaign for Free Expression. The day coincides with the fifth anniversary of a Danish newspaper's publication of controversial cartoons about Mohammed. The depictions of the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse sparked protests by Muslims worldwide and prompted media outlets to censor themselves. But to Lindsay, a society is not truly free unless people can freely air their views on any subject -- including God. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, when asked about the day on Wednesday, declined to comment. Blasphemy Day even includes a contest that invites participants to come up with slogans that might be judged blasphemous by society. And, yes, the winner gets a T-shirt heralding the prized slogan. Lindsay offered this sample: ""There's nothing wrong with God that a dose of reality won't cure."" Some of the entries are so crude they can't be published by CNN. But since the Center for Inquiry is all about freedom of expression, it can't reject any of them. Lindsay has made it clear that expletive-ridden, crass slogans are not the type of entry that is destined to win, but he makes no apologies for statements that might offend a devout person's sensitivities. Neither does artist Dana Ellyn, 38, of Washington D.C., who is showing her provocative paintings of God and religion in a special Blasphemy Day show Wednesday evening. Ellyn grew up as a non-believer but later studied religion on her own to understand it. After all, she said, it's such an important part of society. She found the concept of faith fascinating. It was an unknown to her. She painted a scene from Noah's Ark with a black child sitting under the table. How did the races evolve, her art asks those who believed in the Biblical tale? She portrayed Jesus painting his crucifixion nails after she noticed a church group using space next to a nail salon in a shopping mall stung by recession. She said she realizes her work makes people uncomfortable, though her intent is not to disrespect. ""Even to say, 'I don't believe in God' is enough to knock someone out of their chair and then to see it in a picture ... I've had a lot of hate come my way."" And even though she doesn't believe in hell, she feels a bit uneasy hearing that she is going straight to it. ""I am in no way trying to be a poster child for atheism,"" Ellyn said. ""But I don't want to be punished for not believing in God."" Ellyn said she never means to harm anyone, so she finds it frightening that someone could be punished -- or lose their life -- over remarks or actions considered blasphemous. An Afghan student journalist was sentenced to death for distributing a paper that allegedly blasphemed Islam. A British schoolteacher spent time in a Sudanese jail after she allowed her students to name teddy bears after Mohammed. These are cases that worry Lindsay and the members of his organization. He is most distressed by the U.N. General Assembly considering next month a binding resolution on the defamation of religion. All this did not come easy to Lindsay, the son of Catholic parents who bared his soul in a confession booth each week. Later, he studied religion and philosophy in at Georgetown University. The more he read, the more he questioned beliefs that had been ingrained from childhood. Slowly, the would-be-priest turned into an atheist lawyer -- and a 21st-century defender of time-worn sacrilege.","Wednesday marks first organized observance of Blasphemy Day .

"(CNN) -- World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko knocked out U.S. challenger Eddie Chambers with five seconds remaining in the 12th and final round to defend his IBF, WBO and IBO titles. The Saturday bout in Duesseldorf, Germany, was the 33-year-old Ukrainian's fifth defense of his WBO and IBF titles. Chambers went down for at least two minutes after receiving Klitschko's left hook to the right temple, according to CNNSI's Bryan Armen Graham round-by-round blog of the fight.

"(CNN) -- With the World Series on the line, radio stations in San Francisco aren't taking any chances. Starting Tuesday the San Francisco Giants will face off against the Kansas City Royals in baseball's championship series, and two local radio stations decided they'd send a message. ""No offense, Lorde, but for the duration of the World Series, KFOG Radio will be a ""Royals""-free zone,"" the radio station posted on it's Facebook page. ""We're sure you understand."" 7 reasons why Kansas City's a winner . Lorde, the 17-year-old pop star from New Zealand, won a song of the year Grammy earlier this year for her No. 1 hit, ""Royals."" KOIT said its ban was prompted by listener complaints. ""So @965KOIT banned the Lorde song Royals? That's awesome!"" tweeted someone known as The Sassy PETIT. But not everyone thinks the ban rules. Louis Vargas opined on KFOG's Facebook page that the ban will make no difference in the series outcome, calling the move absurd. Tony Last complained that the song doesn't actually have ""anything to do with the opposing team."" Others commented that the lyrics actually seem to be anti-Royals. ""We'll never be royals,"" Lorde sings. ""It ddn't run in our blood."" Still others, not caught up in the love affair, greeted the announcement with more of a shrug. ""Isn't that song so last year?"" commented Jennifer Farr Hutchison on KFOG's Facebook page. ""Feel free to make that a permanent policy,"" wrote an apparent ""Royals"" hater. The Kiwi sensation may be banned in the Bay Area, but in Kansas City they're letting her rule their airwaves. Kansas City's 99.7 The Point put out a plans to play ""Royals"" at the top of every hour on the opening night of the World Series.

"Vinnie Marino grew up in the 1960s and says a ""restlessness"" drew him to reading about Buddhism, practicing yoga and eating a vegetarian diet. But, while in high school, he also found drugs. After dropping out of college, he moved to San Francisco, where, he says, ""My first week there I was introduced to shooting cocaine."" Eventually, heroin helped calm his ""crazy cocaine brain."" He stayed in the downward spiral for years before fighting to get clean. Here are five questions for Marino: . CNN: You started doing yoga as a teenager when you were living in New York, but you didn't really get serious about it until you moved to Los Angeles. What happened? Vinnie Marino: When I lived in Manhattan, I would jog around Washington Square Park, dreading each lap. I was never a good jock, but yoga just felt so intense. There was a soft side and a strong side to it and a spiritual feeling around it. It really felt like it embodied my whole thing. So I started going to a few vinyasa flow and power flow classes in Los Angeles. There was music at some of them, and it was really physically challenging. It just kept calling me back. I didn't dread it like, ""Oh, no, I've got to go the gym tomorrow."" I know people who love the gym, and they go, and it's a great thing for them. That was just never my experience, but with yoga, I was excited about it, and I just kept on doing it. CNN: You weren't sure if you could make a career out of it, though. Then came a pivotal moment. What was it like teaching your first class? Marino: I did a lot of teacher trainings. I was studying Iyengar Yoga, and I just resisted teaching as much as I loved it. A friend of mine was teaching at a gym in Hollywood, and he said there were like three students that came. It was in an air-conditioned room at seven in the morning. He said, ""I'm going away. Will you please teach for me?"" I said, ""Absolutely not. I will not. Cannot."" He said, ""I'm going away. You have to teach for me."" So I went and did it. Then, I was at another class at the gym I belonged to, and the teacher didn't show up. There were a whole bunch of students in the room, and they said, ""You should teach! You're good at it, and you're always here."" So I it did it again, and it was fun. Then it just started unfolding for me. I started substitute teaching at Yoga Works for Shiva Rea and Seane Corn and Eric Schiffmann, which is really funny. These are big names in yoga. It was really funny at the time. CNN: I've heard you ask in class, ""Who knows about the past or the future? Ram Dass said it all with 'Be here now.' "" How did this become your philosophy? Marino: The older I get, the more I become aware of the fact that life doesn't stop when bad things happen. You still go to work. You still function, for the most part. I'm around a lot of people every day -- and I'm aware, from knowing these people year after year, that when some people disappear, I'm like, ""Wow, I wonder where they went."" Then they come back and tell me their husband died, they're living with their family -- or ""I got a divorce,"" ""I've been on cancer treatment."" There are just so many things you don't actually see when you see a person, even if they appear healthy and strong and beautiful, which there's a lot of in L.A. CNN: In fact, you say you've been drawn to Buddhism because they don't ""rainbow-color"" everything and simply encourage people to think good thoughts. Why do you so strongly believe in this mentality? Marino: Underneath everything, we're all in this human predicament. In Buddhism, they talk about, inherently in life, there's suffering. There are a lot of people here in L.A. who have it all right now. So if you see someone and say, ""Wow, they have a great career, tons of money; they're beautiful,"" there's almost a sadness in knowing that's not going to last forever. Even if by some stroke of luck, whatever it is, you have an amazing life and nothing bad ever happens to you, you know that sooner or later, you're going to pass away, and everyone you love is, too. There's suffering in that. CNN: From everything you've gone through, what's your message to anyone who's trying to live well? Marino: Enjoy right now and be as kind to others as you can. A message that transcends every religion and spirituality is to be of service. Whatever it looks like in your life, as minimal or as big as it could be, people of service are usually happier because when you're of service, you realize you're a part of a whole. They talk about this because people that live the longest feel like they're connected to a community. Whatever community that is, there's some connection that someone cares about. You care about them, and that makes our hearts beat. That makes us desire to get up and keep going.","Vinnie Marino struggled with drug addiction for years .

"Empowered Patient is a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that helps put you in the driver's seat when it comes to health care. Studies have shown that acupuncture can ease pain, but researchers aren't sure of the exact mechanism. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Dr. Andrew Weil wasn't sure exactly how he hurt his knee; all he knew was that it was painful. But instead of turning to cortisone shots or heavy doses of pain medication, Weil turned to the ancient Chinese medicine practice of acupuncture. ""It worked -- my knee felt much better,"" says Weil. Americans spend billions of dollars each year on alternative medicine, everything from chiropractic care to hypnosis. Weil says alternative medicine can work wonders -- acupuncture, certain herbs, guided imagery. For example, Dr. Brian Berman, director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, has done a series of studies showing acupuncture's benefits for osteoarthritis of the knee. Extensive studies have also been done on mind-body approaches such as guided imagery, and on some herbs, including St. John's wort. But on the other hand, there also is a lot of quackery out there, Weil says. ""I've seen it all, [including] products that claim to increase sexual vigor, cure cancer and allay financial anxiety."" So how do you know what works and what doesn't when it comes to alternative medicine? Just a decade ago, there weren't many well-done, independent studies on herbs, acupuncture, massage or hypnosis, so patients didn't have many facts to guide them. But in 1999, eight academic medical centers, including Harvard, Duke and Stanford, banded together with the purpose of encouraging research and education on alternative medicine. Eight years later, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine has 38 member universities, and has gathered evidence about what practices have solid science behind them. Here, from experts at five of those universities, are five alternative medicine practices that are among the most promising because they have solid science behind them. 1. Acupuncture for pain . Hands, down, this was the No. 1 recommendation from our panel of experts. They also recommended acupuncture for other problems, including nausea after surgery and chemotherapy. 2. Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B6 for PMS . When pre-menstrual syndrome rears its ugly head, gynecologist Dr. Tracy Gaudet encourages her patients to take these dietary supplements. ""They can have a huge impact on moodiness, bloating, and on heavy periods,"" says Gaudet, who's the executive director of Duke Integrative Medicine at Duke University Medical School. 3. St. John's Wort for depression . The studies are a bit mixed on this one, but our panel of experts agreed this herb -- once thought to rid the body of evil spirits - is definitely promising. ""It's worth a try for mild to moderate depression,"" says Weil, founder and director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona. ""Remember it will take six to eight weeks to see an effect."" Remember, too, that St. John's wort can interfere with some medicines; the University of Maryland Medical Center has a list. 4. Guided imagery for pain and anxiety . ""Go to your happy place"" has become a cliché, but our experts say it really works. The technique, of course, is more complicated than that. ""In guided imagery we invite you to relax and focus on breathing and transport you mentally to a different place,"" says Mary Jo Kreitzer, Ph.D., R.N., founder and director of the Center for Spirituality and Healing at the University of Minnesota. There's a guided imagery demo at the University of Minnesota's Web site. 5. Glucosamine for joint pain . ""It's safe, and it looks like it's effective,"" says Dr. Frederick Hecht, director of research at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. ""It may be the first thing that actually reverses cartilage loss in osteoarthritis."" All our experts warn that since alternative medicine is financially lucrative, a lot of charlatans have gotten into the business. They have these tips for being a savvy shopper: . 1. Look for ""USP"" or ""NSF"" on the labels . ""The biggest mistake people make is they don't get a good product,"" says Dr. Mary Hardy, medical director of the Sims/Mann-UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology. She says the stamp of approval from the United States Pharmacopoeia or NSF International, two groups with independent verification programs, means what's on the label is in the product. 2. Find a good practitioner . Make sure the alternative medicine practitioner you're going to is actually trained to practice alternative medicine. One place to start is the Consortium for Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine . 3. Be wary of crazy claims . ""Anything that sounds too good to be true probably is,"" says Weil. And once you do start on your journey with alternative medicine, here's a piece of advice: Take it slow. Alternative medicine works, but sometimes not as quickly as taking a drug. ""I tell people it's going to take a while,"" says Hardy. ""I tell them to do a six- to eight-week trial, or even 12 weeks."" E-mail to a friend . Elizabeth Cohen is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.","A number of alternative medical practices have solid science behind them .

"(CNN) -- A Florida death-row inmate convicted of abducting and murdering 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in 2005 has died, prison officials said Wednesday. John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005. John Evander Couey, 51, died at 11:15 a.m. ET of natural causes, a Florida Department of Corrections spokeswoman told CNN. He had been taken to a Jacksonville, Florida, hospital from Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida. Because of privacy laws, no further information could be released by the Department of Corrections. A source close to the case told CNN that Couey's death was not unexpected and he had been ill for some time. ""I never dreamed it would happen like this,"" Jessica's father, Mark Lunsford, told CNN. He said he never thought he would live long enough to see Couey put to death because of the lengthy appeals process. He said he was sad when he heard the news of Couey's death. ""To me, death is sad,"" he said. ""But her death, Jessie's death, has been redeemed ... I'm relieved. I'm glad it's over with."" Couey was sentenced to die in August 2007 for abducting and raping Lunsford, then killing her by burying her alive. The girl was snatched from her bed in her family's Homosassa, Florida, home the evening of February 23, 2005, by Couey, a registered sex offender. Her body was found three weeks later, buried at the home of Couey's half-sister, who lived within sight of the Lunsford home. The girl's body was wrapped in plastic garbage bags, and her hands were bound with speaker wire. She was clutching a stuffed dolphin -- a toy won for her at a state fair by her father, and which Couey allowed her to bring with her when she was abducted. ""I am not shedding any tears,"" the girl's grandmother, Ruth Lunsford, said on Wednesday. ""I don't feel sorry for him. I think God said, 'John Couey, it's time to go.' "" ""I don't feel sorry for him that he had to suffer,"" she said. ""He didn't have any mercy on my granddaughter when he murdered her. I'm glad we didn't have to wait years and years for his appeals and execution, and the taxpayers no longer have to pay for him. I'm glad that God took a hand in it."" Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy, who led the investigation into the girl's death, told reporters he wished Couey could have faced the death sentence handed down by the jury. ""I know he didn't suffer the way Jessie did when he killed her,"" Dawsy said. ""I'm sorry I won't get to look him in the eyes as he died, but I'm relieved to know he'll never hurt another child again."" Authorities believe Lunsford was kept for several days before she was killed. Her blood was found on a mattress in the home where Couey was living, her fingerprints also were discovered at the location. During the search for the girl, as authorities and hundreds of volunteers combed Citrus County, north of Tampa, police twice visited that home. ""Couey's timeline after he kidnapped Jessica Lunsford leaves open the possibility that she was alive, and in the house, at the time of the first and possibly the second interview,"" according to a prosecution memo in the case. In sentencing Couey, Judge Ric Howard noted Couey became fearful of police dogs being used in the area in the search for the girl. He told Lunsford he was planning to take her home, but did not want her to be seen, and so persuaded her to get into a trash bag. He then knotted another trash bag over her head, placed her in a hole and shoveled dirt on top of her. Jurors convicted Couey of first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual battery on a child under 12 in March 2007. Howard, at Couey's sentencing, brought many in the courtroom to tears as he discussed how the girl died slowly as her oxygen ran out. A medical examiner testified she could have been alive as much as five minutes, or even longer, before she lost consciousness, Howard said. ""He caused a slow, suffering, conscious death,"" Howard said of Couey. ""Her only source of comfort during this horrific experience was her purple dolphin."" Another horrific detail the judge noted: The girl was able to poke several fingers through the innermost trash bag covering her before she died. The judge also noted that Couey made ""crude, vulgar and repulsive"" comments to police after his arrest regarding his sexual assault of the girl, and the judge quoted Couey as saying the media was blowing the case out of proportion -- ""This kind of thing happens every day."" Lunsford's slaying sparked national outrage and led to stricter Florida laws regarding registration and supervision of released sexual predators, following a push led largely by her father, Mark Lunsford. Although Lunsford's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child-protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses, Mark Lunsford said at the time of Couey's sentencing the law does not go far enough. On Wednesday, Mark Lunsford told CNN he is a Christian and he believes he will see his daughter again. In a jailhouse phone call before his sentencing, Couey told a woman described as his aunt he expected the death penalty. ""I kick myself in the butt a hundred times a day,"" he said. ""Stupidity ... Just trying to figure out, I'm just asking myself, 'Why was you so stupid?' "" ""Well, none of us are perfect,"" the woman said, ""and the drugs didn't help any."" ""No, that was a big problem,"" Couey said. ""Drugs, alcohol."" Speaking after Couey's sentencing, Mark Lunsford referenced Couey's earlier comments in which he said that when he got to heaven, he would apologize to his victim. ""I have bad news,"" Mark Lunsford said. ""I don't think you're going to make it there."" He called on Couey to drop his appeals. ""You want to do something for her, give your life for the one you took."" CNN's Rich Phillips and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Officials: Couey, convicted of murdering Jessica Lunsford, died of natural causes .

"An international war of words has broken out over a New Zealand pop star's chart-topping single, after an American blogger labeled the track racist. ""Royals,"" the debut single by Lorde, the stage name of Ella Yelich-O'Connor, currently sits above hits from Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making the 16-year-old the youngest artist to top the U.S. chart in 26 years. The singer -- who sings about rejecting the trappings of consumerism in ""Royals"" and has admonished fellow pop star Selena Gomez for being insufficiently feminist -- has won plaudits from critics as a refreshing presence in the charts. But not everyone is a fan. In a post on the prominent feminist blog feministing.com, writer Veronica Bayetti Flores took issue with the song's lyrics, in which Yelich-O'Connor sings that ""every song"" is about gold teeth and Maybach luxury cars -- both fixtures of hip-hop music videos -- before concluding ""we don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams."" ""While I love a good critique of wealth accumulation and inequity, this song is not one; in fact, it is deeply racist,"" wrote Bayetti Flores. ""Because we all know who she's thinking when we're talking gold teeth, Cristal (champagne) and Maybachs. So why s--- on black folks? Why s--- on rappers?"" The writer attacked critics who ""have been so captivated by 'Royals' call-out of consumption that they didn't bother to take the time to think critically about the racial implications of the lyrics."" She concluded her post with the observation that the singer ""apparently calls herself a feminist."" ""Let's just hope her feminism gets a lot less racist as she develops as an artist,"" she wrote. The post attracted a massive online backlash from Lorde's fans and compatriots as well as other writers, with many claiming that Bayetti Flores, by interpreting the song through the prism of American race relations, was guilty of the kind of cultural arrogance she was attributing to the singer. ""I realize not everything in this world is an instrument of oppression,"" wrote New Zealand journalist Lynda Brendish. ""And not everything in this world should be viewed through the lens of Americans, particularly when it comes to race and cultures of other countries. To insist otherwise is ignorant at best and imperialistic at worst."" The track was the songwriter's response to the images of unattainable luxury often conveyed through a U.S.-dominated pop culture, Brendish wrote. ""The theme of the song is the dissonance between that life... and the one she lives in New Zealand, but it is not at all about race."" While a few of the trappings of conspicuous consumption cited in the song were associated with rappers, it also name-checked others associated with other wealthy, high-living stereotypes. ""Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash? I'm thinking Richard Branson and maybe Russian oligarchs there,"" wrote Brendish. ""Blood stains and ball gowns? Celeb socialites... Trashin' the hotel room? Rock stars."" Vice.com writer Dave Schilling said Bayetti Flores' reading of the song ""couldn't be more simplistic"" and asked: ""Why should anyone be surprised that the proliferation of pop songs about conspicuous consumption would get tiresome eventually?"" A commenter on feministing.com, Amelia Harris, called the post ""a dreadfully done piece of deconstruction."" ""I hope you have a better understanding of your own bias and lack of understanding of the world beyond your own, and an interest in the impact of imported American culture on the rest of the world."" Others noted with disappointment that a vocal young feminist role model was being attacked on a feminist blog. Despite the overwhelmingly critical response to her post, Bayetti Flores told CNN in an email that she stood by her comments, which had focused ""on how the song lands in the context of the United States."" ""Clearly it has reached a much wider audience now,"" she added. She took exception to how the song directs ""a critique of excessive consumption to a genre both created and currently dominated by Black Americans, particularly when the vast majority of excess consumption is done by white people - not to mention the fact that Black people bear the brunt of the ill effects of wealth inequality, both in this country and globally,"" Bayetti Flores said. Most of her critique is directed at record companies, U.S. media and ""longstanding racist narratives"" about consumption, she said. While the genre isn't above criticism, hip-hop ""must be critiqued in a way that contextualizes it within a larger system of race and power,"" she added. ""To do so without this context reinforces racist narratives which feed into a larger system of racism that consistently dehumanizes people of color, and serve to uphold and excuse much larger oppressive systems."" A spokesman for Universal Music New Zealand, Lorde's label, said the singer had no comment in response to the criticism. In an interview with NPR, Lorde described how the song was inspired by the messages conveyed by the pop music she had grown up with. ""I was just sort of reeling off some of the things which are commonly mentioned in hip-hop and the Top 40,"" she said. ""I've always loved hip-hop, but as a fan of hip-hop, I've always had to kind of suspend disbelief because, obviously, I don't have a Bentley. There's a distance between that and the life I have with my friends going to parties and getting public transport and doing the things that every other teenager does."" The lyrics in question are: . But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom, . Blood stains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room, . We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams. But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your time piece, . Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.

"""Con dinero y sin dinero, hago siempre lo que quiero..."" Hubertus von Hohenlohe, the Mexican athlete and a descendant of German royalty hums the chorus of the popular Mexican song El Rey (The King) while he proudly shows off his Mariachi suit photos, which he will wear on the Sochi slopes at the Winter Olympics.. ""For me it was never a doubt, I knew that I wanted to ski and to compete for Mexico; I was convinced from the beginning that this is my country,"" Von Hohenlohe told CNNMéxico. Although he has more European royalty than Mexican blood running through his veins, Von Hohenlohe is considered ""an ambassador in style,"" for being the only athlete that will represent Mexico in the Winter Games. ""It's a lot of pride and a great responsibility,"" said the veteran skier. ""We (in Mexico) are 100 million people and the only chance we have (of winning a medal) is up to me, but we don't have to look at it like that, you have to see it as I'm an ambassador of this country, an ambassador with style and a human force that goes beyond the result, "" Being born in Mexico was a matter of luck for Von Hohenlohe, who is the son of the Prince and Princess of Wurttemberg, a century old kingdom that ruled Germany -- when there was still a monarchy in that country. His father, the late Prince Alfonso von Hohenlohe-Langenburg and mother, Princess Ira of Fürstenberg were in Mexico in a business related trip at the time of their son's birth. In 1981 Von Hohenlohe founded the Mexican Federation of Winter Sports and since 1984 he has competed in the Olympics under Mexico's flag, participating in Calgary 1988, Albertville 1992 and Lillehammer 1994. In Vancouver 2010, after a long absence, Von Hohenlohe returned to the Olympics in the disciplines of slalom and giant slalom, when he became the oldest athlete to participate in the Winter Games as a 51-year-old. This year, the priority for the ""Mexican prince"" of nearly 55 years, is not achieving results but to create among his countrymen a passion for winter sports. ""It's not about monitoring my time, but to be there; to ignite young people's dreams that want to do the same, to represent Mexico in winter or summer,"" says Von Hohenlohe, who qualified for the games after sneaking into the International Ski Federation (FIS) slalom category ranking. For his new Olympic adventure -- he insists it's the last one-- Von Hohenlohe will combine his two passions: the sport and music by wearing a special Mariachi suit. A form of folk music from Mexico, Mariachi songs -- often played on festive occasions by groups of guitar, violin and trumpet performers wearing traditional clothes or wide-brimmed hats -- are sung throughout the country, and have become a key part of regional identity . Blog: Will the Winter Olympics be safe? The athlete, who also happens to be a singer, says he will wear his flamboyant uniform to reaffirm his Mexican pride. ""I am someone that when I go on stage I think about less important things that, at the end, provide some flavor, that promote a country, that sell an image, sell a story and since I ski, I will not generate much interest and many news for Mexico; it is important for Mexico to be there and for people to value (the country's presence), "" he says. Mexico, a country with little or no tradition in winter sports has slowly increased its presence in these kinds of competitions and in 2012 Joshua Montiel Santander competed in the skeleton category in the Innsbruck Winter Youth Olympic Games. Von Hohenlohe believes that the only way to encourage Mexican athletes to compete in such disciplines is to look beyond borders. ""Many Mexicans live in Canada or the United States. We have to find them; train them. They need to have a certain dexterity; skiing has to be in their blood; it has to be something natural for them,"" he said. Although the seasoned athlete recognizes that the monetary costs to practice some winter sports can be prohibitive, Von Hohenlohe also believes that it is possible to become involved in the sport if you are ""creative"" and have a support system. Whle the build up to Sochi has had its fair share of negative headlines, Von Hohenlohe expressed his regret that the sporting event is being used as a political platform.

"(CNN) -- Who will fire the next salvo in the ongoing friendly feud between TV host Conan O'Brien and Next Media Animation, the Taiwan-based animation studio known for its sarcastic CGI re-enactments of American news? It all started in November when Next Media marked O'Brien's debut on cable channel TBS with an animated clip poking fun at his awkward exit from NBC earlier this year. (TBS is owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN.) This was nothing unusual, as Next Media already had produced videos spoofing Apple's iPhone 4 antenna problems and JetBlue's escapee flight attendant Steven Slater. But this time O'Brien responded with a tongue-in-cheek parody of Next Media Animation, complete with exaggerated characters and cheesy visuals. It didn't stop there. Within 48 hours, Next Media Animation answered the comedian's response with another, more elaborate and very funny video alleging that ""Conan's cheap knock-off"" was produced by an oppressed gang of American child laborers who once worked for Michael Jackson at his Neverland Ranch. Last week on his show, the comedian said Team Coco would fire off another rebuttal, but it would take a while because his program only has one animator. ""We want to respond,"" he said. Online video ""feuds"" are popular nowadays, and like the Conan/Next Media back-and-forth, they're generally in good fun. In November, the British tabloid The Sun lampooned the popular Old Spice Guy ads to promote its barely clad Page 3 girls. In one video, a topless Page 3 model does a play-by-play parody of Isaiah Mustafa's Old Spice shower ad, with her long red tresses and other props covering any naughty bits. What's unique about O'Brien is that he's using an old medium, TV, to engage a new medium, YouTube. It gives more credibility to a web-based company like Next Media Animation and makes late-night television seem more timely and urgent. Expect more cross-medium smackdowns in the future. Your move, Coco.","Next Media Animation parodies Conan O'Brien's return to television with an animated video .

"Lille (CNN) -- A year that began in uncertainty for Roger Federer ended with a historic title for the 17-time grand slam champion and his country. When Federer defeated Richard Gasquet of France 6-4 6-2 6-2 in front of another record crowd Sunday, it gave Federer a maiden Davis Cup title at the not so tender age of 33. The visitors prevailed 3-1 in the best-of-five match series. Switzerland had never before won team tennis' most prestigious event, playing in one previous final in 1992 when Federer was merely 11. ""For me personally, obviously I'm unbelievably happy because I've been playing in this competition for probably almost 15 years now,"" Federer told reporters as he sat among his teammates. ""At the end of the day I wanted it more for the guys. ""This is one for the boys."" With Federer committing to every round of the Davis Cup this season -- unlike in years past -- and the emergence of compatriot Stan Wawrinka, it greatly boosted Switzerland's chances of success. Federer thus concluded 2014 with one of the biggest titles to elude him and a ranking of No. 2, a considerable achievement given back issues largely contributed to his ranking slipping to eighth in January. Indeed, some wondered -- with justification -- if Federer could ever come close to recapturing his old form. He did, and Federer was sharp Saturday in doubles alongside Wawrinka and then dominant against Gasquet in Lille, northern France. Only one week ago Federer was, according to Novak Djokovic, a ""question mark"" for the Davis Cup final after he withdrew from the final of the World Tour Finals in London against the No. 1 with further back troubles. His name was included in the Davis Cup draw Thursday, ensuring one of the highest profile finals in recent memory, but Federer suffered his most lopsided loss in the competition Friday against Gael Monfils. The positive, he insisted afterwards, was that his body felt fine as the match progressed, and his words ultimately were not a smoke screen. To say that Federer toyed with Gasquet wouldn't be much of a stretch. Gasquet, 2-12 versus Federer entering the match, started with an emphatic hold, but that was as good as it got for the prodigy who has never quite delivered. ""You saw how well Roger was playing, how he just killed Richard today,"" said Wawrinka. Gasquet, replacing the injured Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, was broken for 2-1, which set the tone. Federer lost just 14 points on his own serve and didn't face a break point. Evidencing how well his back must have been feeling, he soared and stretched to put away a smash with venomous side spin in the second set. There was deft touch to seal the tie, Federer executing a half-volley drop shot before falling onto the clay at the Stade Pierre Mauroy. He joined the likes of Rafael Nadal, Rod Laver and Andre Agassi in winning a Davis Cup plus all four majors. Unlike in majors, when players usually make the trek to their box after a title, in the Davis Cup the team habitually floods the court. Federer noticed the difference. ""It was definitely one of the better feelings in my career, no doubt about it,"" he said. ""So much nicer to celebrate it all together. ""So thanks for running up to me and screaming in my ear. It was good fun."" Though he applied the knockout blow, Wawrinka's performance this weekend shouldn't be forgotten, and Federer took note. He crushed Tsonga to give Switzerland its first point Friday and combined wonderfully with Federer in the doubles, his raw power a fine accompaniment to the artistry of Federer. If he harbored any animosity towards Federer for reportedly being taunted by Federer's wife, Mirka, last week at the World Tour Finals, he didn't show it. Wawrinka's season began in superb fashion with a first grand slam title in Melbourne and Sunday ensures it terminates well, following some bumps in between. ""It is an exceptional year for me,"" said Wawrinka. But what to make of the French? The brief fireworks produced inside the stadium after Switzerland's win provided more electricity than anything produced by Tsonga or Gasquet on the court. About 90 percent of the record crowd of 27,448 for a pro tennis match Sunday were French fans, but they barely had an opportunity to get into the match. Over the three days, France claimed one set in the matches it lost. ""The French team said they were ready to go to war, if I can quote them,"" Wawrinka said. ""What happened was totally the opposite."" Tsonga said a lingering arm injury returned Friday and the pain intensified following his outing against Wawrinka, yet the French No. 1 has not had a good year -- barring one tournament in Toronto. Gasquet has never had the reputation of being a clutch player -- his play in doubles and against Federer won't help to shed the label. And so France's drought, at least on the men's side, continues. A generation that promised plenty and was so determined to win the Davis Cup this year for a tennis loving nation has underachieved. France, in an atypical luxury, contested all four of its series this year at home but was still unable to snap a 13-year drought. ""If you look at the tie as a whole, you can see that the Swiss players are at a higher level than us,"" French captain Arnaud Clement told reporters. ""They're top (two) and top four of the world. We prepared for that as much as we could. But we knew that beating them would need an exceptional performance."" When Wawrinka was asked for a percentage regarding his availability for Switzerland's opening tie against Belgium next year, he replied, ""I think the percentage we're going to drink alcohol tonight is very high."" If the French players were to drink some alcohol, it would be for different reasons.","Switzerland wins its first Davis Cup title after Roger Federer routs Richard Gasquet .

"A Montana judge is defending his decision to sentence a former teacher to 31 days in jail for raping a 14-year-old student. Judge G. Todd Baugh said he gave 47-year-old Stacey Dean Rambold ""the right kind of sentence:"" 31 days in jail and more than 14 years on probation. In his response to a complaint filed against him with the Montana Judicial Standards Commission, Baugh acknowledges making controversial remarks about victim Cherise Morales at Rambold's sentencing in August. According to the Montana Attorney General's Office, the judge said she looked older than her years and was ""probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant."" Morales committed suicide in February 2010. ""I am sorry I made those remarks,"" the judge wrote. ""They focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant."" Baugh said he weighed all relevant factors in passing sentence. ""The defendant's last legal or moral transgression was the crime he committed and admitted,"" he wrote. ""In the ensuing almost six years, he had legally and morally good conduct, he was reinstated in sex offender treatment and the undisputed evidence supported community placement and treatment."" The length of the sentence, Baugh's comments and the age disparity between defendant and victim drew criticism and a firestorm of media attention. The Montana Attorney General's Office last week appealed the 31-day sentence, saying it did not meet the state's mandatory minimum sentence. Baugh filed his response on November 15. CNN obtained the document on Monday. Baugh had kind words for Rambold. After Morales' death, the state offered to defer prosecution if Rambold agreed to undergo sex offender counseling and live under other restrictions. ""The defendant did the morally right thing in agreeing, even though the state did not think it could prove up its case,"" Baugh wrote. Later, prosecutors decided to try Rambold because he missed counseling sessions and violated other rules.  ""Again, the defendant did the morally correct thing and did not challenge the violation,"" Baugh wrote. Rambold had sexual relations with Morales in fall 2007, when she was 14 and a student in one of his classes at Billings Senior High in Billings, Montana. She confided in a church group leader and Rambold was charged in October 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. After the deferred prosecution deal fell apart, the state prosecuted, seeking 10 years imprisonment followed by 10 years' probation. The defense noted Rambold had already suffered by losing his job and getting divorced and asked for a 15-year sentence, with all but 31 days suspended. Baugh went with the defense suggestion.

"After another violent week in Syria's civil war, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed regrets for the ""inability of the international community to unite in stopping this conflict."" Ban was referring to a mortar attack Friday on an electoral rally that reportedly killed at least 21 people. A child was among the dead in the shelling, which struck a pro-government election campaign tent in the regime-controlled part of Daraa. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that Islamist rebels were responsible for the attack and that at least 11 of the victims were civilians. The United Nations has asked the Syrian government to reconsider next month's election as the carnage mounts. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is blamed for the using his military to clamp down on opposition forces, is once again a candidate. The observatory estimates that more than 160,000 lives have been lost in the conflict. ""The Syrian people desperately need an end to violence and a clean break from the past to move toward a new Syria, one in which their legitimate aspirations are met and all communities are protected,"" said a representative for Ban. But the latest reports from the ground do not show signs of a slowdown in violence. Syrian troops lobbed shells laced with chlorine at a western Syrian town on Thursday, causing dozens to suffer from the inhalation of toxic gas, the opposition-run Hama Media Center said. A dramatic video posted on social media by activists purportedly shows yellow gas hanging in a narrow street at dusk in Kafr Zeita. A young man in a gas mask runs into the cloud of smoke and walks out moments later with a woman trying to cover her mouth as she struggles to breathe. Another video shows children choking and women using oxygen masks at a makeshift clinic. A man in scrubs turns to the camera while treating the victims and says, ""This is a chlorine gas attack."" Kafr Zeita.is the same opposition-held location where the United States and its allies believe al-Assad's government used the toxic gas in an April 11 attack. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos. Also Thursday, the Syrian government wrested control of the Central Prison in Aleppo, breaking a 13-month rebel siege on the sprawling complex where dozens of political prisoners are believed to be held, according to opposition groups and Syrian state media. Since a 2012 prison revolt, detainees suffered from lack of food, inadequate medical care and the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and dysentery, the Violations Documentation Center, a local monitoring group, found in a report published in April. More than 650 prisoners died either due to deteriorating conditions or at the hands of jailers, whom the center alleges carried out torture and summary executions.","At least 21 die in shelling at a pro-Assad campaign tent, opposition says .

"New York (CNN) -- When President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act on July 26, 1990, he addressed concerns the sweeping civil rights law would be ''too vague or costly, or may lead endlessly to litigation.'' Bush tried to reassure Americans his administration and Congress were ''committed to containing the costs that may be incurred.'' Borrowing from President Reagan's Berlin Wall speech from a few years earlier, Bush said, ''Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.'' Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, an original sponsor of the legislation, introduced a resolution last week saluting the people who helped bring the Americans with Disabilities Act into law. ""Twenty years ago, we heard testimony from Americans who had to crawl on their hands and knees to go up a flight of stairs; who couldn't ride on a bus because there wasn't a lift; who couldn't even cross the street in their wheelchairs because there were no curb cuts,'' the resolution said. ""The ADA has broken down barriers, created opportunities and transformed lives."" Amazing success fueled by act of discrimination . But the sweeping law, which regulates employment practices, federal and local programs, transportation, public accommodations and commercial facilities, remains a ripe source of news, legal action and popular debate. Pressured by court rulings, settlements or conscience, organizations and companies big and small regularly make modest or multimillion dollar changes to their buildings and business practices. In the past week, Los Angeles International Airport said it installed five grassy ''relief stations'' for travelers with guide dogs. The facilities include bowls and fake fire hydrants. In Virginia, The Mount Vernon Ladies Association of the Union, which owns and maintains George Washington's estate, promised the Justice Department it will modify Mount Vernon's main walkway, build a less steep entry ramp and make exhibitions more useful to deaf, hard of hearing, blind and low-vision visitors. In the same week, the department also said Blockbuster will train employees to ensure people with service animals have full and equal access to its more than 3,000 stores. As the anniversary approached, an internet chat board sampling turned up countless positive comments but also many critical ones. ''ADA laws have been interpreted, reinterpreted and misinterpreted so many times that unfortunately nobody has a final answer until you end up in court,'' one posting complained. On plumbingzone.com, a forum for plumbers, a comment poked fun at requirements for urinal heights in public restrooms, saying, ''Listen, a handicapped person ain't gonna use a urinal to begin with.'' On another site, a post by a self-described business owner says, ""I spent thousands of dollars complying with the ADA laws. I then get a letter in the mail from someone that is disabled that came into my establishment notifying me of all my violations.'' ''One was that the toilet paper dispenser in the restroom was three inches off the required ADA position,'' the posting said. ""What disabled person goes around with a tape measure? I could smell a lawsuit and immediately fixed all the minor items.'' ''While I understand the idea behind the law, it is definitely not being used as it was intended.'' According to the Census Bureau, 54 million Americans have a disability. That's almost one in five people. More than three million 15 years or older use a wheelchair. To coincide with the anniversary of the act, the Vehicle Production Group, a Florida-based specialty automaker, announced the MV-1, which it calls the first entirely wheelchair-accessible vehicle. Slated to sell for about $40,000 at base price, the minivan ''features a deployable access ramp with a 1,200-pound weight capacity, a spacious 36-inch entryway and a roomy interior that seats up to six people comfortably,'' the company's news release said.","Disabilities law marks 20th anniversary Monday; it's criticized for its cost, litigation .

"President Barack Obama will meet with more than a dozen tech company bosses Tuesday, one week after industry leaders asked the government to change its spying practices. The White House meeting comes a day after a federal judge said the government's collection of domestic phone records is unconstitutional. Such practices were brought to light by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked the classified information. Obama plans to sit down with Tim Cook of Apple and Eric Schmidt of Google, as well as executives from Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Salesforce, Netflix , Etsy, Dropbox, Yahoo!, Zynga, Sherpa Global, Comcast, LinkedIn and AT&T, a White House official said. But national security and ""unauthorized intelligence disclosures"" are only part of the agenda. The meeting will also include talks about how the tech sector can help the government avoid IT debacles like the healthcare.gov website rollout. Snowden's open letter offers to help Brazil investigate NSA surveillance . The judge's decision . U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's ruling came as the Obama administration completes a review of NSA surveillance in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks. Leon said the NSA's bulk collection of metadata -- phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content -- apparently violates privacy rights. His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases. ""I cannot imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary invasion' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,"" said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. ""Surely, such a program infringes on 'that degree of privacy' that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment."" Leon's ruling said the ""plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,"" adding ""as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury."" Judge: NSA domestic phone data-mining unconstitutional . But he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government. Leon rejected the government's argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in the past three decades. Leon also noted that the government ""does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature."" Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, a critic of the NSA data mining, called on Congress to pass legislation he proposed to ""ensure the NSA focuses on terrorists and spies - and not innocent Americans."" A Justice Department spokesman said Monday that ""we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found,"" but said the ruling is being studied. The avalanche of information . Explosive revelations earlier this year by Snowden triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Snowden's revelations led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance. In a statement distributed by journalist Glenn Greenwald, who first reported the leaks, Snowden said he acted on the belief that the mass surveillance program would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that Americans deserved a judicial review. ""Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights. It is the first of many,"" Snowden said in the statement. He is living in Russia under a grant of asylum to avoid prosecution over the leaks in the United States. Greenwald said the judge's ruling vindicates what Snowden did. ""I think it's not only the right, but the duty of an American citizen in Edward Snowden's situation to come forward, at great risk to himself, and inform his fellow citizens about what it is their government is doing in the dark that is illegal,"" the journalist told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Monday night. NSA official: Snowden amnesty 'worth having a conversation about' Secret court approval . The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a secret body that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for ""foreign intelligence purposes."" Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret court was set up to grant certain types of government requests-- wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States. The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection.In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate that it's ""relevant"" to an international terrorism investigation. But the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: ""A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person."" In defending the program, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that ""15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations."" Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon, were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses. Verizon Business Network Services turned over the metadata to the government. An array of legal challenges . Last month, the Supreme Court refused to take up the issue when it denied a separate petition, which was filed by the Electronic Information Privacy Center. Prior lawsuits against the broader NSA program also have been unsuccessful. Days after the Snowden disclosure in June, some Verizon customers filed legal challenges in the D.C. federal court. The left-leaning American Civil LIberties Union also filed a separate, pending suit in New York federal court.","The meeting comes after tech leaders called for the government to change spying practices .

"(CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to Osama bin Laden, will take over leadership of al Qaeda, according to a statement posted on several jihadist websites Thursday. The United States believes that al-Zawahiri has indeed taken the helm of the terrorist network, according to a U.S. counterterrorism official. Al-Zawahiri was widely regarded as al Qaeda's de facto leader since U.S. special forces killed Osama bin Laden at a hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2. ""Hereby the General Command of the Qaeda al-Jihad -- and after the end of the consultations -- we declare that Sheikh Dr. Abu Muhammad Ayman al-Zawahiri (may God bless him) will take over the responsibility of command of the group,"" the statement said, attributed to al Qaeda's ""general command."" It cited bin Laden's ""martyrdom"" and prayed ""to the Almighty to raise him to his heavens and reward him for his good deeds for us and the Islamic nation."" Al-Zawahiri's official appointment to the terrorist group's top post -- just a few days before his 60th birthday -- is ""not surprising,"" the U.S. counterterrorism official said. ""He had been the number two. It was surprising it took a couple of days for al Qaeda to acknowledge bin Laden's death and this long to say Zawahiri is the new leader."" One of the FBI's most wanted terrorists, al-Zawahiri has played a defining role in al Qaeda. He was indicted for his alleged role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others, according to the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the U.S. federal government. The FBI is offering a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount as the reward for bin Laden. Al-Zawahiri's wife and three children were killed in December 2001 in a U.S. attack on the family's residence in Afghanistan. Asked whether the United States is any closer to finding al-Zawahiri as a result of information obtained at bin Laden's compound or from leads resulting from a recent al-Zawahiri videotaped message about bin Laden's death, the U.S. counterterrorism official said only, ""Obviously, he has been and will continue to be of high interest."" More on al-Zawahiri at CNN's Security Clearance blog . In a nearly half-hour video released this month, al-Zawahiri eulogized bin Laden, saying he ""went to his God martyred because he said no to America."" Al-Zawahiri also criticized the ""treacherous"" Pakistani government and warned that America is ""not facing individuals or groups but an entire (Islamic nation that) rose from the ashes in a jihadi awakening to face its oppressors."" There will probably not be changes in U.S. counterterrorism strategy now that al-Zawahiri is leading al Qaeda, the U.S. counterterrorism official said. The al Qaeda statement cannot be authenticated by CNN, but it appeared on radical Islamist sites known for posting similar statements and recruitment videos by other al Qaeda figures. It said the group will not shift its policies and pledged its support to, among others, the Taliban and leader Mullah Omar as the group battles U.S. and NATO presence in Afghanistan. The posting makes no mention of the pro-democracy uprisings in much of the Arab world that have forced the exit of some longtime leaders. Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst, said al-Zawahiri may have a hard time following bin Laden. ""Zawahiri has none of the charisma of bin Laden,"" Cruickshank said. ""He wants to inspire people, not just who are joining the al Qaeda organization, but people who have never joined the al Qaeda organization and are trying to launch attacks in their name. Without bin Laden there anymore, they won't be as inspired."" Former CIA Officer Phil Mudd added al-Zawahiri is ""very poorly respected."" ""He is seen as a difficult man to work with,"" Mudd said. ""He has no sense among the work force in al Qaeda, the kind of prestige that bin Laden had."" The U.S. counterterrorism official said the United States does not know whether al Qaeda members have pledged their loyalty to al-Zawahiri. Born into a wealthy family in Cairo, al-Zawahiri is a physician and founding member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a militant organization that opposed the secular Egyptian government of Hosni Mubarak and sought its overthrow through violent means. Like bin Laden, al-Zawahiri also went to Afghanistan during its fight against the Soviets, although he was there primarily to offer medical expertise. By the 1990s, he refocused his attention on undermining and attacking the Egyptian government and, eventually, the United States. In 1998, when the Egyptian Islamic Jihad effectively merged with al Qaeda, he sent a fax to the Al-Hayat newspaper warning Americans. Three days later, August 7, suicide truck bombers carried out the embassy attacks. The al Qaeda statement Thursday showed the group's commitment to leading jihad efforts around the globe. Citing Palestinian territories, Somalia and Chechnya, the statement said al Qaeda ""will remain on the path of righteousness as a coherent, solid, cemented rank, with one word that will bind us together, with hearts of affinity, and under one wholesome banner, battling one enemy. Even if the names may vary, there is no failing, no hesitation, no surrender.""

"As the world reels from its worst Ebola outbreak, the nation hardest hit is declaring a shortage of body bags, which are crucial to preventing the spread of the deadly virus. Liberia, one of  three countries most affected by the outbreak, said it has 4,900 body  bags nationwide. It needs 85,000 more in the next six months, the Health Ministry said in a statement. A grim inventory of supplies shows body bags were not the only items lacking. Liberia is also experiencing a shortage of other supplies needed to fight the virus, including protective suits, face masks, gloves and goggles. Liberia said it needs 2.4 million boxes of gloves in the next six months, but it has only 18,000 boxes. Each box has 100 pairs. It also needs about 1.2 million hooded overalls within the same time frame, but it has only 165,000. The numbers are the latest setback in Liberia's fight against Ebola, which has killed at least 2,458 people in the nation. This week, health workers in the nation went on strike to demand higher pay, leaving some clinics unattended. Since the outbreak started in March, about  9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization. More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia. And the numbers are expected to skyrocket. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year, the World Health Organization said. It warned that things will get worse before they get better. Liberia has some supplies arriving in the next week, but it says they are still insufficient. Items scheduled to arrive don't include body bags. In addition to the three nations, a handful of Ebola cases have also been reported in Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the United States.","Ebola has killed at least 4,493 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, WHO says .

"The top U.S. military commander in the fight against ISIS said airstrikes are working to erode the terror group's capabilities and warned militants that the U.S. military is listening to them. Army Gen.

""I'm confident we're having the desired effects,"" Austin said of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq aimed at ISIS.

Austin said the military was still assessing the impact of those strikes and would not say whether or not Drugeon was killed. But, he noted that ""any time we can take their leadership out that's a good thing."" Austin said there is evidence that the U.S.-led coalition is gaining the upper hand against ISIS. ""They are afraid to congregate in any sizable formation. They know if we can see them, we're going to engage them and we're going to hit what we're aiming at."" Children say ISIS captured, beat them on way home from exams . We can hear you... Austin also said the strikes have significantly degraded the group's ability to communicate and added the coalition was able to listen in on ISIS communications. ""As we listen to them, we know that the impact of the precision strikes is demoralizing to them."" The general responded to questions about ISIS militants getting access to warplanes, after the militants were seen on their social media channels with a number of captured aircraft. ""I don't think that's currently a significant threat.  I know I have some fighter pilots who are hopeful that happens,"" he said, drawing chuckles from the crowd. ISIS still has the capability to continue in the fight, the general said, despite what he pointed to as successes from the coalition side. ""I think the question is how soon can we get the Iraqi military up to speed to do what they need to do to hold those gains."" Austin acknowledged the ISIS propaganda effort was having a major impact in recruitment for the group.""They really understand the value of dominating the media space. I think they're about as good as I've seen."" He said their numbers of committed fighters was likely between 9,000-17,000, a figure much lower than previous U.S. estimates. Austin echoed other comments from military leaders that the fight against ISIS will be years long but said, ""I don't see it as decades. I see it as years."" ISIS kills 300 members of Sunni tribe . 'Turkey has skin in the game' One member of the coalition has caused a certain amount of controversy. Turkey has limited use of its airspace and military bases despite pledging to help in the effort. ""Turkey has skin in the game here, obviously.  It's got a set of concerns and we need to be mindful of that,"" Austin said,  adding that the coalition would ""get it done"" with or without more support from the Turks. ""The more access and over-flight rights we can get, the better off we'll be."" Tapper asked about speculation ISIS was receiving financing from U.S. ally Qatar, and how successful the coalition had been at stopping the outside funding of the group. ""I think some things have been done but I think most folks in U.S. government will tell you, there's a lot more work that can be done and needs to be done,"" Austin said. The event was open to the media but cameras were prohibited from filming the session and a previously scheduled live stream of the event by the Atlantic Council was canceled at the request of CENTCOM. CENTCOM said it agreed to the event under the auspices that it was a ""scholarly discussion.""  CNN and other broadcast outlets protested the decision.

"""The Wizard of Oz,"" one of the most beloved movies of all time, celebrates the 75th anniversary of its release this month. Here are some things you may not have known about the film: . 1. That makeup was killer . Makeup in 1939, especially the elaborate and colorful cosmetics many members of the cast wore, wasn't as safe as the stuff performers wear today. In fact, some of it was downright deadly. Buddy Ebsen, who was originally cast as the Tin Man, had to leave the film when his lungs became infected by aluminum dust. The makeup was adjusted for Jack Haley, but he still remembered it as ""awful."" Margaret Hamilton's copper-based makeup as the Wicked Witch was poisonous, so she lived on a liquid diet during the film, and the makeup was carefully cleaned off her each day. Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion costume was so heavy -- ""like carrying a mattress around,"" said his makeup man -- that he'd emerged drenched at the end of shooting. Even Ray Bolger's Scarecrow face left permanent marks. 2. Poor Margaret Hamilton . The actress has frightened generations of ""Oz"" fans with her portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West, but the makeup she wore wasn't the only indignity. She was burned in one scene. Also, though she played an old crone, she was just 36 at the time. 3. A Frank coincidence . When the wardrobe department was fishing around for a jacket for Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan), some MGM staffers bought a bunch at a second-hand store. One of them fit Morgan perfectly. When he checked the label, it said ""L. Frank Baum"" -- the author of the ""Oz"" books. Yeah, it's classified as ""legend"" by Snopes.com, but it still makes for a great story. 4. You're a rich dog, too . Toto, actually named Terry, was paid $125 a week for her services. (Yes, Toto was a female.) Judy Garland got $500 a week for a lot more work, and no doubt many of the extras got much less than the dog. (According to Jerry Maren, who played a Munchkin, the Munchkins got $50 a week.) 5. Changing colors . The lights required for Technicolor were so bright that Dorothy's dress, which appears blue and white, was actually blue and pink. Also, the slippers -- silver in Baum's book -- were made red to show off the process. Incidentally, the five known pairs from the film are each worth $1.5 million today. 6. Oscar! Oscar! ""The Wizard of Oz"" was hugely successful in its initial run and nominated for six Oscars (though one of them, for color cinematography, is considered ""unofficial"" on the Academy's database). It won two, one for its score, one for ""Over the Rainbow"" -- which was almost cut from the film. Director Victor Fleming came out well, too. Though not nominated for ""Oz,"" he won for directing the year's best picture winner, ""Gone with the Wind."" 7. 'Dark Side' of the rainbow . At some point in the '90s, word went around that Pink Floyd's 1973 album ""Dark Side of the Moon"" synced up with the movie in eerie ways. Though members of Floyd swear it's pure coincidence -- and psychologists will tell you that we see links where we want to  -- some of the matchups are striking: ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" meshes well with the tornado; the old Side 1 of the album ends just as the sepia-colored portion of the movie does; and the heartbeat at the album's close coincides with Dorothy listening to the Tin Man's torso. Even if it's bull, it still makes for entertaining watching.","The classic film celebrates its 75th anniversary this year .

"Emerging from an ambulance Wednesday, six-time Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken-Rouen smiled and even cracked jokes. As she addressed the media at a press conference, the champion swimmer and radio sports talk show host described her recent experiences and attitude with words like ""awesome,"" ""thankful"" and ""amazing."" Why? Because she almost wasn't here at all. Less than two weeks ago, Van Dyken-Rouen's spinal cord was severed in an ATV accident in Arizona. Her injuries were so severe that she and her husband, former NFL punter Tom Rouen, were told to say their last goodbyes as she was rushed into emergency surgery. Van Dyken-Rouen has no memory of the June 6 accident. She remembers only riding the ATV to dinner in the eastern Arizona town of Show Low, then waking up to doctors and bright lights. Her husband found her face-down in water, not breathing. Now, the 41-year-old says with conviction, ""Every day you take a breath is a blessing."" Fighting back tears, she admitted it isn't easy. ""I have my bad days."" She's paralyzed from the waist down and copes with daily pain and grueling physical therapy -- but she's not complaining. ""You can get through anything as long as you have a positive attitude,"" she said. Her fans and friends keep up with her on Twitter (@amyvandyken) to hear about her journey -- the good days and the bad. She says it's been the ""thoughts, prayers and positive vibes"" that have kept her going. What's next for Van Dyken-Rouen? She says she's excited to start her new life -- a ""rebirth,"" as she calls it. She is headed next to Colorado, where both her and her husband's families live, to continue her physical therapy. She said the rigorous training she has undergone as an elite athlete has helped with the healing process. She said she intends to ""get the coolest wheelchair, rock it out and make my hair to match."" Van Dyken-Rouen said her dad, who suffers from a form of leukemia, also has a wheelchair, so she already has a racing partner in mind. Van Dyken-Rouen won four gold medals in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta: in the 50-meter freestyle, the 100 butterfly and the 4x100 freestyle and medley relays. In the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, she was on the winning 4x100 medley and freestyle relay teams again. She was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008.","Olympian Amy Van Dyken-Rouen was left paralyzed after a June 6 ATV accident .

"Now that the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate, it's time to focus on what has always been a key goal of health reform: Controlling health care costs. No matter how you count it, health care spending is large -- and growing at a worrisome rate. In 2011, Americans spent $2.7 trillion on health care, almost 18% of our GDP.   The federal government spends more on health care than on defense, Social Security or any other single expenditure category. Investments that could have gone into important areas like education or infrastructure are instead diverted into footing our health care bills. The individual mandate by itself will have little effect on costs. This is because the main effect of the mandate is to add a relatively small number of people, about 15 million, to the insurance rolls.  The vast majority of Americans, more than 250 million, already get their health insurance on the job or from public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.  The mandate alone was never going to change their health spending patterns.  However, this does not mean that the court's decision will have no effect on health spending. The Affordable Care Act contains many provisions intended to drive the health care system toward providing greater value. It would not be an overstatement to say that, with the exception of eliminating the tax break for employer-sponsored health insurance, the health reform law contains almost every idea that anyone, Democrat or Republican, has had in the past 10 years, about how to increase quality and efficiency in the health care system. These ideas include accountable care organizations, patient-centered medical homes, value-based purchasing in Medicare, incentives for hospitals to provider better, safer and more efficient care, an excise tax on ""Cadillac"" health plans, and better information about treatment effectiveness to help patients and providers make informed decisions. The value-based purchasing program, for example, will change the way Medicare pays hospitals for inpatient care.  Instead of paying hospitals for the amount of care they provide, Medicare payments will now also depend on the quality of care provided.  The idea is that by following best practices, hospitals will forgo unnecessary care, help patients recover faster and spend less. Some of these reforms targeting the health care delivery system are novel, and experts are rightly cautious in their predictions about what they can accomplish and whether they will ""bend the curve"" of health care spending until it is sustainable. There are other ideas out there on how we can reduce the federal government's obligations -- notably the plan advanced by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, which takes the brute force approach of simply shifting costs from the government to states and individuals.  The Affordable Care Act is the better choice.  Instead of papering over our problems by shifting ever-increasing costs to those least able to afford care or depriving people of the services they need, the health reform law applies the most creative thinking to address the roots of our spending problems. Today, the court gave us the green light to get on with seeking solutions to the underlying problem of inefficient spending. It permitted the government to do what it should, to innovate in the face of a seemingly intractable social problem.  Not everyone is happy with the decision. But no one can deny that it opens a new chapter in our history as we move forward on a bold and necessary policy experiment.","The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate .

"Let me tell you the story of an outbreak that could have happened, and didn't. A year ago, a mother traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the body of her son, who had died suddenly in rural Uganda. She came in contact with many people in her travels and at the funeral. She soon died, as did the man who helped transport her and the body of her son. What could have gone on to become a major outbreak, killing many people, was stopped because health officials acted quickly. Workers in Uganda, trained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, contacted staff at the local plague laboratory. Using a rapid dipstick test, the lab quickly determined that the cause of death was pneumonic plague, one of the world's most deadly diseases. Within 12 hours, preventive medicine was provided to more than 130 people who had come in contact with the family. The number of deaths was stopped at three. A blind spot anywhere is a risk to us everywhere . Keeping people safe is the role of public health agencies such as the CDC -- a role that becomes even more important every day. We are all connected by the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat, and the next outbreak may be just a plane ride away. The world faces a perfect storm of vulnerability. On average, we identify one previously unknown microbe each year. We're also finding that more and more infections are showing resistance to all available drugs.  And the threat exists that sometime, somewhere, someone will unleash a deadly, genetically modified microbe for which we may have no warning and little preparation. Since we can't predict where or when the next outbreak will happen, we have to be vigilant at all times. For example, nothing has the potential to kill more people than influenza. A strain such as H7N9 could create a pandemic. When something with that much potential to cause widespread harm emerges, we must identify it in hours or days, not weeks or months. H7N9 doesn't yet spread from person to person, and it may never. But when it comes to new infectious diseases, the question is not whether, but when and where. One of the most serious health issues facing us today is the fact that our antibiotic drugs don't work as well as they used to -- or at all -- against a growing number of infections. We risk a future where simple infections can turn deadly. CDC sets threat levels for drug-resistant 'superbugs' For a few bacteria, we're already there. CRE, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, is a nightmare strain of bacteria that can resist all antibiotics, kill a high proportion of the people it infects and spread readily. We still have time to close the door on antibiotic resistance, but it means public health must collaborate with clinical medicine, both in the United States and around the world. That's a key challenge for the next decade in many aspects of global health. Find. Stop. Prevent. This is what it takes to save lives and protect people. The steps are clear: Find out what's harming people, figure out how to stop these harms, put programs in place to protect people by preventing these harms -- and then monitor to see if the programs are working. CDC has staff in every state of the United States and in more than 60 countries around the world. Our experts are passionate about their work and are committed to saving as many lives as possible. But you can do your part too. We can all help by not demanding antibiotics from our doctors and by taking antibiotics only and exactly as prescribed. Get smart and know when antibiotics do or don't work. If you or a loved one is receiving care at a medical facility, ask what they are doing to prevent drug resistance. Also, ask your doctors what they are doing to protect you or your loved one from infection. Drug-resistant infections can be prevented by immunization, safe food preparation and handling, and general hand washing.

"When I was 17, I thought I was invincible like every other teenage boy. I was moving to North Carolina from Bakersfield, California, to pursue my dream of being a professional race car driver. Nothing could stop me. But something did stop me. During the move to North Carolina, I started losing weight and feeling dehydrated, despite drinking massive amounts of fluids. We had to make many unscheduled stops because of my unquenchable thirst and frequent urination. My mood fluctuated, and I wasn't really fun to be around. I went back out to Bakersfield, and my parents immediately took me to our local physician who diagnosed me as having type 1 diabetes. The doctor told me I would never drive a race car again. I was in shock, depressed and didn't accept that fact. I thought, ""Give me some medicine, and I'll be back at the racetrack next week."" But this wasn't the case. Type 1 diabetes can't be fixed easily with medication. Diabetes fast facts . This diagnosis was unacceptable to me, and I wanted to know more about it and what I could do to overcome it. With the help of the Internet, I found a California doctor who specializes in diabetes and had another race car driver, Charlie Kimball, under her care.  My father called Dr. Anne Peters' office and spoke with her assistant, explaining my situation. One week later I was in her Los Angeles office. Peters was the person who gave me hope that with hard work I could continue to chase my dream of being a professional race car driver. She put me on a strict diet and exercise regiment, which has allowed me to achieve the success I have had to date. I went back to North Carolina and realized something -- if I have this many questions and failed to understand all of this diabetes terminology, then what about other people living with diabetes? So my family and I started a foundation called Ryan's Mission to help educate and create awareness about living with diabetes. I continued the twice-daily workout regiment and the strict lifestyle change to allow me to drive a successful 2012 season in the ARCA Racing Series, as well as participate in select NASCAR Camping World Truck Series events. In 2013, my dream came to fruition; I was signed with Roush Fenway Racing as a development driver in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. Then, through Ryan's Mission, we announced our collaboration with the American Diabetes Association to launch the Drive to Stop Diabetes awareness campaign. I have had three NASCAR Nationwide Series starts to date, posting my first top-10 finish in the No. 16 Drive to Stop Diabetes Ford Mustang at Richmond on September 6. I will continue to drive two to three more Nationwide Series races with Roush Fenway this year with the Drive to Stop Diabetes paint scheme. Ryan's Mission's unique collaboration with the ADA uses my story as the voice.  The Drive to Stop Diabetes campaign includes awareness and educational efforts at NASCAR Nationwide races this year, as well as at several off track health and wellness initiatives throughout 2013. I see this as an opportunity to show my ability. Obviously my goal is to follow in the progression of many drivers who have started inside the Nationwide Series ranks and worked their way up to contend for the Sprint Cup. It will be a great opportunity, and I intend to make the most of it. I'm fortunate to have the chance to not only be able to drive as a development driver, but also to educate others. I want to let them know that even when living with diabetes, life has no limits.","Ryan Reed is a development driver in the NASCAR Nationwide Series .

"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said he is not opposed to Plan B, the emergency contraception commonly known as the morning-after pill. Paul, a likely Republican presidential candidate, sponsored an anti-abortion bill in 2013 that defines life as beginning at fertilization. Democrats say the so-called ""Personhood"" measure would outlaw Plan B and other emergency contraceptives. Paul was asked about the matter during an appearance at the College of Charleston, one stop on a day-long college tour of South Carolina. ""If life starts at conception, should medicine that prevents conception like Plan B be legal?,"" a woman asked him during a question-and-answer session here. Rand Paul talks marriage, contraception in Iowa . Paul at first gave a terse answer: ""I am not opposed to birth control,"" he said. After a pause, Paul elaborated. ""That's basically what Plan B is,"" he said. ""Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that."" A number of prominent social conservatives have condemned the morning-after pill as on-demand abortion drugs, sometimes confusing the contraceptive with RU-486, which can be used to induce abortion. Paul stood by his answer after the event, when asked about the exchange by reporters. ""Plan B is taking birth control,"" he said. ""I am not against birth control and I don't know many Republicans who would be indicating that they are against birth control.""

"Much attention has been paid to the defeat in Congress of proposals to ban assault weapons and expand background checks for firearm purchases. But states have been busy passing gun laws of their own in the wake of the December 14 massacre in Newtown. Six months since Sandy Hook: Newtown residents find their voice . At least five states have tightened gun laws, including Connecticut, Colorado and New York, while more than a dozen others have loosened them. Several states are still considering measures. Connecticut added more than 100 guns to its list of banned assault weapons, banned armor-piercing bullets and limited gun magazines to a capacity of 10 rounds. Kansas adopted a law saying that federal statues that violate the Second Amendment are no longer applicable in the state, and that any federal agent who tries to enforce federal gun laws faces jail time. At least eight states -- including Arizona, where a 2011 mass shooting killed six people and left then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords badly wounded -- have passed laws that exempt gun permits from public records. Those laws were largely in reaction to a suburban New York newspaper that published an online map pinpointing the addresses of people with gun permits. Meanwhile, states where new gun control measures have been enacted already face court challenges by gun rights supporters. At Colt's Connecticut factory, no apologies for arming America . Below is a state-by-state summary of key parts of new gun laws that are in effect or will take effect this year: . States that have loosened gun laws: . Alabama: Residents can carry loaded guns in their vehicles to their workplace if they have a concealed-carry permit. If they don't have a concealed weapons permit, they can bring a gun to their car but it must be unloaded and locked away. Arizona: There should be no record of ""the identifying information of a person who owns, possesses, purchases, sells or transfers a firearm."" In addition, police departments that conduct gun buyback programs to get guns off the street must sell the guns instead of destroying them. Arkansas: Guns are allowed in church, and licensed faculty and staff at public universities and colleges can carry concealed handguns. Employees of bars and liquor stores who have concealed permits can bring their guns to work. Prosecutors and deputy prosecutors can now carry a firearm, as can members of the parole board, their investigators and a parole revocation judge. A list of residents with concealed weapons permits will no longer be part of the public record. In addition, the governor can no longer suspend the sale of guns during a declared disaster emergency. Idaho: Concealed gun permits are no longer public record, and the state recognizes concealed permits from any state. Kansas: Federal gun laws will no longer be enforced, and any federal agent who tries to enforce federal laws faces arrest, jail time and a fine. The state also now recognizes concealed carry permits from any state. Kentucky: Citizens can openly carry guns in formerly banned public places, including the State Capitol, city halls, council chambers, libraries, community centers, zoos and parks. The only exceptions to the law are schools and colleges. Maine: Names and other personal information of people with gun permits are no longer part of the public record. Mississippi: Concealed weapons permits are no longer public record, and people can now carry partially visible pistols. A new grant will assist law enforcement agencies in providing additional school resource officers in primary and secondary schools. North Dakota: Guns are now allowed in churches. Oklahoma: Recognizes any valid concealed weapons permit from any state. People who seek certain renewals of gun permits will no longer be fingerprinted, effective November 1. District court judges, the state attorney general and assistant attorney generals can carry firearms, effective November 1. South Dakota: Local school boards can train and arm employees, including volunteers, inside the classroom. Concealed weapons permits are now valid for five years, instead of four. Tennessee: Gun owners with concealed permits can keep guns in their vehicles in public or private parking lots effective July 1. Concealed weapons permits are no longer part of the public record. Utah: Concealed weapons permits are no longer part of the public record. A person currently not allowed to possess a firearm because of mental health reasons can petition the state for the right to bear arms. Virginia: Concealed weapons permits are no longer part of the public record, but the state can still release ""statistical summaries, abstracts, or other records containing information in an aggregate form."" West Virginia: Recognizes concealed permits from additional states. Guns can no longer be seized during a declared emergency. Wyoming: Judges can carry a gun into a courtroom, effective July 1. States that have tightened gun laws: . Colorado: The state where 12 people were killed and 58 wounded in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora in 2012 made background checks mandatory for all gun purchases and has limited magazine capacity to 10 rounds. Connecticut: More than 100 guns have been added to the state's list of banned assault weapons. Armor-piercing bullets are banned, and gun magazines are limited to a capacity of 10 rounds. Gun owners who currently own magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds can keep them but must register them with the state. All firearms sales, including ones at gun shows, must go through background checks. Stiffer penalties for illegal possession and trafficking of guns have been authorized. Also, the nation's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of dangerous weapons is being created; such information will only be available to law enforcement. Delaware: Background checks on all gun purchases are required, assault weapons are prohibited, and magazine capacity is limited to 10 rounds. Maryland: The state banned the sale of 45 types of assault weapons, including the AR-15, and limited magazine capacity to 10 rounds. Residents purchasing a handgun must be fingerprinted and go through safety training. A single automated gun application process between gun dealers and Maryland state police has been established. New York: High capacity magazines are banned. Assault weapons must be registered within the state, including those already owned by residents. All gun buyers must undergo background checks, including at gun shows and private sales except transactions among immediate family members. Anyone who purchases ammunition must also undergo a background check. Sales of assault weapons on the Internet are banned. Mental health professionals who believe a mental health patient might be a danger to society must report that information to a health care director, who must then relay what they determine to be serious threats to the state Department of Criminal Justice Services.","Congress may have defeated gun bills, but states have been passing them .

"Jonathon Walters didn't know where to begin. He just knew he had to start somewhere, or he wouldn't be alive for much longer. His weight had caused him problems for years. In high school, he was wearing size 50 pants. As a junior, sick of the bullies and comments from teachers, Walters went to his father and told him he was dropping out of school. He recalls his dad saying, ""John, quitting is unlike anything else in life. It is only hard the first time you do it. After that it is habit and almost impossible to break."" His dad was right. Walters received his high school diploma through home schooling in 2006. But in the years that followed, he quit college and multiple jobs. Now, though, the comic book colorist from Benton, Illinois, is finally sticking with something. His father's death motivated him to lose 200 pounds in the last nine months, and he says he isn't looking back. 'My world had collapsed' On May 6, 2013, Walters received devastating news: His father had died from a heart attack. He was 53. According to Walters, his father wasn't overweight or really out of shape, so his death was unexpected. ""My world had collapsed,"" Walters said. Walters was despondent. He left his job as a telecommunications sales rep and didn't speak to practically anyone besides his wife and three young boys. Already heavy, Walters began packing on more weight in the weeks after his father died. He ate to numb the pain he felt, every night feeling the crushing weight laying heavy on his chest. ""At first I played the role of the victim and slowly let my obsession with food consume me,"" he said. But then he had a realization about his father's death. It hit him that he too would ""eventually run out of tomorrows."" On July 18, he woke up and decided he had had enough. He was done. ""I was done being a burden to my family. I was done feeling pain every second of every day. I was done being stared at in grocery stores. I was done being the regular customer at fast food restaurants. I was done being the unhealthy version of me. ""I was done quitting everything I started. I was going to not only lose the weight, I was going to obliterate it. I was going to stop giving up. I quit quitting."" Facing reality . Walters made a doctor's appointment for the next day. He had no idea how he would do it, but he was determined to lose weight without surgery and knew he needed help. At the doctor's office, he had to sit in the bench-style chairs because he was too large to fit in the regular seats. Facing reality was hard. He weighed 477 pounds, had high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as well as a severe fatty liver. He left the doctor's office and started exercising the next day. ""I could barely walk without getting winded. After every time I went walking, I could feel pain in my legs and feet. It hurt so bad to keep going, but I knew it was temporary and giving up was permanent."" Walters would walk a quarter mile, then rest for 5 minutes. Slowly, he worked himself up to greater distances. Soon, he was up to 3 miles a day and was down 50 pounds. A few months later, he started running. Walters now runs 10 miles a day, lifts weights and works out on machines at the gym. He has completely changed his diet, lowering his carbohydrate intake, eating more vegetables and fruits, and increasing his protein consumption. He also cut out fried foods and soda. The 6'3"" man currently weighs 270 pounds. He still wants to lose an additional 30 to 40 pounds, but at a much slower pace through weightlifting. He started a Facebook page to hold himself accountable and is inspired by all the messages he gets each day. Terri Hartman, a nurse practitioner who worked with Walters early on in his diet, said she's thrilled with his progress. Besides changing his own life, she's seen his lifestyle changes inspire others, including his two sisters, to become healthy. Walters has found new strength and willpower, Hartman says -- something that will aid him the rest of his life. This time, Walters is determined not to quit. ""It isn't about me anymore. My mission is to bring motivation to the masses and show them it doesn't take any surgeries, pills or other products,"" Walters said. ""I have three boys and a wife that count on me daily. ... Imagining my sons and wife without me, makes every ounce of effort I put in worth it."" He lost 125 pounds, but still felt fat .

"Last month's Supreme Court decision in the landmark Arizona immigration case was groundbreaking for what it omitted: the words ""illegal immigrants"" and ""illegal aliens,"" except when quoting other sources. The court's nonjudgmental language established a humanistic approach to our current restructuring of immigration policy. When you label someone an ""illegal alien"" or ""illegal immigrant"" or just plain ""illegal,"" you are effectively saying the individual, as opposed to the actions the person has taken, is unlawful. The terms imply the very existence of an unauthorized migrant in America is criminal. In this country, there is still a presumption of innocence that requires a jury to convict someone of a crime. If you don't pay your taxes, are you an illegal?  What if you get a speeding ticket?  A murder conviction? No. You're still not an illegal. Even alleged terrorists and child molesters aren't labeled illegals. By becoming judge, jury and executioner, you dehumanize the individual and generate animosity toward them.  New York Times editorial writer Lawrence Downes says ""illegal"" is often ""a code word for racial and ethnic hatred."" The term ""illegal immigrant"" was first used in 1939 as a slur by the British toward Jews who were fleeing the Nazis and entering Palestine without authorization. Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel aptly said that ""no human being is illegal."" Navarrette: ""Illegal immigrant"" is the uncomfortable truth . Migrant workers residing unlawfully in the U.S. are not -- and never have been --  criminals. They are subject to deportation, through a civil administrative procedure that differs from criminal prosecution, and where judges have wide discretion to allow certain foreign nationals to remain here. News: For immigrants and opponents, court's ruling hits their real lives . Another misconception is that the vast majority of migrant workers currently out of status sneak across our southern border in the middle of the night.  Actually, almost half enter the U.S. with a valid tourist or work visa and overstay their allotted time.  Many go to school, find a job, get married and start a family.  And some even join the Marine Corps, like Lance Cpl. Jose Gutierrez, who was the first combat veteran to die in the Iraq War. While he was granted American citizenship posthumously, there are another 38,000 non-citizens in uniform, including undocumented immigrants, defending our country. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and three other justices, stated:  ""As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States.""  The court also ruled that it was not a crime to seek or engage in unauthorized employment. As Kennedy explained, removal of an unauthorized migrant is a civil matter where even if the person is out of status, federal officials have wide discretion to determine whether deportation makes sense.  For example, if an unauthorized person is trying to support his family by working or has ""children born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished military service,"" officials may let him stay.  Also, if individuals or their families might be politically persecuted or harmed upon return to their country of origin, they may also remain in the United States. While the Supreme Court has chosen language less likely to promote hatred and divisiveness, journalists continue using racially offensive language. University of Memphis journalism professor Thomas Hrach conducted a study of 122,000 news stories published between 2000 and 2010, to determine which terms are being used to describe foreign nationals in the U.S. who are out of status. He found that 89% of the time during this period, journalists used the biased terms ""illegal immigrant"" and ""illegal alien."" Hrach discovered that there was a substantial increase in the use of the term ""illegal immigrant,"" which he correlated back to the Associated Press Stylebook's decision in 2004 to recommend ""illegal immigrant"" to its members. (It's the preferred term at CNN and The New York Times as well.) The AP Stylebook is the decisive authority on word use at virtually all mainstream daily newspapers, and it's used by editors at television, radio and electronic news media.  According to the AP, this term is ""accurate and neutral."" For the AP to claim that ""illegal immigrant"" is ""accurate and neutral"" is like Moody's giving Bernie Madoff's hedge fund a triple-A rating for safety and creditworthiness. It's almost as if the AP were following the script of pollster and Fox News contributor Frank Luntz, considered the foremost GOP expert on crafting the perfect conservative political message.  In 2005, he produced a 25-page secret memorandum that would radically alter the immigration debate to distort public perception of the issue. The secret memorandum almost perfectly captures Mitt Romney's position on immigration -- along with that of every anti-immigrant politician and conservative pundit.  For maximum impact, Luntz urges Republicans to offer fearful rhetoric: ""This is about overcrowding of YOUR schools, emergency room chaos in YOUR hospitals, the increase in YOUR taxes, and the crime in YOUR communities.""  He also encourages them to talk about ""border security,"" because after 9/11, this ""argument does well among all voters -- even hardcore Democrats,"" as it conjures up the specter of terrorism. George Orwell's classic ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" shows how even a free society is susceptible to manipulation by overdosing on worn-out prefabricated phrases that convert people into lifeless dummies, who become easy prey for the political class. News: For immigrant graduates, a 'leap of faith has been answered,' educator says . In ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" Orwell creates a character named Syme who I find eerily similar to Luntz.  Syme is a fast-talking word genius in the research department of the Ministry of Truth.  He invents doublespeak for Big Brother and edits the Newspeak Dictionary by destroying words that might lead to ""thoughtcrimes."" Section B contains the doublespeak words with political implications that will spread in speakers' minds like a poison. In Luntz's book ""Words That Work,"" Appendix B lists ""The 21 Political Words and Phrases You Should Never Say Again.""  For example, destroy ""undocumented worker"" and instead say ""illegal immigrant,"" because ""the label"" you use ""determines the attitudes people have toward them."" And the poison is effective. Surely it's no coincidence that in 2010, hate crimes against Latinos made up 66% of the violence based on ethnicity, up from 45% in 2009, according to the FBI. In his essay ""Politics and the English Language,"" Orwell warned that one must be constantly on guard against a ready-made phrase that ""anaesthetizes a portion of one's brain.""  But Orwell also wrote that ""from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase ... into the dustbin, where it belongs"" -- just like the U.S. Supreme Court did.

"New Delhi (CNN)A diamond merchant has plunked  down $691,890 to buy India's most famous suit. The suit owned by  Prime Minister Narendra Modi got tongues wagging when he wore it to a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama last month. Dubbed one of the world's most expensive suits, it sold at an auction Friday. It cost a cool 43.1 million rupees, Surat District Magistrate Rajender Kumar said. The suit is a popular icon. In addition to belonging to Modi,  it had his name embroidered in golden pinstripe all over it. That had the whole nation cackling about an outrageous fashion faux pas. Wearing it while meeting Obama made the sartorial choice even more provocative. Opposition leaders accused him of being narcissistic, one politician even labeled him a ""megalomaniac."" Much of the Indian public wasn't too pleased either, questioning his image of a humble man he proudly portrayed during the 2014 general elections. The infamous monogrammed suit went on auction with bidders from all over the country tussling for the prized possession. Its original price was U.S.$16,084 - and officials expected it to shoot up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The proceeds of this year's auction are supposed to go toward Modi's ambitious pet project of cleaning India's holy river, the Ganges. The suit was just one of the 455 items up for grabs. Other items include gifts and mementos that Modi received from foreign dignitaries and national leaders. According to organizers, the auction which is being held in Modi's home state of Gujarat has been extremely successful. ""There is a lot of interest among the general public, and we are seeing multiple bids for a lot of items,"" Kumar said. Modi held similar auctions when he was the chief minister of Gujarat and raised funds for the education of young girls in the state.","Proceeds of the auction go toward cleaning of India's holy river .
The suit  is considered one of the world's most expensive ."
"(CNN)Michael Peres is obsessed with photographing snowflakes with a microscope. He catches the snowflakes on a piece of black velvet, runs into his garage and places the delicate flakes on a microscope slide with a dissecting needle before they melt. Using envelopes or newspapers as background, he captures colors reflected in the magnified flakes. His hobby began 13 years ago, when the photography professor at Rochester Institute of Technology first began tinkering with how to capture the fleeting beauty of individual flakes before they melted. ""I have a love-hate relationship with winter,"" said Peres, who has lived in Rochester, New York, for 30 years. ""I hate shoveling and cleaning my car off, but there's no other way to photograph snowflakes if you're not in a place where it snows."" Peres shares his photos of snowflakes and other objects on his Instagram account with the hashtag #tinythings.","Michael Peres loves photographing ""very small things""
He mounted his camera to a bellows to shoot images through a microscope .
Peres has 30 seconds to 2 minutes to shoot, depending on the temperature ."
