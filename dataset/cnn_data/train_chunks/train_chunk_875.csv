"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. may not leave any troops in Afghanistan after December 2014, a White House official has said. The indications made by the Obama . administration yesterday defies the Pentagon's view that thousands of . troops may be needed to keep a lid on al-Qaeda and to strengthen Afghan . forces. The end of 2014 marks the deadline for withdrawal of NATO combat troop, a process which began in November 2010. No promises: U.S. President Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, pictured last year, will meet on Friday as the White House gave the first signal that it might leave no troops in Afghanistan after 2014 . Should the US pull all American troops out of Afghanistan at the end of 2014? Previously no explicit signals have been made by the U.S. regarding what future missions in Afghanistan will be necessary and how many American troops they would require. The U.S. now has 66,000 troops in Afghanistan, down from a peak of about 100,000 as recently as 2010. ‘The U.S. does not have an inherent . objective of `X' number of troops in Afghanistan,’ said Ben Rhodes, a . White House deputy national security adviser. ‘We have an objective of . making sure there is no safe haven for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and . making sure that the Afghan government has a security force that is . sufficient to ensure the stability of the Afghan government.’ At stake is the risk of Afghanistan's collapse and a return to the chaos of the 1990s that enabled the Taliban to seize power and provide a haven for Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network. Fewer than 100 al-Qaeda fighters are believed to remain in Afghanistan, although a larger number are just across the border in Pakistani sanctuaries. The force: The U.S. currently has 66,000 troops in Afghanistan and may withdraw all withing the next 24 months . Remain: Afghan National Army troops on their graduation at a NATO training unit, which Pentagon believes require U.S. and NATO ally troops if it is to continue . Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has . said he foresees a need for a U.S. counterterrorism force in Afghanistan . beyond 2014, plus a contingent to train Afghan forces. He is believed . to favor an option that would keep about 9,000 troops in the country. Administration . officials in recent days have said they are considering a range of . options for a residual U.S. troop presence of as few as 3,000 and as . many as 15,000, with the number linked to a specific set of . military-related missions like hunting down terrorists. Asked in a conference call with . reporters whether zero was now an option, Rhodes said, ‘That would be an . option we would consider.’ His . statement could be interpreted as part of an administration negotiating . strategy. On Friday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai is scheduled to meet . President Barack Obama at the White House to discuss ways of framing an . enduring partnership beyond 2014. The two are at odds on numerous issues, including a U.S. demand that any American troops who would remain in Afghanistan after the combat mission ends be granted immunity from prosecution under Afghan law. Karzai has resisted, while emphasizing his need for large-scale U.S. support to maintain an effective security force after 2014. In announcing last month in Kabul that he had accepted Obama's invitation to visit this week, Karzai made plain his objectives. ‘Give us a good army, a good air force . and a capability to project Afghan interests in the region,’ Karzai . said, and he would gladly reciprocate by easing the path to legal . immunity for U.S. troops. Karzai is scheduled to meet Thursday . with Panetta at the Pentagon and with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham . Clinton at the State Department. Without explicitly mentioning immunity . for U.S. troops, Obama's top White House military adviser on . Afghanistan, Doug Lute, told reporters Tuesday that the Afghans will . have to give the U.S. certain ‘authorities’ if it wants U.S. troops to . remain. ‘As we know from our Iraq experience, . if there are no authorities granted by the sovereign state, then . there's not room for a follow-on U.S. military mission,’ Lute said. He . was referring to 2011 negotiations with Iraq that ended with no . agreement to grant legal immunity to U.S. troops who would have stayed . to help train Iraqi forces. As a result, no U.S. troops remain in Iraq. David Barno, a former commander of . U.S. forces in Afghanistan and now a senior fellow at the Center for a . New American Security, wrote earlier this week that vigorous debate has . been under way inside the administration on a ‘minimalist approach’ for . post-2014 Afghanistan. Stay or go: Although NATO have pledged to remove all combat troops from Afghanistan it it yet unknown how many will be required to stay to train local forces and keep Al-Qaeda at bay . In . an opinion piece for ForeignPolicy.com on Monday, Barno said the ‘zero . option’ was less than optimal but ‘not necessarily an untenable one.’ Without what he called the . stabilizing influence of U.S. troops, Barno cautioned that Afghanistan . could ‘slip back into chaos.’ Rhodes said Obama is focused on two main outcomes in Afghanistan: ensuring that the country does not revert to being the al-Qaeda haven it was prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and getting the government to the point where it can defend itself. ‘That's what guides us, and that's what causes us to look for different potential troop numbers - or not having potential troops in the country,’ Rhodes said. He predicted that Obama and Karzai would come to no concrete conclusions on international military missions in Afghanistan beyond 2014, and he said it likely would be months before Obama decides how many U.S. troops - if any - he wants to keep there. Rhodes said Obama remains committed to further reducing the U.S. military presence this year, although the pace of that withdrawal will not be decided for a few months. Last year the U.S. military pulled 23,000 troops out of Afghanistan on Obama's orders.","White House: U.S. may leave no troops in Afghanistan after December 2014 .

"By . Associated Press . The first surgeon general ever forced out of office by the president after he campaigned hard against the dangers of smoking during the Richard Nixon era, died Tuesday, at the age of 87. Dr. Jesse Steinfeld died yesterday morning in a nursing home in suburban Pomona, California, following a stroke he suffered about a month ago. 'He laid the groundwork for us to be better people and make the world a better place,' his daughter Susan Steinfeldm, of La Canada Flintridge, said after announcing his death. Dr. Jesse Steinfeld (left) worked with President Richard Nixon (right) as U.S. Surgeon General from 1969 to 1973, he passed away on Tuesday . Steinfeld was a cancer researcher and taught at the USC medical school before serving as Nixon's surgeon general from 1969-1973. In office, Steinfeld won the ire of the tobacco industry for his stubborn efforts to publicize the hazards of smoking. He changed cigarette package labels that lukewarmly stated tobacco use might be connected to health problems. Steinfeld's label boldly warned: 'The surgeon general has determined that smoking is hazardous to your health.' He issued a report in 1971 that argued for tighter restrictions on smoking in public to protect people from secondhand smoke. Dr. Steinfeld, pictured in 1970, was a strong campaigner about the dangers of smoking . He promoted bans on smoking in restaurants, theaters, planes and other public places - decades before such prohibitions became commonplace. 'It's a good lesson for everyone on how long it takes to change public opinion,' said another daughter, Mary Beth Steinfeld of Sacramento. Steinfeld refused to meet with tobacco industry lobbyists and hung signs around his office that read, 'Thank you for not smoking,' she said. Steinfeld believed his anti-tobacco stance led to Nixon's request for his resignation at the start of Nixon's second term. 'He always used to talk about how he thought the tobacco companies were pressuring Nixon to get rid of him,' Mary Beth Steinfeld said. After Steinfeld left, the position of surgeon general remained vacant until President Jimmy Carter appointed Dr. Julius Richmond in 1977. The only other surgeon general to be forced out of office was Dr. Jocelyn Elders, who was fired in 1994 during President Bill Clinton's administration, the Los Angeles Times reported. Steinfeld was also vocal on other controversial issues, arguing that television violence has a bad influence on children, promoting the fluoridation of water and bans on the artificial sweetener cyclamate and the pesticide DDT. Steinfeld later served as the Director of the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Medical Cancer Center and as a professor at the Mayo Medical School. He also was the president of the Medical College of Georgia, in Augusta, from 1983-1987, when he retired. In addition to his two daughters, Steinfeld is survived by another daughter, Jody Stefansson of Pasadena, California; his wife, Gen, of Pomona, California and two grandchildren.","Dr. Jesse Steinfeld was a cancer researcher before serving as Nixon's surgeon general from 1969-73 .

"By . Daniel Bates . An American salesman has eaten 12,000 Big Macs over the last 30 years - and yet appears to be healthy. Dennis Rosinlof says he eats the McDonald’s burger with fries ten times a week - sometimes twice a day - on his travels, and only takes a break on Sundays. But despite having a fondness for the 930 calorie Big Mac meal, Mr Rosinlof is actually a slim 165lbs and healthy. Big Mac-aholic: Dennis Rosinlof has eaten 12,000 McDonald's Big Macs in 30 years, but is apparently healthy . Addicted: Dennis Rosinlof's first meal of the day is a Big Mac at 10.30am when McDonald's opens . He is 64, six feet tall, weighs 11-and-a-half stone and has a good cholesterol level. Mr Rosinlof said: ‘Conservatively, I’ve eaten at least 12,000 Big Macs over the last 30 years. ‘I don’t get tired of it. I look forward to going to McDonald’s every single time.’ Mr Roslinof described the Big Mac as a ‘fantastic sandwich’ and said that he starts the week off on Mondays with one of the burgers on his way home from work. He eats two on Tuesday - one on the way into work then one on the way home - and one on Wednesday for breakfast. On Thursdays he will eat two Big Macs, two on Fridays and always two on Saturdays. His only break is on Sundays when his wife Lauri, 37, cooks him and his family a meal. Consistent: Forget the nuggets or Filets-O-Fish, Dennis Rosinlof loves Big Macs, saying 'It tastes good, so I order the same thing every day.' Mr Rosinlof said: ‘My first meal of the day is always about 10.30am when they open up the Big Macs. ‘I enjoy what I eat and it tastes good so I get the same thing every day’. The former Vietnam army medic is a salesman at a home furnishings company based in Salt Lake City, Utah. His wife is a registered nurse and has tried to urge him to eat more healthily but given he is in good health they have let him be. Mr Rosinlof said: ‘I think part of it has to do with calories. 'A Big Mac meal is 930 calories. Two of them is 1,860 so I’m still under 2,000 calories a day even when I eat twice a day, but I don’t eat a whole lot more than that. ‘I don’t think I’m addicted to Big Macs but my body understands what’s coming when it’s coming and knows what it has to make to get to get rid of it. ‘I think that might be one reason why Big Macs and I get along so well.’ Dietician David Zinczenko said that Mr Roslinof was staying thin because he stayed within his daily calorie intake, even if he was doing it in a rather unconventional manner. He said: ‘What’s missing from his diet are vitamins’. According to the McDonald's nutrition calculator, these fast food favourites have the following number of calories, fat and salt: .

"By . Associated Press . One of two adult sons in a family of four found dead inside a California home in June fatally stabbed his parents before he and the other son died in an arson fire there, police said. 39-year-old Rodney Bowman killed his father, 78-year-old Sarkis Babakhan, and mother, 70-year-old Rozmary Babakhan. Bowman and the other son, 42-year-old Robert Babakhan, then died of exposure to smoke and toxic chemicals from the fire.

"By . Leesa Smith . Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles director Michael Bay expresses disbelief that a poster was designed without his approval featuring the movie’s heroes jumping out of an exploding building under a release date of 9/11. Michael Bay is unimpressed with the blunder . Bay said he was just as upset about the controversial poster shared on Paramount Pictures Australia's Twitter page as the fans were and he made sure he let the studio executives know. 'When I woke up and saw that, I said, ""Are you kidding me?"" That was a silly, dumb mistake,' he said.'Trust me - I yelled at them. Normally everything goes through me, and no one showed me that poster.' Paramount Australia, who deleted the post shortly after when the oversight was pointed out on Tuesday, has apologised for the embarrassing blunder which was met with outrage on social media from the movie's diehard fans. The studio issued a statement saying 'combining that image and date was a mistake'. 'We are deeply sorry to have used that artwork for the marketing materials promoting the September 11 opening in Australia,' the statement said. 'We intended no offence and have taken immediate action to discontinue its use.' Scroll down for video . Controversial: Paramount Australia has sparked outrage after promoting the September 11 release of the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film with a poster showing the heroes falling from an exploding building . Ill-advised: The tweet sharing the promotional poster was quickly met with angry responses on social media - some of which called for those behind the release to lose their jobs . The film, which stars Megan Fox and Johnny Knoxville, is released in August in the United States and October in Europe, but its Australian release date comes exactly 13 years to the day after 19 hijackers took control of four airliners and carried out the deadly September 11 attacks. The controversial poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks, which claimed the lives of 2,996 people. One of the Twitter replies, posted by user @MorningAfterKill said: 'So who's getting fired for this poster art? September 11? Exploding buildings? People falling out of them? Le sigh'. Another message by @AusFestivus added: 'Guys. Sept 11 and exploding buildings is a bad look okay', while a third tweet, by @yilmaz16, said: 'Really 9/11? Jumping out of an exploding building?' Paramount has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster, and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release. Advice: The reason the poster proved controversial was due to the unfortunate release date of September 11 and the use of an exploding building to promote the film . Anger: The poster was shared on Paramount Australia's Twitter page last night, and immediately drew dozens of negative comments from angry film fans . Outrage: Paramount has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster, and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release . Resemblance: The poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks (pictured), which killed 2,996 people in 2001 . After New York's famous Twin Towers were struck by two aircraft coming up to 13 years ago, there was a period of between one and two hours before they collapsed during which dozens if not hundreds of people were seen leaping and falling to their deaths from the burning buildings. Out of the 2,996 people killed in the four coordinated attacks, 11 of them were Australian citizens. As yet Paramount has issued no statement or apology about the controversial poster, nor has it made any explanation of the decision to release the new film on the anniversary of the attacks.","Director Michael Bay insists he did not give final approval for the poster to promote the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film in Australia .

"By . Associated Press . Donald Trump has a message for the two Atlantic City casinos that still bear his name, five years after he gave up anything to do with running them: You're fired. The real estate mogul and reality TV star, who presided over a casino empire in the glory days of Atlantic City, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday demanding that his name be stripped from the remaining two. He told The Associated Press he sued Trump Entertainment Resorts, a descendant of a corporate entity he once controlled, because it has allowed its two Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal, to fall into disrepair, tarnishing his personal brand and confusing customers. Donald Trump has sued Trump Entertainment Resorts, seeking to force the company to remove his name from its two Atlantic City casinos, Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal . Trump claims to have been disconnected from business in Atlantic city for several years and that the name is misleading . 'I want it off both of them,' Trump said in an interview Tuesday evening. 'I've been away from Atlantic City for many years. People think we operate (the company), and we don't. It's not us. It's not me.' It was the latest manifestation of Atlantic City's struggles: One casino closed in January, two others are slated to do so by next month and another is up for a bankruptcy auction on Thursday and will shut down if a buyer doesn't materialize. Trump's lawsuit, filed in state Superior Court in Atlantic County, seeks a court order directing Trump Entertainment Resorts to immediately cure what it terms a breach of Trump's licensing agreement with the company or remove his name from the casinos and the company itself. 'Since Mr. Trump left Atlantic City many years ago, the license entities have allowed the casino properties to fall into an utter state of disrepair and have otherwise failed to operate and manage the casino properties in accordance with the high standards of quality and luxury required under the license agreement,' Trump wrote in his lawsuit, filed in the name of Trump AC Casino Marks LLC. 'The Trump name ... has become synonymous with the highest levels of quality, luxury, prestige and success.' Trump Entertainment Resorts CEO Robert Griffin declined to comment on the lawsuit. Trump appears particularly vexed at the impending closing of Trump Plaza on Sept. 16. In the lawsuit, he asserts Trump Plaza failed two quality review tests carried out by a third-party consulting firm, one in 2012 and the other three weeks ago. Trump alleges the company had allowed the casinos to fall into disrepair and tarnished the real estate mogul's personal brand . Days later, Trump asserts, the company . sent letters to its employees and announced it would close Trump Plaza . in September without notifying him. 'Not . only does the issuance of these WARN notices further harm the Trump . name and brand, but it also underscores the (company's) inability to . remedy the appalling conditions that gave rise to the defaults under the . licensing agreement in the first place,' the lawsuit says. Trump said the casinos fail to meet industry standards regarding hotel services, food and beverage operations and overall cleanliness, which he said guests had been complaining about for years. Trump does not run or control Trump Entertainment Resorts, which was formed after the Trump casino empire emerged from the second of its three bankruptcies. But he retains a 10 percent stake, which enables the company to use his name for licensing purposes. Trump told the AP he has not considered whether to divest his remaining ownership stake in the company.","Claims hotels and casinos have fallen into disrepair .

"By . Leon Watson . Things got very harey for this tourist when she visited a tiny island off Japan that's been overrun with rabbits. After offering them some food, she was chased down a road by a stampede of wild bunnies in this adorable video posted on Reddit.

Stampeding rabbits: Bunnies swarmed around this tourist after she offered them food . Stop rabbiting! The rabbits ran from all directions to chase after the woman . From 1929 to 1945, more than 6,000 . tons of poison gas were manufactured on the remote island, and the . program was shrouded in secrecy. For 16 years, Okunoshima was left off maps, and workers who produced . the five types of poison gas - which were mostly used in warfare in . China - were told to keep the factories a secret. But somewhere along the line rabbits were introduced and - as rabbits tend to do - they bred fast. Some sources claim they were brought to the island to test the effects of the poison and released by workers when the war ended. Others sources say that a group of schoolchildren on a field trip released eight of the animals in 1971. Now tourists flock to the 2.5 mile wide Inland Sea island off the coast of Takehara to feed and pet the hundreds of bunnies that call it home. And it's easy to see why.

"By . Ryan Lipman . After Queensland mother-of-three and certified lactation consultant  Meg Nagle posted photos of herself breastfeeding on Facebook, she was outraged when the page she used to support other mothers was suspended. The Milk Meg Facebook page was closed for at least 24 hours last year prompting Ms Nagle, of the Sunshine Coast, to coin the term lactaboobiephobia; a fear of women breastfeeding. 'One photo was reported and just the photo was taken down. When a second photo was reported the page was temporarily suspended,' the American-born 32-year-old told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Meg Nagle, pictured with her youngest of three sons, is a certified lactation consultant and runs a blog and Facebook page about breastfeeding . Informed the photos violated Facebook's photo policy, they were permanently removed from the page by Facebook when it was reactivated. While Mrs Nagel said she believes Facebook's polices have since changed to allow images of breastfeeding, she was outraged at that time. 'When that happened I was so frustrated by that. I was just thinking about this whole thing and how people have an issue with it, this fear of breastfeeding. 'The term just popped into my head, because of my psychology background, and I took a liking to it.' Using her professional blog about breastfeeding, Mrs Nagle wrote a post about the experience in March last year and believes she was the first person in the world to coin the term after a Google search at the time found nothing. After posting images of herself breastfeeding on Facebook more than a year ago, the page was suspended for about 24 hours . 'I purposely searched online to make sure it wasn't anywhere and at the time it wasn't out there at all.' Since then a documentary filmmaker has approached her to work on a 10-minute piece about the incident and her blog response. Filmed earlier this year, the documentary will be released online later this year. In the past Mrs Nagle said she has experienced lactaboobiephobia, including when a man asked her to breastfeed in a toilet. The incident happened a few years ago while she was breastfeeding her second son in the U.S. 'I was sitting in a cafe in America, but it happens in Australia too,' she said. 'A man said: ""You know there's a toilet down the hall"", and then he said it again. The 32-year-old coined the term lactaboobiephobia around a fear of women breastfeeding, following the Facebook incident . 'I asked: ""If I was feeding my baby with a bottle that would be OK?"" and he said: ""Yes that would be fine"". It was a horrible experience but you get that in life.' With nothing more to say, Mrs Nagle left the cafe. 'You hear about it in the media all the time. Most people don't even think twice when they see a woman breastfeeding, but on the odd occasion it does happen. Mrs Nagle said after the birth of her first son, who is now 11, she had a lot of support with breastfeeding. But it was not until the birth of her third son two years ago that she decided to make a career out of support other women with breastfeeding. Studying nursing at the time and having already been a volunteer breastfeeding councillor for seven years, the move was a natural fit and also allowed her to draw on her previous psychology studies. The 32-year-old said she had experienced lactaboobiephobia when a man at a cafe asked her to breastfeed in a toilet . Mrs Nagle said the demand for lactation consultants was growing and that Australia and the U.S. have the largest numbers of consultants. 'I think it's really difficult with breastfeeding because there is so much information out there,' she said. 'Sometimes women don't get support in hospital or if they do, they don't get the support when they get home. 'I come from the philosophy of testing you own instincts as a mother and following the lead of the baby... I give women as many different suggestions as I can.' She said there was no black and white approach to breastfeeding. Mrs Nagle, pictured with two of her three sons, said there was no black and white approach to breastfeeding . 'Women will find some things work better than others. Different women will experience different things - its about listening to instincts. 'Finding that support that really is in line with their own parent philosophy is important. Following the lead of the baby without strict schedules and encouraging women to choose what feels right for them from a range of options are the basis of Mrs Nagle's approach to breastfeeding. She added that in western cultures, there was often a lack of support around breastfeeding as part of the shift away from community living. She has used social media and her blog to build a community of mothers, with nearly 15,000 likes on her Facebook. 'I've built a big community of mums who feel like my philosophies are something they relate to,' she said. As part of her work as a lactation consultant, Mrs Nagle has used social media and a blog to connect with breastfeeding mothers . 'Facebook is amazing for mums to share information and get support - it's about mums helping each other. Still breastfeeding her youngest son, two, Mrs Nagle said it made it even easier for other breastfeeding mothers to relate to her. 'I think it's really important for me as a mum to be sharing my own experiences,' she said. 'It's really helpful to share stories and my own breastfeeding experiences.' Thanks to her work with breastfeeding mothers, Mrs Nagle has been nominated for the 2014 National AusMumpreneur Awards in the blog and emerging AusMumpreneur categories. 'It's great I get really supportive feedback from mums,' she said. 'I get lots of good feedback on Facebook.'","Queensland mother-of-three Meg Nagle is a certified lactation consultant .

"By . Mike Dawes . England's Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch were satisfied with Commonwealth Games silver despite having led the women's synchronised 10-metre platform heading into the last round. The Plymouth pair were in front after four of their five dives on day one of the diving competition at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh. But, in a competitive field missing only China from the 2013 World Championships podium in the event, were overtaken on the final dive as Canada's Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion won gold with a score of 310.65.

Barrow and Couch finished with a score of 306.96 and Malaysia's Pamg Pandelela Rinong and Sabri Nur Dhabitah, with 300.12, claimed bronze. Couch said: 'We were competing against silver and bronze medallists from the Worlds (in 2013 in Barcelona). We're really pleased to come second. 'We thought we might come fifth. We're really pleased with silver. 'We haven't been training the best this week. We went into competition and pulled it out the bag.' There was a delayed start to the second event of the day due to a technical issue related to the judges' electronic scoring systems. It meant the divers could not follow their progress on the scoreboard. Like fish to water: Couch and Barrow were brilliant off the 10m platform at the Royal Commonwealth Pool .

'We had an inkling that we were leading,' Barrow said. 'Normally we do our last dive pretty well, so a little bit disappointed with that. 'They (the judges) didn't seem to be on our side.

"By . Nicky Harley . Homeowners were fed up with their council's refusal to fix potholes outside their houses - so they ordered the tarmac and did it themselves. After a year long fight to fix 100 potholes on a 100 metre stretch of road, six pensioners, of Pudsey, Leeds, took matters into their own hands and repaired them themselves. The men refused to take no for an answer when Leeds City Council highways bosses declined to carry out the work on the basis it is a private unadopted road. Scroll down for video . Homeowners Dave Hunt, Chris McNamara and Glynn Crampton (pictured)  are mending their own roads . Pensioners in Pudsey, Leeds, have been forced to fix their own potholes due to a wrangle with the council . So the neighbours, with an average age of 75, ordered a ton of tarmac and set to work filling in the huge potholes armed with a heavy duty concrete garden roller, shovels, rakes and brushes. David Horn, 77, who lives on the affected Crawshaw Gardens, said: 'We decided enough is enough. 'There has been much discussion with Leeds City Council over the years and although it is an unadopted road, we feel they could help us out. 'There are 14 houses here and we all pay council tax. It seems ridiculous that we have to pay for our own road repairs too. 'Over the years we have repaired numerous holes several times.' The residents claim the road had 100 potholes and some were 6ft wide. They have been in discussions with the council for a year to get the potholes fixed. Local MP Stuart Andrew has been out to visit the road but informed the men that there was little the council could do as it is 'unadopted' - which means the council does not own the road and is not liable for maintenance. The pensioners claim they fixed 100 potholes on the short stretch of road outside their homes . Retired teacher Chris McNamara, 64, who filled in the holes, said: 'We are not necessarily picking a fight with the council, but most people here are elderly, some in their 80s or 90s. 'We are mending the road. We all pay our council tax.' Glynn Crampton, 70, who has been responsible for sealing the holes, added: 'They could be dangerous which is why we decided to fill them in ourselves.' The group is due to meet with Councillor Richard Lewis to see if any help is available. A Leeds City Council spokesman said it was 'unadopted' but was unable to comment further. Councils are not liable to repair damaged roads which are unadopted or privately owned.

"By . Sam Peters . An idyllic sun-kissed cricket ground on the south coast of England could hardly have felt further away from a conflict so bitter and entrenched it is almost impossible to pass comment without being branded either sympathiser or extremist. But, through the action of a British-born Muslim wearing two bracelets proclaiming ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ on his left wrist, the consciousness of an audience of cricket fans was pricked on Monday. While Moeen Ali received a smack on the wristband from the ICC and former England fast bowler Steve Harmison toed the ‘sport and politics don’t mix’ line, few others in Southampton appeared outraged.

Agree or disagree, many were . encouraged that a sportsman — who proclaims himself ‘proud to be British . and proud to be Muslim’ — should have the moral courage to make a . statement in a world where media-control is king. Moeen . is the antithesis of the modern sportsmen so often criticised for being . vacuous. While they spout cliches and only seem to care about sport and . material possessions, this man is different. He . is intelligent and aware of what’s going on in the world. In a recent . interview with this newspaper, he said: ‘Religion is very important to . me. One of my aims is to try to show that you can have faith and play . cricket. There can be a lot of negativity and misunderstanding of Islam. ‘I feel my job as a Muslim . is to change that and show people what my faith is really like. A lot . of what is said and written is ridiculous, but that’s life. I just get . on with it and try to be as positive as I can.’ From . the response of the majority in cricket on Tuesday, it seems there is a . significant difference between Moeen backing charities looking to . provide humanitarian support in a war zone and Nicolas Anelka’s cynical . use of the ‘quenelle’  gesture — an overtly anti-Semitic sign — and the .

ICC’s high-handed diktat that he must remove his wristbands will do . little to stop other like-minded cricketers following Moeen’s lead. ‘If . I was Moeen, I wouldn’t mind getting fined if people realise what’s . going on and one life is saved,’ said former Pakistan and current Surrey . all-rounder Azhar Mahmood. ‘All we can do is make people aware.

"By . Cindy Tran . The last thing Sydney drivers want is another distraction on the road. New plans to raise revenue by selling ad space on roads will go ahead for six months on Parramatta's busiest street but critics say it will be six months of dangerous distraction. Parramatta Council have approved a six month trial from Road Ads to paint two advertisement signs on Argyle Street near the Westfield shopping centre. Scroll down for video . The idea was previously done in Bombala on the south coast of NSW and Mayor Bob Stewart said it was a great success and helped raised revenue . The plan was not supported by police and Roads and Maritime Services but a Parramatta Council spokesman said the six-month trial will see whether the concept has any merit. 'Safety is our top priority. We want to reduce the financial burden on our ratepayers and it makes sense to at least consider new funding sources,' the spokesman said. Australian company Road Ads have been lobbying local councils to license the idea and companies will bid for the road space at $4000 per ad. Ads will not be painted near traffic lights, black spots or 'decision-making zones' and will only contain brand logo with no contact details or any signalling to traffic. Lord Mayor John Chedid told The Sun that the company was 'certified by the government' and offered Parramatta a 'perfect opportunity.' 'We could get $50,000 within two months if the model works and it's safe. I think we should trial it on every road in our local government area,' Mr Chedid said.

"By . Frank Coletta . He’s a Federal Liberal Party MP who represents one of Australia’s most diverse Sydney electorates and Craig Laundy has pulled no punches today by stating he is very much ‘pro-Palestinian’. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, he has not only made his support of the Palestinian plight in Gaza very clear but has also urged his party to change ‘alter its views’. Mr Laundy’s electorate of Reid in Sydney is a diverse electorate, very much split along the lines of blue and white collar residents. It ranges from the affluent suburbs of Drummoyne, Five Dock and Abbotsford in the city’s inner west to Muslim dominated areas of Auburn and Lidcombe in the western suburbs. Scroll down for video . Self-confessed 'pro-Palestinian' MP Craig Laundy says too many of his Liberal Party colleagues 'hide behind words' rather than backing a solution to the conflict in Gaza. He told the AFR that his constituents (there is an 18% Muslim population in his area) are complaining about his party’s stance and often, suggesting that ‘they feel we have been too quiet on it (the war in Gaza)’. Mr Laundy, who won the seat by a slender . margin over his ALP counterpart at the 2013 federal poll, also took a . swipe at Labor MP Laurie Ferguson, for choosing the end of the holy . month of Ramadan to criticise Israel but claims Australia’s influential . role within the United Nations Security Council should be used to find . an answer to the ongoing territorial battle between the Palestinians and .

The death toll in the region has continued to rise and up to 32 bodies were recovered from under rubble after heavy fighting in one area. Palestinian Hamas supporters take to the streets, chanting anti-Israel slogans. The Federal Member for Reid says both parties of guilty of ‘paying lip service’ to a possible resolution. He is a staunch  supporter of a ‘two-state solution’. While Mr Laundy is the only one to have spoken publicly, he does have some support from within but other Federal Liberal MPs have, so far, refused to be named. One senior MP, however, has also admitted Labor was ‘outplaying’ the Liberal Party on the issue. On the issue of statehood, Mr Laundy says it’s time that Australia joined forces with a growing number of representatives within the UN who are now voting ‘yes’ with Palestine.","MP claims he's facing a backlash from the Muslim population in Western Sydney .

"Glen Turner was shot and killed on a property near Moree in northern NSW over an environmental dispute . The 79-year-old Moree wheat farmer accused of the shooting murder of a state government worker has been hit with two new charges and will remain behind bars. Ian Robert Turnbull was refused bail after two further charges were laid against him at Moree Local Court on Tuesday. Glen Turner was allegedly shot dead by Mr Turnbull on Talga Lane, near Moree in north-west NSW, about 5.40pm on July 29. Mr Turnbull is accused of also assaulting Mr Turner's colleague Robert Strange on the same day, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The farmer had allegedly stopped his car next to the environmental compliance officers, who were both carrying out an on site inspection, before he armed himself with a rifle and opened fire. Mr Turner was allegedly shot several times before he was found by police. Mr Turnbull was arrested five hours later at a nearby property. Mr Turnbull will return to court in September. Mr Turner was working for the department and is survived by his wife Alison and their two children, aged nine and 10. Scroll down for video . The state government worker was shot as he served a notice to an elderly man accused of illegally chopping down trees in the Croppa Creek area . Mr Turnbull had previously been served notices by Mr Turner for illegally clearing vegetation on his property and in the Croppa Creek area. The Land and Environment Court had ordered the farmer to remediate the land after it found the Native Title Vegetation Act had been breached. In the wake of the tragedy, Mr Turnbull's family hope to see the legislation changed so farmers have more control over how they clear their land after persistent calls from farming communities. The family member said Mr Turnbull was the 'respected elder' who people into the community turned too and not a 'hermit'. 'He was out in the community - he was helping to build old people's homes, he was collecting trampolines at school fetes, he did Meals on Wheels,' the family member told The Daily Telegraph. 'He has held this all in, he has crumbled, he has tried to carry this all to himself.' The Turnbulls said the tragedy had catastrophic impacts for both families and offered their condolences to the Turners. They added that the death was not right and Mr Turner's children had been robbed of their father. Police and paramedics were called to a Croppa Creek property about 55 kilometres north of Moree on the Newell Highway, where they found the body of the victim late on Tuesday afternoon. A post-mortem will be held to determine exactly how the 51-year-old died. He was informing Mr Turnbull that there would be a formal inspection of his property in relation to the suspected illegally clearing of vegetation before the incident occurred. Another worker was with the victim when he was shot, a department source who did not wish to be named said. The other worker is understood to be in shock but is otherwise uninjured. Friends of the alleged shooter have described Mr Turnbull as even-tempered but admitted the whole town knew that he had cleared too many trees. The wheat farmer owned five properties in the area and the shooting took place about a kilometre from one of those. Moree Plains Shire mayor Katrina Humphries said the shooting highlighted the volatile issue of land clearing in northern NSW. The 79-year-old Moree man who was arrested at a nearby property had been served previous notices for illegal clearing on his land and around the Croppa Creek area (pictured) Environmental issues including land clearing and coal seam gas exploration have been a source of frustration in the rural community, she said. 'This is why I say, and I am not saying it flippantly and I mean it, I am not surprised this has happened,' she said. 'Because I know people have been pushed and pushed and pushed. This is their life and this is their livelihood,' Ms Humphries said. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce agreed with these comments, and said this was a tragedy but not an isolated incident, just the worst one. Northern NSW ecologist Phil Spark said the farmer had cleared about 100 hectares of land. 'And a lot of that is koala habitat so that has been a real conflict between conservation and this farmer having the right to clear his land,' he told ABC Radio. The NSW Public Service Association says the tragedy highlights the need for better risk assessment. 'The protection of the environment is an issue that generates great passion with strong feelings on both sides of the argument,' acting general secretary Steve Turner said in a statement. NSW Environment Minister Rob Stokes said he was deeply saddened by the death.","Ian Robert Turnbull, 79, of Moree, faces two new charges, including the assault of another environmental officer .

"By . Sarah Dean . The Australian parents of a toddler with an aggressive brain tumour who were forced to fly to the US for life-saving treatment costing $200,000 say they still haven't received any funding from the Federal Government. Edwin Ho, wife Rochelle Luk and their son Edric have now returned to their home in Perth after flying to the US in May for targeted proton beam therapy, which is not available in Australia. Little Edric looked happy to be home as he crawled across the airport floor giggling after the family got off the plane. His parents previously accused the Government of refusing to fund Edric's much needed treatment because of budget cuts. Scroll down for video . Smiling again: Edric has returned from the US after having life-saving treatment for his aggressive brain tumour . This week they told Channel Seven they are still waiting for help despite the treatment being successful. 'We feel disappointed we didn't get any funding but we're still fighting,' Mr Ho said as the family arrived at Perth airport. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Department of Health for comment. In May, Edric's parents claimed the therapy was their toddler's best chance of survival. However, the Government said he should have the more standard treatment that is already available in Australia. The family said pleas for funding from the Federal Health Department's Medical Treatment Overseas Program had been rejected. Edwin Ho and his son Edric flew to the US in May for targeted proton beam therapy, which is not available in Australia . Struggle: Edric needed treatment for an aggressive brain tumour and doctors say his best chance of survival is with special treatment in the US . They were forced to borrow from friends and family to get their son treated at the University of Florida. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told previously Daily Mail Australia that the decision not to fund the overseas treatment came from a 'preliminary assessment which at this stage denies the treatment'. 'One of the main criteria for treatment overseas is that it can't be performed in Australia. Patients with the same condition are currently being treated in Australia,' she said. 'If doctors or the family can come back with further information before a final decision is made then it will be considered.' Battle: Edric's parents have been forced to borrow from friends and family to get their son treated at the University of Florida . However, the family claim the conformal photon radiotherapy treatment being offered to them in Australia has 'horrible side effects'. Little Edric, who previously had a tumour half the size of his brain removed in an operation, has also been recommended for the special treatment abroad by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists. He is suffering from an anaplastic ependymoma - a tumour that forms when cells in the central nervous system (in his case the brain) begin to multiple rapidly. 'It was devastating': Edric's mother Rochelle said finding out her son was sick was 'every parent's worst nightmare' The experts said the best treatment for Edric was unavailable in Australia and other treatments delivered much bigger areas of low dose radiation to brain tissue that could be harmful. Describing the moment they found out Edric was seriously ill, his father Edwin told Seven News: 'He was normal one week and paralysed the next.' At 18-months, he stopped walking and lost the use of his right hand. 'It was devastating. It was the worst nightmare of a parent,' his mother Rochelle said. The hospitals who have been treating Edric in Australia so far - the Sir Charles Gairdner and Princess Margaret hospitals - said they would appeal against the decision not to fund his overseas treatment. Location: Edric's parents will take him to the University of Florida for treatment on Sunday .","Edwin Ho and wife Rochelle Luk flew their son to the US in May .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Snapchat is reportedly in talks with investors, including Alibaba Group Holding, for financing that could value the company at $10 billion (£5.9 billion). The California-based app, which lets users send messages that disappear after a few seconds, last year turned down a $3 billion (£1.8 billion) offer from Facebook. At the time, Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel said Mark Zuckerberg warned him Facebook planned to launch a rival service unless he sold.

Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel (left) said Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg warned him he planned to launch a rival service unless he sold . Google then allegedly offered $4 billion (£2.4 billion) for the company but was similarly rejected. The terms of the latest funding round may change, according to a report by Bloomberg, who said that it had spoken to sources close to the company. Sarah Perez at TechCrunch points out that Tencent, makers of WeChat and an Alibaba competitor, are a covert investor in Snapchat. If Alibaba does invest in the app, it could intensify competition between the two groups as they battle it out to become leaders in China’s tech industry. Snapchat is reportedly in talks with investors, including Alibaba Group Holding, for financing that could value the company at $10 billion (£5.9 billion) Instagram has launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt. The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. Snapchat is continuing to grow in popularity, with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day. Last month, Facebook acted on its warning by launching Slingshot, a similar smartphone app, in the hope of replicating Snapchat’s success. The app allows consumers to exchange photos and videos, which will later disappear, without requiring Facebook accounts. But despite its rapid growth, Snapchat has had a number of obstacles to contend with. The group this year settled charges with U.S. regulators, which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time. According to the Federal Trade Commission at the time, photos sent on Snapchat could, in fact, be saved by recipients using several methods. Neither Snapchat nor Hangzhou-based e-commerce group, Alibaba, were available for comment. Tencent, makers of WeChat and an Alibaba competitor, are a covert investor in Snapchat.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Two Australian surfers have conquered one of the world's biggest and most dangerous waves off the Western Australia coast at the same time - and captured the whole thing on camera. As if surfing the wave was not a big enough task, fromer pro surfer Mark Mathews, 31, and current pro Taj Burrow, 36, wanted to push surf photography to its limits by shooting the most dangerous image ever taken. Towed by a jet ski, the pair dropped into the wave known as The Right together on Friday, August 1, reported Redbull.com. Scroll down for video . Australian surfers (from left) Taj Burrows and Mark Matthews surfed and filmed their experience on one of the world's most dangerous waves off the Western Australia coast . Ferocious: Known as The Right, the wave's barrel can get so large it can easily fit two surfers inside . Going to extreme lengths to complete a life long dream, Mathews filmed the experience which proved just how violent the wave can be. In the video posted on Rebull.com, it states a photo of a wave of The Right's magnitude has never been attempted. The footage shows the men surfing the infamous wave's gigantic barrel before crashing down and wiping both men out. From Mathews' hand-held camera, he was able to catch a bird's eye view from inside the barrel as it began collapsing and swallowing Burrow. Inside the barrel, Matthews used a held-hand camera to capture Burrows surfing the wave . To get to the gigantic wave, the men were towed by jet ski . With the ferocity of the beastly wave evident from the footage, The Right is reportedly the last wave in the world that has not be paddled by a surfer and produces more two or three-wave hold downs than any other, which can be deadly. A wave hold down is when a surfer is held under water by two or three successive waves breaking over them. Despite the risks, because of The Right's massive barrel, it is ideal for surf photography because it can easily fit two surfers inside it. During filming, Matthews was wiped out and suffered a gash to his face and ruptured eardrum . The Right is capable of producing three-wave hold downs, which keep surfers under water as successive waves break over them . In their pursuit for the perfect shot, both surfers encountered the wrath of the wave, with Mathews being dumped and suffering a ruptured eardrum and cut to his face. While Mathews had previously surfed the wave, Burrow had not. A full story of the surfer's exploits at The Right will air in a mini-documentary on Redbull.com and Stab Magazine later this month. Calm before the storm: While Matthews had surfed the wave before, Burrows had no experience with it . Despite the risks with surfing The Right, the men were determined to conquer it .","Two Australians surfed one of the world's most dangerous waves .

"By . Andy Dolan . Jailed: Graham Burgess, 46, who tried to hire a hitman to kill his partner of 20 years in a bid to collect on his life insurance policy . A debt-ridden lorry driver hired a hitman to kill his partner of 20 years so he could pocket her £215,000 life insurance. However he was caught after the man he believed would do the job was revealed to be an undercover police officer. During one of four video-taped meetings, 46-year-old Graham Burgess said he wanted the mother-of-two run over and killed as she crossed a road outside her work. He told the man ‘I need my missus dead’, adding: ‘If I had the balls, I would do it myself.’ He hoped that police would conclude that Alison Trigg, 45, had been the victim of a hit and run motorist. Burgess was jailed for six years after a judge heard he had agreed to pay the officer £10,000 to carry out the task. He admitted soliciting a person to murder. Stafford Crown Court also heard that Burgess – who had run up £112,000 of debt – planned to move his mistress into their home in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, and that he had been bragging in the pub about plans to kill Miss Trigg. Judge Paul Glenn told him: ‘The callousness of your actions beggars belief. It must have been a terrible shock for Miss Trigg to find out your plans and the emotional effect on the lady must have been enormous.’ The method by which Burgess was put in touch with the police officer, identified only as 'J' in court, was not made public, although the Daily Mail understands he had admitted contacting another potential hitman, who had got cold feet, before meeting the police officer. The court heard he had also been heard bragging in a pub about wanting to kill his partner. Police also discovered that in the months before his contact with the hitman, the lorry driver had maximised life insurance policies for his partner to ensure that her death would see him receive a substantial payout – and had urged the officer to kill Miss Trigg before she paid the £3,000 fee for a university course she had committed to. But he was arrested after his plan backfired and police officers approached Miss Trigg on the morning she was supposed to be killed and took her to safety. Prosecutor Robert Price told the court the defendant and victim had lived together for most of their 20 years as an item. He added: ‘The defendant was a lorry driver who was leading a double life. He had amassed very large debts and kept them hidden from his partner. ‘By November he owed £112,000, he had even taken out a second mortgage on their home without Miss Trigg knowing. ‘The bailiffs started knocking and Miss Trigg told Mr Burgess she couldn’t live with him with all of the financial pressure hanging over him. ‘She also started to suspect he was having an affair. ‘Out of the blue, in October, the defendant told his partner that he had made inquiries about a joint life insurance policy. ‘The defendant said his mum’s death had caused him to make the inquiries. The policy meant that Mr Burgess would receive £215,000 in the event of his partner’s death.’ Stafford Crown Court: The court heard that Burgess – who had run up £112,000 of debt – planned to move his mistress into their home in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, and that he had been bragging in the pub about his plans . Mr Price said J then contacted Burgess on November 7 and Burgess provided the officer with a £500 deposit. A source told the Daily Mail: ‘Burgess told J to give him a missed call once the murder was done, so he could order some computers in his wife’s name, knowing full well that she wouldn’t be around to pay for them.’ Defending Burgess, Sailesh Mehta said the majority of Burgess’s debts were from second mortgage and a £5,000 credit card. After the hearing, Detective Superintendent Dave Mellor, from Staffordshire Police, said Burgess had spent considerable time thinking about how he could dispose of his partner.’","Graham Burgess was caught after trying to hire an undercover police officer .

"By . John Hutchinson . A pop culture lover has found an innovative way to bring music albums to life. Photographer Bob Egan superimposes the classic covers onto the exact London location where they were shot. Using various clues from album covers, mixed with Google Streetview, Egan finds the street, and then brings the memorable album cover to life. He has to be meticulous with his angles, but can do little to guarantee the exact lighting. The Beatles' Abbey Road album cover from 1969 evokes memories of a time when the group really did rule the world - yet something as simple as crossing a road remains etched on the mind. Oasis set their own trend in the 1990s, and their album cover for (What's The Story) Morning Glory? was also simple, yet effective and memorable. Here we take a look at these and some other creations from the New York-based photographer, whose other work can be seen on his PopSpots website. By working out the angles, Egan super-imposes The Beatles' Abbey Road album onto the present-day location. The cover was designed by Apple Records creative director Kosh. It is the only original UK Beatles album sleeve to show neither the artist name nor the album title on its front cover, which was Kosh's idea, despite EMI claiming the record would not sell without this information. He later explained that 'we didn't need to write the band's name on the cover - They were the most famous band in the world.' Famous: The world-recognised album Abbey Road by The Beatles; Egan then finds the exact location which is just outside the world famous Abbey Road Studios, in Westminster, London . Iconic: Oasis broke new ground in the 1990s with their album (What's The Story) Morning Glory? and here it is brought to life on Berwick Street in London's Soho . Trend-setters: The Clash defined British punk and formed in 1976 with this self-titled album. The cover artwork was designed by Polish artist Roslaw Szaybo. The album’s front cover photo, shot by Kate Simon, was taken in the alleyway directly opposite the front door of the band’s ‘Rehearsal Rehearsals’ building in Camden Market. Drummer Terry Chimes, though a full member of The Clash at the time, did not appear in the picture as he had already decided to leave the group. Captured: Egan managed to fade out the garish red sign on Heddon Street, London, so that K.West from the original Bowie cover for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars is prominent .

"A grandmother who used to eat 4,000 calories a day and weighed twice as much as a baby elephant shed more than 20st after she overheard a nurse say to a colleague: 'If I ever get that fat, shoot me'. Sue Callear tipped the scales at a 35st at her heaviest and was classed as super-morbidly obese - meaning she could have died at any time. The 50-year-old’s body mass index (BMI) was a staggering 79 - almost four-and-a-half times the recommended 18.5 for a healthy adult. Scroll down for video . Sue Callear, pictured in 2010, with her grandson Jack, shortly after his birth, weighed 35st at her heaviest . Sue has dropped an incredible 20st from 35st (left) to 15st (right) after having a gastric sleeve fitted . She even had to make her own clothes using two-and-a-half metres of material. Sue also broke several beds and had to use special heavy-duty handrails to drag herself upstairs at her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs. The care worker ballooned in weight after she was bullied about her size at school and she continued to pile on the pounds as a adult, consuming more than 4,000 calories a day. She also gorged on crisps, sweets and pop for hours every night slumped in front of the television. Sue eventually decided to battle the bulge after she went into University Hospital of North Staffordshire for cellutitis and overheard a nurse tell a colleague: 'If I ever get that fat, shoot me'. The mother-of-one borrowed £12,000 from her father and went under the knife to have a gastric sleeve fitted at the same hospital in October 2011. And incredibly, she has lost an incredible 20st in three years and is now 15st and a size 18. Granmother-of-two Sue, who lives with her husband Ken, 46, said: 'I was basically trapped in my own body. 'Like a huge blob I sat there in my armchair, unable to move unaided with all my grandson’s toys at my feet. Sue, pictured with her husband Ken, at their wedding in 1988, was so large she had to make her own clothes using two-and-a-half metres of material . 'I suddenly realised to my horror if I did nothing I would never be able to play with him. 'Then another time on holiday as he played on the beach I wept when I thought I would always have to watch from the back of the car because it was so hard to get out. 'I wouldn’t go outdoors because of the cruel abuse. The worst came from kids but some was from those who should know better. 'I was having hospital treatment for cellulitis and overheard one nurse telling another ‘if I ever get that fat, shoot me’. I broke down in tears and just knew I had to change my life. 'Last week Cory was four and thanks to this wonderful operation I have been able to go crabbing in rock pools and build sand castles with him.' Sue eventually decided to battle the bulge after she went into University Hospital of North Staffordshire for cellutitis and overheard a nurse tell a colleague: 'If I ever get that fat, shoot me' Incredibly, the change was so astonishing that her sister-in-law Jayne Callear didn’t even recognise Sue. The 49-year-old, who works at a local newsagents, said: 'I didn’t even know she was having it so I failed to recognise who I was serving. 'Then I noticed her eyes and we hugged and both wept to know her ordeal was over.' Daughter-in-law Joanne Callear, 28, added: 'Before the op she was very self-conscious. 'She didn’t want to go out because sometimes people would stare and make comments. Now she is a completely different person.' At her heaviest, Sue shut herself away from the world and only spoke to her husband Ken and son Nick, 28, because of her embarrassment about being so large. But now she has been able to get her first job in six years working for a home care company and is able to walk her nine-year-old old Alsatian Kizzy miles around the local park. Breakfast: Nothing . Snacks: Biscuits, crisps and sweets (1,500 calories) Lunch: Fish and chips with cream cake for dessert (838 +230 = 1,068 calories) Dinner: Chicken omelette and chips with four slices of white bread and butter (364 + 951 + 356 = 1,671 calories) TOTAL CALORIES: 4,239 . Breakfast: Two poached eggs (128 calories) Lunch: One ham sandwich on wholemeal bread (224 calories) Dinner: A piece of cod with a serving of peas and carrots (158 + 83 = 241 calories) Snacks: Nothing . TOTAL CALORIES: 593 . The transformation has also seen Sue . conquer diabetes, high cholesterol, raised blood pressure, back pain, . sleep apnoea and clinical depression. Before . the operation she used to take 20 tablets a day for the illnesses but . she is now only on a handful of vitamins and mineral supplements. Sue added: 'The op saved was self-funded and it saved my life. 'Before I didn’t have a life, I didn’t leave my house for nearly three years. I just sat in my chair eating and watching TV. 'Now I can walk for miles and love going to the beach at our caravan in Anglesey. 'It has given me a totally new life.' Sue owes her second chance to pioneering weight-loss surgeon Chandra Cheruvu at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

Now the surgery which saved Sue from an early grave is set to be offered on the NHS to hundreds more people in Staffordshire every year. The hospital is poised to appoint two more weight-loss surgeons to increase the number of patients undergoing the procedure from 170 to 400 a year . Mr Cheruvu said: 'Mrs Callear is a perfect example of how someone’s life can change completely. 'Britain is the most obese country in Europe and Stoke-on-Trent is among the worst cities in the UK. There really is a crisis. 'In fact, since 2012 obesity has replaced smoking as the biggest cause of death. 'Surgery costs the NHS £8,000 so just by curing a person’s diabetes - let alone the other 40 health conditions caused by obesity - it pays for itself in two years and saves money for a further 30 years.

"By . James Slack . Britain is in the grip of a ‘deep institutional crisis’ with trust in government, parliament and politicians at an ‘all-time low’, according to an internationally respected survey. It has led to the UK having one of the lowest political participation rates in the developed world – and even scoring below Palestine and Iraq. Researchers said other institutions in Britain have suffered a decline in trust including the police, the church, the banks and the media. The 2011 riots: The London riots two years ago were 'a consequence of an institutional breakdown,' researchers found . The study by The Economist Intelligence Unit measured the health of democracy in 167 countries around the world. Britain scored relatively healthily for having open and free elections. But its score for the number of people participating in politics – just over six out of ten – was alarmingly low. The MPs’ expenses scandal, the handling of the Libor-rate rigging by the banks and other controversies were blamed for damaging public trust. And the researchers warned that the inner-city riots during the summer of 2011 had ‘provided a glimpse of the unpredictable consequences of institutional breakdown’. Last November, only 15 per cent of the public bothered to take part in elections for police and crime commissioners. Turnout for a string of Parliamentary by-elections has fallen below 50 per cent. Faith crisis: David Cameron and Nick Clegg, pictured in London yesterday, face an 'institutional crisis' where trust in their cabinet, parliament and politicians in general has slumped to an all time low . According to the Intelligence Unit, the participation rate in British politics was ranked below all of the major powers in Europe, and a string of nations which were not even considered to have fully functioning democracies. These included Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Tunisia and Namibia. For all categories in the study, which also included civil liberties, the UK was ranked 16th out of 167 countries in 2012, placing it towards the bottom of the 25 nations considered a ‘full democracy’. But The Economist magazine’s researchers said it would have been lower, had it not been for ‘deteriorating conditions elsewhere’. These included a loss of democratic accountability in countries hit by the eurozone crisis, which have been forced to take orders from Brussels. The UK was ranked below the Netherlands (10th), Ireland (13th) and Germany (14th). In a damning indictment of the political class, the researchers warned that the UK is ‘beset by a deep institutional crisis’. They said: ‘Problems are reflected across many elements – voter turnout, political party membership, the willingness of citizens to engage in politics and their attitudes towards it. Trust in government, parliament and politicians is at an all-time low.’ Trust lost: Researchers said one of the reasons Britain has no faith in chancellor George Osborne (left) and fellow members of Cabinet was the scandal involving bankers' manipulation of Libor interest rates under Barclays CEO Bob Diamond (right) The report suggests it is unsurprising that voters are losing faith in politicians. ‘Over the past few years the British public’s mistrust of politicians, and ruling institutions more generally, has had ample cause to deepen, amid a series of scandals ranging from parliamentary expenses and “cash-for-questions” to Libor-fixing and payment protection scams, phone-hacking and police cover-ups,’ it says. Politicians have faced criticism for failing fully to clean-up their act in the wake of the revelations they had been milking the taxpayer through fraudulent expenses claims and second-home allowances. And there has been widespread concern among consumer groups at the failure of the Government fully to hold the bankers to account for triggering the financial crash. The researchers, based in London, also commented on the 2011 riots. ‘The elite reaction to the riots was a warning of what can happen when society’s institutions are no longer clear what they stand for and do not function as they should,’ the report says. ‘The initial failure of the authorities to respond to the breakdown of law and order on the streets of London provided a glimpse of the unpredictable consequences of institutional breakdown.’ The researchers warned of more problems ahead. ‘The gulf between the country’s citizens and the political elite is a cause of concern given the depressed state of the economy, and the gloomy outlook,’ they said. ‘The Coalition is still in the early stages of implementing the deepest sustained period of real-term public spending restraint since 1945. ‘There is a clear risk of escalating resentment among affected groups, particularly if further state support is offered to the deeply unpopular financial sector.’","UK trust in government, parliament and politicians at an 'all-time' low .

Keeping the Brits abroad stereotype alive, some 24 per cent of 2,000 people questioned opted for a boozy break as their preferred type of trip. However, the majority of holidaymakers said sunshine and warm weather were top of their holiday requirements list – with 64 per cent putting these as their main priority when booking a break away. Boozy breaks: 25% of Brits say pubs, bars and clubs are what they look for when they book a holiday . In second place, 60 per cent of travellers cited sites of local culture, artistic and historic interest as what they most look for in a holiday abroad, according to the findings by Moneycorp. Tasting local foods (53 per cent), having time to read (39 per cent), and meeting local people (24 per cent) were next on the list. These were followed by catching up on sleep (21 per cent) and outdoor activities (20 per cent). culture vulture: Sites of historic importance - such as Agrigento Valley of the Temples in Sicily - were holiday priorities for 60% of Brits . Looking for love was last on the list, with only nine per cent of Brits admitting to going on holiday to find romance.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A summer holiday may involve months of anticipation, but Brits have revealed the precise moment they relax while abroad. It takes travellers exactly three days to switch off and relax – with the happiest point on a trip abroad pinpointed to the third day at 7.30pm. By this point, most holidaymakers say they have stopped thinking or worrying about work and still have plenty of days left ahead to enjoy, according to a survey by www.sunshine.co.uk. And relax... Brits says it takes them three days to switch off while on holiday . Nearly 1,800 adults were questioned about their last week-long break in the past year. The majority said they felt most relaxed on day three of their trip at 7.30pm because they had had enough time to stop thinking about work (42 per cent). The second most popular reason was that they still had enough of the holiday left to enjoy (31 per cent), followed by it being the most enjoyable day (26 per cent). Thirteen per cent of Brits cited this point as their best time in the holiday as they had started to get a good tan, while nine per cent said they were pleased they still had holiday spending money left. 'Magic moment': Travellers said three days gave them enough time to switch off from work and enjoy their trip . However, some 67 per cent of those taking part in the poll admitted to feeling ‘extremely sad’ on the day that they had to return home from their holiday. And 5 per cent of these even claiming to have become upset to the point of crying. Nearly half of the respondents claimed that their last holiday abroad had a positive effect on them once they had returned home. When asked to explain this further, 37 per cent said they ‘decided to work less/not stress as much’ and 26 per cent said they ‘decided to get finances in order’ following a holiday. Sun worshippers: Thirteen per cent of Brits said day three was their favourite as they had achieved a good tan . Some 13 per cent said that the holiday had a positive effect on their relationship with their significant other once they had returned home. Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘There’s a magical moment on all holidays when you can sit back, finally forget about work and look forward to the rest of the days you have left before returning home. It really is a great feeling. ‘The first couple of days on holiday can be taken up with office-related worries, or recovering from travelling. ‘Once you’ve had time to settle into your holiday and let go a little, it’s a chance to really enjoy your break.”","Survey of nearly 1,800 holidaymakers reveals third is best day of break .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A budget hotel that hiked its prices so much during the period of the Commonwealth Games that its rooms were more expensive than those at The Ritz has now slashed them drastically. The Glasgow Central Budget Apartments, which normally cost as little as £40, were earlier this year being advertised for an astonishing £1,500 a night during the sporting event, which opens on Wednesday. The price became the most notorious example of profiteering by some accommodation suppliers during Glasgow 2014. But now the apartments are being . advertised for between £350 and £500 a night during the period of the . games - after which they drop as low as £90. Exterior: The Glasgow Central Budget Apartments, which normally cost as little as £40, were earlier this year being advertised for an astonishing £1,500 a night during the Commonwealth Games . Cheaper option: The Ritz London at the same time cost £285 less, although the Glasgow hotel has now slashed rates to as low as £350 a night . Pre-makeover: A hotel spokesman said rooms were being refurbished one at a time, and those done up were worth every cent . As accommodation providers in and around the host city are accused of 'blatant profiteering', it seems one hospitality firm in particular found literally 'going for gold' during the games harder than it thought. And even though unremarkable accommodation has attracted some previous damning online criticism from former residents, the former price tag exceeded that attached to even a deluxe suite at Britain's most famous hotel. A one-bedroom apartment on Glasgow's Bath Street has an open plan kitchen, dining and living area with a table and chairs, sofa, desk and flat-screen television. In comparison, for £285 less - at a mere £1,215 - visitors to The Ritz London in February, when the Glasgow apartments huge prices were advertised, could have secured a deluxe suite with king or twin beds that includes a sitting room with views along Piccadilly, private and guest bathrooms and complementary chocolates, fruit and a bottle of Champagne on arrival. The 860sq ft (80sq m) of glamour-filled luxury is decorated in a regal style to help visitors experience the grandiose and splendour of drawing room entertaining. At the time a spokesman for Glasgow Central Budget Apartments said their rooms were 'unbelievable' and worth every penny. 'We're refurbishing them one at a time, the ones that are refurbished are a different class with built-in TVs to the bathrooms, we've spent hundreds of thousands on them,' he said then. The £1500-a-night rate was also being advertised through the peak summer months of July, August and September. Only last week the cost of a hotel room in Glasgow was said to have rocketed as the city plays host to the Commonwealth Games. Open arms: Aside from inflated hotel rates, Glaswegians have embraced the Commonwealth Games wholeheartedly . Official: A performer welcomes athletes from Papua New Guinea and Fiji at the Athletes Village for the Games . A new report which was published shows rooms have increased by a massive 158 per cent. This means that a night in a hotel will now cost an average of £344 for the games period according to the Trivago Hotel Price Index (THPI) for July. This is compared to an average of £133 for the week previous, and is a significant increase on this time last year, when a hotel room in Glasgow cost an average of just £78. The most expensive night - Sunday 27 July will cost an average of £448, the study found, with Trivago suggesting this spike was due to the planned opening of the newly refurbished Hampden Park stadium on this date. The stadium, which has received a £14m overhaul, will host athletics events including the men's 5,000 metres, in which Mo Farah is rumoured to be competing. May saw the largest increase in interest in the city's hotels - a rise of 104 per cent and in June, searches increased by a further 13per cent.","Glasgow Central Budget Apartments normally cost as little as £40 .

"By . Marcus Berkmann . ‘This book is a manifesto,’ writes Professor McWhorter, who isn’t messing around.  There is an idea abroad which, though  counter-intuitive, has taken the fusty world of linguistics by storm. The only problem, says McWhorter, is that it’s wrong. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis says that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world. So the French look at everything in their very French way — with an effortless sneer and possibly a cigarette hanging from their lips — not because they are French, but because they speak French. Feeling French: The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis says that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world . This idea caught on in academic circles in the Thirties, when a fire inspector and part-time linguist called Benjamin Lee Whorf observed that the Native American language Hopi has no way of marking time. There are no tenses, no words like ‘later’, and Whorf theorised that these informed the Hopis’ sense of how time and the world work. In Hopi, he said, past, present and future are the same, and this corresponded to ‘the cyclical sense of time in Hopi cosmology’. The academic world being what it is, Whorfianism was succeeded by neo-Whorfianism, whose adherents continue to gather evidence to support the hypothesis. In Russian, there are words for ‘dark blue’ and ‘light blue’, but no word for just ‘blue’, while in Japanese only one word covers ‘blue’ and ‘green’. Does that mean Russians and the Japanese see colours differently? Whorfies would say they do, and have tried to prove it. McWhorter thinks it’s all hogwash. Hopi, he says, marks time as much as anyone would expect a language to, ‘with good old-fashioned tense markers and plenty of words for things like already and afterwards’. And while Russians did press buttons slightly faster than English speakers when asked to distinguish between different shades of blue, it was only 124 milliseconds faster. The theory, he says, simply doesn’t pan out. The problem is that the American media, not to mention a gullible public, really want it to work. ‘The language-as-thought idea vibrates in tune with impulses deeply felt in the modern enlightened American soul.’ But languages don’t evolve in any controlled or rational way. The Whorfians and neo-Whorfians are trying to impose pattern on something that has no pattern. McWhorter’s conclusion is almost painfully straightforward: that all humans essentially think alike. I find this strangely reassuring. Readers of Malcolm Gladwell and the Freakonomics books will know that it’s much easier to put forward a pleasing new theory than it is to prove it doesn’t work. McWhorter doesn’t care about this, and takes to his subject with a giant scythe. The elegance of his writing and the righteousness of his rage make this an unusually sprightly ride through the thickets of academia, where people will still be arguing about this long after we are all dead.","Sapir-Whorf theory says the language we speak shapes our perception .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Concerns: Evidence casts doubt on testimony that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death . New evidence has surfaced that puts fresh doubt on the guilt of a man executed for burning his three children to death in a fire. Cameron Todd Willingham was put to death in Texas in 2004 after prison informer Johnny E. Webb told jurors the defendant had confessed the crime to him. But since then, experts investigating the house fire in Corsicana, have said the science used to convict Willingham was faulty while wrongful-conviction advocates have argued that the State's death penalty system is severely flawed. Now a report has revealed that Webb describes in taped interviews how he lied on the witness stand - in return for a reduction in his sentence for robbery. Willingham was sentenced to death in 1992 after being convicted of murder based on arson analysis and testimony from the jailhouse informant. The report published in The Marshall Project sites 'newly uncovered letters and court files' showing that the prosecutor 'worked diligently' to intercede for Webb after he had stood before jurors in the Willingham case. The report says: 'Along with Webb’s account, the letters and documents expose a determined, years-long effort by the prosecutor to alter Webb’s conviction, speed his parole, get him clemency and move him from a tough state prison back to his hometown jail. 'Had such favorable treatment been revealed prior to his execution, Willingham might have had grounds to seek a new trial.'

"By . Kate Lyons . New laws are expected to be introduced today which will allow authorities to shut down notorious Gold Coast 'party houses', which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours. It is believed there are more than 500 of the infamous 'party houses' across the Gold Coast, which are often situated in residential areas. They regularly attract criticism and complaints from neighbours about noise, public nudity, lewd behaviour and violence. Scroll down for video . A blow has been struck to the Gold Coast's notorious 'party houses' as legislation to be introduced today will allow councils to declare some areas 'party house' exclusion zones . The new laws have been prompted by complaints from local residents about the noise and lewd behaviour of party-goers staying in the houses . The new laws, which are part of the changes to the Sustainable Planning Act, will allow local councils to institute 'party house restriction areas' where short-term rental properties will be forbidden from operating. Under the new laws all short-term rental property operators will also be forced to register with the council. The legislation is due to be voted on in Queensland state parliament today and is expected to pass due to the Newman government's majority. The laws have been welcomed by local residents, many of whom have been agitating for tougher laws for years. Some residents who live near a 'party house' have said they are afraid to leave their homes while a weekend-long party is raging and are tormented by the noise and activities next door. The parties often terrified the local residents and meant they were afraid to go outside their properties on weekends . Neighbours complained they weren't able to take their children outside because of the nudity on display at the 'party houses' The 'party houses' are short-term rental accommodations properties that are rented out for weekends to party-goers .","New laws will allow authorities to shut down 'party houses'

"By . Associated Press . A Washington state grandmother could lose an eye after she bravely rescued her grandson who was being viciously attacked by an otter as he swam in a river on Thursday. Roxane Leilani Grove's grandmotherly instinct kicked in as soon as she heard the screams of her 8-year-old grandson, Bryce Moser, and then saw the horrible sight of an otter biting him aggressively in a swimming hole in the Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle. 'I could see that it was biting into his head and it had its claws around him,' Grove told KOMO News. Scroll down for video . Attacked: Roxane Leilani Grove and her grandson Bryce Moser, left, with their injuries from an otter attack at Pilchuck River, Washington . 'I just . swam out there and I grabbed the claws to pull it off of him. 'I just remember trying to hold it as tight as I can and yelling ""Get . him out of the water! Get him out of the water!""' Grove managed to get young Bryce out of the water but not before suffering her own injuries. 'It just started biting on me and biting on me and it felt like little knives just going in,' Grove told the TV station. The . pair were taken to a hospital where Grove reportedly received hundreds . of stitches to her face and head as well as the eye injury and Bryce . received nine staples in his head. State . and federal wildlife agents in Washington are trying to trap the otter . and it will likely be killed unless it is a female with pups, because it . has pounced on people, said Capt. Alan Myers of the Washington . Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'We're doing everything possible to capture than animal as soon as possible,' Myers said Friday. 'This is an extremely rare incident. Otters are not known to be aggressive toward people.' The boy's mother, Tabitha Moser, saw the four-foot otter attack her son and her mother saved him. A state worker was unable to find the otter, so expert trappers were called in from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, Myers said. They'll try to trap it with a foot snare or tranquilize it. 'We're not sure if it's a hyper-aggressive male protecting territory or a female protecting its young,' Myers said. An eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were attacked by an otter in Washington's Pilchuck River . 'There's a lot of liability in trying to relocate an animal that's been hyper-aggressive, and it would likely be euthanized. If it's a female with pups, there's another possible outcome if we can find a good location.' But the otter would have to be killed in any case so its brain could be tested for rabies, if that's a concern for doctors treating the boy and his grandmother, he said. 'There are no known cases of otter rabies in Washington,; he said. 'That's an extremely remote possibility.' The grandmother was treated at Harborview . Medical Center in Seattle and the boy at Providence Medical Center in . Everett, the boy's mother, Tabitha Moser told KING. The attack took place in Washington's Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle (pictured) 'All of a sudden I just heard him scream for his life. He was just bobbing up and down in the water and as he came up there was something all the way on top of his head,' she told KING. The otter continued to attack as they left the water. 'Even after it got into the river and out of our way it stood on its hind legs looking at us like, 'Don't do it again; don't come in here,'' she told KING. Myers said he has not heard of any other otter attacks in Washington but there have been some around the country. Lake Conner Park has been closed, and signs have been posted along the Pilchuck River warning people to beware of the otter, Myers said.","Roxane Leilani Grove is seen with bloody scratches covering her face in a picture taken after the attack .

"By . Laura Clark . Rising numbers of schools are abandoning A-levels in favour of alternative qualifications amid anger at constant ‘meddling’ with the exam system. Demand for exams created for pupils in China, India and the United States has soared nearly 50 per cent in a year, with top private schools leading the charge away from the ‘gold standard’ A-level. With teenagers across the country awaiting A-level results next week, it emerged that more than 100 British schools entered pupils for an international version of the exam amid ‘instability’ in the domestic system. Reaction: British schools are entering pupils for alternative versions of the exam amid 'instability' in the UK . Figures also show a four per cent surge in the numbers choosing the International Baccalaureate, a broad-based diploma qualification offered around the world. And a third alternative to A-levels - the Cambridge Pre-U - has seen a 10 per cent spike in demand compared with last year. Head teachers are predicting that appetite for alternative qualifications will rise again over the next two years as the Coalition ushers in further reforms to A-levels. Former Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered a radical overhaul of the exam to restore rigour to the system by scrapping pass-as-you-go modules and bringing back end-of-course exams. But critics are concerned at ‘political interference’ in exams and the possibility that changes could be reversed by a future Labour administration. There is also opposition to the splitting of AS-levels from the main A-level, which will put an end to the practice of awarding pupils a grade half-way through their A-level courses. International A-levels have been offered for more than 50 years by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) for schools overseas. Syllabuses are designed to avoid cultural bias and take a global approach. They also retain AS-levels at the half-way stage of the courses. Figures from CIE show that pupils took 1,377 International A-levels this summer – up from 927 last year. Whereas last year 72 schools entered pupils, more than 100 – most of them private schools - did so this year. Some 36 are enrolling significant numbers of entratns. The International Baccalaureate, meanwhile, was developed in Geneva to offer sixth-formers around the world a broad education, with pupils taking a range of subjects as well as writing an extended essay and undertaking community work. Controversy: Former Education Secretary Michael Gove controversially scrapped 'pass-as-you-go' modules and brought back end-of-course exams . Latest figures, from the International Baccalaureate Organisation, show that 4,790 UK candidates took the qualification this year – up from 4,589 in 2013. Some 153 UK schools are offering the IB this year – 82 private and 71 state. The Cambridge Pre-U was devised by CIE in 2008 as a more traditional and rigorous approach to sixth-form study, with more emphasis on written exams and less coursework. Dozens of private schools offer it in some subjects, including Eton. CIE said entries for the Pre-U had risen from 3,831 last year to 4,232. At the same time, the number of A-level entries this year declined three per cent, although it remains the qualification of choice for the vast majority of sixth-formers. Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents leading private schools, said: ‘The numbers at the moment seem to be small but these movements could be indicative. ‘There is considerable concern about the changes and the way in which the changes will be implemented, and schools will be looking at alternatives.’ There was less scope for ‘political interference’ and ‘meddling’ in qualifications such as the IA-level and IB, he said. ‘We are all uncertain about what lies ahead. The mood inside independent and maintained schools generally is wait and see, but wait and see with apprehension and not wait and see with confidence.’ The Perse School, in Cambridge, has already introduced the International A-level in biology and will consider moving towards it in other subjects. Headmaster Ed Elliott said that one attraction of IA-levels was that they were ‘stable’ at a time of ‘great change at A-level’. ‘The other great attraction of the International A-level is that it keeps the AS-level component and you have public exam results at the end of the lower-sixth,’ he said. Pupils worked harder and paced themselves better if they faced an exam half-way through their A-level courses, which also provided valuable information for universities, he said. ‘The reforms Michael Gove put into action were a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There were some problems with A-level that needed reform but not this wholesale, rushed-in reform which could create a whole series of worse problems,’ he warned. Battleground: Head teachers warn  the different forms of exam may be used as ammunition by the Labour Party . Dr David James, director of the IB at Wellington College, the Berkshire public school, said: ‘Unlike many schools, we offer both the IB diploma and A-levels and the trend we’re seeing is strongly towards the IB. ‘The numbers have doubled since 2012 to nearly half our 210-strong sixth form. We know why this is because our students tell us: it’s about the increasing competition for the best university places.’ A number of top UK universities are now making ‘very attainable offers’ to students taking the IB, he said. ‘The IB can also be a ‘golden ticket’ to overseas universities,’ Dr James said. ‘Many of our pupils have their sights set on elite US universities and this year we have IB students going to Harvard, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), New York University and Columbia. ‘The other reason is that the best and brightest students want to take a course which is more intellectual, more fun and more interesting with real links between the subjects. ‘The way we run IB classes at Wellington is at first-year university level and the IB organisation has evidence that IB students are less likely to drop out of university, showing what great preparation the IB is for further education, as well as all-round intellectual and character development.’","More than 100 British schools entered pupils for alternative exams .

"By . Jaya Narain . The parents of a murder victim were devastated when they overheard a judge say victim impact statements ‘make no difference’ at a parole hearing for one of their son’s killers. Geraldine and Peter McGinty, who had made their statement on a video link, heard judge Graham White’s comments when the link was accidentally left open. Their son Colin, 21, was stabbed to death in 2001 by a gang of four men, in what police suspect was a case of mistaken identity. Pain: Geraldine and Peter McGinty had just finished giving a statement when they heard the judges comments . Two of the killers, doormen Gary Hampton, 26, and Michael Brown, 24, were caught and were sentenced to life imprisonment, but recently applied to the Parole Board to be moved to an open prison. Mr McGinty’s parents, who opposed the move, were invited to read a victim statement to the judge before he came to a decision. In their statement at Brown’s hearing, they said they were ‘serving a life sentence of heartache and grief and pain’. Mrs McGinty, 58, told the BBC: ‘The judge was sympathetic and thanked us for reading the statement and said he was closing the link. ‘They couldn’t hear us or see us any longer but we still had the link open and could see and hear them. ‘The judge turned round and said to someone else in the room, “I feel so very sorry for these families. They make these statements thinking they are going to make a difference, but they make no difference at all. Someone should tell them”.’ Tragic: Their son Colin, 21, was stabbed to death in 2001 but his killers are applying for an open prison . Mother-of-five Mrs McGinty, who described Colin as a ‘fabulous son’, added: ‘It was as though time stopped. Peter and I looked at each in disbelief, we were dumbfounded. ‘The heartache that we go through to do these statements, to be told they don’t make any difference.’ Judge White apologised for his remark, which he said was made in a ‘private conversation’. He said: ‘I am sorry if what they overheard upset them and if it made them feel that what they had said had no impact because it certainly did, but what it can’t do is affect our judgment of his [Brown’s] risk. ‘We don’t think that victims necessarily have explained to them what the role of the board is and what we have to take into account.’ Parole Board chairman Sir David Calvert-Smith said there would be an investigation into what was said. He added that victims should be told what their statements may or may not achieve. In a hearing, the Parole Board assesses the risk a prisoner poses, taking into account their offending history, their progress and reports from psychologists and prison officers. The board says victims can ‘play an important part’ in helping them reach a decision and can affect the conditions of release, such as an order not to contact victims. But Mr and Mrs McGinty, from Formby, Merseyside, said the Parole Board has been misleading about the role of victim statements. Mr McGinty said: ‘What is the point? Why are we being put through pain and heartbreak for no apparent reason? I feel the judge was an honourable man and he was very, very honest. We were privy to a conversation that we would not normally be. So I just feel he’s very honest.’ Mrs McGinty added: ‘I’m pleased we heard that statement because it’s not just for us, it’s for other victims’ families. We go through so much anyway, but then to realise the pain that you’ve gone through trying to make a difference for your loved-one isn’t making any difference at all ... they’re not being truthful to victims’ families.’ 'Sorry': Judge Graham White apologised to the family after remarking that their words will 'make no difference' In their statement, Mr and Mrs McGinty described how they rushed to hospital after Colin was stabbed 15 times on a night out. They said: ‘We were allowed to be with Colin while the operating theatre was prepared. That sight of Colin will haunt us forever.’ His last words to his father were: ‘I can’t breathe.’ Following the hearing, recommendations have been made that both of Colin’s murderers should be transferred to open prisons.","Geraldine and Peter McGinty made video statement against son's killers .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Russian President Vladimir Putin must end the 'festering and dangerous crisis' in Ukraine or face the consequences, David Cameron warned today. Invoking the outbreak of World War Two, the Prime Minister said Europe must not forget the 'consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries'. He insisted Russia 'needs European markets far more than we need Russian markets', as he warned it would be 'unthinkable' for France go ahead with selling warships to Putin. It came after Chancellor George Osborne warned failure to stand-up to Russia  risks causing harm to the British economy. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that for too long some EU countries had refused to face up to the implications of the conflict in Russia, which has been 'fermented' by Moscow . Moscow will come under fresh pressure at the United Nations today and a meeting of EU foreign ministers tomorrow is expected to result in a more punitive sanctions regime. Vladimir Mr Putin's ‘cronies’ are likely to be the targets of new financial controls. But Britain has been frustrated by the refusal of some European countries to back tougher sanctions. EU foreign ministers are expected to back the acceleration of sanctions against named individuals and entities, agreed last week before the MH17 crash. However, Mr Cameron wants to go further and move to 'sectorial' sanctions, which could hit defence, energy and financial industries. 'Further military sales I don't think should be going ahead from any country in the European Union,' he said. Asked if France should abandon its  €1.2 billion for Mistral helicopter carriers, Mr Cameron said: 'Frankly in this country it would be unthinkable to fulfil an order like the one outstanding that the French have. 'But we need to put the pressure on with all our partners to say that we cannot go on doing business as usual with a country when it is behaving in this way.' Mr Cameron said it would be 'unthinkable' for France to press ahead with a deal to sell warships to Russia . In a statement to the Commons, the Prime Minister said there was now mounting evidence that separatist rebels in Ukraine shot down the Malaysian Airlines plane with a Russian surface-to-air missile. 'President Putin faces a clear choice in how he decides to respond to this appalling tragedy. I hope he will use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia's support for the separatists. 'If he does not change his approach to Ukraine in this then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia. 'Those of us in Europe should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries. 'We should not shrink from standing up for the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in Europe and which ultimately keep the peace on our continent. 'For too long there has been a reluctance on the part of too many European countries to face up to the implications of what is happening in eastern Ukraine. 'It is time to make our power, influence and resources felt.' 'There is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow has been fermented by Moscow,' Mr Cameron added. The immediate priority was the repatriation of the bodies of the 298 crew and passengers killed in the crash, including 10 Britons. He said the UK had sent a team of air crash investigators from the UK, along with police experts to help identify the victims. But the six-strong team from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have still not been able to start their work, because armed militias are guarding the crash site and intimidating officials. It come as US President Barack Obama called for international investigators to have ""immediate and full access"" to the site in eastern Ukraine. He accused pro-Russian separatists in the area of removing evidence and bodies from the crash site, adding: 'What exactly are they trying to hide?' Labour leader Ed Miliban missed the Commons debate because he is on a trip to  meet President Obama. But in a speech to the Center for American Progress in Washington, he called for sanctions against Russia to be tightened. 'Europe's economic well-being relies upon the upholding of international norms and international law. Our collective security requires every European country to accept its responsibility,' Mr Miliband said. 'European unity must not be an excuse for European inaction. Europe and America must stand together as they have at crucial moments in the past. 'As President Obama made clear in his state visit to the UK in 2011, Europe is a cornerstone of US global engagement. Together we are the most potent catalyst for global action that there is in the world today.' George Osborne said the failure to stand up to Russian President Vladmir Putin with new sanctions could put the UK economy at risk . Earlier Mr Osborne insisted Britain and other countries must use their economic might to stand up to Russia. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: 'This is about living in a world where international borders are respected, where commercial airlines are not shot down, and it’s absolutely in Britain’s national economic interest that that is the case. ‘And when it comes to things like sanctions, of course they can have an impact on your own economy. ‘But the economic impact of not acting in a situation like this could be very much worse.’ British ministers are in talks about how wide to draw sanctions on Russian individuals and companies, following criticism that the US had gone further than the European Union before last week’s Malaysia Airlines crash. Mr Osborne added: ‘Of course, any sanctions will have an economic impact and we are prepared to undertake further sanctions. ‘But think of the economic hit, as you put it, of allowing international borders to be ignored, of allowing airlines to be shot down. ‘That's a much greater economic hit for Britain and we're not prepared to allow that to happen.’ Transport: Rescue workers wearing face masks remove corpses from the crash site . Armed rebels guard a train's refrigerated coaches that are holding the bodies of the victims of  flight MH17,  at a railway station in Torez, some 90 Km east from Donetsk, Ukraine . The Government has openly accused Russia of arming and supporting the Ukrainian rebels who shot down flight MH17. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The Russians have influence, if not direct control, over these people. 'They have been supplying, they have been supporting them, they cannot deny their responsibility for the acts these people are carrying out.' 'There a growing number of strands of evidence, which looked at together in the round, lead the reasonable person to the unavoidable truth that this was a missile fired from rebel-held territory, almost certainly a missile supplied by the Russians.' The Prime Minister has said the conflict 'could have been stopped by Moscow'. He said all the evidence pointed to the fact that 'Flight MH17 was blown out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile fired from a rebel-held area'. Mr Cameron said: 'If this is the case then we must be clear what it means: this is a direct result of Russia destabilising a sovereign state, violating its territorial integrity, backing thuggish militias and training and arming them.' There is growing evidence that MH17 was shot down by pro-Russian separatists who have seized control of eastern Ukraine. Footage has emerged of a BUK missile launcher which could have been used to shoot down the civilian plane being smuggled back to Russia. Last night Mr Cameron told Mr Putin that his support for the rebels in eastern Ukraine had 'contributed to an appalling tragedy' and the delay in experts being able to carry out their investigation was 'indefensible'. Mr Cameron, who had been trying to speak to the Russian leader since the plane was downed last Thursday, finally had a 30-minute conversation with him, an exchange which Downing Street insiders described as 'frank'. A No 10 spokeswoman said Mr Cameron had made clear to Mr Putin that the shooting down of MH17 was 'totally unacceptable'. Mr Cameron told the president that the 'world was now watching' and he 'must change course and work to bring stability to eastern Ukraine', the spokeswoman said. Downing Street refused to comment on exactly which individuals would be targeted, but there is speculation it could eventually include well-known figures such as Roman Abramovich, who has close links to the Putin regime. No10 played down suggestions Mr Putin, who is thought to have spirited away billions, could be personally targeted at this stage. Sanctions could also include an EU-wide ban on arms sales to Russia and curbs on the ability of Russian energy firms to raise money in Europe. Mr Cameron made clear to Mr Putin that Russia’s stance so far was ‘completely unacceptable’. He urged him to intervene immediately to ensure the victims, whose bodies have been removed by local militias, could have proper funerals. Offending launcher? A driver filmed this BUK launcher on the back of a military track rumbling back across the Russian border on Saturday . A source said he told the Russian President: ‘Ten of my citizens have just been killed in a plane brought down by a missile fired by Russian separatists. 'I have been asking to speak to you since this happened. You clearly can play a role in exerting influence on the separatists to grant us access to the site.’ Britain and Australia will today try to push through a UN Security Council resolution calling for investigators to be granted immediate access. But British sources are gloomy about its prospects after Moscow vetoed a similar call on Saturday. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will travel to Brussels tomorrow to hammer out the details of new sanctions on Russia.","Prime Minister insists Russia needs Europe more than Europe needs Russia .

"By . Adam Duggan . A bus driver has been left so scarred from a violent attack that he's unable to even get on a bus since the incident - let alone drive it. In CCTV footage released to Nine News Melbourne, the bus driver can be seen recoiling - as a male teenager, in the midst of an ice binge, hurls verbal abuse at him before becoming increasingly violent. Crying passengers were able to escape the packed bus, while the violent passenger's friend managed to restrain him from further attacking anybody on September 28 last year, the day of the AFL grand final. Scroll down for video . Bashed for asking a passenger to pay his way: A Melbourne bus driver was brutally attacked by a drug-affect teenage passenger on the day of last year's AFL grand final . Causing a commotion: A teenager, in the midst of an ice binge at the time of the attack, violently assaulted a Melbourne bus driver and caused reckless damage to the bus . The boy reportedly failed to tap a valid Myki card - a plastic smartcard ticket used across Victoria's public transport system - when getting on the bus in the west Melbourne suburb of Mill Park with a friend. The video starts following the bus driver's request for the passenger to get off the bus. 'Are you gonna drive?' the drug-affected boy yells. 'Drive the f***ing bus.' Despite the physical attack, the bus driver stands firm and demands the boy 'get off'. Holding him in a headlock: The violent teenage passenger holds the bus driver in a headlock, after he refuses to budge and continues to ask the passenger to remove himself from the bus . 'Are you gonna drive?' the boy again asks the driver. When the driver refuses, the boy slaps him across the face. After holding the bus driver in a headlock and punching him in the face, the boy's friend finally comes to the front of the bus to try and control the situation. The male friend, wearing a black pullover with a white 'Everlast' logo, manages to eventually remove his ice raging friend from the bus after reminding him of the young children who were forced to witness the unprovoked attack. 'Mate - there's little kids, there's little kids,' he tells his friend after trying to restrain him from further injuring the driver. Forced to intervene: The man's friend, clearly concerned by the violence his friend had shown, steps in and helps the driver remove him from the bus . The bus driver, who does not want to be identified, told Nine News Melbourne that he thought the man was going to kill him. 'He just started swearing, throwing punches, grabbing me in the head and just violently attacking me - I've never seen that much rage in a person before,' he said. 'I'm wrecked, he's wrecked my life - I'm scared.' That sentiment was shared by his sister, Antoinette, who spoke with 3AW Radio's Neil Mitchell on Monday. She said that despite her brother's injuries - the safety of the passengers were paramount to him. 'All he kept saying in that hospital was: I wanted to protect my passengers,' she said. Going to work and being forced to endure that: The teenager, who had been taking ice before boarding the bus, became increasingly violent to the driver in front of the packed bus . Speaking with MailOnline, Bus Association Victoria executive director Chris Lowe said that this attack is part of a broader societal problem, not merely a drug problem. 'Passengers find ticketing systems frustrating and take it out on the bus drivers,' Mr Lowe said. 'A lot of people who abuse bus drivers forget they're being watched on CCTV.' In an effort to find out why violent attacks against public transport workers are on the rise, Public Transport Victoria has partnered with Monash University to conduct research on the issue. Finally removed: The teenager's friend finally manages to get the drug-affected boy off the bus . For this bus driver, the research and future awareness campaigns are coming too late. According to his family, it's changed his whole personality. 'He became more quieter, more paranoid,' his sister told Neil Mitchell. 'These people don't understand that something like this goes on... it continues and disrupts lives.' The bus driver has since left his position with Dysons Bus Services, unable to return behind the wheel. The teenage boy has pled guilty to recklessly causing injury. He is yet to be sentenced.

"By . David Mccormack . Many a sporting wife has had trouble keeping their superstar husband in check. But that problem is less of an issue for the woman married to the Brooklyn Nets latest signing. The former Minnesota Timberwolves star Andrei Kirilenko has agreed to a two-year deal with the Nets worth an estimated $3.18 million a year. On the court the 32-year-old has achieved a reputation as a versatile ‘big man’, while off it his unusual relationship with his wife - Russian pop singer Masha Lopatova - has hit the headlines. Former Minnesota Timberwolves Andrei Kirilenko has agreed to a two-year deal with the Nets worth an estimated $3.18 million a year . Lopatova – whose stage name is MaLo - has revealed that she and her husband have an agreement which allows him to have sex with another woman once a year. ‘Male athletes in this country are extremely attractive. They get chased by women. It's hard to resist. It's the way men are by nature,’ she told ESPN The Magazine when he first hit the big time. The 'allowance' isn't a reciprocal agreement, but that she said: 'If I know about it, it's not cheating.' At the time Kirilenko said he had no plans to exercise his ‘allowance’, although he joked that girls would be lining up outside his hotel door. At the time that his wife revealed her husband's 'allowance', Kirilenko said he had no plans to exercise it and joked that girls would be lining up outside his hotel door . Since then it isn't clear if Kirilenko has ever taken advantage, but the couple remain together and so something is clearly working. They have been married for 13 years and have two sons Fedya, age 11, and Stepan, age six. In January 2011, Andrei and Masha acquired American citizenship. Lopatova, the daughter of Russian basketball player Andrei Lopatov, met Kirilenko at a youth basketball camp in Moscow. Soon afterwards he appeared in one of her music videos. 'I find that people in this country are . really interested in athletes and their [families], for some reason. They don't want to know what kind of books I read, but they prefer to . know what kind of underwear I wear,' she once told ESPN. Kirilenko became the first Russian player selected in the first round of a draft and the youngest European player drafted in 1999. He made the NBA All-Rookie Team after his first season, was an NBA All-Defensive Team pick three times and played in the 2004 All-Star Game. At the 2012 Summer Olympics he won a bronze medal with Russia. The Nets deal represents a steep pay cut for Kirilenko, reports New York magazine. He recently opted out of a contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves that would have paid him $10 million this year, only to discover that nobody else was willing or able to spend that kind of money on him. Fortunately for Kirilenko, Nets owner and fellow Russian Mikhail Prokhorov has a net worth of $13 billion and is bankrolling a basketball dream-team in Brooklyn. The Nets have brought in a host of top talent including Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce from the Boston Celtics . Prior to signing Kirilenko, the Nets were set to owe $75 million in luxury taxes this season — more than the taxes paid by all 30 NBA teams combined last year. Masha met Kirilenko at a youth basketball camp in Moscow, he featured in the music video for her single 'Sugary' which reached number one on MTV Russia .",Russian-born Andrei Kirilenko has been given an 'allowance' by his popstar wife that allows him to have sex with another woman once a year .

"By . Damian Spellman . Richard Keogh is desperate for a chance to make Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo pay for his play-off final heartache. The Republic of Ireland defender met up with his international team-mates last week still reflecting upon Derby's dramatic Wembley defeat by QPR, in which his late error helped Bobby Zamora to fire Rangers into the Barclays Premier League. However, the prospect of playing a part in friendlies against Costa Rica in Philadelphia during the early hours of Saturday morning, and then Ronaldo's Portugal in New Jersey next week, have proved hugely cathartic. Too late: Richard Keogh tries in vain to stop Bobby Zamora as QPR beat Derby in the play-off final . Heartache: A distraught Keogh is consoled by manager Steve McClaren at full-time . Keogh, who will hope to win his fourth senior cap against the Costa Ricans, said: 'That would be absolutely fantastic. He [Ronaldo] is one of the best players, if not the best player, in the world. 'It's a great honour to wear the green jersey and when you play against great opposition, it makes you better. 'But we are just focusing on trying to get a positive result. We had a positive result against Italy and we are looking forward to these two games. 'Training has been really sharp, really competitive and I think the boys are ready.' Keogh and Derby team-mates Jeff Hendrick and Conor Sammon met up barely 48 hours after suffering play-off heartache, but were immediately enveloped in support from not only their team-mates, but Ireland manager Martin O'Neill and his assistant Roy Keane.

'For someone like that to mention that to me, it meant a lot. It gives you a lot of confidence to want to do well and really improve, and I really appreciated it. '[Keane] said some calm words to me and when someone like that says it to you, it's really fantastic. It's something that again filled me with a lot of confidence. 'I can't thank those two too much, really, for how they have helped me since came in. 'When he speaks you listen. He's a fantastic guy, he was a fantastic player and when he gives you advice, it's great for everyone, especially the midfield players.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Five officers who investigated the murder of a pregnant teenager are being quizzed  over concerns about how long the investigation into her disappearance took. Jayden Parkinson, 17, was strangled to death by ex-boyfriend Ben Blakeley, 22, on December 3 last year - 24 hours after she told him she was expecting his child. She was reported missing on December 4 by staff at a hostel where she was staying, the same day that Blakeley was quizzed over allegations that he was threatening to put indecent pictures and video of her on Facebook. But Thames Valley Police did not bring Blakeley in for questioning until December 12, when he was arrested on suspicion of murder and a major crime investigation was launched. Five Thames Valley Police officers are being quizzed by the police watchdog over their investigation into the murder of teenager Jayden Parkinson by ex-boyfriend Ben Blakeley, 22, in December last year . It was not until December 19 that her body was found in a grave at the Great Western Cemetery in Didcot, Oxfordshire. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is looking at whether officers who interviewed Blakeley on December 4 were aware that Jayden had been reported missing. They are also examining why Jayden was first classed as a medium risk missing person, and then later moved to high risk on December 10. Five officers have been served with misconduct notices to tell them that they are under investigation, and the IPCC team is in the process of interviewing them. Details of the investigation were revealed today as Blakeley was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years behind bars at Oxford Crown Court today. Probe is said to be looking at whether officers who spoke to Blakeley on December 4 knew she had been reported missing on the same day. Blakeley was not brought in for questioning until December 12 . IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori said: 'Jayden’s family continue to go through an incredibly difficult time, and I again offer my condolences to them. 'Now that the murder trial has concluded, we can provide a clearer picture of our investigation and the progress that has been made in recent months in parallel with Thames Valley Police’s criminal investigation. 'As well as examining the individual actions of officers and staff in response to Jayden being reporting missing and whether these were appropriate, our investigation has also been looking at the force’s policies and systems around missing person reports. 'There is still work to do and it is vital that we establish as full a picture as we can as to how the force responded to Jayden being reported missing, and the contact officers and staff had with her and Ben Blakeley in the months before her murder.'","Jayden Parkinson, 17, was reported missing on December 4 last year .

"By . Darren Boyle . Former London's Burning star John Alford said his life was destroyed by the Fake Sheikh Mazher Mahmood who promised him a role in a Robert De Niro movie in exchange for drugs. The star, who was earning £120,000-a-year on the hit ITV show, was jailed for nine months in April 1999 after an investigation by the News of the World. Following his release from prison, Alford found it difficult to secure new acting roles because of his conviction. Scroll down for video . Actor John Alford lost his £120,000-a-year job playing Bily Ray on London's Burning after the 1997 sting . Alford, pictured leaving Pentonville Prison in London, was jailed for nine months in April 1999 after the case . He was later banned for 16 months in January 2006 for drink-driving after a crash in Islington, North London in April 2005 . Now Alford hopes, following the acquittal of Tulisa Contostavlos on cocaine charges, his own conviction from 1999 could be overturned due to the unreliable nature of Mahmood's evidence. At the time of his conviction, Alford, 41, was one of the highest profile actors in Britain playing baby-faced fireman Billy Ray on London's Burning. The show was watched by up to 18 million viewers a week, but once the story emerged, ITV sacked the actor. He told The Sunday People: 'The fake sheikh ruined my life. When I heard Tulisa had walked free I was so pleased her nightmare was over. 'But I've been living my own nightmare for 17 years. I'm just glad people are finally raising concerns about the way this man operates.' He added: 'I was wrong to sort out the deal and I've been paying for it ever since. If it wasn't for Mahmood there would have been no drug deal. I wasn't a drug dealer, I was an actor. But after the court case, that was it - I couldn't get work.' Alford said was 'so pleased' when he heard Tulisa, pictured, had been cleared after a judge questioned Mazher Mahmood's evidence: 'I'm just glad people are finally raising concerns about the way this man operates' Alford, pictured, is now planning a comeback in a football comedy called 'What's the Score?' After his release from prison, Alford, pictured working on a central London building site, has struggled to secure acting roles claiming that the Fake Sheikh ruined his life luring him with offers of Hollywood . The father-of-two revealed that since his conviction other actors and producers would threaten to pull out of projects if his name was involved. However, he is currently planning an on-screen comeback in a football comedy called 'What's The Score?' Alford claimed he was convinced Mahmood was a real sheikh called Mohammed Al-Kareen because he was wearing an expensive Rolex watch and was travelling around in Rolls Royce. Alford said he hoped the acquittal of Tulisa could lead to his case being reviewed over Mahmood's tactics claiming he had been set up by the sting . He said he had been invited to the meeting with the Fake Sheikh at the Savoy Hotel in London in 1997. Alford was offered the chance to attend the celebrity opening of a nightclub in Dubai - where he would get the chance to meet Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone and possibly work with them in future. During this meeting, Mahmood asked whether Alford would be able to supply some cocaine and cannabis on his behalf. Judge Stephen Robbins at Snaresbrook Crown Court told Alford: 'You were undoubtedly motivated by the desire to earn even more money than you were earning as a successful actor, believing you would be opening a night-club in Dubai. 'There was a strong element of entrapment but you willingly went along with the idea. 'You had plenty of opportunity when you left to fetch these drugs to distance yourself from it.' Judge Robbins said he had to take into account Alford's previous cocaine use where he spent up to £500 a time on the drug. During the trial, Mahmood told the court that he had heard from an unnamed showbiz contact that Alford was regularly dealing cocaine at parties and at his home. Alford said while he had previously used cocaine, he had never dealt it before meeting the Fake Sheikh. Alford received a nine month sentence for supplying two grammes of cocaine and a two month concurrent sentence for providing 12 grammes of cannabis. He was also ordered to pay £3,000 towards the prosecution's costs. The actor was filmed by three hidden cameras when he returned to the hotel room with the drugs, including three wraps of cocaine and a small slab of cannabis resin. His QC David Etherington said Alford had been the victim of a 'professional sting' designed to 'ruin and publicly humiliate him'. Alford, pictured, was later convicted of drink driving in January 2006 after crashing his car in Islington, London .","John Alford lost his £120,000-a-year TV job after the 1997 Fake Sheikh sting .

"By . Darren Boyle . Police sergeant Louise Gibson took her own life after discovering her cheating PC husband was having an affair with a PCSO, an inquest heard today. All three officers worked together at the same police station and when she discovered the affair, it was the 43-year-old sergeant who was sent home. The decision to relieve the distraught woman of her frontline duties was criticised at an inquest into her death  when her parents accused the force of abandoning her. Sergeant Louise Gibson, left, took her own life after her husband John Gibson, right, had an affair . Her sister Katrina said: 'Thames Valley Police has offered no support to our family and has consistently put the mental wellbeing of Louise’s estranged husband over her family.' Following a huge police search, Sergeant Gibson’s body was found on May 19, four days after she stormed out of her parents’ home less than a mile from where she died. The inquest into her death heard that the day she vanished, Sergeant Gibson, had a meeting with colleagues about her marriage and was asked to hand over some of her duties while her personal situation was sorted. The hearing in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire was told that Sergeant Gibson was left distressed by the meeting, feeling that her marriage and career were over. Sgt Gibson's father Charles Ward, left, said:  'Thames Valley Police have consistently put the mental well-being of Louise's estranged husband over her family', also pictured is Sgt Gibson's sister Daniella . She was taken home and told her father she wanted to die. After overhearing her father telling her sister that only crazy people killed themselves, Sergeant Gibson stormed out of the house and was not seen by her family again. Three suicide notes and a will were found in her bedroom. Coroner Richard Hulett recorded a verdict of suicide. Speaking after the inquest, Sergeant Gibson’s tearful sister Katrina said the family believed there were a number of unanswered questions surrounding the case and that information was withheld from them. Describing her sister as a 'beautiful person and a wonderful mother', she said: 'As her family we are very disappointed with how the investigation into the causes behind Louise’s death have been handled. Sgt Gibson, pictured, was distraught after discovering details of her husband's affair and left three notes . Following the inquest, Louise Gibson’s sister Katrina issued a statement, saying the family felt Thames Valley Police had lied to them. She said: 'Thames Valley Police have offered no support to our family, and have consistently put the emotional well-being of Louise’s estranged husband John White Gibson, above that of Louise’s parents and her children, especially her 15 year old daughter. Louise Gibson had been a Sergeant at Wycombe Police Station with her husband PC John Gibson where he started an affair with a PCSO . 'They have consistently withheld information from us, and as such we still have a lot of questions that have not been answered. 'Why was Louise forced to work in the same station as her estranged husband and his mistress for months, when she had repeatedly asked to be moved? 'Why was she offered no welfare support from senior officers? 'Why has there been no investigation into Louise’s missing will? 'Why was Louise’s case being presented on the part of the police in this inquest by an officer who had never met her? 'The list goes on and on. 'Louise was a beautiful person and a wonderful mother, and her actions were completely out of character. 'Whatever reasons Thames Valley give for her death, Louise was a strong person. 'None of the people who really knew Louise and know the situation she was in believe that she would have done this, unless she was driven to it. 'We will continue to fight for justice and for the answers to our questions - for Louise, for her children and for all of the people who loved her.' Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Brown, left, told the inquest it was decided that it would be in Sgt Gibson's best interests to take a break from front-line supervisory policing due to her relationship with her husband . Sgt. Gibson’s father, Charles Ward, added that he was angry that Louise had been left at home without anyone explaining to him what had happened at the meeting that day. Mr Ward said: 'Why was a hugely competent officer who was suddenly unable to perform her duties effectively due to some form of mental stress and of which they had been well aware taken to the house at Kingshill and abandoned at the roadside? 'Why was no attempt made to check that there were persons present to deal with the situation or to advise anybody at all that she was in a very bad place?' Sergeant Gibson, a Thames Valley Police officer of more than 10 years and mother of three, had previously been married to Tony Cook. She remarried John Gibson, aged 40 years, who she worked alongside at Wycombe police station, but the couple did not have any children together. When working the couple slept at Sergeant.Gibson’s parents home in Great Kingshill, but had a home in Macclesfield, where she was originally from. In the weeks leading up to her death Sergeant Gibson was going through a breakup with her husband and he no longer slept in Kingshill. She was then told by someone at work that he was having an affair with the unnamed PCSO. Sergeant Gibson confronted both about the affair but they denied it. She then told her father she was going to hire a private investigator to get proof of the affair and a few days later showed Mr Ward a photo of her husband’s car outside the woman’s house in the middle of the night. When Sergeant Gibson confronted her husband with the evidence, he admitted the affair. As the situation at work became difficult, Sergeant Gibson was called into a meeting on May 15 to discuss what was going on. Louise Gibson's sister Katrina, left,  asked Thames Valley Police: 'Why was Louise forced to work in the same station as her estranged husband and his mistress for months, when she had repeatedly asked to be moved?' Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Brown told the inquest: 'The meeting was in relation to the ongoing personal circumstances between her and her husband and the effect it was having on her team and the relationship with her husband at the police station. 'They (the supervisors) decided the best help they could give Louise was to take her from what was a very pressured, front line, supervisory role for a short time so she could address her personal issues. 'This didn’t sit well with Louise in terms of her professional career development. 'Her view was she had lost her husband and now she was losing her job.' The distressed officer was taken back to her parents’ home, where she was spoken to by her father at around 4.30pm. Sgt Gibson, centre, photographed with her eldest daughter Beth and her youngest child, now 15 . Mr Ward said: 'She said her life was over and her career was ruined. 'She said John had won and that the team had been taken away from her but that John and this girl were still allowed to carry on. 'She also said she didn’t care if she was alive anymore and didn’t want to wake up in the morning.' The cause of death was given in accordance with the medical evidence. Following the inquest into Sergeant Gibson’s suicide, a spokesman for Thames Valley Police said it is continuing to support her family and colleagues. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Shead said: 'Our thoughts today remain with Louise’s family at this very difficult time. 'I can only imagine the sense of loss they must feel. 'Louise was a hugely popular and well-performing officer who is sorely missed by her colleagues. 'Many of the staff and officers who knew her have deeply felt the loss of Louise and we continue to offer ongoing support.' The circumstances surrounding the sergeant’s death were referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation. The watchdog has since asked Thames Valley Police to carry out a local probe, which is ongoing, before reporting back to the IPCC.

Rethink: Britain is reviewing its arms exports to Israel following the upsurge of violence in Gaza. Pictured are Israeli soldiers firing a mortar shell towards the Gaza Strip . In response to the crisis in Gaza, however, the government has now established a review to check whether pending exports should go ahead. Yesterday, David Cameron responded to the deadly attack on a school in Gaza by saying that international law stated that schools and civilian targets should not be targeted. But he declined to say whether he believed the Israelis had targeted the school, where 10 died, or whether the country’s actions were ‘criminal’. It comes following a simmering row between the Tories and Labour over what Ed Miliband described as the Prime Minister’s ‘silence’ over the action in Gaza. Over the weekend, the Labour leader criticised Mr Cameron for his failure to tell Israel its conduct had been ‘unacceptable and unjustifiable’. But the Conservatives hit by back by saying his ‘ultra-critical’ comments would hamper the search for peace. Export: The equipment has included ammunition, drones and armoured vehicles, as well as weapon control and targeting systems, bullet-proof garments and naval gun parts . The row came as an Israeli strike killed 10 and wounded 35 at a United Nations school in the town of Rafah, which was being used as a shelter for people displaced by the 27-day conflict between Israel and Hamas. On Sunday, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon described the attack as a ‘moral outrage and a criminal act’ and called for those responsible for the ‘gross violation of international humanitarian law’ to be held accountable. Speaking yesterday, Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the UN is right to speak out in the way that it has, because international law is very clear that there must not be the targeting of civilians or the targeting of schools if that is what has happened. ‘The UN as the international body is right to speak out in the way it has.’ But the Prime Minister declined to make the same accusations himself. Pressed on whether he regarded the attack as a ‘criminal act’, he told the BBC: ‘I’m not an international lawyer, so that’s up to international lawyers. Aftermath: David Cameron responded to the deadly attack on a UN school in Gaza (pictured) by saying that international law stated that schools and civilian targets should not be targeted . ‘But international law is very, very clear that the use of force always has to be proportionate and civilians should not be targeted.’ He added: ‘We obviously do think it is appalling the loss of life that there has been. From the start, though, we have also made the point that if the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel stop then that would be probably the fastest way to stop this conflict.’ Pressed on whether there was a case for reviewing arms exports to Israel in light of the conflict, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said this work was already underway. ‘We are currently reviewing all existing export licenses to Israel,’ she said. ‘Clearly each one is assessed on a case-by-case basis anyway when it’s granted, against strict criteria. We have one of the most rigorous systems in the world for licensing arms.’ She described the Rafah attack as a ‘particularly appalling incident’, adding that it was ‘not appropriate to be attacking people who are seeking shelter’. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the UK is to provide an extra £2million in emergency assistance to help provide mattresses, blankets, nappies, cooking equipment and other essential supplies for nearly 8,000 families who have fled the conflict in Gaza. ‘However vital the food, water and shelter that we are providing, ultimately we need an immediate and unconditional ceasefire which is respected by all sides,’ she said. ‘Only when the fighting stops can people begin to address some of the underlying causes of this conflict.'","Export licences granted to 130 UK defence manufacturers to sell to Israel .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . 'Could be jailed for war crimes': Reyaad Khan, 20, pictured above in an ISIS recruitment video, has boasted about executions and posted pictures online . A British jihadist could be tried for war crimes and jailed for life after using Twitter to brazenly boast about his role in the ‘execution’ of prisoners in Syria. Reyaad Khan, 20, has repeatedly uploaded bloodthirsty posts and pictures on social media bragging about the inhumane killings. In one he posted graphic photographs of the distorted corpses of alleged victims, tweeting: ‘Guys we caught & executed. This is how they looked less than an hr l8er’. The former college student from Cardiff also laughed about witnessing the ‘longest decapitation ever’ and boasted in another: ‘Executed many prisoners yesterday.’ His claims about his involvement in the crimes carried out by a unit of ISIS are now being investigated by the United Nations. Khan, who once dreamt of becoming Britain’s first Asian prime minister, could see his name added to the investigators’ list of suspected war criminals in Syria for future prosecution. Experts believe that Khan, who is one of three young men from Cardiff who joined the group, could also be put on trial for alleged war crimes in a British court if he ever returns to the UK. Gory: Khan uploaded pictures of men he said his militant comrades had executed, then seemingly disfigured . Propaganda: Kahn (left) appeared in a recruitment video encouraging young men to join ISIS's jihad in Syria and Iraq, alongside Nasser Muthana (centre) and former Aberdeen schoolboy Abdul Raqib Amin (right) Geoffrey Robertson QC, a former UN appeals judge, said: ‘Any boasts on social media – even a tweet – about killing will be jumped on by the prosecution as a confession and used in evidence. ‘If you fight for Isis, your complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity would be virtually inevitable.’ He added: ‘Young people contemplating travel to Syria to join a group like ISIS must be warned that if they return they can be prosecuted at the Old Bailey and jailed for long periods for the war crimes and crimes against humanity that these groups are committing. ‘Under an 1861 law, guilt of even one murder of a foreigner is enough to land them in jail for life.’ ISIS, which has recently changed its name to Islamic State, announced last month it has formed a caliphate across Syria and Iraq. Firepower: Boasting tweets posted by Khan include this picture of a modified machine gun . Risk: A QC and former UN judge said that tweets such as the above could lead to prosecution for murder . Up to 500 British Muslims are believed to be in the region with as many as half joining forces with ISIS, a group known for its extreme violence, including crucifying and beheading its enemies. Khan’s Twitter claims are being examined by the UN after details of his posts were passed on to investigators by the Sunday Times. The Welsh youngster who left for Syria earlier this year was first exposed as a jihadist in June after he appeared in an ISIS propaganda video brandishing a rifle urging other Britons to join him. Just last month, he used his Twitter account to boast about his part in the killings of rivals from the Islamist group Jabhat al-Nusra (JN) while fighting in the city of Deir Ezzor in Syria. Using his alias Abu Dujana RK he wrote on July 5: ‘Executed many prisoners yesterday, (they) sold their deen (religion) for $70 which they didn't even get.’ Terror: Khan's made flippant remarks about his jihad lifestyle, such as the above reference to suicide bombing . In response, another ISIS fighter said: ‘Epic executions bro, we need to step it up like the brothers in Iraq.’ Three days later on July 8, Khan, a former A-grade student, wrote: ‘Probably saw the longest decapitation ever. And we made sure the knife was sharp. Brother who was next decided to the use the glock (pistol) lol.’ When some of Khan’s Twitter followers morbidly asked for photographs, he replied: ‘Don't hav pics. Just vids. Not allowed to post. Bros un-masked in vid having fun.’ On July 16, Khan, whose parents have begged for him to return to their home in Riverside, posted several bloody images of bloated and disfigured corpses. His tweet added: 'JN guys we caught & executed. This is how they looked less than an hr l8er. Still think JN r knights of the Ummah (Muslim community)?’ Killings: Khan says he saw a man's head slowly removed, then includes 'lol', the acronym for 'laugh out loud' When one of his 1,500 followers, questioned the authenticity of the photos, Khan replied: ‘I was there when they got killed.’ Days later Khan also posted a picture of an automatic assault rifle with the caption, ‘Check this little badboy out’. And on July 20 he asked: ‘Anyone want to sponsor my explosive belt? Gucci give me a shout’ The head of the UN’s commission of inquiry on Syria, Paulo Pinheiro, revealed last week that UN investigation teams were currently compiling an exhaustive dossier on war crimes suspects including details of ISIS fighters. Mr Pinheiro said: ‘I can assure you we are now collecting information on perpetrators from all sides including non-state armed groups and ISIS.’ The UN human rights office added: ‘It is deeply tragic that young men like this are coming from abroad and getting sucked into this terrible conflict where the most appalling atrocities have become commonplace. ‘We will pass on any information we receive of serious crimes to the independent commission of inquiry on Syria.’","Reyaad Khan, 20, tweeted bloodthirsty messages and images .

"By . Daniel Mills . A disgruntled News Corp employee has tried to embarrass boss Rupert Murdoch on the eve of the company's 50th birthday celebrations for The Australian by parking a clapped-out old car plastered with bizarre notes out the front of his Sydney headquarters. In a brazen protest, the employee parked a car out the front of the company's headquarters in Surry Hills, Sydney, with letters stuck on its windows on behalf of the 'journalists, photographers and artists' of the company, criticising pay and conditions. It also questions recent financial decisions made at the company's headquarters, including a new $60 million publishing system that many employees either don't know how or refuse to use more than a year after its implementation. The notes attack the company's managers by claiming they are imposing 'a pay cut in real terms' that will hurt staff and force them to give up 'various allowances and conditions'. The letter was written and addressed to Rupert Murdoch on the eve of one of News Corp's biggest celebrations of the year - The Australian's 50th birthday . The letter as 'written' by the car on the rear of the vehicle which admits the journalist is being affected by the proposed pay cut . The unidentified journalist penned a bizarre open letter (left) to his boss Mr Murdoch (right) The protest car seen parked out the front of the Holt Street company by media website Mumbrella at about 7.30am on Monday was parked there in the hope that Mr Murdoch would see it as he came to the office this morning. Mr Murdoch, who is in Sydney for celebrations to mark The Australian's 50th anniversary tomorrow night, gave an interview in which he hit out at climate change and described Prime Minister Tony Abbott as someone the public could look up to and admire. Mr Abbott once worked as a journalist at The Australian. But while the 50th birthday bash is expected to attract a host of dignitaries - including Mr Abbott - the party was clearly the last thing on the mind of the disgruntled staffer who parked the protest car in front of the News Corp building. The car which was parked outside the News Corp headquarters, and seen by Mumbrella at 7.30am on Monday . Another letter posted on the rear of the vehicle claims the journalist cannot afford to upgrade their ageing vehicle. 'Yes I know! I should be retired,' the letter reads. 'But my owner is a journalist at News Corp. They want to cut his pay in real terms and slash his conditions. So he can’t afford to replace me, and I have to work until I drop. Liberty.” A poster from the journalists union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, was also stuck on the car.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . The honour of captaining Manchester United for one game on tour might not carry quite the same significance for Tom Cleverley as it did for Wayne Rooney, but the England midfielder hopes it is an indication of an equally bright future for him under Louis van Gaal’s management. Cleverley’s decline at Old Trafford last season was one of the more regrettable aspects of the David Moyes debacle. Often played out of position and then not at all, a midfielder who had shown such promise under Sir Alex Ferguson even became a target for his own supporters. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cleverley score a brilliant one touch passing goal . Honour: Tom Cleverley captained Manchester United against Roma after a tough year at the club . Personal training: The England international has got off to a fine start under Louis van Gaal . VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . It came to a head with a spiteful internet petition to have Cleverley (below) axed from England’s World Cup squad. Roy Hodgson defended him, but a lack of playing time at United ultimately cost the player a place on the plane to Brazil. Cleverley, who turns 25 next week, used the summer to take stock. He went on holiday with his partner Georgina Dorsett and their baby daughter, Nevaeh, and came back determined to fight for his Old Trafford future under Van Gaal. The reports from the manager’s Dutch coaching staff have been so positive that Cleverley played in every game on tour and was made captain for the victory over Roma in Denver. It would be no surprise at all if a contract that is due to run out next summer is now extended, amid strong interest from Everton. Future clear: Cleverley will be hoping to provide United with an English core with Wayne Rooney . Eyebrows raised: Cleverley struggled last year - there was even a petition for him not to make the World Cup . Cleverley admits he was hurt by the criticism but it has only made him more determined to prove his detractors wrong. ‘It makes you develop a lot thicker skin,’ he said. ‘You’ve just got to take it on the chin. It’s football. ‘Fans are passionate and they like to see their team win. And when their team isn’t winning, they’ve got a right to look at the team. I will use it as a learning curve and not dwell on it as a negative. ‘Yeah, I got a bit of stick. It does hurt when it comes from your own fans, I suppose it would anyone really. I definitely want to prove a few people wrong. ‘But I’m not here to talk about David Moyes. We’ve got a clear way we are going to play under the new manager. We all believe in that, we are all following that and I think the main thing is we are playing as a team again. ‘Under the new manager we are being told to think of things as a team but personally it has gone well. I definitely think I can fit into the way he plays. I don’t think I have got to make much adaptation because he likes passers, movers, and people who understand the game. Fighting back: He will be hoping to live up to his early promise at Old Trafford . Strict: Van Gaal has laid down the law at United - he will tell those who aren't in his plans this week . ‘I’ve got minutes under my belt out here, I feel fit, we’ve won every game, one of them on penalties. We’re back being a top team together. ‘I would still have loved to have gone (to the World Cup) but I think I made it hard for myself to go to Brazil with not playing in the last three months of the season. ‘I played in a lot of the qualifiers, but I’m not bitter about it. I’m fully hoping to get back into the squad and help us get to the next Euros.’ Cleverley acknowledges that fatherhood has also played a part in his resurgence. ‘Definitely,’ he added. ‘I’ve learned a few things, off and on the pitch. Obviously being a new dad you learn how to live your life better as well. You need to get into your sleeping routines and all that. I’ve definitely learned from it and hopefully I will improve because of it this year.’","Cleverley captained United against Roma in International Champions Cup .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Florida, Dubai, Las Vegas are today’s Premier League footballers’ holiday destinations of choice. But 100 years ago, World War One descended across Europe, taking the sportsman of England — with varying degrees of rapidity — to the killing fields of France and Belgium. Earlier this year a delegation of English football luminaries stood in a cold, windswept corner of northern France. They saw Lochnagar Crater where Second Lieutenant Donald Bell, a full back with Bradford Park Avenue, won his Victoria Cross. He had filled his pockets with grenades and attacked an enemy machine-gun post. Writing home, he said of his deliverance: ‘I am glad I have been so fortunate for Pa’s sake, for I know he likes his lads to be top of the tree. Hard life: Offices and men play a game of football during the war . Respect: Living and playing conditions were a whole lot different to the ones modern footballers now have . First class: No expense is spared for the current crop of footballers these days . He used to be always on about too much play and too little work, but my athletics came in handy this trip. We are out of the trenches at present and I am perfectly fit. The only thing is I am sore at elbows and knees with crawling over limestone flints. I believe that God is watching over me and it rests with him whether I pull through or not.’ Five days after his bravery won him football’s only VC of the Great War, he undertook a similarly brave raid and died, aged 25. His letter had yet to reach England. Bell’s wife of one month, Rhoda, was presented with his medal by King George V. But, for all its many conspicuous war heroes, football’s reluctance to stop playing as the conflict started damaged the sport’s standing in public esteem. More of that later. The first shot of what turned into war came with the assassination in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg Empire. Yet the 38,000 spectators at the two-day Eton-Harrow cricket match were more concerned with the state of the pitch than the affairs of mainland Europe. Soon, however, cricketers had hung up their pads to fight. A remarkable 34 first-class cricketers died during four years of fighting that started on August 4, 1914. One of those was Percy Jeeves of Warwickshire. He was a fast-medium bowler, tipped on the evidence of just one sighting by Plum Warner — the Middlesex captain and one of the most important cricket figure of the age — as a future England player. But it was another Plum who gave Jeeves immortality. PG Wodehouse saw Jeeves play for Hawes CC in Yorkshire and thought the name perfect for a resourceful valet, hence Jeeves and Wooster. The real Jeeves was 28 when he died at High Wood near Montauban on July 22, 1916. WG Grace: Regarded as the inventor of modern batting. Scored 1098 Test runs for England between 1880 and 1899. Colin Blythe: One of the best bowlers of his generation. More than 2500 wickets for Kent and 100 in 19 Tests. Ronald Poulton-Palmer: England rugby captain and wing. Arthur Wilson: Won silver at the 1908 Olympics with the British rugby union team. Richard Garnons Williams: Welsh forward who played in his country’s first international rugby match in 1881 — his only game for the national side. Noel Chavasse: Ran the 400m for Britain at the 1908 Olympics. Tony Wilding: New Zealander who won Wimbledon four times. Georges Boillot: First driver to win the French Grand Prix twice. Donald Bell: Bradford PA footballer, given the Victoria Cross for outstanding bravery. Sandy Turnbull: Scot who scored the only goal in Man Utd’s 1909 FA Cup final win. Others to perish were Colin Blythe of Kent and England, whose memorial stands at St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, and AEJ Collins, who is famed for scoring the world record 628 in a house match, at Clifton College in 1899. The war also accounted for WG Grace. The most famous sportsman of Victorian England, suffered a fatal heart attack when a Zeppelin dropped a bomb on his patio in 1915. It was Grace’s intervention, along with the heavy death toll of the Battle of Mons, that brought a cessation to the cricket season after initial opposition from government and the MCC, who decreed that ‘no good purpose can be served at the moment by cancelling matches’. Yet the position was becoming unsustainable. Grace wrote in a letter to The Sportsman: ‘The time has arrived when the country cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting at a time like this that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day... I should like to see all first-class cricketers of suitable age set a good example and come to the help of their country without delay in its hours of need.’ The last first-class cricket match was played at Hove on September 2. The MCC declared ‘the continuation of cricket is hurtful to the feelings of a section of the public’. First-class cricket resumed in 1919. By then 210 cricketers had fought, including the Indian Hardit Singh Malik, the ‘flying hobgoblin’, an Oxford golf blue, who wore his flying helmet over his turban. The spirit that sportsman took on to the battlefield was usually inculcated in the public schools, the mood of which was summed up in Henry Newbolt’s poem: And England’s far, and Honour a name/ But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:/‘Play up! Play up! And play the game!’ In their book Public Schools and the Great War, Anthony Seldon and David Walsh tell the story of Captain Billie Neville, of the East Surrey Regiment, a former captain of hockey and cricket and head boy at Dover School, who bought four footballs for each of his platoons so they could kick their way across No Man’s Land. Neville was as relaxed about the war as he might have been about a house match. Legend: WG Grace was a batting sensation for England during the 19th century . In a letter to his parents he said: ‘As I write the shells are fairly haring over; you know one gets sort of bemused after a few million. Still, it’ll be a great experience to tell one’s children about.’ Aged just 21, he died on July 1, 1916 at Carnoy, yards in front of the German wire. Valour took many forms. Noel Chavasse, who ran for Britain in the 400metres at White City in London’s 1908 Olympics, was the son of an Anglican bishop and graduated from Oxford. He is also one of only three men to have been awarded the VC twice — for saving lives. ‘His courage and self-sacrifice were beyond praise,’ read the citation in The London Gazette of his first VC, when he treated wounded soldiers at Guillemont in sight of the enemy. That evening he searched No Man’s Land for four hours. The following day he rescued three people from a shell hole 25 yards from the German trenches. As the current edition of the Olympian newsletter reports, the citation read: ‘Although he was severely wounded while carrying a wounded soldier to the dressing station, he refused to leave his post and for two days not only continued to perform his duties but went round repeatedly under heavy fire to search for and attend to the wounded.’ Chavasse suffered a severe stomach injury when a shell exploded at an aid post, and died on August 4, 1917, aged 32. Brilliant:  Colin Blythe was one of the best bowlers of his generation . Rugby’s deceased included Ronnie Poulton-Palmer, the England captain and wing who had scored four tries against France in 1914. He was one of 26 England internationals to perish. Thirty Scottish rugby internationals died. Rugby was responsible for founding one of the most distinguished sporting battalions, Mobbs’ Own, the idea of England back Edgar Mobbs, drawn from Northampton and Bedford. The Mobbs Memorial Match is still played to this day between the British Army and the Northampton Saints. From other sports, Tony Wilding, the New Zealander who won the Wimbledon gentleman’s singles four times, died. Grand Prix racing driver Georges Boillot, of France, was shot down in a dogfight against five German Fokkers. He crashed near Bar-le-Duc and died of the injuries. Football matches were played by soldiers, occasionally of opposing sides, as at Christmas in 1914, which prompted the current FA to commission a floodlit pitch to be built at Ypres. But, back home, our national sport had a mixed war. Of course many men contributed greatly to the war effort, but not immediately. Speaking to an Army battalion, Field Marshall Lord Roberts of Kandahar summed up a growing anger at football’s slowness in abandoning its fixture list, saying: ‘I respect and honour you more than I can say. How different is your action from that of the men who can still go on with their cricket and football, as if the very existence of our nation were not at stake.’ Champion: Tony Wilding won the prestigious Wimbledon on four occasions . The FA Cup and top two divisions played on. There was even the ‘Khaki Cup Final’ in 1915, so called because of the number of soldiers attending in uniform. But when the Earl of Derby presented the Cup to Sheffield United, who beat Chelsea, he declared it was everybody’s duty to ‘play a sterner game for England’. Football stopped. The primacy of the war effort had been understood more readily over the border at Hearts, where the manager John McCartney started up a Pals’ Battalion on November 26, 1914. He said: ‘Now then, young men, as you have followed the old club through sunshine and rain, roll up in your hundreds for King and Country, for right and freedom. Don’t let it be said that footballers are shirkers and cowards.’ Three of the Hearts team — Harry Wattie, Duncan Currie and Ernie Ellis — died on the first day of the Somme offensive on July 1, 1916. But damage to football’s good name had already been done, denting its status as the principal winter sport of the public schools. By 1929, the number of public and grammar schools affiliated to the RFU had more than quadrupled in a decade to 133. The oval-ball game was seen as a noble sport with British values. This trend caused Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski to argue in their book Why England Lose that ‘only when there are England players with educated accents might the national team maximise its potential.’ The latest chance of many to prove that verdict wrong comes at the European Championship in July, 2016 — the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.","While footballers nowadays enjoy breaks to the likes of Florida and Las Vegas it was a totally different story 100 years ago .

Jordan, born and raised in Barbados before earning a scholarship to Dulwich College at 16, endured a difficult afternoon with the ball in India’s first innings at the Ageas Bowl, sending down four wides in a wayward spell that raised questions over his unconventional approach to the crease. Holding’s criticism was fierce, with the Sky analyst claiming the 25-year-old’s confidence was ‘shattered’ while highlighting a string of technical problems he says need fixing. Stand up and take notice: Chris Jordan has taken criticism from Michael Holding on board this summer . Not holding back: The former West Indian seamer was fierce in his opinions on Jordan . Keep it quick: Jordan said he is always looking to improve and would 'enjoy' talking to Holding about the game . Jordan insisted: ‘My approach to the crease is different but everyone is unique and different things work for different people and that works for me right now. I don’t intend changing too much. 'You’re always looking to improve as a cricketer and if you get a window where you can improve then I’d be more than happy to work on it. But at this moment I don’t see too much that I need to change. ‘Playing international cricket is all about having a strong mind and strong character — sticking to what has got you to that stage in the first place. ‘Michael Holding has vast international experience and was a great fast bowler. You’re always looking to learn new things and push your game on. He’s someone I’d probably enjoy speaking to about the game. ‘In the first innings everything didn’t go according to plan. There were a couple of balls that didn’t come out of the fingers quite right. But it’s nothing I’m too worried about because I put it right in the second innings. ‘I’m not the sort of player who gets too caught up in disappointments. It’s all about how you come back from those disappointments. I’ll just mark it down as one bad day in my international career.’ On the rise: Jordan has broken into England's Test and is looking to become a regular .

The 36-year-old midfielder has signed a two-year contract with emerging MLS side New York City — one of Manchester City’s sister clubs. But the American side do not enter the league until next March so Lampard will play for the Premier League champions until January. VIDEO Scroll down to see Arsene Wenger: Lampard loan raises FFP suspicions . Confident: Man City don't believe they've broken Financial Fair Play rules with Frank Lampard loan signing . New deal: The midfielder join New York FC on a two-year deal after being released by Chelsea . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger raised doubts at the weekend over whether Lampard’s loan — given the club he is contracted to — adhered to the FFP rules to stop clubs spending more than they earn. City failed UEFA’s FFP tests last season and must include five home-grown players in a restricted 21-man Champions League squad — of which Lampard will be one. However City, who are close to breaking even this year, are steadfast in their belief that they have not bent UEFA’s regulations in their move for Lampard. UEFA rules state Lampard’s loan move falls inside the FFP guidelines provided City pay the former Chelsea midfielder’s wages, which they insist they will. Although Manchester City, New York City, Melbourne City and are all owned by holding company City Football Group — who also own shares in Yokohama Marinos — they are run as standalone businesses. With that in mind, City believe the relationships with their sister clubs are no different from feeder club arrangements — for example Chelsea’s agreement with Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem. Suspicious: Arsene Wenger has raised concerns over the Lampard deal . City do not see loan arrivals from New York, Melbourne or Yokohama becoming a regular occurrence. They feel the main benefit of the partnerships will be for the club’s talented academy players to be loaned out. Meanwhile, Monaco defender Ricardo Carvalho has spoken of his surprise at Lampard’s move to City. Carvalho, who spent six seasons at Stamford Bridge with Lampard, said: ‘I’m a supporter of Chelsea so of course I would prefer to see him back at Chelsea rather than in a City shirt.

But now he’s had a taste of senior action it has left him wanting more. ‘It is up to the manager, but I’m going to try and make his decision as difficult as possible, it’s my job really,’ he said. ‘I’m no-one yet. It is just pre-season and I haven’t done anything in big games, so I’m just going to keep my head down and work hard.’ And Aarons would rather not head out on loan this season. ‘I’m hoping to get involved in a first team this season and make an impact,’ he added. ‘Before every game I pray to not be injured and just go out and be guided to a performance. ‘I worked so hard off-season. I wasn’t expecting to be pushing for the first team, so I’m surprised.But I’m happy with what I did off-season – it gave me the opportunity to do what I’m doing here.’ On the run: Aarons uses his pace to get away from Huddersfield's Phillip Billing at the John Smith's Stadium .","The winger terrorised Schalke in recent friendly .

Bittar's arrival at the BHA coincided with a well publicised stand-off over the new whip rules and he was credited with resolving the furore between the sport's governing body and jockeys.

"By . Laura Williamson . David Weir seemed a little embarrassed when told he had joined Daley Thompson, Sally Gunnell and Linford Christie by completing track and field’s grand slam of Olympic or Paralympic, world, European and Commonwealth titles. ‘I’m still just Dave from the Roundshaw council estate in London,’ he said following his victory in the T54 1500m at Hampden Park on Thursday. ‘But it is the best feeling ever. This was what made me not retire after the London 2012 Paralympic Games; the feeling of getting another medal. ‘If I didn’t do it, it would haunt me for the rest of my life. It is a fantastic feeling to make your country proud.’ Always on top: David Weir made it a track and field grand slam at Hampden Park with another win . Wave: Weir is still as passionate as ever and his emotion was appreciated by the crowd at Hampden Park . Weir remains the unassuming family man who transforms into a fierce competitor on the track and still remembers to dedicate victory to his son Mason, who turned three yesterday. Athletes can be hesitant to talk about their pride in representing their country for, as Sir Bradley Wiggins put it, ‘you’re not really allowed to support England now’, but not Weir. He is unashamedly patriotic about wearing an England vest. The same applies to representing Great Britain and Weir  has pledged to try to carry on until the next Paralympics in 2016. The ‘Weirwolf’ will be 37 by then; a far cry from the 17-year-old who quit athletics after the Atlanta Games in 1996, disillusioned by the way paralympic athletes were treated. Top of the pile: The 'Weirwolf' is looking to terrify opponents at the Paralymics as he's not finished yet . Now para-sport events enjoy equal billing at these Commonwealth Games. The reception Weir received was just as passionate as the guttural roar that accompanied Scotland’s Eilidh Child winning silver in the 400m hurdles later that night. It was cold, wet and horrible at Hampden on Thursday night and yet it was still Weir, in his old-fashioned leather and suede gloves that mean his rivals cannot hear him coming before he bursts past them, who had the experience and fitness to navigate the puddles and make a decisive charge for the line with 300m to go. Easy does it: Weir made a late dash in the last 300m to take yet another gold to add to his trophy cabinet . Wheelchair racing is also a strong, competitive and fascinating sport, with athletes of the calibre of Australia’s 11-time Paralympic medallist Kurt Fearnley in the Commonwealth Games and Weir’s great rival Marcel Hug at the European Championships in Swansea next month. And yet, time and time again, Weir comes out on top over a range of distances from 400m to the marathon. In winning his first Commonwealth title, ‘Just Dave’ really has cemented his place among the greats. Bring it on: Weir will have his opponents waiting for the day he retires as he leads the field yet again .","'Weirwolf' now has Olympic/Paralympic, World, European and Commonwealth titles which ranks him alongside Daley Thompson .

"By . James Andrew . Follow @@JamesAndrew_ . Brentford's Mark Warburton may not be one of the famous managerial names in English football, but Marcos Tebar says he’s in the same bracket as Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. Tebar signed a two-year deal at SkyBet Championship newboys Brentford this summer, having learnt his trade at Real Madrid. The Spanish midfielder, who made just one senior appearance at the Bernabeu, had first-hand experience of working with Mourinho and Pellegrini but believes his new manager is best suited to his style of play. The Bees' knees: Mark Warburton is highly rated by Brentford's summer signing Marcos Tebar (below) Tebar said: ‘I played with the first team at Real Madrid during pre-season under both Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. ‘I was at Madrid during Mourinho’s first season and he had a very good relationship with the players. ‘I improved my football under him, mainly the defensive side of my game. ‘Pellegrini was also a good manager and I think he wants to play more with the ball whereas Mourinho is more defensive. Spanish flair: Tebar came through the ranks at Real Madrid and played for Almeria in La Liga last season . ‘But Warburton is also very good. I like his style of play, it is good for me because it is the way I like to play football. I like to be in possession and pass the ball. ‘Out of the three managers I would say Mark’s style of football suits me the best, I feel comfortable with the way he plays the game.’ Tebar was close to moving to Griffin Park last season before making the switch to Almeria in La Liga. But Warburton finally got his man this summer when the 28-year-old terminated his contract in Spain. The midfielder is determined to make his name for himself in England and dreams of following other Spaniards by starring in the Premier League. The Special One: Tebar played under Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho at the Bernabeu . He added: ‘Last year I was close to coming to Brentford, but at the last moment I got an offer from Almeria and I wanted to test myself in La Liga. ‘But I had another offer from Brentford this summer and this time I came because I wanted to play in England. ‘Playing in La Liga was a great experience for me. Two of the best players in the world play there, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and challenging them and trying to get the ball off them is very hard. ‘But I have signed a contract for two years with an option for a third at Brentford, so I want to be an important player in this team and play here for a long time.’ Trophy boy: Manuel Pellegrini helped Manchester City to the Premier League title last season . Brentford’s return to the second tier of English football ended 21 years in the bottom two divisions. And Warburton is not going into this season just to make up the numbers, with a new stadium on horizon, there is plenty of positivity around the west London club as they head into their season opener against capital rivals Charlton. The former Watford academy coach wants the Bees to follow the path set by Sean Dyche’s Burnley last season. Tough test: Tebar pitted his wits against the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo last campaign . Warburton said: ‘Our long-term aim is to fill the new stadium. That’s what we use as our driving force in the dressing room – to fill a 20,000-seater stadium. ‘How do we do that? By playing the right type of football to get the fan base in, but we’ve got to believe in what we do. ‘We’ll set short-term targets, every five or seven games, but it’s about us having the self-belief. ‘We’ve got to look at positive examples, like Burnley last year. Great job: Warburton wants Brentford to follow the influence of Burnley and Sean Dyche . ‘Sean Dyche did a magnificent job on one of the smallest budgets in the division. ‘It’s not about budget all the time, it’s about discipline, self-belief and Sean had that in abundance. We’ve got to learn from that and try to replicate it here. ‘We’re good friends and spoke a lot last year. He spoke of his budget being a survival one really, so it shows the quality of job he did. ‘That tells our players it’s not about having people on 20 or 30 grand a week. It’s about applying yourself and maximising what you have.’ If Warburton does manage follow Burnley into the Premier League then there could be more people than just Tebar comparing him to Mourinho and Pellegrini.","Brentford summer signing worked with Mourinho and Pellegrini at Madrid .

"By . James Restall . As Eilidh Child roared over the finish line at Hampden on Thursday night, the capture of a second Commonwealth silver medal was not the only hurdle she had successfully cleared. As she raced off on her lap of honour, the Games’ poster-girl from Perth could also delight in having fulfilled the expectations of a nation with a taste for glory following eight days of unprecedented success. Delight in the knowledge that her run had delivered Scotland’s record return on the track for a generation. But, perhaps more importantly, the 27-year-old could tick off another box on her wedding plan. Child is set to tie the knot with her fiance Brian Doyle in October next year, but the couple had put preparations for their nuptials on hold during training for Glasgow. Joy: Scotland's Eilidh Child wins 400m hurdles silver on home soil at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Amazed: Child puts her hands over her mouth in shock as she claims a silver medal at Hampden Park . Emotional: Hampden Park rose to cheer home favourite Child home in the 400m hurdles final on Thursday . Embrace: Child hugs her supporters after claiming silver medal in the 400m hurdles final in Glasgow . One idea they had mooted was to name the tables at the wedding reception after athletics stadiums. Now, after confirming her seat at the Commonwealth Games’ top table, Child is ready to make Hampden the centrepiece of her ceremony. ‘We’re getting married in October next year. The only thing that we can confirm now is that we are going to do different stadiums as the table names,’ the athlete beamed. ‘Glasgow was going to be one of them, but if the race didn’t go the way I wanted, I didn’t want to be reminded of it! Now Glasgow can be the head table!’ It was a night which is already being commemorated in the streets of Glasgow. Many are embracing Scotland’s triumphs by donning traffic cones beneath the Wellington statue — the duke’s own hat gleaming with gold once more. Hundreds lined the streets of the Merchant City yesterday afternoon as their silver star showed off her prize atop the Irn Bru store — one little girl was overheard begging her mother: 'Will Eilidh be there?' Streaming clear: Child was comfortably ahead of the bronze medal position in the final of the 400m hurdles . Hurdling: Child looks focused as she makes her way around the track during the 400m hurdles final . One place she won’t be is back on the track tonight. The former-PE teacher elected to sit out yesterday’s 4x400metres relay heats, but her younger team-mates’ fourth-place finish wasn’t enough to give Child one last Hampden hurrah. ‘It’s quite a young, new team,’ she said, ahead of the race. ‘They asked me if I wanted to run the heat but I took a step back, and said it would be really nice for the four girls who have not raced at the championships yet to go out and run. ‘Lynsey Sharp and I are the other members of the team, so we’ve already been out there and seen that crowd. It’s great for all Scottish athletes to appreciate that crowd.’ Although the relay girls will not be appearing on the podium, Child is tipping the rest of Team Scotland’s athletes to add to their best medal haul on the track since their five in Auckland in 1990. ‘It’s brilliant, because we’ve only won two medals at each of five Commonwealths,’ she said. ‘It’s great that we’ve got that monkey off our backs and gone one extra. ‘Hopefully it doesn’t stop with me, hopefully there’s more medals to come in the next couple of days as well. The whole of Team Scotland has upped its game and it just shows you what you can do when there’s a home games with that whole support behind you’ Hugs: Child looks on in disbelief having claimed a Commonwealth silver medal in the 400m hurdles final . Patriotic: Child walks around the Hampden Park track holding a Scottish Saltire in her hand after the final . After the whirlwind of Glasgow, what next? One thing’s for sure, the Face of the Games is unlikely to experience the same level of expectation she felt here when she competes on the world stage. ‘It’s really good for me because I’m probably not going to race on a bigger stage,’ Child explained. ‘I know the Commonwealths are not valued the same as the Olympics, but for me, a home Games is about the most pressure I’m going to have on me at a championships. ‘I’m just happy that I dealt with it in the right way. It means that when I go to Rio, when I go to the World Championships, I’ll be in a better position that what I’ve been in before. I am confident that I will be able to conduct myself well like I’ve done here. ‘I’ve got about a week until the European Championships, where I am ranked No1. Hopefully, I can try and get another medal there, but it really depends on how I recover from this. ‘I’ve never really done back-to-back championships before, but hopefully I can come back and do something there as well.’ Having drunk deep in the euphoria of Glasgow 2014, some might expect Child to use the momentum to target an elusive Olympic medal in two year’s time. Having finally shed weeks and months of pressure, she isn’t in a hurry to pile to it all back on. ‘I don’t like to set myself targets because it limits you,’ Child smiled. ‘I think I will just see what happens.’ Adored: Child walks around Hampden Park and claps the hands of her Scottish fans after the final .","Child was the poster girl of Glasgow 2014 and came home in second place .

The number of confirmed cases of measles in the Swansea epidemic has risen to 588, according to health officials in Wales. The latest figures show that 40 new cases of the disease have been diagnosed since Wednesday. Up to 20 new cases a day are being reported by GPs, with 109 new ones in a week over the Easter period. Health officials have estimated around 3,800 children in the Swansea area have still not had the MMR vaccine and parents are being asked to act. Vaccination: Lauren Durbin, aged 10 months, is given an MMR injection by Sister Sian Owen today . Injection: Kieran Elford, aged 13, is given an MMR injection following the epidemic . Dr Marion Lyons, Director of Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said: 'The alarming numbers of cases of measles and continuing spread of the disease in Wales illustrates how vital it is for parents to get their children vaccinated. 'Unvaccinated children aged between six and 12 months living in or travelling to the outbreak areas of Swansea and Neath Port Talbot can be offered vaccination by their GP. 'There's no adverse effect to this extra jab and those children would still need to receive the recommended two doses at 13 months and three years four months.' Rise: The latest figures show that 40 new cases of the disease have been diagnosed since Wednesday . Dr Lyons added that increasing numbers of people coming forward for the MMR vaccination was encouraging - with just under 600 people in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area alone receiving an unscheduled MMR vaccine in the past seven days. 'We are really pleased to see that 586 people have proactively got the MMR vaccine over the past week, on top of those already scheduled to have it,' she added. 'Though this is a good start, there are still thousands of children who have not had both doses of the MMR jab and so are still at risk from becoming infected with the potentially fatal measles virus. ‘The risk to unvaccinated children in Wales is increasing as the disease . spreads. 'You only need one or two people who haven't had the . vaccination in a community to put at risk babies, toddlers and anyone . else who is vulnerable, such as children with leukaemia who cannot have . the vaccination and pregnant women who haven't been vaccinated. 'Ninety per cent of children receiving one dose of MMR are very quickly . protected against measles. For those completing the recommended two-dose . course of MMR, 99 per cent of children will be protected against . measles.’ She warned: ‘Their health is dependent on those with whom they have . close contact being fully protected against measles so that it cannot . spread to them. The number of confirmed cases of measles (pictured) in the Swansea epidemic has risen to 588, Public Health Wales has confirmed . ‘The current pattern of cases and spread of illness indicates that this . outbreak is likely to continue into the summer months and the risks to . unvaccinated individuals will increase as more people become infected. ‘Protection against the risk of measles by getting MMR vaccination is safe, simple and effective.' Drop-in MMR vaccination clinics are being held by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board between 10am and 4pm on Saturday April 6 at Morriston Hospital, Singleton Hospital, the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and the Paediatric Outpatients at Neath Port Talbot Hospital. No appointments are necessary. Children and adolescents who have not had their scheduled MMR jabs will be targeted, but officials say 'no-one will be turned away, including adults'.","Hospitals in the region opened drop-in clinics today following increase .

"By . Graeme Yorke . A selection of Newcastle's young players returned to the club's training ground on Friday to undergo fitness tests ahead of the new season. With the two of the club's French contingent - Moussa Sissoko and Mathieu Debuchy - at the World Cup in Brazil and senior players still enjoying their break, Sammy Ameobi and Co were put through their paces.

Unless Arsenal sell him in the current transfer window, it means the central defender can sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas side from January. The Gunners do not want to sell their captain this summer, but also want to avoid the possibility of losing him for nothing next year. Barcelona, Manchester United and Napoli all have a firm interest in Vermaelen.

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Andy Murray is set to confirm that he will be continuing his groundbreaking coaching arrangement with Amelie Mauresmo, despite his untimely quarter final exit from Wimbledon earlier this month. Murray is more than a week into his mid-season training block in Miami and the 35 year-old former women’s number one has joined him as he prepares for next month’s hard court events leading into the U.S Open. He is likely to end speculation by announcing in the next few days that their relationship will carry on after an initial spell working together during the four-week grass court season. Conditioning: Andy Murray receives treatment from his physio Mark Bender with Amelie Mauresmo in background . Push: Andy Murray works out in Miami as he looks to bounce back from his disappointing Wimbledon defence . Heat: Murray trains on court without his shirt on in the warm temperatures in Miami . As Sportsmail first revealed, the plan was always for this to be a long-term deal with a trial period at first, rather than the other way round, and her presence in Florida appears to confirm the commitment on both sides. It was thought the biggest stumbling block might be a reluctance to travel on her part. But it seems she has cut short her summer holiday to be with him ahead of the Canadian Open, his next tournament, which begins on August 4 in Toronto. Murray has said that at times he may be willing to do training blocks nearer to where it might be convenient for her, but with the punishing conditions for the next few tournaments he was adamant he wanted to head to south Florida at this time of year. Also in Miami are assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green, both of whom are known to have been unhappy at being kept out of the loop about his original plan to work with Mauresmo. Their presence suggests that has been smoothed over, although there may be some small adjustments to the way his support staff operate in future, or its make-up, when the announcement is made. Loss: Murray suffered a disappointing quarter-final defeat at the hands of Grigor Dimitrov . Victor: Dimitrov beat Murray in straight sets on Centre Court to end the Brit's Wimbledon defence . Murray played beautifully at Wimbledon until putting in a bafflingly poor performance in the quarter final, albeit against an inspired Grigor Dimitrov. Combined with his unscheduled exit from the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club it did not add up to a dream start with Mauresmo, although he made clear from the outset that it would be too early to make an impact either way at Wimbledon. Amid the fever of the fortnight there was much speculation about his reported cry in the quarter final referring to ‘five minutes before the match’, although I understand that he actually said ’45 minutes’ before the match, in reference to some technical instruction from his staff. Either way it has not been of any long-term importance. Before taking a brief break prior to resuming training Murray made it clear he had enjoyed working with the former SW19 women’s champion, and now it seems he wants her to take him forward for a much longer period. In some ways this is a good place for them to start in earnest together, as he is freed from the pressure of being Wimbledon champion, is over his back surgery, and has slipped back into the chasing pack with a world ranking of number ten. He probably has a window of four or five years to add to his Grand Slam and Olympic haul, with no sign of the competition easing. After losing at Wimbledon Murray suggested that he would be taking the forthcoming Masters level tournaments in Canada and Cincinatti more seriously than he has in the past, as arguably what hurt him most on the grass was his lack of big wins going into the tournament. 'It’s been a year since I won an event and the best way to prepare for majors is by winning a lot of matches and I have not done that,' he said. 'In Doha (January) I didn’t do that, I didn’t do that before the French, I didn’t win Queens. 'It hasn’t stopped me playing from having good runs in the Slams but to have great ones it helps if you have a good build-up.'

"The cold war engulfing Blackpool intensified on Saturday as hundreds of fans demonstrated against club owners, the Oyston family. Resentment is building among Blackpool followers towards chairman Karl Oyston, who has cut the playing staff to leave manager Jose Riga with just 14 registered players before Saturday’s start to the Championship. They are yet to sign a goalkeeper and, at one point in the second half of the 1-0 defeat by Burnley, Riga was forced to field eight trialists. Before the defeat by Burnley — in which Marvin Sordell scored the only goal — home fans marched to Bloomfield Road. They wore ‘Oyston Out’ T-shirts and shouted derogatory chants such as ‘you greedy b*****d, get out of our club’. Get lost: Blackpool fans show their disgust at the Oyston family before their pre-season clash against Burnley .

'They need to get 16 or 17 players together before they go to Nottingham Forest next week. 'We will see what the players are like, I don't know many of them. We will see if they can manage in the Championship because it's a difficult league. They say it is an easy league to get out of. Yes, it is if you drop down but getting up is not easy. 'Looking at this season now, after all the changes, they will be looking for some kind of stability as a success. The easy news story is to hit it now with the recent problems but It's been over the last two seasons and it's been coming. They have had four managers in just over two years. There is no real stability there and that's what matters. The one redeeming factor is that the season lasts nine months and a lot can happen.' It is understood that relations between Belgian coach Riga and the club's hierachy remain frosty and curiosity was also aroused on Saturday by the sight of Brian Flynn, the former Doncaster Rovers manager, sitting in the stands and taking notes. Flynn was almost appointed by Oyston in May before a sudden u-turn due to the chairman's unease over the make-up of the Welshman's backroom staff.

"By . Sam Peters . FIFA has been called on to launch an urgent investigation into an incident which saw Uruguay defender Alvaro Pereira play on after being knocked unconscious against England. FIFpro, the union representing professional footballers across the globe, insist the incident shows that the world governing body is failing to protect players. Pereira was knocked out after his head smashed into Raheem Sterling’s knee in the 61st minute of Uruguay’s 2-1 win on Thursday. Collision course: Raheem Sterling and Alvaro Pereira hurtle towards each other as they challenge for the ball . Crunch: Alvaro Pereira instantly falls to the ground after being hit by Raheem Sterling's knee . Down and out: Alvaro Pereira lies motionless are being knocked out following a collision with Raheem Sterling . The players’ union has called for independent match-day doctors to be introduced to prevent teams flouting head injury guidelines. ‘Football is awash with incidents in which players suffer potentially concussive blows to the head and stay on the pitch,’ FIFpro said in a statement. ‘In Pereira’s case, he demanded to play on, overruling advice from Uruguay’s team doctor for him to be immediately substituted. ‘FIFpro understands that faced by the pressures of such an important international stage, many players would react in this way. There are times, however, when the players also require greater protection against the prospect of making any rash decisions.’ Pereira later apologised for refusing to leave the field after ‘the lights went out’ following the accidental clash but the incident again highlights the problem contact sports face in dealing with what has been termed a ‘global concussion crisis’. Worrying scenes: Uruguay players gather around Alvaro Pereira after he is knocked out . Saying no: Alvaro Pereira refuses to leave the field after coming round following his collision . Concussion has become the single biggest issue facing professional sport following a £450million settlement with former American footballers suffering early onset dementia linked to repetitive head injuries. The players had accused the NFL of knowingly underplaying the risks of concussion. Football, rugby union, rugby league and horse-racing are among the sports reviewing their concussion protocols over fears they too could face crippling lawsuits. Earlier this month the Mail on Sunday revealed that former England striker Jeff Astle died in 2002 from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease also found in American footballers, boxers and rugby players.","Uruguay star collided with Raheem Sterling in 61st minute .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Usain Bolt has set his sights on winning Commonwealth Games gold at Hampden- after joking that his only complaint about Glasgow 2014 is that the Scots keep trying to get him drunk! The Jamaican superstar came under fire this week after he was quoted in a national newspaper saying the Games were ‘a bit s***’ and that the London Olympics in 2012 ‘were better’. However, after anchoring his country’s 4x100m team to first place in their heat last night amid raucous backing from the Hampden crowd, the 27-year-old global megastar went on a major charm offensive. I can hear you, Glasgow: Usain Bolt got a great reception at Hampden Park despite bad press this week . Appreciated: Bolt was the star turn at Hampden and he thanked the crowd for his reception . Describing Glasgow and its athletics crowds as ‘brilliant’, Bolt insisted he wouldn’t be leaving Scotland without the Commonwealth Games gold medal he needs to complete his collection. And, asked what he had made of Scottish culture so far, he insisted with a grin that locals had been constantly trying to ply him with alcohol. ‘For me, it’s different,’ he said. ‘Most people – even the caretakers – have been trying to give me beer or wine. But it’s been fun and I’ve had some good laughs. ‘It’s been wonderful here. It felt like I was competing at the London Olympics all over again. I really appreciated it. I love competing in front of a crowd like that – for me it’s just brilliant. Loving life in Glasgow: The Olympic champion gets a feel for the Hampden Park track on Friday night . Friday night lights: Bolt eased through the Hampden heats and will now see what Saturday brings . ‘I always go to every country I visit with an open mind and to see what they represent and what they are all about. I go to enjoy it and to see the country. I came to Scotland with an open mind and it’s been fun. The people have been wonderful to me. It’s been just great. ‘But I need a gold. That’s very important for me.’ Bolt admitted Glasgow’s weather has been colder than he would have preferred. But he insisted that he never once considered pulling out of the Commonwealth Games in the wake of this week’s controversy. Instead, he sought to put further distance between himself and the reported comments that caused such a stir ahead of his keenly-awaited appearance at the national stadium last night. ‘No, I never thought of leaving because it was a lie,’ said Bolt. ‘And I was never worried (about a bad reception from the Hampden crowd). I know my true people would know I would never say anything like that. All alone out in front: Bolt saw off a late surge from Nigeria's Mark Jelks to claim top spot in the heat . ‘She (the journalist) asked me how I was and I said I hadn’t done very much, that I had just been in my room. She asked if it had been fun and I said: “I guess, but I haven’t really been out.” ‘But she interpreted that as me saying it was ‘a bit s***’ or whatever. ‘I can’t believe she actually said that. First of all I would never use that word if I was going to say that. The people here have been so good to me so I would never say something like that. ‘It was rough because everyone wanted to say something to me but I did not want to say anything because last time I had a simple conversation it turned out worse for me. I decided I would wait till I had a chance to speak. 'Now listen carefully...': Bolt gives an interview to BBC Sport after finishing the job for Jamaica in the heats . ‘But it’s been great here, everything has been good so far. It’s just the weather, it’s really cold. ‘For me I love competing in team events as well as individual events and I’m just happy to be a part of this team and to be part of these Commonwealth Games. It’s great to be part of a team, feel the vibe, enjoy and have a laugh and be as one representing your country. ‘I’m very happy for my team-mates.

Manchester City’s new £6million goalkeeper Willy Caballero has warned Joe Hart that he has not joined the Premier League champions just to sit on the bench. Caballero, 32, accepts that he will start the season as No 2 to the England international after agreeing to move from Malaga and play for his old boss Manuel Pellegrini. But it is understood that Pellegrini wants Caballero to fight Hart for a first-team place and the Argentine is up for the challenge. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool v Manchester City highlights . Fresh start: Caballero joined City from Spanish side Malaga in a £6m deal earlier this summer . Doing their bit: Caballero and several of his City team-mates visited The Bronx community event in New York . ‘I’ve come to play,’ said Caballero, who started City’s first two pre-season tour games in Hart’s absence. ‘I know the situation because Joe is a fantastic goalkeeper but I will fight to play. ‘The decision will be down to the coach, the boss. I have trained well in the last three or four weeks and I need more time with my teammates, but I will be ready for the beginning of the season. ‘Goalkeepers are a different type of player and I believe in myself. City are a big club and it’s a big opportunity. I want to try in every way I can to play.’ Although Hart is set to be offered a new contract, Pellegrini wants Caballero to provide more competition than Costel Pantilimon who had to be satisfied with playing in the domestic cups apart from a seven-game run in the Premier League when Hart was axed at the end of last year. Safe hands: Caballero is expected to provide a sterner challenge to Joe Hart than Costel Pantilimon did . Speaking during a visit to a local youth training camp in the shadow of Yankee Stadium where City face Liverpool in the early hours of Thursday morning, Caballero added: ‘I don’t know if I will play in the cup or other tournaments, I only know that he wanted me. ‘I came here for the best opportunity for my career, for my life and for my family. It’s fantastic for me.’ Caballero has become the fifth Argentine on City’s books, joining Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and his former Malaga teammate Martin Demichelis – who have yet to join up with the City squad after appearing in the World Cup final – as well as other new signing Bruno Zuculini. Incumbent: Hart regained his starting place last term after an early-season loss of form . VIDEO Liverpool v Manchester City highlights . Earlier in his career he found himself stuck behind first-choice Roberto Abbondanzieri at Boca Juniors for three years and left Argentina to pursue first-team football in Spain, first with Elche and then Malaga where he helped Pellegrini’s side reach the Champions League quarter-finals last year. He also set a new club record in 2011 by not conceding a goal for 480 minutes. ‘I’m used to this, I’ve done it before,’ said Caballero, who won the title at Boca and the FIFA Under 20 World Cup with Argentina in 2001. ‘When I was younger I was in the same situation with the No.1 goalkeeper at Boca Juniors. He was in the best time of his career and it was very difficult for me to challenge him. The solution then was for me was to leave and go and play in Spain. ‘The other Argentine players arrive in five days’ time and I’m looking forward to seeing them. I know Martin Demichelis very well, and I’m looking forward to working with Pablo Zabaleta and Sergio Aguero.’ In good company: Cabellero is one of five Argentinians now at the Etihad Stadium . Caballero admits that the opportunity to team up with Pellegrini again was a major factor in his decision to leave Spain and move to the Premier League. ‘Manuel was a very important figure in me coming to Manchester City. Knowing him from before and having played for him was crucial. He’s the same. It’ the same pre-season, the same work, and he treats people exactly the same. ‘English football is very different from Spain but it’s the same for the strikers and defenders as well. I know the coach, I know the way to work and in the next four weeks I will get used to it.’","Willy Caballero signed for Man City in £6m deal earlier this summer .

"By . Mike Dawes . Jamaican sprint superstar Usain Bolt tweeted to deny calling the Commonwealth Games 'a bit s***' on Wednesday morning. Bolt was reported in The Times to have made the remark outside the athletes' village on Tuesday, also replying 'not really' when asked if he was having fun in Glasgow. But the six-time Olympic champion responded on his Twitter feed by saying: 'I'm waking up to this nonsense..journalist please don't create lies to make headlines.'

Back in Jamaica it's not like this. I need to get me some clothes. It's freezing.' Bolt's manager Ricky Simms told BBC Sport the remarks attributed to the athlete were 'utter rubbish'. Simms added: 'The atmosphere in and around the stadiums has been absolutely fantastic and I have absolutely no idea where these quotes have come from.' In response, The Times said: 'We stand by this story 100 per cent. We have utter confidence in this story.' Bolt arrived in Glasgow last Saturday morning and, at a press conference in the main press centre, confirmed he would be running the 4 x 100 metres relay heats on Friday as well as in the sprint relay final on Saturday, the final day of athletics competition. The 27-year-old confirmed he would be staying in the athletes' village but added that he would be spending most of his time in his room. Asked on Saturday what he expected from Glasgow, he said: 'A lot of rain maybe, seeing a lot of kilts around the place. I didn't come here with expectations, I'm just coming out and trying to see the country. I guess they will try to show me their culture. 'I always stay in the athletes' village, it's always fun to be among the athletes, it makes you relax more. 'I try not to walk around the village too much because I tend to take a lot of pictures.

"By . Beth Gibbons . Lots of us think we’re doing well if we make time to exfoliate our faces. Now hair experts want us to start scrubbing our scalps, too. A number of big brands have added exfoliating shampoos and scalp masks to their ranges, while several top treatment centres offer scalp ‘facials’. But what do they actually do? Scrubbing up well: Scalp exfoliators clear away troublesome dandruff and take years off your locks . ‘The scalp is much like the skin, but with more oil glands and hair follicles,’ says trichologist Philip Kingsley. ‘This means that sebum and dead skin cells can build up, causing oiliness and flaking, particularly if you’re prone to dermatitis or psoriasis.’ But scalp exfoliators won’t just clear away troublesome dandruff — they could take years off your locks, too. ‘A build-up of sebum and dead skin cells blocks the pores, and leads to increased shedding,’ says Kingsley. ‘In fact, this is one of the key reasons hair thins as we age. Cell turnover slows with age so dead cells need help to be scrubbed away. Exfoliating the scalp once a week will clear away this build-up.’ It also means your usual products will be more effective, as they’ll be better able to penetrate the follicles. Just don’t over do it. ‘If you’ve got a sensitive scalp it’s best to avoid coarse exfoliants, which can be abrasive and irritate the skin,’ says Kingsley. ‘Look for products that contain salicylic acid or fruit enzymes, as these gently soften dead skin so it can be rinsed rather than scrubbed away.’ As someone with a dry, flaky but super-sensitive scalp, I’m a little apprehensive about putting any of these products near my hair, but the promise of glossy, younger-looking locks is enough to make me reconsider. So, which are worth trying? Aveda Invati Exfoliating Shampoo, £20 for 200ml, lookfantastic.com . INGREDIENTS: Salicylic acid is said to reduce the build-up of dead cells, and turmeric and ginseng are there to speed up cell turnover. This botanical shampoo promises stronger, thicker-looking hair. HOW TO USE IT: Like a normal shampoo, and then condition and style as usual. VERDICT: The shampoo is an unappealing brown colour and smells slightly medicated. It didn’t create much foam, even from a good palm-sized amount. My scalp was wonderfully clean, although my hair, which is curly, felt a little too dry for my liking. Still, there was no flakiness. A qualified success. SCORE: 7/10 . Alterna Caviar Exfoliating Scalp Facial, £32 for 85ml, amazon.co.uk . INGREDIENTS: Contains a concentrated dose of active fruit enzymes to break down cells, and exfoliating micro-beads for the scrub. It also contains caviar extract, which is said to be nourishing. HOW TO USE IT: Once a week, apply it before your shampoo, then condition and style  as normal. VERDICT: The granular gel is a cinch to apply thanks to the bristle head of the brush applicator, which gives a heavenly head massage. And best of all, my locks didn’t feel at all dry afterwards. A clear scalp — and, for me, a clear winner. Not even a tiny bit of flakiness. SCORE: 10/10 . Philip Kingsley Exfoliating Scalp Mask, £6 for 20ml, johnlewis.com . INGREDIENTS: Containing salicylic and moisturising plant oils to moisturise, this gentle mask is designed to also soothe the scalp. HOW TO USE IT: Once a week before shampooing. Condition as normal. VERDICT: Completely smooth and odourless, it doesn’t feel as abrasive as other products containing salicylic acid. The instructions recommend conditioning your hair at the same time, so I apply the exfoliator to my roots and my favourite hair mask through the ends and sit it out for  20 minutes. Afterwards, my scalp feels like it can breathe in the same way that your face glows  after exfoliation. My hair seems lighter somehow. There is no trace of my usual flakiness and my scalp is completely itch-free. SCORE: 8/10 . Ouidad Mediterranean Bay Leaf Exfoliating Hair And Scalp Treatment, £28.25 for 178ml, beautybay.co.uk . INGREDIENTS: The cream is infused with natural fruit enzymes to soften skin cells, as well as a gentle bamboo scrub. HOW TO USE IT: The directions advise massaging into the scalp, two to three times a week, but it did leave my hair a bit dry, so I would advise using an extra dollop of conditioner afterwards. VERDICT: The Ouidad range is designed especially for wavy, curly hair. The herbal-scented lotion was grainy but not quite as gritty as the others, so didn’t feel quite as exfoliating, although I enjoyed the three-minute massage. My scalp was thoroughly cleansed, but my hair felt a little dry. SCORE: 6.5/10 . Kiehls Deep Micro-Exfoliating Scalp Treatment, £20 for 100ml, kiehls.co.uk . INGREDIENTS: Contains finely-ground apricot seed and argan shell for the scrub, and menthol to increase blood flow to the scalp. HOW TO USE IT: Apply once a week after shampooing. VERDICT: I loved the scrubbing sensation, not to mention the cooling zing of mint. My scalp was left with a lovely tingling feeling afterwards and it didn’t dry my hair out either. This seemed to soothe rather than irritate my sensitive scalp, earning it a place in my bathroom cabinet. SCORE: 9/10 .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A British flower containing a lethal poison which can lead to serious illness or even death has been found near to a National Trust lighthouse - despite once being extinct. Dougie Holden, assistant ranger at the lighthouse, found the lone corn-cockle flower in the grounds of Souter Lighthouse in Whitburn, Sunderland. But the Royal Horticultural Society has now warned curious members of the public to neither pick up nor touch the 'very rare' flower, due to the noxious poison and toxins that it contains. Scroll down for video . National Trust assistant ranger Dougie Holden found a lone corn-cockle flower - real name agrostemma githago - in the grounds of Souter Lighthouse in Whitburn, Sunderland. The flower was once believed to be extinct due to modern farming methods . Experts say every part of the plant is filled with glycoside githagin and agrostemnic acid that could lead to severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, weakness, slow breathing and, in extreme cases, even death. The sighting comes after the flower, which goes by the real name agrostemma githago, was thought to have disappeared from the UK due to modern farming methods. Mr Holden said: 'It is highly toxic and shouldn’t be touched. I have never seen one before. I am delighted. 'If it disperses, we might get a small population of them which would be great. It will be interesting to see if we get more growing in the future.' Guy Barter, chief advisor at the Royal Horticultural Society, said the plant is barely seen in the UK and is very dangerous. He said: 'This is indeed a very rare flower and was once extinct in Britain. The seed may have found its way into a wildflower mix and blown from a garden but they do lay dormant for years. Experts say every part of the plant is filled with a poison that can lead to serious illness and, in extreme cases, death . 'It‘s more likely the soil has been disturbed and the flower popped up. 'They are poisonous and harmful - but as long as you wash your hands thoroughly you should be okay. But I certainly wouldn’t recommend eating one.' The corn-cockle, a pink or purple flower, originates from other parts of Europe and is believed to have been brought into England by Iron Age farmers. At one time, most fields would have been filled with the poisonous flower, but modern agricultural methods and weed-killers all-but wiped it out. It was also a very common weed in the 19th century. The plant was used for generations in folk medicine and even receives a mention in Shakespeare’s Coriolanus. It can grow up to three feet tall and is covered with fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation if touched. Its poison was discovered centuries ago, when doctors thought it could have medicinal properties. They used it to experiment on patients and animals. In the summer, the plant produces pink or purple flowers with black lines on the petals. They can grow in various places such as fields, roadsides, railway lines and wasteland.","Dougie Holden found plant at Souter Lighthouse in Whitburn, Sunderland .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Most in-demand celebrity attributes can either be yours forever; a nose job, for example, or very temporarily; the smoky eye look, say. The former is a drastic gamble, and the latter is a cheap thrill. So when Femail noticed the rising trend for eyebrow tattoos that eventually fade - a process which involves filling in your brows with micro-fine 'hairs' that are inked onto the skin - we jumped at the chance to try it. Lasting for between 14 months and two years, and costing in the region of $700-$1,000; semi-permanent eyebrow tattoos promise to bestow you with  Cara Delevingne worthy power-brows for a good while, but not forever. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Before I had my eyebrows tattooed, they were fairly sparse . in places (left), but my hour-long session with a scalpel certainly . fixed that (right) pictured a few days after the procedure . Before: Thanks to an overzealous attack with the tweazers when I was a teen, parts of my brows never fully grew back, leaving me with slightly patchy areas (pictured) After: This was taken directly after the procedure, when the dye was still heavy and before my brows had settled down into a more natural state . My natural brows have always provided me with somewhat of a conundrum. When I was younger, they were so bushy that I once let a friend - with particularity strong feelings against their bushiness - go absolutely mad on them with tweezers. They never fully grew back. I was left with brows that are bold in some places, and randomly sparse in others. So, like many women, I've taken to filling in the odd gaps - crudely and unevenly I might add - with my Anastasia brow pencil. Eager to try out this much-hyped, longer-lasting solution, I enlisted the services of Browhaus; a New York salon which has seen a sharp increase in demand for their $925 'Brow Resurrection' service, among models and mortals alike. Browhaus has perfected what they describe as 'an advanced brow embroidery technique' which involves tattooing onto the skin with exceptionally detailed and natural strokes. Gearing up: To lessen the pain - but not entirely diminish it as I would later discover - I had numbing cream applied to my brows prior to the treatment, held in place for 15 minutes using Saran wrap (pictured) Tools of the trade: The assortment of dyes and the dreaded scalpel instrument (left) and me doing my best impression of someone who is not freaking out, as the sharp blade is dragged across my brows (right) Entering with more than a little trepidation - a semi-permanent tattoo is still an un-hidable addition to your face, let's not forget - I was first treated to a consultation with the salon's senior brow specialist, Michelle. After discussing my options, I opted to go for the natural look, and Michelle carefully worked on my patchy brows with a dark pencil to get the shape right; essentially lengthening them and filling in the gaps, so as to more closely resemble their shape before the tweezers-attack incident. After plucking away a few stray hairs, and then letting a numbing gel sit on my brows for 15 minutes, it was time to get started. Stretched out under a stark lamp on what closely resembled a dentist's chair, panic set in when Michelle calmly lifted a glinting, scalpel-like instrument from the tray to my left. Inking away: The process takes about an hour and a half from start to finish, and the experience feels not unlike going to the dentist . My initial reaction: Upon first inspection, I was pretty traumatized by my new brows, which I worried were far too dark and blockish, more Bert from Seseme Street than Cara Delevingne . Success: A week on from my treatment (pictured), and my brows have settled into normality. Gone are the sparse patches, and I'm really pleased with how natural the results are . I was told this wouldn't hurt much, but unsurprisingly, as she took the blade to my brows and started intricately scratching away at my skin, it became less and less comfortable - despite the numbing cream. Michelle carefully etched the brown ink back and forth across my brow-line with what I hoped were realistic strokes for about half an hour; pausing periodically to check the symmetry and admire her work. Once she was done, I crossed my fingers and braved the handheld mirror. My knee-jerk response: Heaven help me, I look like Bert from Seseme Street. 'Michelle carefully etched the brown ink . back and forth across my brow-line with what I hoped were realistic . strokes' In my typically over-polite fashion, I thanked Michelle profusely and left like a deer in the headlights, scattering back to the office with my very dark, very bold power-brows in tow. 'They are definitely not too dark, I would tell you if they were,' my editor assured me, in her equally over-polite manner. I could tell she was fibbing. One week, and several showers later, however, I'm pleased to report a total turn around. The color has faded and they look much less aggressive. Queen of the brows: Cara Delevingne (pictured) exploded onto the scene in 2011, rising fast to supermodel stardom and sporting bold eyebrows which have since amassed a cult following . Hot on her heels: British model Suki Waterhouse's dark brows stand out against her blonde hair (left) while Camilla Belle (center) and Lily Collins (right) have strong brows that closer match their hair color . The brow brigade: Kim Kardashian (left) is blessed with chunky eyebrows, as is Megan Fox (center) and Brooke Shields was the star to bring bushy brows into style for her generation in the 80s . Browhaus tell me the intensity will continue to fade as they heal, for about six to 10 days, and my editor concedes that the color is perfect, honestly this time. 'For just shy of $1,000 and a manageable . level of pain, I am proud to be . sporting strong, natural-looking brows' For just shy of $1,000, a manageable level of pain, and only a short-lived period of panic, I am proud to be sporting strong, natural-looking brows which I don't have to draw on every morning. Although I regret to report that I still look nothing like Miss Delevingne, I'm a total convert to the movement of the semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo.","The Brow Resurrection process costs $920, and lasts for between 14 months and two years .

"By . Sophie Borland . Moving hospital beds further apart and having fewer patients on wards will prevent the spread of a new breed of superbugs, say experts. There should also be large windows for better air circulation as part of a ‘Victorian-style makeover’ to help cut the risk of infection. Scientists said such measures would buy medics crucial time as they attempt to develop new cures for antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Hospital beds should be moved further apart to help stop infection in hospitals, say experts (file picture) Last month the World Health Organisation warned that the threat was so high patients may soon die from scratches or grazes that become infected. Professor Kevin Kerr, from Hull York Medical School, told the Royal Society: 'We are talking about returning hospital wards to the type we had 100 years ago. ‘In the near future it is possible that a scratch from a rose thorn could become septic. ‘Without effective antibiotics, septicaemia could easily set in and result in death.’ Addressing a meeting of the Royal Society in London last week, which was attended by Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, he added: ‘It is a terrible prospect, but a very real one. Scientists said such measures would buy medics crucial time as they attempt to develop new cures for antibiotic-resistant superbugs (file picture) ‘We are facing a return to the state of affairs that existed before antibiotics were discovered.’ The problem has been caused by the widespread use of antibiotics by doctors – and farmers on livestock -  which has led to bacteria evolving so they are immune. At the same time, drug companies have . developed fewer, new antiobiotics as they are not as profitable as more . expensive treatments for diabetes and high blood pressure, for example. Professor Mark Kerr, from Kingston University, London, called on hospitals to employ ‘old school’ measures, adding: ‘We need to hold back the spread of resistant bacteria while finding ways to persuade pharmaceuticals to improve their output of new generations of antibiotics.’ Although rates of MRSA and C.difficile in hospitals are at record lows, scientists are deeply concerned about a new breed of antibiotic-resistant superbugs that includes strains of E. Coli. Last month Dr Keiji Fekuda, assistant director for health security at the World Health Organisation said: ‘The world is headed for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill. ‘We should anticipate to see many more deaths.’ ‘We are going to see people who have untreatable infections, we cant do anything about them. Or there will be people who will be treatable but it will take much longer to treat them.’","Experts say the steps will prevent the spread of a new breed of superbugs .

"By . Steve Robson . It was built with huge cannons to repel the French Navy - but now the 134-year-old Spitbank Fort is a little more welcoming. The historic sea fort has undergone a £3million pound radical conversion to turn it into the ultimate B&B for people seeking isolation. Standing a mile out to sea, guests have to arrive at the £350-a-night hotel via taxi boat. Scroll down for video . Secluded: Spitbank Fort sits a mile out to sea from Portsmouth Harbour where it was built to defend Britain against French invasion in 1878 . Transformation: At one time up to 150 soldiers would sleep in hammocks beneath the fort - now up to 18 guests can stay in the luxury hotel . At one time up to 150 soldiers would sleep below in hammocks - now the fort has room for 18 guests who can enjoy a terrace hot tub, the Crow’s Nest bar and a rooftop fire pit. Groups can hire the fort exclusively for £5,000 which includes lunch upon arrival, champagne reception, a three-course dinner and breakfast the following morning. The venue - which was recently visited by the cast and crew of the James Bond film Skyfall - can also host 60 guests for functions such as weddings and birthday parties. Built in 1878, Spitbank Fort was later blitzed by the Nazis during World War Two before being decommissioned by the Ministry of Defence in 1982. After a massive restoration project, many of the fort’s original features have been kept intact, with the gun ports transformed into bedroom windows offering sea views and gunpowder rooms enlisted as cosy snugs. Getaway: The historic fort couldn't be more secluded standing one mile out to sea . Unique: The sea fort hotel offers an unusually secluded getaway experience . Colourful history: Spitbank Fort has previously been a nightclub and hosted TV shows . The 15 feet granite walls of the fort mean guests are well protected from the roughest of weather. There are also plans to transform neighbouring forts into a spa retreat and a naval history museum in the near future. Makeover: The former sea fort which had anti-aircraft guns now features a sun deck where visitors can watch boats passing in and out of Portsmouth Harbour . Unique: The luxury hotel has unique a Crow's Nest bar, hot tub, sun deck, gaming table, restaurant and even a firepit .

'We’ve been open for five months now and we’ve had an amazing response. It’s obviously been popular with men and we have had a few birthday celebrations here for 40th’s, 50th’s and 60th’s.' 'It is normally the wives who book it up as a treat for their husbands but they end up enjoying it here just as much as the men. 'The . hot tub on the roof terrace and crow’s nest bar have gone down very . well and I think our guests see it as a really fun venue. 'Even though we are only a mile away from land people feel like they are going on a long journey when they come here. 'We have four weddings booked for next year so far and expect to get a lot more interest for that.' The hotel provides boat transfers from nearby Portsmouth and Gosport in Hampshire. Renovators Clarenco worked alongside English Heritage to ensure many of the original features of the fort, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, were preserved. It used to have room for 150 soldiers, who slept in hammocks, but now guests can relax in the lap of luxury in nine spacious bedrooms. During the Second World War the fort was decimated by Nazi bombs before it wasrevamped and turned into a night club in the 1990s. Rooms in the basement contain artefacts from the island’s past with guests ableto view the giant bellows used to heat up the forge and a large muzzle cleaner. Outside guests can take in the sea air and fish for mackerel, sea bass and pollock which swim in the waters surrounding the fort. VIDEO: The ultimate Christmas hideaway?

"By . Lizzie Parry . A dissolvable tampon could soon offer women faster protection against HIV, scientists say. Those deemed to be at high risk of contracting HIV in the U.S. are currently prescribed daily drugs, taken orally, to protect against the virus. But a range of new topical protection methods, including gels and films which can be inserted into the vagina before sex, are currently in development. A team of researchers at the University of Washington noted the new products were not performing well in clinical trials because they are difficult to use. Scientists at the University of Washington have created a dissolvable drug, which could be spun and inserted into the vagina using an applicator, in a similar way to a tampon. They say the new discovery could help protect women from HIV faster . And so they have created dissolving fibres, which could be spun and inserted into an applicator, similar to those used to insert tampons. Bio-engineers believe the tampon could deliver a topical drug, known to protect women from contracting the virus, faster. Their method spins the drug into silk-like fibres, which quickly dissolve when they come into contact with moisture. It means higher doses of the drug could be administered than is possible when using gels or creams. Lead study author Cameron Ball, said: 'This could offer women a potentially more effective, discreet way to protect themselves from HIV infection by inserting the drug-loaded materials into the vagina before sex.' The findings build on previous research by the team, which found electrically spun cloth could be dissolved to release drugs. The latest study shows the fibre materials can hold 10 times the concentration of medicine as anti-HIV gels currently in development. Oral pills are available in the U.S. for people who are considered at risk for HIV infection. Meanwhile a host of topical medications in the form of gels and films are starting to be developed. They are placed inside the vagina before sexual intercourse, allowing the drug to dissolve and diffuse into the surrounding issue. The tampons are placed inside the vagina before sexual intercourse, allowing the drug to dissolve and diffuse into the surrounding issue . People deemed at risk of contracting HIV, seen under the micropscope, are currently given daily drugs, in oral form, in the U.S. Called microbicides, the drugs must be given as a large dose to be effective minutes before sex. But to date the topical drugs have not performed well in clinical trials, partly because they were not easy to use. Drugs in film form take at least 15 minutes to fully dissolve in the body, while the volume of gels must be large enough to deliver a full dose but small enough to prevent leaking. 'The effectiveness of an anti-HIV topical drug depends partially on high-enough dosages and quick release,' Ball said. 'We have achieved higher drug loading in our material such that you wouldn’t need to insert a large amount of these fibres to deliver enough of the drug to be helpful.' The research team says the soft, dissolving fibres could be rolled into a cardboard tampon applicator for insertion or built into the shape of a vaginal ring, similar to those used for contraception. The material can accommodate different anti-HIV drugs and the team is testing several others for effectiveness. Assistant professor Kim Woodrow, who led the research, said: 'We think the fibre platform technology has the capability of being developed into multifunctional medical fabrics that address simultaneously challenges related to biological efficacy and user preferences.'","Scientists at the University of Washington have created dissolvable silk fibres which could be spun and inserted using an applicator .

"By . Associated Press . Alarmed by booming sales of highly potent edible marijuana products, Colorado regulators have drafted an emergency rule making it easier for new users to tell how much pot they're eating. The result? Weaker pot brownies and cookies on store shelves, and new packaging requirements. Draft emergency rules require Colorado's makers of edible pot to physically de-mark their products so that consumers can 'intuitively determine' how much constitutes a dose of marijuana's intoxicating ingredient, THC. Scroll down for video . Pot edibles: Chef Alex Tretter carries a tray of cannabis-infused peanut butter and jelly cups at Sweet Grass Kitchen, a well-established Denver-based gourmet marijuana edibles bakery which sells its confections to retail outlets throughout the state . Colorado's rules already require edible pot to be sold in 'servings' of 10 milligrams of THC. But many consumers have complained they can't tell what a serving is and eat too much of a heavily-dosed product, leading to many reports of unpleasant experiences, including nausea and feelings of paralysis. Those stronger-dosed edibles are holdovers from the medical pot marketplace, where sellers say consumers who have built up strong tolerances won't buy anything that has a dosage less than 100 milligrams of THC. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote in June of going into a 'hallucinatory state after eating too much pot candy in Colorado . New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote in June of going into a 'hallucinatory state' after visiting Colorado and eating too much pot candy. And an edible pot cookie has been blamed for the death earlier this year of a college student who ate more than six times the suggested dose and then fell to his death from a hotel balcony. A spokeswoman for the Colorado agency that prepared the rules couldn't comment on them because they have not been made public. But Natriece Bryant of the state Department of Revenue confirmed that the rules take effect in November if approved by the governor, as expected. The final rule could differ from the draft obtained by AP on Thursday. Marijuana industry advocates who helped draft the rules said they'll help consumers. 'The problem of people overdoing it with edibles, accidentally, is going to be very much taken care of with these new rules,' said Mike Elliott of the Marijuana Industry Group, which represents several large Denver dispensaries. The draft rules also set new packaging requirements for products that can't easily be divided or perforated - such as liquids or granolas. Gone is the requirement that pot-infused juices and sodas come in opaque packaging. Instead, the liquids would have to be sold in transparent bottles surrounded by opaque packaging. The bottles would need to allow consumers to tell how much they've drunk, so they could look like cough-syrup bottles, with dividing lines on the side. Solids that can't be easily de-marked, such as granola, could not exceed 10 mg of active THC per package. So instead of a big bag, they'd have to be divided into single-serve packages. A pot-infused cookie maker who has seen the emergency rules said they'll lead to milder products on shelves. Mountain High Suckers: These drug-infused candies are sold at Botana Care marijuana store in Northglenn, Colorado . Julie Berliner of SweetGrass Kitchens said she's planning to stop making cookies stronger than 10 mg of THC per piece, at least for the recreational market. 'That's the way the industry will be going, where each piece is 10 (mg of THC) and not something you'll have to measure yourself,' she said. The Department of Revenue starts work on Friday on a bigger proposal - requiring edible pot products to be colored or stamped to indicate they contain pot. Lawmakers have expressed alarm that marijuana treats look just like their straight-laced counterparts when out of the package. But it's not clear how to give edible pot products a distinct appearance  while still looking like something people would eat.

Today we are offering a fantastic prize of a flight in this historic aircraft, along with an overnight stay to help you prepare for it. See the panel below for details and how to enter. Before Vera, whose last visit to Britain was in 1959, left her base at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario, I was offered the chance to take a 30-minute test flight with her crew. War hero: The Lancaster is named after Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski, who was awarded a posthumous VC . The sound hits you first: the distinctive, deep-throated growl of its four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. At a length of just over 69ft and with a wingspan of 102ft, the bomber dwarfed me as I stood next to her, but inside, it’s surprising how tight the space actually is – about 6ft feet across and 5ft high. As I stand in the cockpit at 2,500ft, it’s  impossible not to be moved by my surroundings, nor to marvel at the bravery of the men who crewed this magnificent aircraft during the war. The Lancaster was built in Toronto in 1945 and served as a search and rescue aircraft. It is dedicated to the memory of Royal Canadian Air Force Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski, and is known as the Mynarski Memorial Lancaster. It is painted in the colours of his wartime Lancaster KB726 VR-A, which flew in raids with 419 (Moose) Squadron. Mynarski was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross after his aircraft was shot down over France in 1944. As the blazing aircraft plummeted, he attempted to free the trapped tail gunner. Mynarski survived the crash but later died from severe burns. Miraculously,  the gunner lived to tell his story. Vera’s journey will take four days, involving stops in Newfoundland and  Iceland before arriving at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire on Friday. In service: The smiling crew of an RAF Lancaster return to base in 1943 (file photo) Here's your chance to win a  once-in-a-lifetime flight in the remarkable Canadian Lancaster. One lucky reader will win an unforgettable 30- to 40-minute flight aboard this wartime aircraft – as well as an overnight stay for two. Our winner will take to the skies from Durham Tees Valley Airport on Thursday, August 28, after spending the night at The Judge’s Lodging hotel – a Grade I listed Georgian townhouse in historic York. Dream trip: Matthew Munson paid £43,000 to fly in the Lancaster - you can do it for free . Durham Tees Valley is a fitting start and end point for the flight:  it was once Middleton St George RAF base, the northernmost bomber station during the war. The Mail on Sunday has teamed up with Thwaites, brewer of Lancaster Bomber ale – sponsor of the Lancaster’s landmark tour around Britain – to offer this fantastic prize. You can buy Lancaster Bomber ale, twice voted Best English Bitter, in stores, including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Waitrose, Booths and Ocado.

"By . Lucy Crossley . With space at a premium and skyrocketing rents, one family have found an unusual solution to the housing shortage in one of China's largest cities - by setting up home in a converted male toilet. When Zeng Lingjun moved to Shenyang to find work, the enterprising 33-year-old decided that instead of his house-hunting mission becoming a busted flush, he would rent out the unused hotel bathroom. Shoe repairer Mr Zeng moved into the 20 square metre male toilet in 2006 and when he married wife Wang Zhixia in 2010 she joined him, with their baby son Devi born a year later. Round the U-bend: Zeng Lingjun, his wife Wang Zhixia and their baby Devi have set up home in a converted men's toilet . Enterprising: Mr Zeng created a bed by placing wooden planks on top of one toilet and has transformed two unused stalls into wardrobes . Despite his family's unusual living arrangements, Mr Zeng decribes his home  - still fitted with urinals - as 'small but complete', and says they are used to the lingering odour. And he is so content with his lot that he even called his baby 'Devi' which means satisfying one's desire. Originally from a poor family living in the village of Fumin in Jilin Province, Mr Zeng won a place at the Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology in 1999. However, he was unable to attend the university as he did not have the money to pay his tuition fees so instead moved to Shenyang, in Liaoning province, to make money, with just 50 yuan, worth around £5.25, in his pocket. After moving into the toilet Mr Zeng quickly set about making alterations, placing planks over one toilet to make a bed - which faces a small television set up on a table nestled between two urinals. Two other stalls were converted into wardrobes. Homemaker: Wife Wang Zhixia cooks outside the entrance to the family home. She said the living arrangement was not 'convenient for cooking', but that she is used to it . Upbeat: Mr Zeng decribes his home - still fitted with urinals - as 'small but complete', and called his baby 'Devi', which means satisfying one's desire . On the opposite wall he has put up a red paper cut-out of the Chinese character ""xi"", or happiness -- a Chinese tradition to court good luck. 'I am satisfied with what I have now, said Mr Zeng told news website Englishnews.cn. 'Life actually is better here than where I used to rough it out.' Outside the 'bedroom', in what used to be a washbasin, is their . kitchen and Mr Zeng's workshop. Hard working: Mr Zeng set up his workshop for his cobbling business inside his toilet home . 'It's not convenient for cooking, but I'm . used to it,' former cleaner Ms Wang told China Daily.com. Mr Zeng pays out around 8,000 yuan a year, roughly £830, to rent the toilet from the hotel, and was given a space in front of the building for free where he polishes shoes for 10 yuan a pair. He takes home 2,000 yuan a month from his job as a shoeshine, cobbler and locksmith, which is nearly double the minimum wage set by the government of Shenyang. Despite his enthusiasm, Mr Zeng admits his home is not the most comfortable and says he has to flush the toilet regularly to wash away any odours that come down the pipes from the in-use lavatory block on the floor above his home. Long-term exposure to the humid atmosphere has left his child, now aged three, with eczema. When . he married his wife in 2010 he could not scrape together . enough money for a real honeymoon, but as he was determined to give his . wife a taste of luxury he took out 500 yuan from his savings and rented . a . 900-square-feet apartment in a high-end neighborhood. They lived there . for six days before they came back to start their new life together in the toilet. Although . he would like to find a better paying job and move his family into a . more conventional home he still has to send money to his aging parents, . and soon must find enough cash to send Devi to school. China's 240 million rural migrant workers in cities and factory towns form a vital cog in China's booming economy. However, many of them live in undesirable conditions, with limited access to health care and education. Mr . Zeng has applied for low-rent housing in Shenyang, but because his . registered residence status is still in his home province of . Heilongjiang, it is difficult for him to get his application approved. However, he is determined to remain positive. 'Take it easy. We are still young. Life will be better as long as we work hard', he said. Wedded bliss: Ms Wang shows her son the couple's wedding photograph. Mr Zeng could not scrape together enough money for a real honeymoon, but took out 500 yuan from his savings and rented a 900-square-feet apartment in a high-end neighborhood .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Britain's first ever left-hand driving school has been declared a sell-out success. The one-off course, designed to give Britons the confidence to get behind the wheel on holiday, launches today, with further classes planned if demand continues. The new school, which opens in London, can't come soon enough, with more than a quarter of Britons saying they are afraid of driving on the right hand side of the road. It's a sign: A third of Britons say they don't research the rules of the road before travelling . A poll conducted by Skyscanner, which set up the school, also found that 36 per cent of drivers don't even bother to research overseas driving laws before embarking on their journey. During the classes, drivers will learn to understand confusing overseas road signs as 16 per cent say this is one of their top fears. Drivers also get a chance to use cars with the controls on the other side as one in ten (nine per cent) admit this is their number one concern. The classes, hosted in London's Brixton, will see drivers learning to take the wheel on the left side of the car to prepare them for hiring cars on holiday this summer. On track: The driving school aims to give Britons confidence to get behind the wheel on holiday . Skyscanner's Mary Porter said: 'With two-thirds of the world's countries driving on the right-hand side we want to give British holidaymakers the confidence they need to drive overseas. 'Rules and regulations vary from country to country so we've also published a guide to provide some clarity for drivers - including top tips on driving on the opposite side of the road. 'There is so much to discover off the beaten track so we hope people make the most of it without the fear of driving abroad.' 1. Repeat the phrase 'drive on the right' and remember you want to always be closest to the middle of the road. 2. On a dual carriageway or motorway remember that the 'fast' lane is the . far left lane and the 'slow' lane is the far right lane. As a beginner, . it's worth sticking to the right lane and take it slowly until you have . built up your confidence. 3. When approaching a roundabout remember that you must give way to the left and drive anti-clockwise around them. 4. It is important to remember that the most dangerous turn is now the . left-hand turn because it crosses the other lane of traffic. 5. Having a co-pilot can be a help. A backseat driver can be more of a help . than a hindrance because a reminder to stay on the correct side is . certainly welcome as is any help navigating. 6. If you're headed to . Nice this summer, remember to carry a breathalyser in the car as it's a . legal requirement for all motorists in France. 7. In some cities in . Spain, cars must be parked on different sides of the road according to . the day of the week so check before you pull up to a spot. 8. If . you're planning a holiday in Spain or the Canary Islands and you wear . glasses, the driving laws require you to carry an additional pair when . driving. 9. In most cities in Portugal and Italy cars must be parked . in the direction of traffic so if you're visiting this summer remember . to follow the locals and don't be caught out. 10. The USA is a popular country for road-trips but it's important to . remember rules vary from state to state so it's worth checking before . you arrive. One law, regardless of state, is that it is illegal to pass a . stopped school bus, whichever direction you're travelling in. A driving abroad guide has also been produced, detailing national speed limits for other countries, unusual road signs and driving laws. For instance, it informs drivers they must have their own breathalyser in France and must park their car in the direction of traffic in some Italian and Portuguese cities. The UK’s first left-hand driving school has launched after it’s revealed more than a quarter of holidaymakers are afraid to drive abroad. The course, to be held in Brixton, London, includes familiarisation with foreign road signs and roundabouts to build Brits’ confidence of taking a road trip while away. Skyscanner is teaming up with driving instructors to offer free classes to travellers looking for practice and advice before getting behind the wheel overseas. Nervous drivers: A quarter of Brits say they are not confident to get behind the wheel while on holiday . 1. Not recognising road signs2. Getting lost3. Going around roundabouts4. Trying to navigate 5. Driving on the other side of road . The move comes after research revealed 27 per cent of Brits admitted to being afraid of driving on the opposite side of the road. The survey of 1,084 adults also showed 36 per cent admit they don't research driving laws before driving abroad and 24 per cent would prefer their partners to drive.

But the stunning Dutch supermodel, 30, confesses that she suffered body insecurities and feared for her job while she was pregnant. In fact Lara says she hated pregnancy and found the changes her body went through 'quite shocking'. Scroll down for video . David Walliams and wife Lara Stone pictured out on a stroll in Saint Tropez, France, this week . She found the changes her body went through 'quite shocking', but got back into shape with a trainer . Wearing . maternity jeans at 10 weeks, she had to stop modelling quite early on. Lara feared the potential impact carrying a child would have on her body - and her career. But after a year off to look after her 14-month-old Alfred, she landed right back on her feet after as the face of L'Oréal. 'Being . pregnant affected my work quite early on - it's not like you can work . until you're eight months pregnant.

Also, I like working and I don't like sitting around at . home, so I really wanted to get back into things. It's nice once the . baby's here, but then I was like, ""I really want to do something . again."" ' She also said that she and David sometimes leave Alfred for days with their nanny, as neither of their families live nearby to help out with Alfred. 'My family doesn't live near and my husband's family lives a couple of hours away, and both of our jobs are so unpredictable,' she says. 'Sometimes there is nothing you can do and you have to leave him with the nanny for a couple of days.'

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Many popular holiday destinations are charging through the nose for car hire, found a new survey. Costs in Majorca, for example, are almost twice as high as those in Cyprus, which has the lowest charges among 16 resorts surveyed by Post Office Travel Money. Other popular spots where charges were particularly high include Faro in Portugal, Split in Croatia and Dublin. Price discrepancies: Hiring a car in Majorca costs twice as much as it does in Cyprus . The survey took into account not just the basic care hire cost, but also such expense as satnav hire, additional-driver cover and 40 litres of petrol. On this basis, one-week car hire in Larnaca in Cyprus was just £295, while in the most expensive - the Norwegian capital Oslo - it was as much as £614. Budget options: Luqa in Malta, Marmaris in Turkey and Salzburg in Austria offer cheaper car hire . Majorca was the next most pricey - at £514 - while Split was £509, Faro £503 and Dublin £482. After Larnaca, the best value destination was Luqa in Malta (£317), followed by Marmaris in Turkey (£325), Copenhagen (£335) and Salzburg in Austria (£362). Post Office Travel Money said its survey of 2,106 UK adults showed that in hiring a car, 56 per cent failed to take out excess waiver insurance that reduces the excess payable for accidents or theft to zero. Even more (76 per cent) did not take out insurance cover for tyre, undercarriage and window damage. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'These figures make it clear that it is a false economy to cut costs by sticking to the basic cost when booking car rental online. 'We advise against taking a risk that could cost hundreds of pounds if your hire car suffers damage or is stolen.'","Survey finds huge discrepancy in car hire costs around Europe .

"By . Ray Massey . Self-driving ‘robo-cars’ are to be allowed on Britain’s roads from the New Year despite fears over their safety, the Government announced yesterday. Ministers are fast-tracking the measures, which pave the way for drivers to sit back and, ultimately, concentrate on other tasks as an on-board computer assumes command of the vehicle. The cars are guided by radar, laser sensors, cameras and sat-nav. They will take to public roads in Britain for the first time from January in a series of trials lasting up to three years. Scroll down for video . Major manufacturers already developing self-driving car technology include Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Vauxhall, Volkswagen and Honda. They have been joined by internet giant Google. All models are expected to have a manual override, allowing the driver to take control if necessary. The cars can be used in regular traffic either independently or as a ‘road train’, where they work with other driverless vehicles to move through traffic as a convoy. In the UK, self-drive mode may be restricted initially to certain roads, such as motorways, or specific lanes. Business Secretary Vince Cable in a driverless car. The vehicles work by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s position on an electronic map . Significantly, much of the technology is already fitted to family cars – including self-braking, self-parking, lane recognition, cameras that can ‘read’ signs and adaptive cruise control, which adjusts speed to the traffic. The test for manufacturers is to link the technology via an on-board computer in a way that will meet safety legislation. The Government will review road laws to enable driverless cars to be street legal. Business Secretary Vince Cable announced the move after testing a vehicle at the headquarters of motor industry research organisation MIRA at Nuneaton in the West Midlands. Ministers have set aside £10million for trials in three cities. Mr Cable said the announcement would put Britain ‘at the forefront of this transformational technology and open up new opportunities for our economy and society’. Driverless cars are already in use in a number of countries, including Japan, Sweden and the US, where four states have passed laws permitting autonomous cars. But there are many hurdles to overcome before they become a regular sight on Britain’s roads. AA president Edmund King was wary over the development. ‘Cars have become more automated,’ he said. ‘However, there needs to be a big leap of faith by drivers from embracing assistance systems to accepting the fully automated car.’ In a survey by Churchill Car Insurance, 56 per cent of UK adults said they would not purchase a driverless car and a quarter believed they would not be safe. There are suggestions that Britain’s pot-holed roads are in such a state that the technology could not cope. Insurers say there are challenges over liability if a self-driving car crashes, while academics warn that their computers could be ‘hacked’ and disabled, or even used by terrorists as a weapon. Supporters say the cars will be safer than many motorists. Safety experts often joke that the most dangerous part of any car is ‘the nut behind the steering wheel’.","First trials of driverless cars on British roads will start from January 2015 .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Holidaymakers are getting used to paying for hidden extras when they fly but what about being charged for fresh air? An airport in Venezuela is doing just that in an attempt to pay for a new air conditioning unit. Simon Bolivar International Airport in the country’s capital city Caracas introduced the charge of 127 bolivars (£12) on July 1 to pay for the new system, which was installed at the airport in May. Added cost: The charge of 127 bolivars applies to all domestic and international flights . The airport claims to be the first in South America to have installed the new technology. According to a statement on the airport’s website, the new air conditioning system helps to ‘eliminate contaminants in the environment and protect health’. The charge applies to all domestic and international flights and must be paid to the airline when passengers check in. CNN.com reported that several passengers had complained on Twitter about the new charges. One user, @VeronicaTorresA, wrote: 'While the stench of the toilets asphyxiates me ... they have started to charge 127 bolivars for breathing the ozone', while another traveller complained that the temperature at the airport had shot up to 36C. Meanwhile, radio presenter Daniel Martinez asked: 'Could you explain to me the ozone thing in Maiquetia? The toilets have no water, the air-con is broken, there are stray dogs inside the airport, but there's ozone?' Charging passengers to breath fresh air is not the only controversial episode for Venezuela's aviation industry. The . International Air Transport Association has accused the country of . preventing the repatriation of $4 billion in airline ticket sales . because of currency control problems. Fresh thinking: The airport claims to be the first in South America to have installed the new technology . Just last week, Delta Air Lines reduced its service to Venezuela due to a dispute with the government over revenue trapped in the South American country. The carrier reduced its service by 85 per cent, replacing its daily roundtrip flight between Atlanta and Caracas with one roundtrip weekend flight as of August 1. American Airlines reduced it service to Venezuela by 80 per cent last week and now only flies in from Miami, while Air Canada suspended its flights to Venezuela in March. But Venezuela's cash-strapped government agreed to pay part of the $4 billion owed to foreign airlines and may soon allow them to aggressively raise airfares in an attempt to prevent more carriers from leaving the country. Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco Torres announced a deal in May that would allow six Latin American airlines, including Colombia's Avianca and AeroMexico, to repatriate revenue from local sales in 2012 and 2013.","Charge of 127 bolivars is being levied to pay for new air conditioning unit .

Anyone with a sneaking feeling that London living is not all that it's cracked up to be might want to consider a rather more spacious alternative to living in a cramped city centre apartment. Isola di Mal Ventre is one of the few remaining private islands available for sale in the Mediterranean, and will set you back just under £1.2million - cheaper than a semi-detached property in some areas of the capital. Barely 130 miles from the fashionable resort of Porto Cervo where even the most modest of villas could set you back over £10 million, the island is located just a few miles off the coast of Sardinia and is completely uninhabited, with only the remains of a shepherd dwelling visible. Scroll down for video . Blue paradise? The Isola di Mal Ventre is one of the few private islands for sale in the Mediterranean . Tranquillity: The island has crystal clear waters and numerous coves composing spheres of pure quartz . Proof if any were needed that you don't have to be Richard Branson to own an island, the 200 acre island on sale is around two kilometres long at its longest point and rises around 18 metres above sea level. The agents selling the piece of land known as Isola di Mal Ventre, or roughly translated as 'the Island of the Sore Belly' has been inhabited on and off since Roman times with a watering well and buildings foundations still evident. These could be incorporated in the design of a modern villa and the agency selling it says it may be possible to construct a jetty from which trips to the mainland could be done in minutes by boat. Historic: Proof of the island's Roman past is clear with some architectural remains still standing . Located within a marine protected area, the island's current owners took it on in 1972 . As far as the eye can see: The island's south east coast has some beautiful sandy beaches . The west coast of the island is quite exposed to the Mistral and is rugged as a result, whereas the south east coast has beautiful sandy beaches with crystal blue waters and numerous coves composing spheres of pure quartz. The island itself is mainly granite covered in low vegetation with a wide variety of flora and fauna. Situated within a marine protected area, the island has not been the subject of any planning application since its current owners took it on in 1972. It's cheaper than this.... the 'ice cube house' in Brixton, on the market for £1.5m . And this...David Cameron's former home in West London was valued at £1.5million recently . Local architects suggest that a low rise villa could easily be constructed around the remains of former buildings, while water could be drawn from the existing well. 'This is one of the most unique properties in the Mediterranean, with potential revenue from holiday makers looking for sanctuary or something a little different,' said spokesperson Alexandra Hayward of the sale, which is advertised on real estate website debutesq.

Finnair has been forced to backtrack on claims it didn't fly in Ukrainian airspace after being lambasted on social media as airlines struggle to come to terms with the Malaysian Airlines tragedy. Finnair was not alone as they looked to ease the worries of their own passengers after the MH17 disaster which saw the Malaysian flight crash in Ukraine, killing 298 passengers. SIngapore Airlines apologised on Saturday after their statement about not flying in Ukraine airspace was viewed by many on social media as insensitive.

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Daniel Martin . Updated: . 04:38 EST, 22 February 2012 . Four people have been arrested in the fraud investigation surrounding David Cameron’s ‘back to work’ tsar Emma Harrison. Officers carried out dawn raids on the homes of former staff of her employment agency A4e, which receives tens of millions every year in Government contracts. The two men and two women were questioned on suspicion of cheating taxpayers. Escalation: Four people were arrested in the fraud investigation involving Emma Harrison, the government's 'back to work' tsar, appointed by David Cameron and paid by the Government to help the unemployed find jobs . The revelation about last month’s arrests marks a major escalation in the crisis over A4e, which is paid by the Government to help the long-term unemployed find jobs, and prompted fresh calls for the suspension of its contracts. The company has insisted that police activity had been confined to searches of its offices. But last night, as a whistleblower made claims contradicting the company’s assertion that the problem involves only a ‘very small number of individuals’, it also emerged: . The Prime Minister appointed 48-year-old Mrs Harrison in 2010 after she boasted she could get problem families into work, but he may be regretting bringing her into the fold after she paid herself £8.6million, mainly taxpayers’ cash, last year. MPs said earlier this month that her company, which generates the vast majority of its £180million turnover from the taxpayer, had missed many of its targets for putting the long-term jobless into work. The fraud allegations are understood to concern taxpayers’ money being claimed for finding unemployed people a job, even if the work lasts just a few days. Last Friday, detectives from Thames Valley Police visited the company’s offices in Slough, Berkshire. The company played down the visit as little more than a ‘chat over tea’ to discuss the fraud probe. Police visited the A4e offices in Slough, Berkshire, as part of the fraud probe, but the company played down the visit as a 'chat over tea' and made no mention of the four arrests . However no mention was made of the arrests which, the Mail discovered yesterday, had already taken place on January 18 in the Berkshire and Buckinghamshire areas. A4e has insisted in a statement that the fraud allegations are an isolated case of ‘four former A4e front-line staff who are alleged to have falsely claimed that customers had been placed into employment’. But yesterday an A4e whistleblower told the Daily Mail workers were being made ‘scapegoats’. ‘They are putting the whole blame on the workers. But the pressure from managers was relentless,’ said the source, who no longer works at the company. Front-line staff were responsible for helping jobseekers find work, the source said. If they were successful they filled out a form declaring a ‘job outcome’ which earned staff a £50 bonus. But the company could claim up to £1,900 in success fees from the Government. Under the rules in place at the time, this money was meant to be paid only after the person had been employed for at least 13 weeks. The whistleblower claimed: ‘At no stage was I ever told about this requirement or asked to check if people had been working for 13 weeks. ‘We would put in the paperwork to our managers as soon as someone had got a job, the very same day if possible.’ Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘There is a growing number of concerns which mean that the only common-sense thing would be for the Government to suspend its contracts.’ Calls: Margaret Hodge said that the only common-sense thing to do would be for the Government to suspend the A4e contracts . Despite the police investigation, A4e could be in line for a share of £126million of payment-by-results contracts to help more than 50,000 16 and 17-year-olds to ‘earn or learn’. The Cabinet Office said the firm would still be able to pitch for contracts to help the young jobless under a scheme launched yesterday by Nick Clegg. A spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘It’s an open tender process.’ Yesterday a police spokesman confirmed: ‘Thames Valley Police officers visited the offices of A4e in Slough on Friday, February 17, as part of an allegation of fraud. ‘As part of the investigation, four people, two women aged 28 and 49, and two men, aged 35 and 41, were arrested on suspicion of fraud on January 18. They have all been released on police bail until mid-March.’ Last night A4e strenuously rejected the whistleblower’s claims. Andrew Dutton, the firm’s CEO, said: ‘I will not sit by and let these accusations discredit the hard work that our staff do to support thousands of people into work. ‘A4e has zero tolerance towards fraud, and any instance of fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity is completely unacceptable. We take our responsibility very seriously, and we are committed to using taxpayers’ money effectively and efficiently to deliver the best services to the public.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Two men and two women questioned on suspicion of cheating taxpayers .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Following powerful volcanic eruptions, large amounts of sulfur dioxide deposit themselves in ice cores buried deep within the Antarctic. By studying these deposits, researchers from Nevada have been able to accurately plot the most explosive of these events during the past 2,000 years. Topping the list was the eruption at Samalas, Indonesia in 1257, followed by the Kuwae event of 1452, and Tambora in 1815. Although the study plots earlier events, the researchers don't know exactly what these explosions were. Researchers studied records of global ice core sulfate data collected from Antarctica. In total, the study looked at 26 ice core records collected in an array of 19 sites from across Antarctica. Samalas was the most explosive eruption, and it took place in 1257 in Indonesia's Mount Rinjani's (pictured) The scientists, led by Michael Sigl and Joe McConnell of Nevada's Desert Research Institute (DRI), studied 26 ice core records from 19 sites across Antarctica. It is the most accurate and precise reconstruction to date of historic volcanic sulfate emissions in the Southern Hemisphere, and is the first annually resolved record extending through the Common Era - the last 2,000 years of human history. Powerful volcanic eruptions are one of . the most significant causes of climate variability in the past due to the large amounts of sulfur dioxide they emit. This leads to the formation . of microscopic particles known as volcanic sulfate aerosols. These . aerosols reflect more of the sun's radiation back to space and ultimately cool the . Earth's temperature. This map plots the most explosive volcanic eruptions of the last 2,000 years, based on the research and using date estimates . Topping the list was the eruption at Samalas, Indonesia in 1257, followed by the Kuwae event of 1452, and Tambora, also in Indonesia,  in 1815. Although the study plots earlier events, the researchers don't know exactly what these explosions were. Based . on the timeline, however, it's possible to estimate what these events . may have been. For example, the fourth most powerful eruption took place . in around 674 AD, which could have been the Pago event in Bismarck or . the eastern Alaskan eruption in Mount Churchill believed to have take place around 700 AD. During the research, the scientists discovered evidence of 116 events - and the top ten are pictured in red. Topping the list was Samalas, Indonesia in 1257, followed by Kuwae in 1458, and Tambora in 1815. The researchers are unsure exactly what the earlier explosions were but have been able to plot the years for the fourth, fifth and sixth . Fifth and sixth place occurred between 531 to 566 AD and could be the Rabaul Caldera explosions in Papua New Guinea that is thought to have took place around 535 onwards. The seventh most powerful explosion happened shortly after Samalas, and may have been Quilatoa in the Andes in 1280. Based . on the 450 AD date of the eighth place event suggests it was Ilopango . in Central America, ninth appears to have been the Grímsvötn and Laki eruptions in Iceland around 1785. While tenth place happened shortly before Samalas and . could have been an earlier eruption of Mount Rinjani, Indonesia. Past volcanic events are measured using sulfate deposition . records found in ice cores, and have been linked to short-term global and . regional cooling. The latest research brought together an array of ice core sulfate . data in the world, including the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide . ice core - said to be the most detailed record of volcanic sulfate in the . Southern Hemisphere. By studying the levels of sulphate deposits, the team were able to construct a timeline that shows when the largest eruptions took place, based on the level of sulphate found, and which were the most destructive. A Desert Research Institute scientist examines a freshly drilled ice core in the field before ice cores are analysed in DRI's ultra-trace ice core analytical laboratory (left). Locations of Antarctic ice core sites used for volcanic sulfate aerosol deposition reconstruction are pictured right . Topping the list was the eruption at Samalas, Indonesia in 1257, followed by the Kuwae event of 1452, and Tambora in 1815. Most notably, the research found that the . two largest volcanic eruptions in recent Earth history deposited 30 to 35 percent less sulfate in . Antarctica, suggesting that these events had a weaker cooling effect on . global climate than previously thought. Powerful volcanic eruptions are one of . the most significant causes of climate variability in the past due to the large amounts of sulfur dioxide they emit. This leads to the formation . of microscopic particles known as volcanic sulfate aerosols. These . aerosols reflect more of the sun's radiation back to space and ultimately cool the . Earth's temperature. Past volcanic events are measured using sulfate deposition . records found in ice cores, and have been linked to short-term global and . regional cooling. These reconstructions are critical to accurate model simulations used to assess past natural and anthropogenic climate changes. Such . model simulations underpin environmental policy decisions including . those aimed at regulating greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions to curb . projected global warming. Although the study plots earlier events, it is unclear what these explosions were. Based on the timeline, however, it's possible to hypothesise what these events may have been. For example, the fourth most powerful eruption took place in around 674 AD, which could be the Pago event in Bismarck in 710, or the eastern Alaskan eruption in Mount Churchill of 700. Fifth and sixth place occurred between 500 to 600 AD and could be the Rabaul Caldera explosions that took place in 535 and 536. The seventh most powerful explosion happened shortly after Samalas, and may have been Quilatoa in the Andes in 1280. Based on the 450 AD date of the eighth place event suggests it was Ilopango in Central America, and tenth place happened shortly before Samalas and could have been an earlier eruption of Mount Rinjani. ‘This record provides the basis for a dramatic improvement in existing reconstructions of volcanic emissions during recent centuries and millennia,’ said the report's lead author Michael Sigl, a postdoctoral fellow and specialist in DRI's unique ultra-trace ice core analytical laboratory, located on the Institute's campus in Reno, Nevada. These reconstructions are critical to accurate model simulations used to assess past natural and anthropogenic climate changes. Such model simulations underpin environmental policy decisions including those aimed at regulating greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions to curb projected global warming. ‘This work is the culmination of more than a decade of collaborative ice core collection and analysis in our lab here at DRI,’ said Joe McConnell, a DRI research professor who developed the continuous-flow analysis system used to analyze the ice cores. An ice core section (picutred) is simultaneously analysed for a variety of elements and chemical species in DRI's ultra-trace ice core laboratory while slowly melting the ice on a heated melter plate . McConnell, a member of several research teams that collected the cores, including the 2007 to 2009 Norwegian-American Scientific Traverse of East Antarctica and the WAIS Divide project that reached a depth of 3,405 meters in 2011, added, ‘The new record identifies 116 individual volcanic events during the last 2000 years.’ ‘Our new record completes the period from years 1 to 500 AD, for which there were no reconstructions previously, and significantly improves the record for years 500 to 1500 AD,’ Sigl added. This new record also builds on DRI's previous work as part of the international Past Global Changes (PAGES) effort to help reconstruct an accurate 2,000-year-long global temperature for individual continents. Simulations of volcanic sulfate transport performed with a coupled aerosol-climate model were compared to the ice core observations and used to investigate spatial patterns of sulfate deposition to Antarctica. The third most explosive event took place at Tombora in Indonesia (pictured) in 1815 . Simulations of volcanic sulfate transport performed with a coupled aerosol-climate model were compared to the ice core observations and used to investigate spatial patterns of sulfate deposition to Antarctica. ‘Both observations and model results show that not all eruptions lead to the same spatial pattern of sulfate deposition,’ said Matthew Toohey from the German institute GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. He added, . ‘Spatial variability in sulfate deposition means that the accuracy of volcanic sulfate reconstructions depends strongly on having a sufficient number of ice core records from as many different regions of Antarctica as possible.’ The findings are published in Nature Climate Change journal.","Powerful volcanic eruptions are a significant cause of climate variability .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Our large brains, long legs and ability to craft tools are often thought to have evolved together at the start of the Homo lineage up to 2.4 million years ago. But new climate and fossil evidence shows these unique traits may have originated much earlier in our Australopithecus ancestors, between three and four million years ago. The research also suggests that rather than forming as a single package, these key traits evolved individually, over a much longer timeframe. Our large brains, long legs and ability to craft tools were thought to have evolved together at the start of the Homo lineage (illustration pictured left) up to 2.4 million years ago. New climate and fossil evidence shows these traits may have originated earlier, in Australopithecus ancestors (pictured right), 4 million years ago . Although scientists have recognised these characteristics for decades, they are now reconsidering the true evolutionary factors that drove them. Paleoanthropologist Dr Richard Potts . began by developing a climate framework for East African 2.5 million to 1.5 million years ago. This showed that the era was a . time of strong climate instability and shifting intensity of annual wet . and dry seasons. Researchers then reviewed the body of . fossil evidence relevant to the origin of Homo, to understand how . the human genus evolved. Species' can be identified based on differences in the shape of their . skulls, especially their face and jaws, but not on the basis of size. These differences in their skulls suggest early Homo spread across the the . environment, each utilising a slightly different strategy to survive. Even . though all Homo species had overlapping body, brain and tooth . sizes, they also had larger brains and bodies than their likely . ancestors, Australopithecus. According . to the study, these differences and similarities show the human . package of traits evolved separately, and at different times in the past . rather than all together. It also blurs the lines as to when the traits began to evolve. A large brain, long legs, the ability to craft tools and prolonged maturation periods were all thought to have evolved as African grasslands expanded and Earth’s climate became cooler and drier. The new analysis, published in the journal Science, led the team to conclude that the ability of early humans to adjust to changing conditions ultimately enabled the earliest species of Homo to vary, survive, and begin spreading from Africa to Eurasia 1.85 million years ago. Paleoanthropologist Dr Richard Potts . began by developing a climate framework for East African 2.5 million to 1.5 million years ago. This showed that the era was a . time of strong climate instability and shifting intensity of annual wet . and dry seasons. The framework, which is based on Earth’s astronomical cycles, provides the basis for some of the paper’s key findings, and it suggests that multiple coexisting species of Homo that overlapped geographically emerged in highly changing environments. Dr Potts, curator of anthropology and director of the Human Origins Programme at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, said: ‘Unstable climate conditions favoured the evolution of the roots of human flexibility in our ancestors. ‘The narrative of human evolution that arises from our analyses stresses the importance of adaptability to changing environments, rather than adaptation to any one environment, in the early success of the genus Homo.’ Between 2.1 and 1.8 million years ago, the oldest species of Homo (pictured left and second from left) began to diversify. By 1.8 to 1.9 million years ago, Homo erectus (fossils pictured right and second from right) evolved in Africa and began spreading to Eurasia. These lineages overlapped for several hundred thousand years . Even though all Homo species had overlapping body, brain and tooth sizes, they had larger brains and bodies than the Australopithecus. These differences and similarities show the human package of traits evolved separately, and at different times. This graphic shows the overlapping species . The researchers then reviewed the entire body of fossil evidence relevant to the origin of Homo to better understand how the human genus evolved. Susan Antón, professor of anthropology at New York University, said: ‘We can tell the species apart based on differences in the shape of their skulls, especially their face and jaws, but not on the basis of size. ‘The differences in their skulls suggest early Homo divvied up the environment, each utilising a slightly different strategy to survive.’ Even though all of the Homo species had overlapping body, brain and tooth sizes, they also had larger brains and bodies than the Australopithecus. The morphology, variation and behaviour of our ancestors is pictured. In addition to studying climate and fossil data, the team also reviewed evidence from ancient stone tools, isotopes found in teeth and cut marks found on animal bones in East Africa . According to the study, these differences and similarities show that the human package of traits evolved separately, and at different times. In addition to studying climate and fossil data, the team also reviewed evidence from ancient stone tools, isotopes found in teeth and cut marks found on animal bones in East Africa. Leslie Aiello, president of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, added: ‘Taken together, these data suggest that species of early Homo were more flexible in their dietary choices than other species.' The team concluded that this flexibility likely enhanced the ability of human ancestors to successfully adapt to unstable environments and disperse from Africa. Dr Potts said: ‘This flexibility continues to be a hallmark of human biology today, and one that ultimately underpins the ability to occupy diverse habitats throughout the world.’ He said future research on new fossil and archaeological finds will need to focus on identifying specific adaptive features that originated with early Homo, which will yield a deeper understanding of human evolution.","Man’s large brains, long legs and the ability to craft tools are .

Empowering local doctors is an important objective within the organisation. Dr . Ramer is the only expatriate veterinarian on the ground - the majority . of the team is comprised of Rwandan, Ugandan, and Congolese . veterinarians and all support staff are African. The . Gorilla Doctors' work continues to see the mountain gorilla population . rise, while all other monitored populations of great apes around the . world are steadily declining. The . last six years have seen the vets and scientists employ increasingly . advanced techniques, which they hope will help all critically endangered . species, not just gorillas. Gorilla . Doctors operates under a 'One Health' approach to conserving the . species, which live in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda . and the Virunga Massif, which straddles the borders of Rwanda, Uganda . and DR Congo. Assistance: A team from the Gorilla Doctors transfer a gorilla named Ihirwe in a crate across a river in Kasuo, Democratic Republic of Congo . Transfer: The Gorilla Doctors carry a crate holding Ihirwe the gorilla in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo . Working hard: All other monitored populations of great apes around the world are steadily declining . 'One Health' is a belief that the . health of one species is inextricably linked to that of the entire . ecosystem - including humans and other animal species. This . is important as disease can be spread by local people, who, earning an . average of $1 (£0.59) a day, delve into the forest for resources such as . water and firewood, as well as to hunt bushmeat. The . region, which is the most densely populated in Africa, is also a magnet . for thousands of eco-tourists who trek to the habituated gorilla . groups, eager to observe the wild apes in their natural habitat. The . Rwanda Development Board, which orchestrates the gorilla tourism . program, requires tourists maintain a 23ft (7m) distance from the . gorillas. However, the gorillas are not aware of the rule and often approach much closer, making disease transmission a primary concern. But . there is two-way traffic around the national park and some of the . mountain gorillas, which can weigh 30st, also wander out of the . protected forest and into close proximity to local communities in search . of eucalyptus and bamboo shoots. The common cold could potentially kill the animals, who share 98.5 per cent of their genes with humans.

Love: Another view of gorilla Kalonge with her favourite carer Babo at the Senkwekwe Centre, DRC . In fact, infectious disease, such as . human-born respiratory illness, accounts for 20 per cent of mountain . gorilla deaths in central Africa. Gorilla . Doctors immediately treat all gorillas exhibiting severe respiratory . illness symptoms with medications to help the animal overcome the . infection quickly. The . region the Gorilla Doctors operate in is also one of the most turbulent . in the world and has been marred by genocide and war. 'We monitor their heath, intervene when a gorilla is sick and rescue orphans when they are confiscated by authorities from poachers or dealers' Dr Eddy Kambale, Gorilla Doctors head veterinarian in DRC . At . times, the team has been unable to monitor the gorillas' health, . primarily in the DR Congo, where rebel factions have . moved into the gorilla's habitat. Most . recently, the M23 rebel group occupied the Mikeno Sector of Virunga . National Park for 18 months and were finally dispersed by the Congolese . army and UN forces, allowing conservation workers to re-enter the park . and check on the gorillas and other wildlife. Their . latest mission, to fly a young Grauer's gorilla orphan named Ihirwe to . the Grace sanctuary in north-eastern DRC, was made possible by UN . forces. Gorilla Doctors has provided critical medical care to over 30 orphan gorillas since the organisation's inception. The . Senkwekwe Centre, located in Rumangabo, DRC, is home to four mountain . gorilla orphans and one suspected Grauer's gorilla orphan. The . Gorilla Rehabilitation and Conservation Education (Grace) center is . home to 14 Grauer's, or eastern lowland gorilla orphans.

Needing treatment: A close up of mountain gorilla Ndakasi having her teeth checked at the Senkwekwe Centre, DRC . The Grauer's gorilla is slightly larger and less hariy than the mountain gorilla subspecies. Dr . Eddy Kambale, the Gorilla Doctors head veterinarian in DR Congo, has . been directly involved in the care of 24 orphans rescued from poachers. He said: ‘My work with the Gorilla Doctors consists of saving one gorilla's life at a time. ‘I . usually spend about 20 days in the field at a time but this is . determined by the gorillas' health, which can increase the number of . days. ‘We monitor their . heath, intervene when a gorilla is sick and rescue orphans when they are . confiscated by authorities from poachers or dealers.’ The latest rescued orphan was a . female gorilla - later named Kalonge - who was turned over to officials . at Kahuzi Biega National Park after being caught in a poacher's snare. New . arrivals at the Senkwekwe Center, such as infant Kalonge, must be . placed in quarantine for 30 days, to establish the health status of the . animal and prevent transmission of diseases among orphans. Once . Kalonge arrived at the Senkwekwe Centre, she was immediately placed in . the care of experienced caregivers Babo and Phillipe, both former . Virunga National Park rangers. ‘These two men are very experienced in the care of orphan gorillas’ said Dr Ramer. Want something to eat? Dr Jan Ramer offers a banana to a gorilla named Ihirwe onboard a UN helicopter from Goma, DRC . Medical assistance: Gorilla Kalonge being assessed in the quarantine zone at the Senkwekwe Centre . ‘They know how to make gorilla appeasement vocalizations, gently hold the orphan when she is frightened and encourage her to eat - which is not a small task. They will remain with Kalonge 24/7, even sleeping beside her, to slowly gain her trust.’ As infants, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two subspecies of eastern gorilla. The Gorilla Doctors take blood, fur and faeces samples, and ship them to the Max Planck Institute in Cologne, Germany, for DNA analysis before they can determine the orphan's long-term care facility. Dr Ramer added: ‘If we confirm she is a Grauer's gorilla she will be taken to Grace to join the 14 other orphans there. ‘If, on the outside chance, she is found to be a mountain gorilla she will stay at Senkwekwe and join the four mountain gorillas, Maisha, Ndakasi, Ndeze, and Matabishi, who live there. ‘Either way, she will finally be back with her own kind, living in a forested enclosure and allowed to be a healthy and happy gorilla.’ The Gorilla Doctors were formed in 1986 as the Virunga Veterinary Center, later becoming the ‘Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project’. Starting from the first Gorilla Doctor, Dr James Foster, the organisation now employs 14 veterinarians and operates in DR Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The Gorilla Doctors is powered by the non-profit Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project and the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center and is directed by Dr Mike Cranfield and Dr Kirsten Gilardi.","Vet team operates in heart of Africa, treating ill gorillas in Uganda, Rwanda, and Democratic Republic of Congo .

Mother-of-one Christine Bradley, 56, had rented the device from a tanning salon for £80 and planned to get a nice tan ahead of a holiday in Gran Canaria. She lay down on the sunbed but within moments realised its lamps were getting 'unbearably' hot. Shocking: Christine Bradley, 56, at her home in Hartlepool, where her hired sunbed burst into flames . Unbearable: Christine leaped off the sunbed when it became far too hot for her . Damage: The fire destroyed all her new holiday clothes, TV, carpets, wallpaper, blinds and a window . Christine knew something was not right when she could only handle the heat for 15 minutes, rather than the half hour she planned. The heat got so intense she eventually had to jump off and then watched in horror as it burst into flames. Christine, of Hartlepool, fled to her neighbour's home in her dressing gown and dialled 999 as the blaze spread through her spare room. The fire caused £1,000 worth of damage - including destroying all her newly purchased holiday clothes, TV, carpets, wallpaper, blinds and a window.

Christine said: 'I only got it delivered on Friday. It was five minutes between getting off and smelling smoke. 'I can't believe how lucky I am. Five more minutes and I dread to think what could have happened. I wouldn't have got out. 'Normally they take time to warm up, but this one didn't - it was really quite hot straight away. I thought ""this is too hot"", so I got out. 'I went to get a towel, but the next thing I looked up and flames were coming from the top of it. If I had been on five minutes later I would have been dead. 'I'll never in my life use sunbeds again - the experience was just horrendous.'

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Associated Press . Admission: German MP Michael Hartmann said that he used crystal meth for around a month in 2013 . German MP Michael Hartmann has revealed that he took crystal meth in a bid to sharpen up at work. Hartmann, the interior policy expert for the Social Democrats, had his Berlin apartment searched for drugs by police on Wednesday and his lawyer later admitted that he once bought and consumed crystal meth in 2013. His lawyer stressed that Hartmann, who has been a vocal anti-cannabis campaigner, was not addicted to crystal meth and only took it for around a month to ‘improve performance’ at work , according to The Local. His lawyer said: 'Without wishing to excuse his misconduct, he explains it by saying that he hoped at that time to be more efficient through drug use.' Police searched the 51-year-old’s home after a surveillance team saw him buying the drug. Drug information website Frank describes crystal meth as a drug in the amphetamine family that makes users 'exhilarated, alert and awake', with long-term use sometimes leading to brain damage. Hartmann is by no means the first politician to be embroiled in a drugs scandal. Toronto mayor Rob Ford caused a media storm after admitting that he’d taken drugs. Last Friday he said he won't guarantee he will stay sober if he's re-elected, telling a radio show that people will just have to trust him. Ford, who returned this week to City Council from two months in rehab, said in an interview on Newstalk 1010 that he can't make promises about something over which he has 'no control.' Radio host Jerry Agar said that as someone who has supported Ford in the past, the lack of guarantees that he won't drink again if re-elected makes it tough to 'take another four-year shot on Rob Ford.' 'That's up to you,' Ford replied. 'You're going to have to look at my record and compare it to the people I'm running (against) and you're basically going to have to trust me.' Ford insisted that returning to lead Canada's largest city and run for re-election October 27 won't compromise his recovery. Ford said last week that he's used 'every drug you can probably think of,' and blamed substance abuse for the racist and homophobic language he's used. He said he's used cocaine, marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms, but not heroin. He acknowledged he smoked crack but denied he was a crack addict. He said he drank at City Hall, but never did drugs at work. Controversial: Toronto mayor Rob Ford caused a media storm after admitting that he’d taken drugs and recently said that he couldn't guarantee staying sober if he was re-elected . The mayor announced in late April that he would seek help for alcohol addiction after a video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack cocaine. Reports last year of a similar video led to months of denials before Ford made his statement about smoking crack in a 'drunken stupor.' A small group of protesters, inspired by Joe Killoran, a shirtless jogger whose rant at Ford during a Canada Day event on July 1 touched off a social media frenzy, gathered outside the radio studios. 'We have no shirts, you have no ethics,' read one sign carried by the protesters, many of whom were bare chested. Since his return Ford has given a handful of interviews, but has refused to take questions from city hall journalists at large about the circumstances surrounding his alcohol and drug use, the company he kept and offensive remarks he has made.","Michael Hartmann admitted using crystal meth for around a month in 2013 .

She was speaking at a riding event in her native Switzerland last weekend after Michael was recently transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to a unit near his Swiss home.

Scroll down for video . Hope: Corinna Schumacher, pictured at a riding event in her native Switzerland, has said that her husband (right) is getting better slowly . Just weeks ago experts warned Corinna was on the cusp of making herself gravely ill with her worries over the future for her husband Michael . She told Neue Post: ‘It's getting better, slowly certainly, but in any case it's improving.’ She was pictured laughing and handing out chocolates at the event. 'This smile is a message about fate,' said Germany's Bild newspaper. 'It means: we will fight. For every happy moment in life.' Just weeks ago experts warned Corinna was on the cusp of making herself gravely ill with her worries over the future for her husband Michael, 45, as the Formula One ace struggled to come out of the six month induced coma. She was warned to find downtime for herself otherwise she risked succumbing to depression. The picture she presented of herself at the weekend at her western-style ranch in Givrins, Switzerland, shows she took the advice to heart. Michael Schumacher, 45, (pictured with his wife Corinna) suffered a major head injury when he fell while skiing in France in December and was kept in a medically induced coma for six months after the accident . Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm was . with her as she held a western-style riding tournament called 'reining' at the ranch. Corinna became an expert in the pursuit several years ago . and has won prizes for her skill around the world. At . the CS Ranch - the initials stand for her name - Corinna, 45, was 'the . epitome of grace and charm. A life on hold has now flooded back to her. This was a statement to the world that she is comfortable with the . progress Michael is making and knows that life must always go on,' said a . Swiss radio station. Riders from more than a dozen nations turned up at the ranch for the day's events at the ultra-modern arena that Corinna bought in 2004. Bild quoted a guest as saying: 'Ms .

"By . David Kent . and Ted Thornhill . Mario Balotelli has posted an Instagram photograph of himself brandishing a shotgun, with a caption underneath that reads 'big kiss to all the haters'. The 23-year-old Italian striker later deleted the post. The incident is the latest in a long history of controversies involving Balotelli, who in 2011 during his time at Manchester City was caught throwing darts at a youth team player. Controversy: Mario Balotelli posted a pictured of himself with a gun on Instagram before deleting it . Head boy: Mario Balotelli rises above Gary Cahill to score the winner for Italy against England . Drowning his World Cup sorrows: Mario Balotelli looked to be having a great time frolicking in the sea with his fiancee Fanny Neguesha in Miami . In the same year, former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole was forced to apologise to Tom Cowan, a sports science student on work experience at Chelsea's Cobham training ground, for shooting him with a air rifle. New AC Milan coach Filippo Inzaghi hopes the criticism Balotelli faced recently will help him grow as a player. Balotelli was the target of more blame than most players for Italy's first-round elimination from the World Cup, and also had an up-and-down campaign with Milan last season despite leading the club with 14 goals in 30 appearances. Italy's Mario Balotelli celebrates after scoring a goal past England's goalkeeper Joe Hart during their 2014 World Cup Group D soccer match at the Amazonia arena in Manaus. Balotelli is currently on holiday in Miami with fiance Fanny Neguesha after Italy crashed out of the World Cup in the group stages. Balotelli scored the winner in a 2-1 win for Italy against England on June 15. 'I spoke with Balotelli after Italy's exit and I told him that the criticism should serve only to strengthen him,' Inzaghi said on Thursday at a festive preseason training kickoff event at the club's new downtown headquarters. 'I didn't have everything served to me on a silver platter during my career; unfair criticism helped me.' Balotelli has four years left on his contract at Milan but had been linked with a return to the English Premier League - with Arsenal reportedly interested - until Italy's flop in Brazil. 'Balotelli is an asset for Italian football,' Inzaghi said, noting that the forward asked for a physical trainer to accompany him during his last week of vacation. 'It's my job to get the most worth out of him. He can create the difference for us.' The Italian striker is currently in negotiations with his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico for the right to visit their child, called Pia, who is eighteen months old. Ballotelli did not acknowledge he was Pia’s father until February this year after DNA tests proved his paternity. He was allowed to hold her for the first time in April in the court house in Naples, after the judge granted special permission. Balotelli and Miss Fico attended a private hearing at a court in Brescia, near Milan, in May to discuss how often the footballer will be able to visit his daughter.","Striker later deleted the post from the picture sharing site .

"By . Associated Press . and Ted Thornhill . Police in Bangor, Maine, believe they have quacked the code for finding followers on social media. The 80-officer Bangor Police Department, which serves a city of about 33,000, has attracted more than 20,000 likes on its Facebook page after humorous pictures of a stuffed duck were added. The duck, dubbed 'Duck of Justice' or 'DOJ,' appears in pictures of police cars, department members and K-9 cops, often accompanied with some pithy text about law enforcement. Good idea or just quackers? Bangor police department has increased it social media presence posting photographs that feature a stuffed duck . Out and about: The Duck of Justice likes to explore . Winging it: The Duck of Justice helping out with some online research at the police station . Proud: Bangor police officers have become attached to the Duck of Justice . Examination: Officer Buckley takes a closer look at the DoJ . 'I happen to believe that police officers are a pretty humorous bunch,' said the man behind the duck, Sgt. Tim Cotton, a 17-year veteran Bangor officer with a fondness for the humor of George Carlin and Jim Gaffigan. 'I want to read something that at least has some humorous undertones - I wouldn't connect to a page that I didn't want to read.' Bangor is just one of many police departments nationwide discovering that using comedy on social media can help them interact with the public. One department, in 10,000-resident Brimfield Township, Ohio, has earned more than 155,000 Facebook likes for its chief's in-your-face humor about everything from methamphetamine busts to lost dogs. Nancy Marshall, a Maine-based social media strategist who runs a public relations firm in the Maine capital of Augusta, said Bangor's site helps residents humanize the police. 'It's definitely a new way of engaging with the public,' Marshall said. 'I admire the Bangor police department for being bold enough to expose their humanity.' Write stuff: The Duck of Justice reads up on justice . Top billing: The 'Duck of Justice' pops up in numerous locations . A new start: The wooden duck was stuffed by a taxidermist and rescued from a trash compactor . Cotton took over in April as the department's public information officer, a job that makes him responsible for the department's Facebook page. Since he started, the page's number of 'likes' has shot up by more than 8,000. The wooden duck - stuffed by a taxidermist and rescued by Cotton from a trash compactor at a district attorney's office - is a light way for the department to get residents' attention about sometimes serious matters in a crowded social media landscape, he said. The duck has made the rounds in Bangor, appearing in a photo at Bangor Raceway with a caption that said it was 'whistling 'More Than A Feeling'' because the band Boston was playing nearby. It also propped up a copy of the voluminous 2013-14 Maine criminal statutes book, reminding residents that it 'will be in the office all weekend if you have any questions.' The duck also has a more serious side, appearing in profiles of new officers and a post about a lost dog. Quacky days: It's a thumbs up for the DoJ from this officer . The page has its detractors, including commenters who contend that paying Cotton to use social media isn't a wise use of public money. Other departments' social media efforts have stumbled, such as the New York Police Department's April request for followers to post pictures of themselves with NYPD officers on Twitter with the #myNYPD hashtag. Many users instead used the hashtag to post pictures of aggressive police behavior. The duck originally was sneaked into in social media photos, hidden in plain view in a manner similar to the popular 'Kilroy Was Here' graffiti of the World War II era. The duck became the focus of photos as it became more and more popular, Cotton said. The Facebook page has since received fans from as far away as Brazil and Iran, he said. As for the critics, Cotton says it's just water off a, well, you know. 'Policemen find their job funny no matter what people think of police,' he said. 'There's horrible things in police work and there's wonderful things.'","Bangor Police  has had 20,000 Facebook likes thanks to a stuffed duck .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . If you think the recent bad weather has been a struggle, spare a thought for poor Rachel Prince. The 26-year-old is trapped indoors every time it rains due to a rare condition that means she’s allergic to water. As such, Miss Prince, from Ripley, Derbyshire, has been unable to go outside for the past month because a single drop will cause a painful itchy red rash. Rain, rain go away: The recent stormy weather has been Rachel Prince's worst nightmare because she suffers from an extremely rare allergy to water . 'It makes me feel like my skin is on fire': Miss Prince can't even seek comfort from her fiance Lee Warwick (right) because the saliva from his kiss brings her out in a painful rash . Recent weather conditions - some of the wettest to hit the UK in 200 years - have seen Rachel housebound. And she can't even seek comfort from her fiance Lee Warwick, 28, because the saliva from a kiss also causes a reaction. Rachel’s condition, Aquagenic pruritis, means even a few drops of saliva from Lee could bring out an extremely itchy prickling-like rash. The allergy also means she cannot go for long baths or even drink a cold glass of water as it makes her throat swell up whenever she takes a sip. The condition is so rare it’s believed Rachel is one of only about 35 people in the world who suffer from it. Frustrating: Her allergy also means she cannot take long showers or baths without suffering a reaction . Struggle: Miss Prince first noticed the allergy when she was 12 and the rash has gradually got worse over the years . Rachel, who is an artist, said: 'I never . go out without checking the weather and because of the recent amount of . rainfall we’ve had, I’ve been indoors a lot which I hate. 'A single drop of rainfall can give me a painful allergic reaction that can last a few hours. 'I always go out with a coat that has a big hood on it, as well as an umbrella, just in case it does suddenly rain. 'I’ve been staying in a lot lately which is so boring and depressing as I want to go out but I just can’t - it’s not worth the risk. 'It’s so painful and red, I’ve experienced people staring at me when an allergic reaction happens in a public place.' Learning to cope: Miss Prince has managed to adapt to daily life with her partner Lee Warwick . After coming into contact with water - or blood, sweat and tears - a person with Aquagenic Urticaria develops painful, itchy hives that spread over the affected area. These can last anywhere between 10 minutes to an hour-and-a-half and some sufferers have to lie down to let the pain subside. Investigators believe the hives are not caused by a histamine release but are the result of extreme skin sensitivity to additives in water such as chlorine. The condition is extremely rare and is thought to affect around 35 known people in the world and there is no proven treatment. Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists said: 'Aquagenic might be associated with elevated blood histamine levels, but there are other processes at work and we do not yet fully understand the precise mechanisms that trigger the itchy rash. 'As the disorder is very rare, there may be other reasons for your symptoms - for example an allergy to a bathing product, so accurate diagnosis is the first step.' Rachel first noticed the allergy aged 12 and as she became older the rash worsened, making it almost impossible for her to be in contact with water without experiencing pain. She said: 'The rash makes me feel as though my skin is on fire and it itches as though I have a nettle rash. 'I find it hard to drink anything too cold as it really hurts my throat and makes it feel uncomfortable and as though it’s going to close. 'For some reason juice and tea are easier to drink but I don’t know why as they have water in too. 'Because my condition is so rare no-one has ever heard of it, some doctors have also refused to believe I’m suffering from an allergy to water because it’s that rare. 'I’m even allergic to sweat and tears - including my own blood when it gets in contact with my skin.

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Andrew Young In Praia Da Luz, Portugal . Locals in Praia da Luz have vented their anger at Scotland Yard’s re-investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann by spraying road signs in the resort with graffiti. The words ‘McCann circus’ have been stenciled onto dozens of Stop signs in the Portuguese resort where Madeleine disappeared in May 2007, so they read 'Stop McCann Circus'. Four arguidos - or 'persons of interest' - were quizzed in Portugal last Tuesday as part of the latest stage of the Metropolitan Police’s multi-million-pound probe. Backlash: Locals in the Portuguese resort where Madeleine disappeared in May 2007 have sprayed graffiti onto road signs so that they read 'Stop McCann circus' Four arguidos - or 'persons of interest' - were quizzed in Portugal last Tuesday as part of the latest stage of the Metropolitan Police’s multi-million-pound probe . One resident told the Daily Mirror: ‘We know these people, they are innocent. It is crazy. When will it end? We want to be left alone.' The mayor, Victor Mata, has expressed concern at the timing of the searches, as he fears it’ll put tourists off visiting. He said: ‘The next three months are when the entire village earns its keep.' Anger: Some locals are fearful that the police investigation will harm the tourist trade . In June, Portuguese and British police searched three sites in Praia da Luz for clues but found no evidence relating to the case. A former Scotland Yard commander, meanwhile, has urged British police to search an abandoned well just 875 yards from the apartment where Madeleine vanished. The Mail on Sunday has established that the uncovered shaft is on scrubland used as a campsite by Roma gipsies – and has been overlooked by Portuguese police. In June, Portuguese and British police searched three sites in Praia da Luz for clues but found no evidence relating to the case . Hidden from the nearby road, the well drops 30ft down to 12ft-deep water. ‘It is clearly known to locals and possibly to local criminals as a place to discard evidence from petty crime, such as handbags and other unwanted stolen items,’ said Roy Ramm, who served 27 years with the Metropolitan Police force and, as Commander of Specialist Operations, dealt with serious crime, from murder to rape and human trafficking. He added: ‘Whoever abducted Madeleine knew the local streets, alleyways and scrubland and used that knowledge to avoid detection.’ Mystery: Madeleine disappeared in May 2007 .","Road signs in Praia da Luz have been altered to read 'Stop McCann circus'

"By . Helen Pow . An 18-year-old Georgia man has drowned while playing a game in which someone is launched off a dock in a shopping cart and has to swim to safety. Chance Werner, of Euharlee, graduated high school just hours before the tragic incident at Lake Allatoona Saturday night, authorities said. Werner was playing the game with other teens and an adult at Dock D at the Holiday Harbor Marina in Bartow County just before midnight. The friends were pushing each other into the lake in the shopping cart, and pulling the cart back up with a rope, according to Bartow County Sheriff Clark Millsap. Victim: Chance Werner, of Euharlee, graduated high school just hours before the tragic incident at Lake Allatoona Saturday night, authorities said . Most of the time, the cart is tied to a pole at the dock, but in this instance, Werner decided to act as the pole. She said the rope was tied to the cart and his belt loop and when the cart was launched off the dock it dragged Werner down with it. The teen was pulled about 30 feet below the surface and he drowned. 'This is a tragedy for this young man just as he was starting the next stage in his life,' Melissa Cummings, spokeswoman for Georgia Department of Natural Resources, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Lake: The tragic incident happened at Lake Allatoona, pictured, Saturday night, authorities said . Police were called to the dock at 12:07 a.m. Sunday and his body was recovered almost three hours later. He was still tied to the cart.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A thank you letter written by slaves from the Amistad Rebellion in 1841 to former President John Quincy Adams, who defended them in court and helped set them free, has been published. The letter was released by the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University to mark the 175th anniversary of the rebellion. Adams was 74 when he decided to represent 53 Africans and prevent them from being sold into slavery by Spain. Artefact: The Amistad Research Center at Tulane University has released a letter from freed rebellion slaves to former President John Quincy Adams . Ally: Adams stood up for the Amistad slaves in front of the Supreme Court in Connecticut, which ruled that they were free to return to Africa . The letter contains messages from four of the 53. One wrote: ‘Dear friend, we write this to you because you plead with the Great Court to make us free and now we are free and joyful we thank the Great God. ‘We will tell all our friends about you and we will say to them Mr. Adams is a great man and he plead for us and how very glad we be and our friends will love you very much because you was a very good man and oh how joyful we shall be.’ The Freedom Schooner Amistad, a near-replica of the ship that sparked the 19th century evolt, flies Sierra Leonean and American flags as it sails into port in central Freetown, Sierra Leone, in 2007 .

After switching ships in Cuba to La Amistad, a slave called Cinque led an uprising on July 1 against their captors. Several were killed in the ensuing violence. The ship then crashed in Long Island, where they were jailed. A US court eventually set them free. Another said: ‘Wicked people want to make us slaves but the great God who has made all things raise up friends for Mendi people he give us Mr. Adams that he may make me free.’ The Africans had been kidnapped in Sierra Leone and were heading by ship in 1839 to Spain via Cuba when they decided to make a bid for freedom.

"By . Helen Pow . and David Mccormack . The 9/11 museum have come in for further negative criticism and accusations of crass commercialism after it was revealed that the memorial site will house an 80-seat restaurant. The Pavilion Cafe, run by famed New York restaurateur and Shake Shack mastermind Danny Meyer, is scheduled to open inside the National September 11 Memorial & Museum during the summer. A portion of proceeds from the restaurant are going back to the museum and Meyer has denied that it is an inappropriate location for people to enjoy food and drink. ‘We’re not doing this for crass or commercial reasons,’ he told the New York Post. Scroll down for video . Danny Meyer, founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, has denied that opening a restaurant on the 9/11 memorial site is crass, while memorial spokesperson called Tuesday night's social event a 'small gathering' The Pavilion Cafe at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum . will be run by famed New York restaurateur Danny Meyer who is responsible for the Shake Shack brand . Details about the restaurant emerged just hours after the sacred site was accused of being turned into a private club for invited guests on Tuesday night. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was one of dozens of guests accused of 'desecrating' the graves of 9/11 victims by 'drinking, eating and laughing' at a VIP-only opening party for the museum. According to reports, some first responders, who were supposed to be able to tour the museum for free prior to its official Wednesday opening, were turned away due to party preparations. 'They were drinking, eating and laughing when this is pretty much a grave-site,' a National September 11 Memorial & Museum employee, who asked not to be named, told the New York Daily News of the 60 or so partygoers. Criticized: Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured on May 14, has been accused of 'desecrating' the graves of 1,115 unidentified 9/11 victims by 'drinking, eating and laughing' at a VIP-only opening party for the emotive September 11 Museum . Emotional: The impressive museum features Ladder three Fire Truck as well as scores of other memorabilia . In honor of the first responders: Captain Patrick John Brown's helmet from the FDNY on display in the museum . Haunting: Part of the World Trade Center's original foundations are now incorporated into the museum . No day shall erase you from the memory of time: The letters of the quotation from Virgil's Aeneid were forged out of remnant World Trade Center steel by New Mexico blacksmith Tom Joyce . Was the black tie opening party at 9/11 museum disrespectful to the victims? 'I don't think alcohol should be allowed in there. It's a sacred ground and they desecrated it.' The worker, who also described the party's mood as . 'festive,' said the information desk at the lower level of . the museum acted as a makeshift bar from 6.30p.m. until 9.30p.m. Bloomberg and Condé Nast executives reportedly noshed on crab cakes and shrimp cocktail hors d'oeuvres at the black tie dedication ceremony for the museum. But museum spokesman Michael Frazier said the event was more a ‘small gathering’ than ‘festive.’ ‘This small gathering was done respectfully and in recognition of our supporters who helped to build the memorial and museum,’ he told the New York Daily News. ‘Among the attendees were 9/11 family members.’ Earlier in the day, several first responders, including an NYPD officer and his wife, were turned away. The newspaper also said a group of firefighters left the site in tears after they were told to wrap up their tour early. Condé Nast is paying for all visitors who explore the museum on opening day. Artifacts: The museum displays artifacts associated with the events of 9/11 along with touching testaments of both loss and recovery . For sale: The new museum's gift shop sells t-shirts, stuffed animals, key chains and other products marketed off the tragedy . The fresh critisism comes amid outrage . from September 11 survivors and victims' families over a gift shop . attached to the 9/11 Museum. The store associated with the museum sells . items ranging from key chains to NYPD dog vests marketed off the . tragedy. Jewelry, mousepads, magnets, flags, pins, stuffed animals, cellphone cases, toy firetrucks and much more are available for purchase. According to the museum's website, the proceeds benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial which is run by executives with privately-funded six-figure salaries. The idea of a gift shop alone is offensive to many, but is made even more painful considering thousands of unidentified remains of victims were recently moved to a tomb beneath the museum. 'Here is essentially our tomb of the unknown. To sell baubles I find quite shocking and repugnant,' Diane Horning, who lost her 26-year-old son Matthew in the attacks, told the New York Post. Insensitive: Diane Horning, pictured above with Representative Chuck Schumer, lost her 26-year-old son Matthew in the Twin Towers attacks. She finds the idea of a gift shop 'shocking and repugnant' Never forget: President Obama dedicated the new museum on Thursday, opening the memorial to survivors and victims' families.

Silk scarf with print of vintage photo showing WTC at lunchtime Price: $95 . Matthew worked as a database administrator for Marsh & McLennan, an insurance firm which had offices in the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Matthew's remains were never recovered. 'I think it's a money-making venture to support inflated salaries, and they're willing to do it over my son's dead body,' Mrs Horning said. Joe Daniels, the memorial and museum's CEO, makes $378,000 a year, though his and other executives' six-figure salaries are funded through private donations. Still, the idea of a gift shop doesn't sit well with many close to the tragedy, who believe it could have been kept closed until Wednesday, when the museum opens to the public. President Obama dedicated the museum in a moving speech on Thursday, and the memorial has since only been open to survivors and victims' families. 'These people are suffering, and they don't need to be reaching into their pockets,' John Feal, a former Ground Zero demolition survivor, told the Post. 'The museum could have gone six days without asking for money.' However, Feal, who runs the FealGood Foundation for ailing 9/11 workers, said he understands the museum's need to sell items in order to cover costs. The museum plans to operate on a $63million budget with money raised through admission fees and donations. 'All net proceeds from our sales are dedicated to developing and sustaining the national September 11 Memorial & Museum,' the museum's website reads. 'Thank you for helping to build a lasting place for remembrance, reflection, and learning for years to come.' The gift shop itself was funded with a $5million donation from Paul Napoli and Marc Bern, partners in a law firm which made $200,0000 representing 10,000 Ground Zero workers in a lawsuit. That's $5million Feal believes should have been donated to the 'sick and suffering - their former clients'.","It has been revealed that the under fire 9/11 museum will house an 80-seat restaurant called The Pavilion Cafe .

Not so funny: Comedian Wade Lynch, pictured, has been doing his Queen performance for years but the skit sparked outrage on Monday night . Prince Edward Island's Premier Robert Ghiz, sitting immediately to Camilla's left, was clearly humiliated at the entertainment officials chose to dish up to their special guests. As Lynch performs, Charles manages a less than half-hearted applause while Camilla seems to struggle even to tap her fingers on her hand in acknowledgement. The couple mutter a few, no doubt unimpressed, remarks to each other under their breath as the cringe-worthy act goes on. But Charles and Camilla weren't the only ones to find the performance deplorable.

Lynch, who has been impersonating the Queen for years, told the Prince Edward Island Guardian he was approached by Tourism P.E.I. to do the skit in front of Charles and Camilla. And he thought he pulled it off, telling the newspaper he felt 'a lot of the jokes landed' and that he could see the prince 'sort of nodding and chuckling.' Disappointed: Lynch, pictured, thought the performance went down well but was disappointed when he heard of the backlash .

One of the dancers, fashion photographer Reihane Taravati, has also posted a photograph on Instagram with the caption: 'Hi, I'm back' The friends were arrested on Tuesday after police took offense at the video, which shows three men and three unveiled women dancing in the streets and on the rooftops of Tehran. Williams protested the arrests on Facebook, posting: 'It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness.' This sparked the creation of the Twitter hashtag #freehappyiranians and finally Iranian authorities caved to the pressure. It's not clear how much longer the director will be detained. The video titled 'Happy in Tehran' features the group dancing in various locales just as in the original and is one of hundreds of covers of the hit made by fans around the world. But after the video hit YouTube and racked up close to 200,000 views with the help of Western news sites like the Huffington Post, authorities hunted down its stars, interrogated them in footage seen across the country and threw them in jail. Sad: These six young residents of Tehran have been arrested for remaking Pharrell's feel good hit video Happy . Pharrell responded to the shocking arrest late Tuesday in a tweet expressing is dismay . 'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia according to the ISNA news agency. By Tuesday night, the Grammy award winning singer had weighed in on the controversy. 'It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness,' Pharrell tweeted, with a link to a New York Times blog story about the arrests. The arrests came despite the three men and three women trying to dial back their fame by setting their video to private when they realized it had angered Islamic authorities. 'Following a series of intelligence and police operations and after coordinating with the judiciary, all the suspects were identified and arrested,' said Sajedinia. The Iranians' rendition of the hit angered authorities who seemed to fear it was evidence of a new generation casting aside the old Islamic lifestyle for Western ideals (a still from the remake is at left, with Pharrell at right) Islamic law requires women to cover their heads in public. Authorities called the video 'vulgar' Their interrogations showed the women veiled and angry officers asking questions. Sajedinia said they 'confessed to their criminal acts.' Islamic law stipulates that women must cover themselves in public. The video appears to show three women dancing exuberantly to the hit on Tehran rooftops, sans headress. The move comes a perplexing time since just recently Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke publicly in support of loosening the state's cencorship of the internet. 'We ought to see (the Internet) as an opportunity. We must recognise our citizens' right to connect to the World Wide Web,' said Rouhani according to the official IRNA news agency. The young people were publicly shamed as their interrogation was aired on Iranian television along with clips of their video . Veiled: The three women from the video were seen veiled in the interrogation footage . 'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia . 'Why are we so shaky? Why have we cowered in a corner, grabbing onto a shield and a wooden sword, lest we take a bullet in this culture war?' he said in his weekend speech. In a interview with IranWire last month prior to the arrests, one of the women explained that the video was meant as a celebration of Iran and to show that young people there have fun like they do anywhere. 'Despite all the pressures and limitations,' she said, 'young people are joyful and want to make the situation better. They know how to have fun, like the rest of the world.'","Everyone featured in the video has been let go except for the director, human rights advocates in Iran tweeted Wednesday .

Kerri Kasem told The View on Thursday that the bitter feud between her father's second wife Jean and his three children from his first marriage had deepened. She said that her father's remains were still in Washington despite the fact that his wish was to be buried in Glendale, California. Scroll down for video . Kerri Kasem told The View on Thursday that her father Casey Kasem had not been buried following his June 15 death due to an ongoing feud between his children and second wife . Dispute: Mike, Kerri, and Julie Kasem (left - right, with their father Casey second from right in 2003) argue that his wife removed him from a care home towards the end of his life, causing a bedsore which contributed to his death . Miss Kasem said: 'I don't know what's going on with [Jean] and why she makes the decisions she does.' Widow Jean Kasem has accused the DJ's children of making a desperate grab for his life insurance following his death. Battle: Casey's widow Jean has accused his children of trying to get their hands on the former DJ's life insurance following his death earlier this month . Mrs Kasem . accused his daughter Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how . quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could . be cashed out. However, . Kerri has hit back, saying that Jean hasn't had Casey body flown out to . L.A. for burial yet because she is trying to deflect attention from an . imminent investigation into elderly abuse. Kerri Kasem also told The View that she could not remember why the feud had started. She said: 'If I knew I would tell you. I would try and make amends. I would say, ''I'm sorry Jean. What happened? ... Why do you hate us so much?''' Mr Kasem died on June 15 - Father's Day -  aged 82 from Parkinson's disease, dementia and sepsis. Kerri Kasem claimed Jean took him out of his rest home and moved him . around the U.S. at the end of his life to keep him away from family. During the trip he developed a bedsore which contributed to his death, his children have claimed. Jean is now arguing that the whole saga is a ploy by his children to get their hands on his money. According to TMZ, . Jean said: 'Their impatience for Casey to die was obvious... and now . their impatience to collect on the life insurance is even more telling.' The DJ's eldest children held a memorial service for him last weekend, attended by 200 people including his brother, but excluding Jean and her daughter Liberty, who she had with Casey. Jean has put Casey's Beverly Hills mansion, complete with eight bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, tennis courts, and a piece of the Brooklyn bridge, on the market for $42million. According to reports, . Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ after his . daughter Kerri agreed to her request to hand over his remains. Kerri . Kasem had been granted custody last month over her father’s medical . care, but that role expired when her father died on Father's Day morning. An attorney for Kerri told TMZ that Jean's attorney had reached out to request the body be released to her. The pair didn’t speak directly. According to a recent filing of Casey's health directive he wanted a burial. Jean Casem will act as the executor of Casey's will. His death was announced on social media by his children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem. The message didn't include the name of . his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly . court battle over his medical treatment. 'Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,' the message read. 'Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken. 'Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad. With love, Kerri, Mike and Julie.' Kasem died in a Washington hospital at 3.23am, spokesman Danny Deraney said in a statement. In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia. Kasey Kasem's widow put his Beverly Hills mansion up for sale for $12million. The 12,000 square foot mansion also has eight bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and a piece of the Brooklyn bridge . A judge in May temporarily stripped his wife of her caretaker role after she moved him from a medical facility in Los Angeles to a friend's home in Washington state. Jean Kasem said she moved her husband to protect his privacy and to consult with doctors. Casey Kasem developed a severe bedsore while in Washington and was in critical condition by the time he was hospitalized in early June. Kasem's transportation to Washington posed serious risks. 'She disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration,' Dr. Paul Leitner said in documents obtained by the paper. 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr. Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.' Jean Kasem had objected to a Wednesday ruling in a Los Angeles Superior Court that stopped her husband from being given food and drink over concerns it might be painful for him. 'Right now, Casey Kasem's health is declining and (he) won't be with us much longer,' Danny Deraney said in a June 6 statement. Casey Kasem is seen with wife Jean Kasem and his children (from left) Kerri Kasem, Michael Kasem and Julie Kasem . During . temporary conservator Kerri Kasem's visit to see her father on June 1 in . Washington state, Jean Kasem threw meat at her as he was preparing for a . trip to the hospital. 'In . the name of King David, I threw a piece of raw meat into the street in . exchange for my husband to the wild rabid dogs,' she told NBC News. Kasem became famous as the voice of American Top 40, and his career there began on July 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, when the No. 1 song was Three Dog Night's cover of Randy Newman's Mama Told Me Not to Come. The show expanded to hundreds of stations, including Armed Forces Radio, and continued in varying forms - and for varying syndicators - into the 21st century. He stepped down from American Top 40 in 2004 and retired altogether in 2009, completing his musical journey with Shinedown's 'Second Chance.' While many DJs convulsed their listeners with stunts and 'morning zoo' snarkiness, Kasem would read 'long distance dedications' of songs sent in by readers and introduce countdown records with sympathetic background anecdotes about the singers. 'The idea . from the beginning was to do the type of thing on radio that Ed Sullivan . did on television, good, honest stories with human interest,' he told . the Los Angeles Times in 1975. Kasem's . legacy reached well beyond music. His voice was heard in TV cartoons . such as 'Scooby-Doo' as the voice of Shaggy and in numerous commercials. 'They . are going to be playing Shaggy and Scooby-Doo for eons and eons,' Kasem . told The New York Times in 2004. 'And they're going to forget Casey . Kasem - unless they happen to step on his star on the Hollywood Walk of . Fame. I'll be one of those guys people say ""Who's that?"" about. And . someone else will say, ""He's just some guy who used to be on the . radio.''' Succeeding Kasem at the main American Top 40 show in 2004 was multi-platform star Ryan Seacrest, who has said he had been a fan of Kasem since boyhood and would imitate him in pretend countdown broadcasts at age 9.","Casey Kasem's remains have not been buried following his death on June 15, his daughter Kerri said on Thursday .

'Through the trip it was just amazing to go through so many different states and just see the diversity of the landscape, the countryside - it's huge,' she replied. 'I love it - It's very friendly, very welcoming.  And we felt that the entire way.  And the scenery was incredible.  And I think that what lifted our spirits when it really hurt, sort of grinding on the bike, was to see everything around us.

'When I say everyone, I literally mean everyone loves this bike - from the young ones to the elderly.' The 52-year-old, a tractor driver at a nearby agricultural firm, has been using his extreme wood-whittling skills to create vehicles for the last decade. After honing his skills with three wooden pushbikes, the craftsman tried his hand at a chopper, but the bike fell flat due to the puny 50cc engine it had installed. But refusing to be daunted, Istvan went on to create a wooden motorcycle with a 200cc engine and a fully-functioning wooden car.

"By . Margot Peppers . The popular blogger behind Instagram handle The Blonde Vegan has opened up about how her obsession with following a plant-based diet has led to a dangerous eating disorder. After launching her Instagram account in June 2013, New Yorker Jordan Younger, now 23, quickly amassed 70,000 followers who turned to her for inspiration, recipes and diet advice. But a year later, after she stopped getting her period and began constantly feeling lethargic, Jordan realized her passion for veganism and healthy eating had turned into an unhealthy obsession. Dangerous habits: Jordan Younger, the popular blogger behind Instagram handle The Blonde Vegan, has opened up about how her obsession with following a plant-based diet led to a dangerous eating disorder . 'Food was not enjoyable anymore,' 5ft 4in Jordan, who weighed just 105lbs at her lowest point, told People. 'I was spending the entire day obsessing about eating . only vegetables, green juices, fruits and occasionally nuts and grains,' she added. 'I was following thousands of rules in my head that were making me sick.' Jordan was suffering from what doctors call 'orthorexia' - a 'fixation on righteous eating' which causes people to 'become consumed with what and how much to eat, and how to deal with ""slip-ups,""' according to the National Eating Disorders Association. While she . says that Instagram isn't wholly to blame, Jordan acknowledges that she . might have come to terms with her problem more easily if it weren't for her . internet presence as a vegan. Large audience: After launching her Instagram account in June 2013, the New Yorker, now 23, quickly amassed 70,000 followers who turned to her for inspiration, recipes and diet advice . Restrictive eating: But her passion soon became an unhealthy obsession. 'I was spending the entire day obsessing,' she said. 'I was following thousands of rules in my head that were making me sick' 'My blog . made it hard for me to see that I had an eating disorder,' she said. 'If I wasn't so . closely tied to the vegan identity I'd given myself, I would have . realized it a lot sooner.' 'I was following thousands of rules in my head that were making me sick' She added: 'I think labels - as far as diet choices - are very, very dangerous. I'm a prime example of that.' As it was, it took bad skin, low energy levels and the loss of her period for Jordan to finally seek advice. And after speaking to a friend who was recovering from an eating disorder, she saw too many similarities to ignore. Video Source www.gosweetandskinny.com . Label: 'My blog made it hard for me to see that I had an eating disorder,' she said. 'If I wasn't so closely tied to the vegan identity I'd given myself, I would have realized it a lot sooner' Red flags: She suffered low energy, bad skin and vitamin and protein deficiency. What's more, she stopped having her period for several months . Jordan's fears that her strict vegan lifestyle may have done more harm than good were confirmed when she decided to try eating a wild salmon - her first taste of fish in a year and a half. Two days later, her period returned - sure sign that the fish had been what her body needed. So on June 23 of this year, Jordan posted a blog entry called Why I Am Transitioning Away From Veganism, explaining to her fans that she had become deficient in vitamins and protein, and would have to start eating eggs and fish to get her hormones back in balance. She explained that she did not blame veganism for the disordered eating habits she developed, writing: 'Those who read this blog know that I have a very extreme personality, and the combination of my personality with the restriction of an entirely plant-based diet pushed me over the edge.' Transition: On June 23, Jordan explained to her fans that she had developed disordered eating habits and health problems, and would have to start eating eggs and fish to get her hormones back in balance . New lifestyle: 'Plants are amazing!' wrote Jordon, who now goes by 'The Balanced Blonde'. 'But that's not ALL that is out there. Some of us need more... especially those of us with extreme ""all or nothing"" personalities' Despite her honest approach, Jordan lost thousands of 'hardcore vegan' followers and even received death threats for changing her dietary ways. 'If I wasn't so closely tied to the vegan identity, I would have realized a lot sooner that I had an eating disorder' Nevertheless, she decided to continue posting under the new username 'The Balanced Blonde'. 'Plants are amazing!' she wrote. 'Vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and legumes are beautiful foods from the earth and should be incorporated into as many meals as possible throughout the day. 'But that's not ALL that is out there. Some of us need more in order to fuel or bodies properly - especially those of us with extreme ""all or nothing"" personalities like my own.'","Jordan Younger, 23, suffered from orthorexia- a 'fixation on righteous eating' which causes people to 'become consumed with what and how much to eat'

"By . Louise Boyle . An autopsy has revealed that a married father was drunk when he shot his wife and children and set the family's house on fire before killing himself. Darrin Campbell had a blood-alcohol level of 0.11 at the time of his death in a $1.6 million rented Tampa home belonging to retired tennis player James Blake. Campbell, 49, shot his 51-year-old wife Kimberly and children - 18-year-old Collin and 16-year-old Megan - on May 7, Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputies said. Scroll down for video . An autopsy report revealed today that Darrin Campbell, left, was drunk when he shot wife, Kimberly, right, in the head with his .40-caliber handgun in Florida. He killed his two children in the same way . Colin Campbell, 18 (left), was a well-known member of the varsity baseball team and attended the exclusive and private Carrollwood Day School with his sister, Megan, 15 (right) Autopsy reports revealed that his wife . and children were each shot once in the head. There was no soot in their . airways, indicating they died before Campbell set fire to the home. Authorities said Campbell bought a .40-caliber handgun and $600 in fireworks in the weeks before the shootings, according to The Tampa Tribune. Campbell, . 49, who had no criminal record or history of mental illness and was . described as being part of what looked to be 'the perfect suburban . family', spent days preparing for the murder-suicide on Wednesday, . buying fireworks and cans of gasoline that would destroy his rented . Florida mansion. Retired tennis star James Blake said last month he didn't know the family who died in the Florida home they were renting from him. Fire: The blaze was so ferocious on May 7 that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day . Blake said his only contact with Darrin . Campbell was 'a few emails for the lease agreement'. He said he never . met any of the family face-to-face. He told reporters at a tennis event that his thoughts and prayers were with the family, and he hoped police would keep him updated on their investigation. According to reports in The Tampa Bay Times, Campbell - who was leasing the five-bedroom home in Avila, known for its luxurious mansions and heavy security - had recently displayed some odd behavior, in terms of his finances and his career. In February 2006, Darrin and Kimberly Campbell bought a vacant lot in Odessa for $294,000. In March . 2011, the local property owners' association placed a lien on the lot . for unpaid association fees totaling $8,000, which were apparently paid . by February 2012. Retired tennis star James Blake has said that he didn't know the family who died last week in the Florida home they were renting from him . In . both 2008 and 2012, Darrin Campbell was delinquent in paying his . property taxes on the lot, though the taxes, totaling about $7,800, were . eventually paid. Taxes on the property for 2013 have not been paid. 'We . are conducting a financial audit on him to determine if there were some . financial issues,'Hillsborough County sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski . said. 'We do know that he was working up to a point but recently had taken some time off."" Campbell took last week off from his job at VASTEC, the digital records company. Last Monday, a VASTEC spokesman said, he requested a leave of absence 'for unspecified reasons', which the company approved. The . gun Campbell used in the murders and suicide was a .40-caliber Sig . Sauer, a popular handgun he bought in July 2013 at Shooters World, a . store and gun range on Fletcher Avenue. Bruce . Kitzis, the store's general manager, said Campbell's only visit there . was to buy the gun, and that he passed a federally mandated background . check before purchasing the weapon. 'It was (about) a year ago, was the only time he came in. We did the background check and everything was fine,' Kitzis said. Watch Video Here: . Sinister: . Fireworks were found strewn around the house and police say an . accelerant - probably the gas canisters he bought - were used to start . the blaze last month . It's unfortunate. We at Shooters World did everything we could, of course. There are so many wonderful gun owners. It's a tragedy.' Campbell also bought a large number of fireworks and gas cans, which was caught on CCTV. He then made two purchases of gasoline from different stores. Family members said the Campbells had a 'strong marriage'. The firecrackers seen in Campbell's shopping cart in the video were reportedly used to start a fire in his home on May 7 after he allegedly shot dead his family . Campbell's mother Mary said they had 'everything to live for' and were a perfect family. The investigation is to focus on Campbell's financial situation. Local realtors estimated Campbell would have been paying $6,000 a month to rent out the 5,000 sq ft home from former tennis star James Blake. The family moved into the rented home so that the children could be near to their private school after selling their previous $750,000 home for a profit. He also had school fees for son Colin,19, and daughter Megan,16, of more than $35,000 a year. Meanwhile, a surveillance video was released showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts placing stacks of fireworks into a shopping cart at Phantom Fireworks.","Darrin Campbell, 49, had a blood-alcohol .

"By . Margot Peppers . Taco Bell has announced plans to beef up its menu - literally - with a whole new variety of high-protein items based on the on-trend Paleo diet. Each of the burritos and bowls on the new Cantina Power Menu will contain more than 20 grams of protein, double the serving of meat and less than 500 calories altogether, appealing to diners who swear by low-carb dieting. The change, according to Taco Bell president Brian Niccol, is in keeping with current food trends in the U.S. 'People are not looking for diet food,' he said in a statement. 'They want food that gives them energy.' Packing a punch: Taco Bell has announced plans to launch a new high-protein Cantina Power Menu based on the Paleo diet, with burritos and bowls packing twice the amount of steak and chicken . The new Cantina Power Menu, which will include a $5.19 steak Power Bowl and a $4.99 chicken bowl, will be introduced to Taco Bell restaurants across the country on July 17. Not only will the menu items contain more protein - with 29 grams in burritos and 28 grams in bowls - but high-calorie toppings like creamy dressing and rice and beans will be replaced with low-fat options, like cheese and sour cream. The choices will also be loaded with guacamole, Pico de Gallo and lettuce. And the fast food chain is even getting in on the Greek yogurt trend; with the new menu, customers will be able to order yogurts from boutique supplier Three Happy Cows, for $2.49 each. 'People are not looking for diet food - they want food that gives them energy' 'There are . lots of yogurt parfaits out there, so we asked ourselves what would get . people excited about yogurt at Taco Bell,' said Mr Niccol. 'And the . answer is Greek yogurt.' Judging . by current eating trends, Taco Bell can expect the new menu to be . popular; a recent report from the NPD group found that 42per cent of . millenials say that eating more protein is somewhat or very important. And . according to Euromonitor, sales of protein supplements have grown more . than 40per cent in the past six years, with experts predicting that they . will grow another 40per cent by 2018. New meals: High-calorie toppings like creamy dressing and rice and beans will be replaced with low-fat options, like cheese and sour cream. Each item will be under 500 calories (pictured, the Doritos Locos tacos) The Paleo . or Paleolithic diet, which has been lauded by celebrities including Uma . Therman, Jessica Biel and Megan Fox, is focused on only eating foods . that were available to cavemen 10,000 years ago. This means cutting out refined foods, trans fat and dairy, with an emphasis on lean fats, fresh vegetables and nuts and seeds.

Last month, Chinese scientists . determined that eating as little as one chicken breast or salmon fillet every . day can reduce the risk of stroke by 20per cent. 'An . estimated 1.4million stroke deaths could be prevented worldwide each . year by higher protein consumption,' explained lead researcher Dr . Xinfeng Liu, from Nanjing University School of Medicine. To appeal to the country's current protein craze, other chains and brands have amended their ingredients - including Panera, Cheerios and Kashi. But some . experts have warned that we may have taken it to the extreme; according . to the Institute of Medicine, women should consume about 46 grams of . protein a day, and men should consume 56. But a recent report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that men over 20 get an average of 98.9 grams of protein a day, and women eat about 68 grams.","The new Cantina Power menu, featuring steak and chicken burritos and bowls with at least 20 grams of protein, will launch on July 17 ."

"By . Michael Zennie . After crossing the border into Texas, illegal immigrants face a long, dangerous trip through hot desert scrub brush before reaching civilization. Not all of them make it. On Monday, the remains of one immigrant was found under a mesquite tree on a ranch near Falfurrias, Texas. A Breitbart Texas reporter was present as a local sheriff's deputy arrived to oversee the scene. The body was found picked apart by wild animals. The skull was ten feet away from the rest of the body. Horrific: The skull of an illegal immigrant was found ten feet from the rest of his body after it was picked apart by wild animals . The remains were found under a mesquite tree on a remote part of a ranch in rural Brooks County in South Texas . The body was one of 41 already discovered this year in rural Brooks County, a rural area of South Texas that is 944 square miles and home to just 7,200 people. There were 12 found in June alone. One sheriff's deputy says only one in ten immigrants who die crossing the border are ever found. This body was discovered by workers on Cage Ranch outside Falfurrias. Another illegal immigrant told Border Patrol officers about finding the remains, according to Breitbart. The Brooks County Sheriff's Office confirmed to MailOnline that officers discovered a body believed to be an illegal immigrant at the ranch on Monday. The Border Patrol searched and discovered the body under a tree - a 30-minute drive up a winding, rough dirt road. Authorities said immigrants usually die from a combination of heat exhaustion and thirst. It's not yet clear what happened to the person who was found in Falfurrias this week. The remains of more than 160 migrants were found in a mass grave in Falfurrias. The immigrants were all found dead across the county . Authorities say the immigrants are often lied to by the coyotes who help smuggle them across the border. The traffickers often tell immigrants they have just a short hike to meet people who will help them get settled in the U.S. Instead, they are in for miles and miles of trekking through the desert. The deaths of so many immigrants puts a financial strain on tiny Brooks County, which is also one of the poorest in Texas. For each one found, the country must spent $2,500 for the medical examiner to review the remains and for a funeral home to bury them. In recent years, a mass grave was found in Falfurrias - with remains haphazardly buried - some in plastic shopping bags, others piled with several bodies on top of each other. Authorities are investigating a local funeral home over allegations it mishandled the burial of more than 160 migrants.","Body is one of 42 discovered in Brooks County, Texas, so far this year .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A junior footballer has been banned for seven years by FA bosses after allegedly wiping spit on a referee's back. Jake Schofield, 15, reportedly spat on his hand and smeared it on the official at the end of a game between his side Moston Valley and Failsworth West Juniors in Manchester. He was reported to Manchester FA and was stunned to later find out he had been banned from playing football until August 2021. Banned: Jake Schofield, 15, has been banned from football for seven years after allegedly wiping spit on the referee's back at the end of a game between Moston Valley and Failsworth West Juniors in Manchester . The punishment is six years and eight months longer than Luis Suarez got for biting the shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. The disgraced Uruguay striker was banned from football for four months - as well as nine internationals - following the incident during the 80th minute of this year's World Cup clash. It also much worse than Raul Meireles's 11-game ban for spitting at a referee while playing for the Turkish side Fenerbahce in December 2012. Yesterday, Jake, a centre-back from Harpurhey, said: 'The length of the punishment is well over the top when you compare it to the ban Suarez got for biting or Raul Meireles got.' Bite: The ban is six years and eight months longer than Luis Suarez got for biting Italian player Giorgio Chiellini . The footballer, a student at Manchester . Communication Academy, denied wiping spit on the referee's back, and claimed the official had . misunderstood his actions at the final whistle. 'We’d had a few words during the game and at the final whistle I didn’t really want to shake his hand but my manager told me to go and do it,' he said. 'As I walked over I spat on the floor which I admit disrespected him and he said he wouldn’t shake my hand as I’d just spat on it. I told him I hadn’t and as he turned away I patted him on the shoulder.' Stunned: Jake has played junior football since the age of five with a clean disciplinary record . Jake, who has played junior football since the age of five with a clean disciplinary record, was suspended three weeks after the incident on April 1. He was later found guilty of assault on a match official and improper conduct against a match official. According to the notice of suspension on the Manchester FA website, Jake is banned from all football activities, including management, for 2,562 days until August 8, 2021. However, after being contacted by the Manchester Evening News, bosses at the governing body have now said they will launch an investigation into the decision. Manchester FA chief executive, Colin Bridgford, said the sanction would be reviewed, pending an appeal from Jake. 'Clearly, this is a case that needs to be investigated in terms of the charge, the process, the panel and the sanction,' he said. 'It does not appear to be in line with other cases in terms of consistency or fairness.' Manchester FA's discipline officer could not be contacted. It is understood she has taken long-term leave since the decision was made. The maximum penalty for assault on a match official in junior football is a lifetime ban. But it is thought the charge could be reduced on appeal to improper conduct against a match official, which carries a maximum suspension of 10 games.","Jake Schofield, 15, allegedly spat on hand and wiped it on referee's back .

The 6.8-magnitude quake hit six miles below the sea surface off the coast of Fukushima in northern Japan at 4.22am (7.22pm Friday GMT). The force injured a 68-year-old woman who reportedly fell down the stairs and broke her leg, as well as shaking buildings in Tokyo, around 120 miles away. Earthquake: A powerful earthquake today struck near the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant - triggering a small tsunami. The magnitude 6.8 quake hit six miles below the sea surface off the coast of Fukushima . It also sparked a small tsunami, which reached the coast of Ishinomaki Ayukawa and Ofunato about 50 minutes after the quake. Smaller waves were observed at several other locations along the coast, but changes to the shoreline were not visible on television footage aired by public broadcaster NHK. Eight towns which were devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami issued evacuation advisories to thousands of households along the coast, along with schools and community centres. These included Rikuzentakata, Higashi Matsushima and Otsuchi. Crippled: The Fukushima Dai-ichi plant (pictured) was devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami .

The shocking advice, featured in an article entitled 'Ten Charm Rules', was published in the glossy magazine's supplement, Teen Tatler. It advises teenagers to buy presents and 'flirt gently' with their friends' parents if they wish to be invited to 'swanky' holidays, dinners and country weekends. Shocking: Society bible Tatler has come under fire after encouraging children as young as 13 to flirt with their friends' fathers. Above, the magazine advises teenagers to buy gifts and 'flirt gently' with their friends' parents . Reader: Poppy Dinsey described the feature as 'Teen Tatler basically saying flirt with dads to get free holidays' And it even goes so far to claim that the 'big secret to getting on in life' is to make other people's parents like you. The article tells readers who are staying over at their friend's house to take a 'cunning present' - such as Prestat Rose & Violet Crèmes, which sell for £11.50 a box - for their parents. It adds: 'At some point . take half an hour out to flirt (gently) with the parent of the opposite . sex and then write a witty thank-you letter — bingo, you're a winner. 'Soon, . word will get out and you'll be invited everywhere — dinners, more . country weekends, swanky holidays and so on, and so on... Outrage: Rachel Jobes hit out at the article on social-networking site Twitter, saying: 'No words! #shocking' 'Another gem': Sam Wolfson retweeted an image of the piece, saying: 'Another gem from Teen Tatler' 'Think of it . as essential homework for life. Hone your social-seduction techniques . now and those same tools will serve you handsomely for ever.' But the tenth lesson warns readers: 'Don't be a creep', adding: 'There is a fine line.' Yesterday, Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming condemned the article, published in April, saying it was 'going down territory you shouldn't be going down'. DO flirt with your friend's parents to secure invitations to 'swanky' holidays, dinners and country weekends. DO give your friend's parents thank-you letters and 'cunning' presents, such as boxes of expensive chocolates. DON'T be intolerant to food or insist on a 'no carb' diet. DON'T wear improper shoes, such as 'fetid' Nike Airs or a 'yellowing' pair of Supergas. DON'T be creepy. The Brimingham Yardley MP told The Times: 'It's . not really the sort of thing they should be encouraging. 'Being nice and polite is one . thing, trying to create a sexual frisson between your friend's parents . and your teenage self is at the very least ill-advised. 'I'm . surprised that Tatler wish to encourage it.' Twitter users also hit out at the piece, which goes on to advise children on how to eat - 'no intolerances or nocarb nonsense' - how to write a thank-you letter and what shoes to wear. Poppy Dinsey described the feature as 'Teen Tatler basically saying flirt with dads to get free holidays', while Sam Wolfson added: 'Another gem from Teen Tatler.' Rachel Jobes said: 'Flirt with friends' fathers to get on, No words! #shocking', and Emma-Louise Trooter wrote: 'I don't have enough words to suitably describe my disgust.' Meanwhile, a user named Cathy simply said: 'I am speechless.' Tatler magazine, founded in 1709 and relaunched in 1901, is renowned for its coverage of high society and aristocratic events. Criticism: Lib Dem MP John Hemming said the article was 'going down territory you shouldn't be going down' It has been criticised in the past for an article entitled 'Best Society Breasts', which contained photographs of 28 wealthy women. Kate Reardon, 42, was appointed the 17th editor of the magazine in 2010. A Tatler spokesman told MailOnline: 'If the Tatler feature is read in its entirety it is clear that we intended it to be light-hearted.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . On trial: Monika Antosik allegedly arranged for estate agent Alexander Kucharski, 86, from Warsaw, Poland, to be killed so she could steal his money . A glamorous Polish accountant arranged for a millionaire client to be killed with the help of two teenagers so she could steal his money, a court heard today. Monika Antosik, 31, allegedly ordered Grzegorz Ostrowski, 19, to carry out the murder of wealthy 86-year-old estate agent Alexander Kucharski. With the help of a 15-year-old girl, the teenager reportedly killed the pensioner at his house in Warsaw, Poland, before chopping up his body. The pair then hid his remains in a suitcase and set it alight in a nearby forest, it is alleged. Antosik is believed to have used the tips and knowledge she had gained during her previous job as a prison officer to arrange the killing. Now, she has gone on trial at a Polish court charged with one count of murder. The court heard that Antosik had hatched the murderous plan after discovering Mr Kucharski was worth several million euros. With her in-depth knowledge of various crimes, she felt the plan was a 'get rich quick' scheme that could not fail, it was alleged. She therefore reportedly coaxed Ostrowski into breaking into the pensioner's house and killing him. Ostrowski, in turn, persuaded the unnamed teenage girl to help him and after murdering Mr Kucharski, they allegedly chopped up his body and hid the remains in a suitcase. They then dumped the case in a nearby wood, before returning and setting fire to it two weeks later, the court heard. The horrific crime was only discovered after Polish police found Mr Kucharski's charred remains buried in the forest, and started searching for his killers. Anna Zeromska, prosecuting, told the court: 'The woman had prepared a very precise plan, the motive for which was the acquisition of the victim's property. Ex-prison officer: The 31-year-old (pictured left and right) used the knowledge she had gained during her former job as a prison officer to arrange the killing, a court heard. She went on trial today charged with murder . 'Following the murder, she was ready to implement the next part of the plan and preliminary findings suggest she was preparing false documents including fake legal papers.' Police arrested Antosik after it emerged the drafted legal documents connecting the accountant and her client had been forged. If convicted of murder, the blonde accountant faces life in prison. Capital: Grzegorz Ostrowski, 19, and a 15-year-old girl allegedly killed Mr Kucharski at his house in Warsaw (pictured). They then reportedly chopped up his body, before putting his remains in a suitcase and burning it . Ostrowski and the 15-year-old girl have also been charged with murder. The girl will have to appeal before a Juvenile Court. The trial continues.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . For most dogs, going for walks on grass, chewing on bones and eating dog food are part of daily life. But for Ruby the black Labrador this isn't the case - because she is allergic to being a dog. The three-year-old, from Edinburgh, has allergies to meat, milk, dust mites and some types of grass. Allergic to life: Ruby the Labrador, pictured with her 27-year-old owner Karen Stanfield, is allergic to being a dog . She is forced to eat homemade vegetarian meals instead of normal dog food - and even takes the drug Piriton to keep her sneezing and spluttering at bay. She is also required to jump in lakes, rivers and puddles to wash off stray blades of grass every time she ventures outdoors. Ruby's owner Karen Stanfield, 27, who keeps her house spotlessly clean for her pet's sake, said: 'People are always wondering what I feed my dog and when I explain they say: ""How can a dog be allergic to all the things that dogs normally love?"".

Puppy: She is forced to eat homemade vegetarian meals instead of dog food - and even takes the drug Piriton . Ruby’s unusual allergies emerged last year when she began suffering from constant stomach upsets, sneezing and fatigue. Unlike a normal 18-month-old Labrador puppy, she refused to play or go for walks and started to lose weight, despite eating all the food she was given. Ms Stanfield, a dog trainer and owner of Karen's Dogs, was mystified and tried everything from dog treats to coaxing Ruby out on walks to try to get her back to her usual self.

Playing around: Unlike a normal 18-month-old Labrador puppy, she refused to play or go for walks and started to lose weight, despite eating all the food she was given.

It was only when Ruby's vet carried out an Avacta sensitest, a special blood test for allergies specifically designed for pets, that her owner found allergies were the cause of her problems. Following diagnosis, Ruby was placed on a strict vegetarian diet, excluding dog food and bones. Now, Ms Stanfield cooks food from scratch every day to make sure no allergens contaminate the meals, as well as hoovering her house from top to bottom to ensure dust mites can’t thrive. Diagnosis: Ms Stanfield (pictured, left, with Ruby) discovered that allergies were the cause of her pet's problems after her vet carried out an Avacta sensitest. Right, Ruby is allergic to certain types of grass .

'She didn’t want to play and had a stomach upset solidly for three months. She only weighed 55lbs but she lost 15lbs. 'You could see all of her ribs - it was like I wasn’t feeding her even though I was trying desperately to keep her healthy. She looked like a neglected dog, as if she was starving, and I couldn’t find the cause. Strict diet: Following diagnosis, Ruby was placed on a strict vegetarian diet, excluding dog food and bones . 'Even though I’m a positive reinforcement dog trainer I couldn’t work out why Ruby was so lethargic and unhappy. She was miserable and so was I. 'It wasn’t until Ruby’s vet did the sensitest that we realised it was allergies causing all her problems.' She added: 'Ruby ate vegetarian food for a year and I’ve just started reintroducing turkey and pork back into her diet as she’s not allergic to those.'","Ruby the Labrador is allergic to meat, milk, dust mites and types of grass .

The international event, featuring 198 riders, was launched by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry this afternoon. Forecaster Simon Partridge, of the Met Office, said today would see a 'mixture of sunshine and showers' across most of the country, particularly in the South-East, with temperatures in the late teens.

The wet weather is not set to improve anytime soon - with further downpours expected tomorrow and throughout next week. 'Monday and Tuesday will again see a . mixture of sunshine and showers, but perhaps quite not as many as on . previous days,' said Mr Partridge. 'Wednesday . will be a little bit drier, with temperatures around average for this . time of year, but it will still not be anything like the weather we have . recently had.'

But despite the rain, Britain's Jenson Button, of McLaren Mercedes, still managed to qualify third for tomorrow's Grand Prix, which will involve 52 laps around the 3.66-mile circuit. Germany's Nico Rosberg, of Mercedes, scooped the pole position, while Germany's Sebastian Vettel, of Red Bull, finished second. However, Hamilton blew his chance of securing pole position for the Grand Prix after he . inexplicably aborted his final run in this afternoon's dramatic qualifying session. Better weather: But cycling enthusiasts in Yorkshire were treated to sunshine and dry weather as the opening stage of the Tour de France got underway in Leeds . The racer appeared set to secure his . second pole in as many years in front of his home crowd at the track, which was home to the very first F1 world championship round in 1950. But . as his title rival Nico Rosberg snatched the pole in the final moments, . Hamilton chose to bail out on his final lap, seemingly confident he had . done enough to start Sunday's race from the front of the pack. The . final sector of the track had however dried out, with not only Rosberg . going faster than the Briton, but four other drivers, meaning Hamilton . will only start sixth at Silverstone on Sunday.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . For the price of just £125, they bought an acre of land on which to build their first home. Sixty years on, Rhys and Audrey Probert are still living on the plot - and it is now worth £350,000. Mr Probert, now 82, was just 22 when he bought the expanse of land in the village of Osbaston, Monmouthshire, to make a home with his then-fiancée. Couple: Rhys Probert (pictured with his wife, Audrey) was just 22 when he paid £125 for an acre of land  in the village of Osbaston, Monmouthshire. He then spent a further £1,000 building a bungalow for him and Audrey . Renovated: When it was built, the modest bungalow featured only one bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and no carpet nor central heating. But now, it has been transformed into a 2,570sq ft home (above) worth £350,000 . Pool: Over the past six decades, the Proberts have extended and added to the property. Above, the couple are pictured at a younger age with their children in a swimming pool that they built at the back of the bungalow . He then spent a further £1,000 - all he could afford - building a modest bungalow, featuring only one bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and no carpet nor central heating . But over the past six decades, he and his wife have transformed the property into a 2,570 sq ft home, with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a conservatory and even a swimming pool. Today, Mrs Probert, 80, said the couple had worked 'night and day' to create their perfect home. “It really is the house that love built,' said the grandmother-of-four. Perfect: Mrs Probert, 80, said she and her husband had worked 'night and day' to create their perfect home .

Active: Grandmother-of-four Mrs Probert is pictured with her husband on a hike (left) and surfing (right) 'We have spent 60 happy years making memories in this house and will stay here until the end of our days.' Mr Probert, a retired postman, added: 'We have come an awful long way from the home we first built. 'We had no carpets, no central heating, we had quarry tiles on the floor that were cold as ice. 'There was a tiny kitchen and bathroom and one bedroom. The whole house was probably just 64 square metres. Trasnformed Mr Probert, a retired postman, said: 'We have come a long way from the home we first built' Luxury: The couple's outdoor swimming pool is a far cry from the first home they built together in 1950 . 'Then as we got more established in our jobs and as we settled down to have children we slowly started to expand.' Now, the couple's house is worth a whopping £350,000 - more than 300 times what they originally paid to build it - based on the sales of similar local properties. Mrs Probert said: 'All those years ago it cost us £1,000 in building materials and labour to put the house up in its original state. 'That was a lot of money then but it wouldn’t get you much today. Garden: The couple's house is worth a whopping £350,000 - more than 300 times what they originally paid to build it - based on the sales of similar local properties. Above, part of the property's garden . 'We later extended to make room for our first child in 1962 so there was a nursery. “As our family grew so did the house. By 1969 we had two children and an outdoor swimming pool for them to play in.' As the years passed and their children flew the nest Audrey and Rhys decided to sell part of their land to reduce their workload in the garden and free up some finances so they could travel. 'We stay very active but an acre of land was an awful lot to maintain,' said Mrs Probert. 'About 10 years ago we decided to sell half of our plot to a builder. We used the money to go to Australia and Rhys completed 2 A levels in German and Art. Proud: The Proberts said their home has remained 'modest and comfortable and filled with happy memories' 'Soon the builder finished developing the land and the end result was a spectacular house which sold for £600,000. 'Over the years this area had become quite affluent and our little hamlet is now a desirable address. 'It’s wonderful that we are still here after all these years. When we first moved in there was nothing for miles around, just fields and trees.' 'It’s a very different world now but our home has stayed the same -  modest and comfortable and filled with happy memories.'","Rhys Probert, now 82, and wife Audrey, 80, bought an acre of land for £125 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Denise Clark, 34, arranged her own funeral and wrote goodbye letters to her two young sons after being told she had terminal cancer . A mother has spoken of the 'absolute hell' she endured after being wrongly told for two years she had terminal cancer. Denise Clark, 34,  arranged her own funeral and wrote heartbreaking goodbye letters to her sons after she was told the disease would claim her life. After being given the prognosis at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, she also spent £10,000 attending an alternative therapy clinic in Spain. She hoped the treatment there would extend her life, giving her more time with her two young boys before she died. But as the months passed and she continued to feel well, she became suspicious and eventually demanded another scan. To her total shock, the results revealed the growth in her pelvis was not cancerous - but internal damage from previous cancer treatment she'd undergone. Ms Clarke has now settled a claim for a high five-figure sum after she took action against NHS Grampian. She said she hoped no-one else would ever endure the nightmare ordeal her family went through. 'I planned my funeral and wrote farewell notes to my boys. It was heartbreaking but I had to do it for my family. No one should have to do that if they don’t need to. 'Hearing them say it was a mistake was amazing  - but it doesn’t give us back the two years of our lives that were made absolute hell.' Ms Clarke's ordeal began in 2009 when she suffered bleeding, nine weeks into her pregnancy with son Luca, now four. When she finally got an appointment for tests nearly six months later, in January 2010,  she received the devastating news she had cervical cancer. With the disease spreading, Luca was delivered at 33 weeks so Ms Clarke could start treatment as soon as possible. She went on to beat the disease but in November 2011 she was told she had a huge, cancerous mass in her pelvis and there was nothing more doctors could do. 'They said I'd already had as much radiation as I could have in a lifetime,' she said. 'There was an option for some more chemo - which might buy me some time - but I wanted my boys to remember me how I was, and not rotting away on a couch. 'I was absolutely devastated. We just weren't expecting it at all.' Desperate, she researched alternative treatments and booked herself into a special clinic in Spain to build her health up as much as she could. She also began to plan for the future of her two sons, Harvey and Luca. Ms Clarke with her sons Harvey and Luca. As the months passed and she continued to feel well, she became suspicious and demanded another scan. The shocking results revealed the growth in her pelvis was not cancerous - but internal damage from previous cancer treatment she had received . 'I wrote them farewell letters to say how proud I was of them and told them not to be sad because of all the good times they had spent together.' She even had family photographs taken to remind them of her. 'I wanted the boys to have fun times and . lots of mum memories, like playing football together or having a . barbecue. Nothing that cost a fortune.' She added: 'I didn’t know if I was going to end up dying in a hospital, if I would be at home or how it would happen.' Then after two years of agony, specialists revealed her recurring health problems were actually due to internal damage caused by high levels of radiation she'd received during her initial cancer treatment. She said: 'The doctor was there with the test results and my mum burst out crying. I just started to laugh. 'Mum said ""how can you laugh?"", but it was out of relief,' says Ms Clarke, an oil firm operations manager. 'I got home and said to my son: 'Harvey, the doctors made a mistake, they are wrong"". 'His little face just lit up and he was hugging me the hardest he has ever hugged me. 'He said he never wanted to let me go.' Ms Clarke has now received a five-figure sum from NHS Grampian to compensate for the misdiagnosis. She said: 'It's a massive relief they made a mistake and I'm OK - but that's two years of my life I'll never get back' She added: 'It's a massive relief they made a mistake and I'm OK - but that's two years of my life I'm never getting back.' She also worries the misdiagnosis had forced her eldest son Harvey, now 10, to grow up too quickly. 'Even now he's still got worries in his head, he says he doesn't want to be without me and tells me not to leave him,' she said. The misdiagnosis also led to her running up huge debts paying for alternative treatments and her marriage broke down due to the strain of her poor health. During treatment, high doses of chemotherapy left her needing a blood transfusion and she suffered acute renal failure after medics unnecessarily inserted stents to maintain her kidney function. Despite this, Ms Clarke added she has nothing but praise for many of the medical staff at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmity  X-ray unit, but said she felt let down by NHS Grampian. 'It wasn't just one department that got it wrong, it was multiple departments. They made mistakes time and time again,' she added. 'Going through something like this gives you clarity on so much. 'All I want now is to see my boys grow up, and watch my babies become the men I know they will be.' NHS Grampian refused to comment on the case, adding that it was a confidential matter.","Denise Clarke, 34, underwent treatment for cervical cancer in 2010 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . We've all gone into a restaurant planning to order something healthy - only to end up devouring the most calorific option. Now scientists say they have worked out why we get so easily derailed when dining out. They say the answer may not lie with a lack of willpower or judgement - but could actually be the menu's fault. Diners can be derailed from healthy eating simply by the way a menu is designed, researchers say . 'What you order may have less to do with what you want  - and more to do with a menu's layout and descriptions,' says Brian Wansink, professor of consumer behaviour at Cornell University in the U.S. He and his team drew their conclusions after analysing 217 menus and the selections of more than 300 diners. First, menu layout may be to blame. Any dish that attracts attention - for example listed in bold, highlighted, in a coloured font or boxed out - makes us more likely to order . that than the item listed next to it. 'But in most cases, . these are the least healthy items on the menu,' says Professor Wansink. Second, menus with items described in detail sell better - and lead us to believe they taste better. Previous research has found that when restaurant . menu items were re-named to make them more descriptive, they were more popular. When the seafood filet became . Succulent Italian Seafood Filet - and red beans and rice became Cajun Red . Beans and Rice - sales of these items went up by 28 per cent and they were rated . as tastier, even though the recipe was identical. Diners were also . willing to pay an average of 12 per cent more for a menu item with a . descriptive name. Often the most unhealthy items are listed in bold, highlighted or boxed out -  to attract attention . 'When it comes to what you order for . dinner, two things matter most: what you see on the menu and how you . imagine it will taste,' adds Professor Wansink, author of Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for . Everyday Life. So how do you navigate a menu and and avoid order envy or calorie guilt? 'Just ask your server,' he advises. 'Ask ""what are your two or three lighter entrées that get the most compliments?' or 'What's the best thing on the menu if a person wants a light dinner?""' The research will be published this month in the International Journal of Hospitality Management. Research published in May found restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than if it is offered for a smaller price. People who paid $8 instead of $4 for a buffet enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the cheaper food. Those that paid for the $4 (£2.40) buffet said felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate.","We're more  likely to choose items that are highlighted, bold or boxed out .
But these are usually the unhealthiest options, say U.S. researchers .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Women who receive better pain relief during labour are less likely to suffer postnatal depression . Controlling pain during childbirth may reduce the risk of mothers suffering from post-natal depression. Researchers found women who had an epidural during labour had a 14 per cent rate of depression six weeks after birth. But this rose to 35 per cent for those who did not have the pain relief. In the study an epidural was the only means of pain control available to the women. The Chinese research also found that breastfeeding was more common in the group who had an epidural for pain compared to those who did not, 70 per cent compared to 50 per cent. Dr Katherine Wisner, a perinatal psychiatrist at Northwestern University in the U.S., wrote a report on the research conducted by the Chinese researchers. She said: 'Pain control gets the mother off to a good beginning rather than starting off defeated and exhausted. 'Whether . it’s vaginal or Caesarean section delivery, pain control [during and after the birth] is . an issue for all new mothers. 'There is no way to have a delivery without . pain. The objective here is to avoid severe pain. 'Controlling that delivery pain so a woman can comfortably develop as a mother is something that makes a lot of sense.' She added the study’s findings, . published in the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia, are among the few . to examine the relationship between pain during labor and postpartum . depression. 'It’s a huge omission that there has been almost nothing in past research about pain during labour and delivery and postpartum depression. 'There is a well-known relationship between acute and chronic pain and depression.' The incidence of severe acute postnatal pain is approximately 11 per cent for new mothers. The . research discovered that biological and emotional factors contribute to . postpartum depression, which affects 14.5 per cent of women who give . birth. Dr Wisner added: 'These findings are quite exciting and further research should be done to confirm them, especially in women at increased risk of depression and in women from other cultures.' She recommends a woman who has chronic pain one to two months after delivery should be screened for depression. And that managing pain after childbirth supports a new mother’s ability to emotionally attach and care for her baby. Women who had an epidural during labour had a 14 per cent rate of depression six weeks after birth - but this rose to 35 per cent for those who did not have the pain relief .","Women who had epidural had a 14% rate of depression 6 weeks after birth .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . She was born weighing just 1lb and shorter than the length of a toothbrush. But baby Nova Johnson  - given just a 10 per cent chance of survival - has gone on made a miraculous recovery. Arriving just 27 weeks into her mother's pregnancy last August, doctors feared she was unlikely to survive. Miracle: Nova Johnson - pictured here aged two months  in the first picture her parents took of her -  was born weighing just 1lb and shorter than the length of a toothbrush. She was given just a 10 per cent chance of survival after she was born just 27 weeks into her mother's pregnancy . Nova's mother Jennifer suffered from pre-eclampsia during her pregnancy. The condition can cause a premature birth and low birth weight . Her mother Jennifer had pre-eclampsia  - high blood pressure and protein in in the urine during pregnancy. The condition can cause fits (eclampsia) and other complications, as well as low birth weight and premature birth for the baby. As a result, Mrs Johnson had to be admitted to hospital more than three months before she was due to give birth. Nova was born by Caesarean but was so ill she was immediately taken to the critical care unit before her parents could even meet her. 'She was absolutely tiny. It was ridiculous,' her mother said. 'The nurses said she was the smallest baby they’d ever seen born at 27 weeks. Mrs Johnson, 45, said: 'It was terrifying . knowing that our daughter was so tiny and so ill that we wouldn’t even . be able to see her until she was a day old. After an agonising day's wait, they were allowed to see her the next day. Survivor: Nova (with father Daniel, right) will soon celebrate her first birthday and is making good progress . She was so tiny that her father Daniel's wedding ring fitted over her foot and all the way up to her thigh. And a toothbrush placed next to her was longer than her body. 'She had tubes everywhere and was on a breathing apparatus - we were told to take it hour by hour,' said Mrs Johnson. Premature babies born before their mothers are 27 weeks pregnant are more likely to survive than ever before, according to research published in the British Medical Journal. However, the proportion of premature babies who experience serious health problems has remained 'largely unchanged'.While the pre-term survival rate continues to rise, the number of long-term disabilities, such as learning difficulties and cerebral palsy, will rise, the researchers warned. Fearing Nova may not survive, doctors offered Mrs Johnson the chance to take a picture of her baby daughter. But she refused - insisting Nova would pull through. By the time she was two months . old, her daughter had survived heart surgery and was finally longer than the toothbrush. 'After Nova came off the breathing . apparatus she made really good progress,' her mother said. 'She had her brain . scanned every week and her hearing and sight tested, but so far . everything is fine.' And after 101 days in hospital, she had recovered enough to join her four sisters at home in Birmingham. 'Everyone was hoping and praying that she’d be OK but I knew she was a little fighter and she’d make it through. 'Now she’s at home it's crazy to think how small she was. She's such a smiley and placid baby and such a giggler. She’s always laughing at her sisters. 'I just didn’t know how we were ever going to get through this so the fact that she’s doing absolutely perfectly is incredible.'","Nova Johnson was born almost three months early last August .

A judge ruled that the hit musical stole the name trademarked by British chain The Glee Club, which has venues in Birmingham and Nottingham. Judge Wyand directed Fox TV, which is behind Glee, to pay out £100,000 as an interim payment. Gleeful: Mark Tughan, 45, registered the name for his chain of comedy clubs as a trademark in the UK in 1999 - ten years before the US musical show first aired in Britain on Sky One . But the order will have to get the backing of the Court of Appeal before it can be fully enforced. Mark Tughan registered the name ‘The Glee Club’ as a UK trademark in 1999 under Comic Enterprises, some 10 years before the TV show arrived. He argued that customers were being put off attending his venues in Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford and Cardiff because people associated them with the teen musical drama. Teen musical: Mr Tughan argued customers were being put off attending The Glee Club because people associated them with the teen musical drama . Senior executives from Rupert Murdoch's Fox TV were flown in to contest the claims, saying they had no prior knowledge that the comedy clubs or their trademark existed. They argued that changing the name would be costly and complex and accused Comic Enterpises of money-grabbing because it is seeking damages. But today High Court judges sitting in London ruled that the trademark had been breached and rubbished claims that changing the show’s name in the UK would be difficult. Judge Wyand said: ‘I find it hard to believe that the cost of the re-titling and publicising of the new name would be so prohibitive compared to the value of the series. I was told many times during the course of the trial how this series is a ‘blockbuster.’ Fox said it would appeal against his ruling.","Mark Tughan trademarked The Glee Club a decade before the show came out .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A major criticism of electric cars is that they don’t have the style and personality of many petrol-powered vehicles. The next best thing, therefore, is to take a classic, iconic car and transform it with an electric motor. That was the thinking behind Zelectric Motor’s David Bernardo who specialises in turning the Volkswagen Bug into a quieter, smoother, battery-powered car. Scroll down for video . The electric model prototype (pictured) was created by Californian inventor David Bernardo who replaces engines of classic Volkswagen Bugs, built between 1958 and 1966, with electric motors . Harley Davidson began road trials of its first electric motorcycle last month. At a launch event in New York City, riders took the iconic motorcycle brand's experimental machine across the Manhattan Bridge and through the streets of the city centre. Like other electric vehicles, the engine on Harley Davidson's Livewire prototype is silent, although the meshing of gears reportedly makes a hum like a jet aeroplane taking off, quietly. Its 74 horsepower engine has a top speed of 92mph (148km/h). Mr Bernardo begins by replacing the engines of classic Volkswagen Bugs, built between 1958 and 1966, with electric motors. Battery packs are fitted under the hood, and behind the car’s rear seats to distribute the extra weight more evenly. This means the car’s original balance is maintained, despite the extra 350lb (158kg) weight. Mr Bernardo, with help from electric car experts at EV West, then increases the car’s suspension and fits stronger brake discs to account for this extra weight. Electric cars typically have a . single-speed transmission, but Mr Bernardo keeps the Beetle’s four-speed . transmission to allow for manual gear changes – although this is . optional. The left-hand image shows how the 1285cc engine in the rear of the Volkswagen Beetle 1300 from 1966 traditionally looks like. The right-hand image shows this engine replaced by Zelectric's electric motor . Battery packs are fitted under the hood, and behind the car's rear seats to distribute the extra weight more evenly. This means the car's original balance is maintained, despite the extra 350lb (158kg) weight. The car's suspension is then increased, and stronger brake discs are fitted, to account for the extra weight . The company has already made a red, and a black prototype, and plans to build models it can sell within the next year. A completed car is expected to cost $45,000 (£26,300). The car lasts up to 110 miles (177 km) on a single charge, and has a top speed of 90mph (144km/h). ‘Retrofitting a classic with an electric drivetrain just makes good sense,’ said Bernardo. ‘This makes best use of an existing car rather than using new non-renewable resources to create one from scratch. Electric cars typically have a single-speed transmission, but Zelectric Motors keeps the Beetle's four-speed transmission to allow for manual gear changes - although this is optional. The Zelectric Bug's speedometer is pictured . The car lasts up to 110 miles (177 km) on a single charge, and has a top speed of 90mph (144km/h). It is expected to sell for $45,000 (£26,300) when it goes on sale next year . ‘Investment-grade vintage Beetles continue to rise in value, and when Zelectrified are incredibly smooth, quiet, and super fun to drive.’ Bernardo said he chose models built between 1958 and 1966 because they are the most driveable and collectible Beetles. Unlike earlier versions, these models are built to handle the increased torque of the Zelectric drivetrain along with more than double the original horsepower. The only metal modifications that take place during a Zelectric installation are limited to holes to accommodate wiring. The Beetle was devised by Adolf Hitler who created a plan to solve Germany's unemployment problem by building autobahns for motor vehicles. Work began on the roads in 1933, but the car was not finished until 1939 when production was handed over to the German Air Force. A 1930s Volkswagen ad is pictured .

A disabled man is suing former NBA great Shaquille O'Neal and two other celebrities for ridiculing his appearance in an online post. Jahmel Binion, 23, claims he suffered emotional distress after O’Neal posted a picture on Instagram of his own contorted faced next to Binion's with the caption 'Smile Today'. The April post gained more than 14,000 likes, with basketball player Trey Burke and rapper Waka Flocka Flame joining in on the teasing. Following a public backlash, the post was deleted and Shaq and Burke apologized to Binion. However, the Michigan man has filed a lawsuit in Macomb County alleging that O’Neal, Burke and Waka Flocka Flame intentionally inflicted emotional distress, invaded his privacy and defamed him, Macomb Daily reported. In the lawsuit, Binion claims the mocking photos 'constituted a public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff' and 'placed plaintiff in a false light in the public eye.' Binion was diagnosed with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia as a baby, a disorder which causes sparse hair growth, missing teeth and facial deformities. He said he struggles to hold down a job and can't work in hot conditions. Binion said he was dumbfounded to see thousands of internet users . mocked his picture when it appeared on Shaq's feed. Scroll down for video . Offensive: The mocking photo was uploaded to the Instagram account of Shaquille O'Neal (left) comparing him to Jahmel Binion (right) - who has the rare genetic disorder ectodermal dysplasia.

'I . was kinda hurt because I look up to him and I watch Shaq play . basketball so I was like, why is he making fun of me when he's supposed . to be this role model?' 'I can't let it get to me, then I get hurt and depressed, so I keep my mind positive.' The National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias wrote an open letter to O'Neal saying 'bullying is never acceptable', as many Instagram and Twitter users demanded Shaq apologize for the photo. Days later, Shaq said he called Binion to say sorry. 'Made . a new friend today when I called and apologized to Jahmel Binion. Great . dude,' he tweeted with the hashtags #alwayslearning and #MYBADCUZ. He followed up with another tweet that said: 'Had the opportunity to . talk to Jahmel Binion yesterday and apologize about the post on IG!'

The description reads: 'This page is to support my anti-bulling and cyber bullying organization'. Visit the Facebook campaign at #hugdontjudge. Dear Mr. O’Neal, . All of us at the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family, Jahmel Binion, who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia. Individuals affected by these rare, genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance, which others may consider “different.”  Bullying is never acceptable and we, as a nation, have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying. However, to be called out on a celebrity’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible.  We applaud Jahmel for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “Hug Don’t Judge.” Mr. O’Neal, we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change. The ectodermal dysplasias are rare genetic conditions that affect the development of hair, teeth, skin, glands and nails in men, women and children of all races and ethnic groups.  Of the more than 180 different syndromes, x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth, the inability to perspire, sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, but in all cases present a variety of challenges. We invite you to attend our NFED National Family Conference, July 23-26 in Columbus, Ohio, and meet families from around the world who, like Jahmel, are affected by ectodermal dysplasias.  You will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas, daunting physical challenges, and financially draining dental procedures they’re up against. You might want to consider making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of.  Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride. We are urging our NFED community to use this opportunity to raise awareness, to make positive change, and to support Jahmel’s “Hug Don’t Judge” campaign (#hugdontjudge). We encourage you to do the same.  Let’s raise awareness of the ectodermal dysplasias. Together, we have the power to make life better for the people it affects. Beauty is diverse. Let us show you.

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Amazon has accused one of the world's leading publishers of taking too big a cut from ebooks at the expense of authors. The online bookseller said French firm Hachette, which acts for JK Rowling and Ian Rankin, is handing 'too small a portion' of the revenue to authors. It is the latest blow in a long-running war of words between Amazon and Hachette, the fourth-biggest publisher in the U.S. Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling (pictured) is one of the clients of French publisher Hachette. She currently receives 25 per cent of revenue from ebooks sold on Amazon . Online bookseller Amazon has been involved in a long-running dispute with French publisher Hachette . Amazon's comments follow reports that it had been demanding 50 per cent of the ebook price as its cut from any sale as part of a shake-up of its policies. But writing on its Kindle forum website the company said it was happy with its 30 per cent cut but believed Hachette should take less. Currently, Hachette takes 45 per cent. That leaves only 25 per cent for the authors. Under Amazon's new proposals it will no longer carry the whole cost of discounting allowing the price of ebooks to go down, the company claimed. However authors have dismissed Amazon's claims saying slashing the price of ebooks could devalue their work and accusing the company of 'thuggish behaviour', The Guardian reported. The dispute has seen Amazon remove pre-orders and slow deliveries for some of Hachette's best-selling authors. Hachette's biggest names include David Baldacci, David Foster Wallace and JK Rowling's crime alter ego Robert Galbraith. Hachette's biggest names include crime writer Ian Rankin (left) and bestselling American novelist David Baldacci (right) A post signed by the Amazon books team said: 'Ebooks can and should be less expensive. Keep in mind that books don't just compete against books. 'Books compete against mobile games, television, movies, Facebook, blogs, free news sites and more. If we want a healthy reading culture, we have to work hard to be sure books actually are competitive against these other media types, and a big part of that is working hard to make books less expensive. 'While we believe 35 per cent should go to the author and 35 per cent to Hachette, the way this would actually work is that we would send 70 per cent of the total revenue to Hachette, and they would decide how much to share with the author. 'We believe Hachette is sharing too small a portion with the author today, but ultimately that is not our call.' Ebooks sell for around $15 in the U.S., which Amazon says is too high. The online retailer is able to reduce that price but only by paying for the discount itself. By allowing bigger discounts and lower prices, it claims it could sell 1.74 times as many copies of the average book. Quoted in The Guardian, writer Roxana Robinson, the president of America's Authors Guild, said: 'Amazon is using PR to try to sway public opinion. 'I don't feel it is to writers' benefit in the long term to start devaluing the product. Not every book is going to sell that much more if you drop the ebook price. There is not an infinite demand for books.'","Latest blow in a long-running dispute between Amazon and Hachette .

Kenneth Moreno was cleared in 2011 of the on-duty rape of a drunk fashion executive in her apartment in December 2008, but spent nine months in jail for official misconduct. Now the 46-year-old, who works as a building contractor after being kicked out of the police force, wants his 'opportunist' accuser to pay up. In his false arrest lawsuit, the Brooklyn resident claims the woman falsely accused him of rape, leading Manhattan prosecutors to build a case against him despite a lack of forensic evidence, according to New York Daily News. Scroll down for video . Jail time: Former NYPD cop Kenneth Moreno (left) was convicted of official misconduct but acquitted of raping a woman in 2008. He is pictured at his sentencing with attorney Chad Seigel at the State Supreme court on August 8, 2011, in New York . Moreno said the false claims have cost him work opportunities and ruined his life. 'There were some carpenters (at work) one day and . one of them asked me if I was the ‘rape cop',' he told Daily News. 'They asked me . to leave so I lost a job that day. I don’t want to be known as the ‘rape cop'. It’s horrible.' He also said that his jail time took a toll: 'I tried to get through (jail) a day at a . time but there was always the presence of danger and animosity.' In his suit, Moreno also accuses the woman, now 32 and living in San Francisco, and civil attorney Yasmin Saeed of . maliciously filing a $57 million lawsuit 'to extort monies' from him . and the city. A federal judge tossed out their suit last year, ruling there was no evidence backing her claims. The appeal was also shot down. Saeed declined to comment to Daily News. Litigation: Kenneth Moreno (pictured in 2011) is suing NYC and the woman who accused him of rape for $175 million in a bid to restore his reputation . In 2008, Moreno was accused of raping a drunk woman while he was on duty. According to court documents, Moreno and his patrol partner, Franklin Mata, helped her out of a taxi outside her East 13th Street apartment on December 7. Mata was accused of keeping a lookout while Moreno raped the woman as she lay face-down and dazed on her bed. The pair took the woman's keys and returned to her apartment three more times while still on duty, New York Times reported. The woman told authorities she passed out and awoke to being raped in her bed, saying she acutely remembered being assaulted despite being unclear during significant parts of the night. She said she secretly recorded a conversation days later in which Moreno alternately denied they had sex but said 'yes' twice when she asked whether he had used a condom. However Moreno said the woman asked them to return and that Moreno was counseling her about her drinking. In their two-month trial in 2011, Moreno testified that he flirted and cuddled in her bed while Mata slept on . the couch. Charged: Kenneth Moreno's partner, Franklin Mata (pictured) was sentenced to two months jail after being convicted of official misconduct for repeatedly visiting the woman's apartment while he was on duty . He maintains he . rebuffed the woman's advances but admitted he placed a phony 911 . call about a sleeping vagrant to provide an excuse for one of the . visits. Mata and Moreno were cleared of rape and burglary charges, however they were convicted of misconduct for returning to the woman's apartment. They were fired from the police force within hours of their convictions. Moreno served nine months of a one-year prison sentence, while Mata spent two months behind bars. The rape acquittal caused outrage. Women's groups protested the verdict, while some newspaper columnists questioned how it was possible to acquit the two men given the evidence. The woman said that after the verdict, her 'world was turned upside-down by the actions of two police officers who were sent there to protect but instead took advantage of their authority and broke the law.'","Former NY cop Kenneth Moreno, 46, was cleared in 2011 of raping a drunk woman while on duty in 2008 .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Mississippi tea party brawl isn't over yet, an attorney for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Chris McDaniel told reporters on Monday, and the insurgent conservative's campaign expects to find evidence of enough voter fraud in the June 24 primary runoff to trigger a new election. That would be the third bare-knuckle contest between McDaniel and six-term senator Thad Cochran, a 76-year-old moderate Republican whose embrace of immigration reform and other liberal-leaning policies made him a prime target for the tea party movement. McDaniel campaign counsel Mitch Tynersaid Monday that he 'would be surprised if we don’t find' enough fraudulent votes to throw out the June 24 results. The campaign, he said, has already found 'thousands.' Last week it was reported that an initial review of ballots flagged at least 4,900 'irregularities.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mitch Tyner, an attorney representing U.S. Senate candidate Chris McDaniel, told reporters that 'there has indeed been election fraud in this case,' and said he would challenge the June 24 runoff results . A GOP runoff win for Sen. Thad Cochran (L) could be short-lived if Chris McDaniels (R) successfully shows that more ineligible votes were cast than the margin of victory . Cochran and McDaniel first squared off on June 10. McDaniel came out on top but neither won at least 50 per cent of the vote. The runoff two weeks later was supposed to settle the matter. But complaints of fraud circulated throughout the state even before polls closed. They centered mostly on a seven-figure super PAC set up to benefit him, which paid for advertisements encouraging Democrats in majority-black counties to 'cross over' and vote in the Republican runoff. The strategy is legal, but Democrats can only participate in another party's primary process if they haven't already voted in their own. Mississippi law provides for 'automatically a new election,' Tyner said Monday, if the number of 'ineligible voters' exceeds the margin of victory. That law, an election adviser in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, told MailOnline, wouldn't require McDaniel to find 6,700 fraudulent votes cast for his opponent. Any 6,700 ineligible votes would suffice. 'Most of them,' he said, 'are going to be absentee ballots. It's too easy to scam, and nobody ever checks unless the margin is this close or the result this unexpected.' Tension built Monday as the Mississippi Republican party faced a 5:00 p.m. deadline to file its certified runoff results with state officials, and McDaniel aides fanned out across the state to work with county clerks to examine paper ballot applications from absentee voters. Tyner said in a brief press conference that until Monday the campaign's representatives were not 'able to go into the courthouses, look in the ballot boxes and determine exactly what is contained in there, which includes the absentee information. And so, that is what we’re going after today.' Cochran's campaign doesn't seem concerned. His spokesman Jordan Russell said in a statement that '[w]e have representatives at all 82 courthouses today to monitor the review of ballot boxes and have been pleased with the results.' 'The county-by-county results reported thus far are revealing an extremely low number of crossover votes from the June 24th election. As the process moves forward, the conversation is shifting from wild, baseless accusations to hard facts.' Russell told The Associated Press that Cochran's campaign had found only one single crossover vote out of more than 2,000 votes cast in Perry County; three out of 4,000 in Pontotoc County; five out of 2,000 cast in Leake County; and seven crossover voters out of more than 11,000 in Lauderdale County. But the radio ads and fliers that blanketed black communities focused elsewhere in the state, including some with messages trying to tie McDaniel to the Ku Klux Klan in order to motivate Democratic voters. The epicenter of the controversy is Hinds County, where Tyner spoke near the courthouse steps. More than 169,000 of the county's 245,000 residents are black, according to 2010 U.S. Census data. Last week, McDaniel offered a $1,000 reward for information proving that fraudulent votes were cast on June 24. 'All Citizens for Mississippi,' a political committee that didn't legally exist before it produced and distributed literature like this flier, is one of the shadowy groups behind the cesspool-like politics in the Cochran-McDaniel fight . Old guard vs. new blood: Former Mississippi Gov. and former Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour founded the super PAC behind race-baiting ads that drove black Democrats to vote against tea party candidate Chris McDaniel . 'It is imperative that an ineligible voter not be excluded from this,' Tyner said Monday, 'because when I vote and there’s an ineligible voter that also votes, he dilutes my vote. He dilutes your vote.' McDaniel can challenge the result of the primary even after the results are certified, but he could also apply for an injunction in court on Monday afternoon that would prohibit the Mississippi Republican Party from finalizing its numbers. A more likely scenario, however, would see the McDaniel campaign filing a challenge with the party, and then in court once party leaders had been given 10 days to review it. And if Cochran's victory turns out to be short-lived? 'The correct remedy is a new election,' Tyner said. The eventual victor will square off against former Democratic congressman Travis Childers in a less contentious matchup expected to yield a Republican senator in a deeply red state. Nationally, the Republican party is teetering on the edge of reclaiming control of the U.S. Senate. That accomplishment would put the GOP in control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 2007.","Tea party Republican Chris McDaniel's campaign lawyer said Monday that he expects to find enough voter fraud to force a third Senate primary contest with aging centrist Thad Cochran .
Cochran won a runoff by about 6,700 votes, but McDaniel's attorney says campaign lawyers will almost certainly show at least that many 'ineligible voters' cast ballots .
Mississippi law would require a new election – after a primary fight and a runoff – between the two Republicans .
McDaniel's campaign is examining absentee ballot applications in every county to identify Democrats who illegally 'crossed over' to participate in the GOP primary after voting in the Democratic primary ."

President Barack Obama inserted himself into the Arab-Israeli conflict on Friday, issuing a statement  that encouraged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to minimize civilian deaths in its ground push into Hamas-ruled Gaza. At he same time, he assured him that the U.S. supports Israel's right to self-defense. 'No nation should accept rockets being fired into its borders or terrorists tunneling into its territory,' Obama told reporters in the White House press briefing room.

Obama told reporters at the White House that he aimed to convince Netanyahu to minimize Arab casualties as Israel marches into Gaza . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized a deeper incursion into Gaza on Friday, aiming to destroy rocket launching sites and tunnels; Israeli troops fired volleys of tank shells and clashed with Palestinian fighters in a high-stakes ground offensive meant to weaken the enclave's Hamas rulers . Obama said he spoke by phone to Netanyahu earlier in the day over the sounds of sirens going off in the background in Tel Aviv, and told him Secretary of State John Kerry is prepared to travel to the region. 'I also made clear that the United States and our friends and allies are deeply concerned about the risks of further escalation and the loss of more innocent life,' Obama said. 'And that's why we've indicated although we support military efforts by the Israelis to make sure that rockets are not being fired into their territory, we also have said that our understanding is the current military ground operations are designed to deal with the tunnels.' 'And we are hopeful,' he added, 'that Israel will continue to approach this process in a way that minimizes civilian casualties.' Israel's ground incursion followed a 10-day campaign of more than 2,000 airstrikes that had failed to halt relentless but largely ineffective Hamas rocket fire on Israeli cities. Israel stepped up its campaign after the Islamic militant group refused to accept an Egyptian truce offer. TOPSHOTS .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . and Francesca Chambers . House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that he will file a lawsuit against President Obama for what he claimed is a series of abuses of power in the executive branch of the federal government. 'This is not about impeachment,' the Ohio legislator insisted. 'It's about him faithfully executing the laws of this country.' Obama has touted his 'pen and phone' approach to implementing his domestic agenda by going around Congress, casting 2014 during his most recent State of the Union address as a 'year of action.' 'What we've seen, clearly over the last five years, is an effort to erode the power of the legislative branch,' Boehner said. 'I believe the president is not faithfully executing the laws of our country.' Scroll down for video . House Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday that he plans to sue President Barack Obama over his series of executive actions that have sidestepped Congress . Golfer-in-chief: Barack Obama has spent as much time bypassing Congress as he has on the links, say Republicans . White House press secretary Josh Earnest accused congressional Republicans of obstruction and said they had left Obama with little option but to make greater use of his executive authority . The White House says he has undertaken at least 20 'executive actions' this year, mostly on agenda items where legislation has been bogged down in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives. His more controversial actions have included raising the minimum wage for companies undertaking new federal government contracts, ordering a long series of changes to the implementation schedule of his Obamacare law, decreeing new fuel-economy standards for trucks, and – most recently – declaring that the EPA will enforce a wide-ranging set of rules governing carbon emissions. Obama's Climate Action Plan, formalized this week, is being called a 'coal-killer' because it will dramatically increase costs associated with building and running coal-fired electric power plants. But most objectionable to conservatives in Boehner's caucus, according to multiple Capitol Hill sources, is the president's 2012 action that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. That move, Republicans say, led directly to the current border crisis that has seen tens of thousands of unaccompanied children – including many toddlers and infants – being brought across the U.S.-Mexico border in the hope of an amnesty. White House press secretary Josh Earnest accused congressional Republicans of obstruction on Wednesday, and said they had left Obama with little option but to make greater use of his executive authority . 'The fact that they are considering a taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the President of the United States for doing his job, I think, is the kind of step that most Americans wouldn't support,' Earnest said. 'This lawsuit is not going to consume the attention of the White House.' Fox News host Neil Cavuto, an unlikely ally of the Obama administration, bemoaned the GOP's latest move as partisan politics on his show Wednesday afternoon. 'Where was your rage when Democrats were going after President Bush on the same use of executive orders?' Cavuto asked Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann. 'I think you know in your heart of hearts this is a waste of time now. There are far more important things you guys have to be addressing.' Bachmann apparently didn't get her caucus leader's memo that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to impeach the president. 'What we should do right now is defund the executive branch while we have the option,' Bachmann said. 'What we can do further is impeach the elected official.' 'Think about what you are saying,' Cavuto told her during the shouting match. 'The Democrats would be in their right mind to laugh you out.' Executive action: The GOP says Obama's 2012 unilateral policy change on immigration enticed tens of thousands of unaccompanied children to cross the U.S. border, putting a strain on government resources and creating a humanitarian emergency .

He told a closed-door House Republican Conference meeting on Tuesday – and followed up with a detailed memo . – that he plans to move ahead with the lawsuit in the coming weeks. The . whole House of Representatives would be the plaintiff, meaning he will . need the approval of House leaders. With the GOP in the majority, that isn't expected to be a problem. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, an informal House leadership panel, will likely make the call. It includes Boehner, newly minted Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer. A simple majority vote, likely 3-2, will determine if Boehner can proceed. Asked in his weekly press briefing on Wednesday if he's committed to moving forward, he replied, 'I am.' The House has passed legislation that would curb the president's power to take executive actions that Republicans say fall outside his constitutional authority, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has declared them dead on arrival. Boehner spokesman Michael Steele told Roll Call on Tuesday that Obama 'has a clear record of ignoring the American people’s elected representatives and exceeding his constitutional authority, which has dangerous implications for both our system of government and our economy.' 'The House has passed legislation to address this,' said Steele, 'but it has gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate, so we are examining other options.'","House speaker says Obama 'is not faithfully executing the laws of our country'

"By . Mark Prigg . Saturn’s auroras are caused by the same phenomenon which leads to dramatic magnetic light displays on Earth, researchers have found. Astronomers have been able to capture the best images yet of Saturn’s auroras as the planet’s magnetic field is battered by charged particles from the Sun. Researchers say their research is a 'smoking gun' for the theory that Saturn’s auroral displays are often caused by the dramatic collapse of its 'magnetic tail' - just as on Earth. Scroll down for video . The ultraviolet images, taken by Hubble¿s super-sensitive Advanced Camera for Surveys, capture moments when Saturn¿s magnetic field is affected by bursts of particles streaming out from the Sun. Due to the composition of Saturn¿s atmosphere, its auroras shine brightly in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Just like comets, planets such as Saturn and the Earth have a 'tail' – known as the magnetotail – that is made up of electrified gas from the Sun and flows out in the planet’s wake. When a particularly strong burst of particles from the Sun hits Saturn, it can cause the magnetotail to collapse, with the ensuing disturbance of the planet’s magnetic field resulting in spectacular auroral displays. A very similar process happens on Earth. Just like comets, planets such as Saturn and the Earth have a 'tail' – known as the magnetotail – that is made up of electrified gas from the Sun and flows out in the planet’s wake. When a particularly strong burst of particles from the Sun hits Saturn, it can cause the magnetotail to collapse, with the ensuing disturbance of the planet’s magnetic field resulting in spectacular auroral displays. A very similar process happens here on Earth. University of Leicester scientists observed this process happening on Saturn firsthand between April and May of 2013 as part of a three-year-long Hubble observing campaign. Their findings have been accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. The ultraviolet images, taken by Hubble’s super-sensitive Advanced Camera for Surveys, capture moments when Saturn’s magnetic field is affected by bursts of particles streaming out from the Sun. Due to the composition of Saturn’s atmosphere, its auroras shine brightly in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This observation campaign using Hubble meant the astronomers were able to gather an unprecedented record of the planet’s auroral activity. The Northern Lights above Norway: When a particularly strong burst of particles from the Sun hits Saturn, it can cause the magnetotail to collapse, with the ensuing disturbance of the planet¿s magnetic field resulting in spectacular auroral displays - just like on Earth. The team caught Saturn during a very dynamic light show. Some of the bursts of light seen shooting around Saturn’s polar regions travelled at over three times faster than the speed of the gas giant’s rotation. 'These images are spectacular and dynamic, because the auroras are jumping around so quickly,' Dr Jonathan Nichols, of the University of Leicester’s Department of Physics and Astronomy, who led the Hubble observations, said. 'The key difference about this work is that it is the first time the Hubble has been able to see the northern auroras so clearly. 'The particular pattern of auroras that we saw relates to the collapsing of the magnetotail,' he added. 'We have always suspected this was what also happens on Saturn. 'This evidence really strengthens the argument.' 'Our observations show a burst of auroras that are moving very, very quickly across the polar region of the planet. 'We can see that the magnetotail is undergoing huge turmoil and reconfiguration, caused by buffering from solar wind,' Nichols said. The unique six-sided jet stream at Saturn's North Pole known as 'the hexagon'': Now researchers have captured images of the same area experiencing an aurora . 'It’s the smoking gun that shows us that the tail is collapsing.' The new images also formed part of a joint observing campaign between Hubble and NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around Saturn itself. Between them, the two spacecraft managed to capture a 360-degree view of the planet’s aurora at both the north and south poles. Cassini also used optical imaging to delve into the rainbow of colours seen in Saturn’s light shows. On Earth, observers of auroras see green curtains of light with flaming scarlet tops. Cassini’s imaging cameras reveal similar auroral veils on Saturn, which are red at the bottom and violet at the top.","Images prove theory auroral displays caused in same way as on Earth .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . President Barack Obama’s aggressive and controversial Climate Action Plan grew out of a draft proposal from one of America's richest environmental activist groups, it emerged Monday. The Natural Resources Defense Council, which spent $41 million of its $210 million nest egg last year pushing for changes in energy policy, circulated a 110-page document in 2012 that outlined what would become the president's latest salvo in the global-warming wars. Now that the Obama administration has adopted the green-group's plan, the NRDC's insider status is widely seen as an in-your-face response to oil, gas and coal companies that had a seat at the table 13 years ago when then-Vice President Dick Cheney convened meetings in secret to chart future energy policy. While the Bush administration focused on extracting as much energy out of the ground as legally possible, the current White House's policy is to erect roadblocks in the path of 'big coal' while rewarding alternative energy speculators with loan guarantees and other sources of public funds. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Celeb-fueled access and activism: The NRDC gets its street cred from the Hollywood glitterati who host its fundraisers and record its robocalls . Apocalypse: Climate change activists, led by the NRDC and billionaire Tom Steyer -- who co-funded the 'Risky Business' report and its fearsome predictions -- have their fingers on the pulse of the Obama White House . The NRDC's proposal departed from the green movement's previous one-size-fits-all approaches, allowing states to determine how to meet stringent carbon-emission targets while drawing them all toward the central goal of squeezing coal-generated electricity to the margins of the U.S. national power picture. As with the Obamacare law, however, state-based solutions could result in a patchwork quilt of crisscrossing rules that aggravate tensions between businesses and the White House, while opening up the floodgates for a wealth of legal avenues by lawsuit-waving opponents. Environmental Protection Agency regulators were among a narrow group of stakeholders who got private briefings on the proposal beginning in 2012, and based their eventual written rules on what they heard. 'Once enacted,' The New York Times reported on Monday, the new EPA regime 'could do far more than just shut down coal plants; it could spur a transformation of the nation’s electricity sector.' Such a wholesale shift is high on the list of NRDC's priorities, and its three activists who wrote the proposal – and frequently advocate for green policies with government agencies – had all the resources they wanted to pull it off, according to an NRDC insider. 'This was the most talked-about thing going on inside the organization,' the veteran D.C. activist told MailOnline. 'Nothing else we were doing – not pollution control or ESA [Endangered Species Act] work or marine protected areas – nothing had as much juice behind it.' 'Of course, fundraising was always a trump card, but other than that, the carbon policy team got everything it wanted and pretty much had a blank check.' The statistical analysis alone coast 'a few hundred thousand dollars,' NRDC lawyer David Doniger told the Times. Doniger wrote the document along with fellow lawyer David Hawkins and Daniel Lashof, an activist described by the Times as a 'climate scientist.' Lashof holds a Harvard bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics, and a Berkeley Ph.D. from an 'Energy and Resources' program that describes its goal not in research terms but as a policy outcome: 'a sus­tain­able envi­ron­ment and a just society.' Outsize influence: NRDC president Frances Beineke (2nd L) draws big names to fundraising events, including HuffPo founder Arianna Huffington (L) and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt (2nd R) Not dying off: An American climate scientist was recently forced into retirement after being accused of falsifying data to show polar bears were drowning because polar ice caps had melted . Endangered species: Coal production in the U.S. is under fire as the White House -- with help from the NRDC -- seeks to muscle it out of America's energy picture . Before co-authoring what became the Obama White House's latest climate rules, he helped draft the U.S. Senate's failed 'cap and trade' carbon emissions bill. Lashof recently left the NRDC to take the reins at NextGen Climate America, a think-tank sidecar on NextGen Climate Action, a wealthy super PAC bankrolled by liberal climate activist billionaire Tom Steyer. Steyer plans to put $100 million in play this year electing politicians who embrace his PAC's desire to 'avert climate disaster.' Doniger told MailOnline on Monday that the NRDC was 'unsolicited by EPA or others in the Administration,'  and that his group 'briefed EPA and others around that time, at our initiative.' He also emphasized that 'no funder came to us to do this work.' Cheney's National Energy Policy Development Group, which delivered a report to the president in May 2001, was a body solely comprised of government officials. But it held about 40 meetings with energy-policy stakeholders – mostly those on the business side. Green groups were given a chance to preset their case, but only after the task force's initial report was already drafted. Natural Resources Defense Council lawyer David Doniger (L) helped draft the climate change proposal that the White House embraced, while his co-author Daniel Lashof now works with billionaire global-warming crusader Tom Steyer (R) President Obama told the League of Conservation Voters that Republican global warming deniers pretended they can't read in order to curry political favor on their right wing .

NRDC insider added that it was common in the organization to talk about . how the environmental movement needed to 'compete with the big polluters . like the BPs and Halliburtons who directed the Bush-Cheney energy . policy in secret.' 'Did we want to turn the tables? Hell yes.' Theories about global warming have taken a serious hit in recent weeks with the revelation that the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's official graph of historical surface temperatures records has been quietly altered for years. Many of the world’s most oft-cited climate measurements, records indicate, have been gradually replaced in at least three countries with hypothetical numbers derived from computer models. The result, naysayers contend, has been a faulty reading of a climate trend that has been cooling, not warming, the earth since the 1930s – despite a 10 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions since 1996. Additionally, U.S. policy won't impact the frenzied pace of coal-fired power plant construction in China and other Asian nations. Obama last jabbed at global warming skeptics during a speech at the University . of California Irvine, saying their arguments are similar to believing the moon is made of cheese.","A trio of activists from the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote a 110-page draft that became Obama's latest global-warming plan .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A former Las Vegas prostitute of 16 years, who now runs a Christian nonprofit to help those negatively affected by the industry that nearly killed her, has written about her drastic life-turnaround. Annie Lobart, 46, is the founder of Hookers for Jesus; a name she admits 'many disagree with' - which offers support for women in the sex industry, as well as a Las Vegas-based safe house for those who wish to escape their situations. Ms Lobart, who lost her virginity at 18, grew up as a self-confessed 'goodie two shoes,' but her life took a sharp turn when her boyfriend at the time revealed himself as a pimp, and subsequently led her into the dingy world of prostitution. Poster girl: Annie Lobart (pictured) escaped 16 years of prostitution to form Hookers for Jesus, a nonprofit which provides support and a safe haven for women who wish to escape the sex industry . 'I took pop culture's pill and swallowed it whole,' writes the buxom blonde of the 'money, presents and parties' that came with the job. Ms Lobart was initially enthralled by what she describes as 'the honeymoon phase' of her 'glamorous' life in the sex industry; during which time she was a stripper, a 'high-class escort' and a street prostitute, and says she encountered plenty of 'very famous' men who paid for her services. Although she confesses she went through a phase of 'sex addiction,' she claims the practice was never actually enjoyable to her. 'Sex for money is not pleasurable, it is not fun, us girls do not enjoy it,' she writes. 'In fact there were many times I just wanted to hurt the man that was touching me.' Slippery slope: At first, Ms Lobart (left and right) was seduced by the 'money, presents and parties' that came with her life as a call girl, but says that being paid for sex was never 'fun' Before long, she was heading down a dark path; suffering the traumas of abuse, 'drugs of every kind,' pornography, anorexia and repeated abortions. 'Sex for money is not pleasurable, it is not fun, us girls do not enjoy it' 'I was beaten, raped, kidnapped, strangled, suffocated, guns put in my mouth, hair cut off, tied up, gagged, put in trunks of cars, bones broken, spit on, kicked, pushed, stalked by crazy men,' she writes. Though she thought things couldn't get any worse, Ms Lobart was then diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma - a form of cancer which affects the lymph tissue - and even though she recovered, and finally abandoned her career as a prostitute with the help of a former client, things continued to spin downhill. Trauma: Ms Lobart (bottom) soon fell prey to an almost unbelievable chain of bad fortune, including beatings, rapes, abortions, kidnappings and then cancer, but after finding God, she turned her life around and now campaigns to help others . Having flirted with the concept of God over the years, but having not yet fully embraced Christianity, Ms Lobart thought her wealthy businessman boyfriend and his 'high-society square lifestyle' would be the answer, literally, to her prayers. Instead she formed an addiction to cocaine, a substance she describes as 'the drug even the devil himself does not want.' Following an accidental overdose in 2003 that almost claimed her life, Ms Lobart began to take her faith more seriously. She claims the moment her life changed forever came when Jesus visited her in a dream. Happily ever after: Ms Lobart (right) married her husband Oz Fox (left), who is the lead musician in a heavy metal band called Stryper, in 2009 . Crusaders: Hookers for Jesus (pictured, volunteers for the cause) was formed after Ms Lobert narrowly survived a drug overdose, an event that eventually lead her to embrace her Christianity with full force . 'When I chose to fully believe that He died in place of me for my sins, it literally blew me away,' she writes. 'Jesus came into my heart...and He literally took my life back from the devil.' 'When I chose to fully believe that He died in place of me for my sins, it literally blew me away' Ms Lobart founded Hookers for Jesus in 2005 and states its primary mission is: 'To Hook (Outreach) Give Hope (Jesus) Heal (emotional & spiritual restoration) and Help (Transitional . Assistance) for those who have been negatively affected by sex . trafficking and the adult entertainment industry.'

"Perry announced suspension of campaign morning before final debate . Announces his endorsement of Newt Gingrich's campaign . Romney on Perry's departure: 'We'll miss him on the stage tonight' By . Meghan Keneally . Updated: . 09:25 EST, 20 January 2012 . Rick Perry announced today that he is dropping out of the Republican presidential bid after continually poor rankings and debate performances. ‘There is no viable path forward for me in this 2012 campaign therefore today I am suspending my campaign and endorsing Newt Gingrich,’ he said at an 11am press conference in North Charleston, South Carolina. 'I've discovered this tremendous purpose and resiliency of our people. They haven't stopped believing in the promise of America. They never stopped believing in the American dream...What's broken in America is not our people: it's our politics. 'I ran for president because I love America. I love the people, I love the freedom. Scroll down for video . Saluting his supporters at the press conference today, Rick Perry announced that he was stopping his bid for president because he no longer has a 'viable path' to win . Supportive: Mr Perry appeared with his son Griffin (center), wife Anita (right) and daughter Sydney (not shown) 'Humbled': Shortly after Perry's announcement, Gingrich said he was honored and humbled by the endorsement . 'The conservative philosophy . transcends any one individual and will live long past any of us,' he . said, clearly signalling that he was preparing to endorse one of his . other competitors. 'Newt is not perfect, but who among us is,' Mr Perry said during his endorsement. The . boost that Mr Gingrich will receive from Mr Perry's endorsement- though . it may not be very large- may be all that is needed to bring the former . speaker into fighting reach of front-runner Mitt Romney. Mr . Perry has a strong base of evangelical Christian supporters, and that . is one group that Mr Gingrich has had trouble connecting with due to his . complicated personal history. There were clear overtones of religious . approval in Mr Perry's speech of Mr Gingrich, perhaps as a signal to . values-voters that they should vote for the former speaker. Even before the formal announcement, there were rumblings that he would . endorse Mr Gingrich as the Perry campaign . took down their anti-Gingrich website early Thursday morning. Mr Gingrich followed Mr Perry's endorsement with his own press conference highlighting his connection to Mr Perry. Dropping out: Mr Perry's announcement comes just two days before the South Carolina primary . 'He has been a great patriot,' Mr . Gingrich said in response to Mr Perry's announcement. Mr Gingrich was . apparently honored and humbled by the endorsement. Mr Gingrich then said that he has asked Mr Perry to head up a . 10th Amendment enforcement project, which will place emphasis on . constitutionality clause. The project is reportedly something that the . two men have discussed for years and will be a way for Mr Perry to . remain active on a national scale while stepping back from the 2012 . race. After announcing his bid for president on August 11, Rick Perry was seen as a conservative godsend for Republican voters. He reached a record-high of 31.8 per cent in national polls a month later, but his campaign only went down from there. The . veritable 'nail in the coffin' came at the televised CNBC debate in . Rochester, Michigan on November 9 when Mr Perry forgot one of his major . campaign platforms. Mr . Perry continually lambasted the size and over-reach of the federal . government, and he campaigned saying that he would abolish three federal . departments as soon as he took office. When . asked about that decision at the debate, he took over a minute to . remember the three agencies before finally just saying 'Oops... I . forgot'. Though he . remained in fourth place immediately after that debate, the space . between he and third-place Newt Gingrich continued to widen. Front-runner Mitt Romney made very brief remarks about the news as he was leaving a campaign event. 'He's a great conservative, a great governor,' Mr Romney said. 'We'll miss him on the stage tonight,' he said referring to the last debate in South Carolina before the Saturday primary. While the news of Mr Perry's suspension does come a as a surprise . as the South Carolina primary is only two days away, it is not a . complete shock as his support has been lagging, even reaching its' lowest point in recent weeks. Mr . Perry will be the second candidate to drop out this week, as Jon . Huntsman Jr. also cancelled his campaign after . less-stellar-than-expected performance in New Hampshire. Mr Perry has been in last place since . the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday. He currently only has 4.4 per . cent of the Republican votes in South Carolina, trailing Rick Santorum . by 9 points. He even took a brief trip to his home . state after the first major primary in Iowa- where he finished in fifth . place-to talk with advisers and consider whether he would remain in the . race. He then decided to stay the course . but to skip last week's primary in New Hampshire, opting to devote more . time and resources to South Carolina, where his conservative credentials . would be more favorable. Just over a week later, he has clearly reversed that decision. His . campaign made no secret of the fact that they were hoping for a strong . surge in South Carolina as he was seen as a conservative alternative to . Mormon front runner Mr Romney by appealing to Christian values-voters. That hasn’t worked, however, and some . of Mr Perry’s strongest supporters have been calling for an end to his . campaign in recent weeks. Erick . Erickson, founder of popular political blog RedState who started as one . of the Texan governor’s biggest advocates, announced that he believed . that Mr Perry’s campaign had to ‘come to an end’. Signalling . a shift even within the state in question, South Carolina state senator . Larry Grooms- who initially backed Mr Perry- switched and is now . supporting Santorum. Unlike the rest of the Republican . field, Mr Perry was able to highlight his time spent in the Air Force . during the campaign, and that was thought to be a major advantage going . into South Carolina because of the state's strong military presence. Mr Perry's high point in the campaign came in September, when he reached his high with 31.7 per cent of the vote. One more down: Preparations are being made at the debate site ready for just four candidates . Since . that initial peak, Mr Perry has continued to plummet in the polls and . has remained steady with around 6 per cent of Republican voters . nationally throughout the past month. He branded himself as the true outsider of the race, never having worked in Washington, D.C. and spending all of his time in Texas state government. Mr Perry's campaign took repeated and . significant blows with many of the televised debates, the worst of . which was his infamous 'oops' moment when he forgot the names of the . three government agencies he wished to cut if her were elected. Most . recently he was put on the defensive after saying that Turkey was run . by Islamic terrorists in Monday night's televised debate. The country . responded with harsh criticism of the candidate. 'Figures . who are candidates for positions that require responsibility, such as . the U.S. presidency, should be more knowledgeable about the world and . exert more care with their statement,’ the Turkish statement asserted. The end: Mr Perry appeared relatively optimistic during his frank press conference .","Perry announced suspension of campaign morning before final debate .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Archaeologists have been searching for signs of a Roman military presence in eastern Germany for centuries. And now researchers believe they have made the long-awaited discovery of what appears to be a military camp, near the town of Hachelbich in Thuringia. Located in a valley, the temporary camp measures 18 hectares (180,000 square metres) and is thought to have housed 5,000 Roman troops. Archaeologists have been searching for signs of a Roman military presence in eastern Germany for centuries, and now researchers have made the long-awaited discovery of a Roman military camp near the town of Hachelbich in Thuringia. Pictured are the Roman trenches dug around the site . Researchers believe the camp was set up by the Romans in the hope of invading territories further east, according to a report in Science. Artefacts discovered inside the trenches include four nails from the bottom of Roman boots, part of a scabbard and traces of makeshift bread ovens. Scientists claim these date back to the first two centuries AD, but they have been unable to pin them down to a more specific event in Roman history. Researchers believe the camp was set up by the Romans in the hope of invading territories further east. Pictured is an excavation of the site.  The exact whereabouts is currently being kept secret, to prevent metal detector hobbyists from stealing items for the site . Around the camp there are 6.6ft (2 metre)-deep trenches, which each measure over 0.24 miles (400m) in length. A separate trench protects a gate constructed at the northern edge of the camp . The artefacts discovered from Hachelbich - fittings and nails from the sandals of Roman legionaries . Around the camp, there are 6.6ft (2 metre)-deep trenches which each measure over 0.24 miles (400 metres) in length. A separate trench protects a gate constructed at the northern edge of the camp. The camp was first discovered in 2010, but it has taken up until now for archaeologists to conclusively prove that it is in fact Roman. ‘It's typically Roman - no Germans did that sort of thing,’ Mario Kuessner, an archaeologist working at the sitefor the state of Thuringia told Science. ‘The best would be if we could find coins or something with the legion number written on it,’ said Kuessner. ‘That would help us pin down the date. The Romans were defeated in a battle against German tribes north of the Rhine River in 9AD. Written sources suggest that despite this defeat, the Romans would sometimes campaign into Germany. The Hachelbich discovery provides concrete evidence to back this up.

'It is not a pretty picture,' Rebecca Redfern, from the centre for human bioarchaeology at the museum of London, said. 'At least one of the skulls shows evidence of being chewed at by dogs, so it was still fleshed when it was lying in the open.' The first analysis of the haul of 39 skulls, discovered beneath the site of the Guildhall in the City of London, were published earlier this year. 'Examination of the sample using techniques employed by forensic anthropology and entomology found that some of the material had been deposited in open waterlogged pits,' the report says. 'The majority of the sample was adult males who had evidence for multiple peri-mortem blunt- and sharp- force injuries; many also had healed injuries, suggesting that violence was a common feature of their life.'","Camp is near Hachelbich and measures 18 hectares (180,000 sq metres)

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The eyes may be the window to the soul, but a smile can reveal more about a person than first thought. A body language expert has told MailOnline the tiniest tweak to a smile can change how a person is perceived - from looking up to appear flirtatious, to lowering the eyebrows to look more dominant and powerful, for example. Dr Peter Collett has pinpointed six types of smiles from the genuine ‘Duchenne’, where the corners of the mouth are pulled up and the muscles around the eyes contract, to the knowing, wry smile. Secret smiles: A body language expert has revealed the tiniest tweak to a smile can change how someone is perceived - . from looking up to appear flirtatious (as seen on Miranda Kerr pictured left) to lowering the brows to look more powerful, which could help you get ahead at work (stock image pictured right) While the ‘raised-brow’ smile suggests submission, keeping eyebrows level can make the smile more powerful, which could prove useful when negotiating a business deal, or in a job interview. ‘In the realm of facial expressions there’s a big difference between lowered and raised eyebrows, with the former signalling dominance and the latter signalling submission,’ Dr Collett, a psychologist from Oxford, said. ‘When someone smiles with both their eyebrows raised it shows that they don’t want to dominate the situation and they want come across as unthreatening.’ A full smile is called a Duchenne smile - after 19th century anatomist Duchenne de Boulogne, who produced a ground-breaking study of the muscles involved in facial expressions of emotion. The openness of the expression gives the impression that someone is genuine. A full smile is called a Duchenne smile and signifies that someone is open and genuine (as modelled by George Clooney pictured left), while raising the eyebrows while smiling makes someone look submissive and non-threatening (Diana Vickers is pictured right) Dr Collett added that the wide open smile is a ‘clever way of getting other people to share one’s positive feelings.' ‘When someone tilts their head back slightly and opens their mouth wide they look like they are laughing rather than smiling. 'Because laughter is so contagious, those of us who see someone doing this are much more likely to be affected by the display and to feel that we share their positive emotions.’ Meanwhile, the ‘look-up’ smile can be used to appear seductive and flirtatious. ‘Some people have a habit of lowering their head slightly when they smile,’ said Dr Collett. The wide open smile (modelled on the left by Marilyn Monroe) is a ‘clever way of getting other people to share positive feelings' as it looks as if the person is laughing, which is contagious, while the wry smile (modelled by Emma Watson, right) is intimate and gives the impression they are sharing a secret with someone . ‘Unconsciously, this gives the impression that they’re shorter than they really are and that they’re looking up towards the person they’re addressing. 'This, coupled with the suggestion of embarrassment, makes the look-up smile especially flirtatious, which explains why it’s favoured by women when they’re dealing with impressionable men.’ Some people smile asymmetrically and when they look directly at someone, this wry smile can appear knowing and tells someone that you’re aware of something, or that you share a secret. ‘Smiles come in all shapes and sizes - some are involuntary, others deliberate, and they’re linked to a rich vocabulary of subtle messages,’ continued Dr Collett. A survey found that just over half of women think a smile is the most attractive trait in a man that they are meeting for the first time, while men also place more importance on a woman's smile than her chest, bottom or legs . ‘By taking a closer look at how people smile we can gain a much better understanding of what they’re feeling, and in some cases what kind of person they are. 'And of course the same principle applies to your own smiles.’ A study of 2,000 people commissioned by Wrigley’s Extra White Bubblemint, found that just over half of women think a smile is the most attractive trait in a man that they are meeting for the first time. Men also place more importance on a woman’s smile than her chest, bottom or legs. However, 67 per cent of women and 53 per cent of men said that they worry about their smiles. The survey, released to coincide with the launch of National Smile Month today , revealed that there’s nothing better than someone directing a genuine smile straight at us to encourage us to return the favour. A total of 58 per cent of people smile when they receive a compliment, 37 percent when looking at family photos and one in five when they are praised at work. The survey revealed that 67 per cent of women and 53 per cent of men said that they worry about their smiles. This graph shows how often people smile a day, with women more likely to crack a grin than men . Up to twelve facial muscles are involved in smiling – slightly more, it’s been observed, than the number of muscles involved in frowning. The most important of these are the Zygomatic major muscles, which hoist up the corners of the mouth and expose the top teeth, the risorius muscles which pull the corners of the mouth sideways, and the orbicularis oculi which contract around the eyes, creating wrinkles outside the eyes. There are several things that distinguish fake smiles from genuine smiles. One is asymmetry, where the smile appears more on one side of the face than the other. Another is the sudden appearance and disappearance of the smile. As a rule, genuine smiles involve the muscles around the mouth as well as the orbicularis oculi – those supposedly involuntary muscles around the eyes – whereas false smiles only involve the muscles around the mouth . Psychologists have discovered that women typically smile more than men, and men tend to reduce their smiling in order to appear more dominant. It’s possible to spot someone’s nationality from how they smile. American smiles, for example, concentrate on the Zygomatic major muscles - the muscles that pull up the corners of the mouth and expose the top teeth - whereas English smiles often enlist the risorius muscles, which pull the corners of the mouth sideways, so that the lips remain sealed and the teeth aren’t exposed at all. The long-term positive effects of smiling were demonstrated by a study in California. Researchers analysed the photographs of a large sample of women who had appeared in a  college yearbook in the late 1950s. They then contacted the women and interviewed them thirty years later. They found that those young students with the biggest smiles had gone on to have the most stable marriages in later life, and that they’d also experienced fewer physical and psychological problems.","A body language expert from Oxford has pinpointed six types of smiles .

The Suffolk County social service department alleged he used an open hand and a belt on the boy's buttocks, legs and arms after they got home. The incident occurred in March 2013. A county family court later found the father in neglect. The identifies of the father and the child were suppressed as art of the family court ruling. The appellate division has now said under the circumstances the spanking 'did not constitute excessive corporal punishment'. 'The father's openhanded spanking of the child as a form of discipline after he heard the child curse at an adult was a reasonable use of force,' the appeals court ruling said. The neglect ruling was dismissed, the court said, because evidence collected at a fact-finding hearing that the father hit his son with a belt 'was insufficient to prove that allegation'.","Long Island father spanked his eight-year-old son on the behind for cursing at an adult in March 2013 .

"By . Emily Payne . Enola Hallerton still fits into the clothes she wore as a three-year-old, and some days gets so tired she has to crawl instead of walking. The 10-year-old, who measures just 97 centimetres, has a extremely rare disease which means she will never grow more than one metre tall. Morquio (MPS), an incurable growth stunting disease, affects just 105 children and adults in the UK. Tiny: Enola Halleron wears clothes that would fit a three-year-old and measures just 97cm tall . Enola, from Blackburn, was diagnosed when she was two-years-old after doctors noticed an abnormality with her hips. She has grown just 5cm since she was five, which makes her almost 2ft smaller than the average ten-year-old girl. She also only weighs around two stone more than when she was born. Enola’s mother Donna Halleron, 40, said: 'She wasn’t a normal baby as she did weigh 11lb 1oz, which obviously is very big. Stunted growth: Enola, pictured with her sister Cora, 15, is almost 2ft shorter than an average 10-year-old girl . 'The only thing that doctors did pick up on was that she had positinal talipes which made her foot deformed. 'It had been stuck in my rib cage when she was in the womb. 'We were told it would correct itself with physio but, that it may have a knock on effect on her hips, so she was monitored for that. 'It was only after x-rays and check up appointments that a doctor actually said to me, ""There is only one way to describe Enola’s hips and that is weird"".' Morquio is a life long condition with no cure. A few adults can live until their 50s or 60s but the majority rarely live beyond their 20s or 30s - which is Donna’s biggest fear for her daughter. Family support: Enola Halleron pictured with her sister Cora, 15, left and mother, Donna, has a extremely rare disease which means she will never grow more than one metre tall . Enola (pictured with her sister, Cora) was diagnosed with Morquio when she was two . The part time teacher said: 'After her diagnosis I remember looking it up on the internet and just sobbing for two hours. 'It is devastating to think that she may not live a long life because looking at her beforehand she was just a normal child running around. 'It is getting harder for her now though as when she was younger there wasn’t much difference between her and other children. Morquio's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive mucopolysaccharide storage disease, which is usually inherited. Symptoms . include an abnormal heart development, abnormal skeletal development, . large fingers, knock-knees, compression of spinal cord and flared ribs, . short neck, joint laxity and 'duck-waddling' gait. Patients . with Morquio's syndrome appear healthy at birth, but often present with . spinal deformity in the second or third year of life. LIfe expectancy can be as early as 2 or 3 and some can live up to 60 or 70 years old. 'But now her classmates are almost double her size and she does obviously stand out. 'People treat her like a baby and stare at her in the street but I just have to try and explain to her that they don’t understand.' Most children diagnosed with Morquio . disease will not grow taller than one metre and suffer changes to their . skeleton leaving them unable to walk by their teens. Enola is missing the enzyme which breaks down cell waste which results in her body retaining materials that could damage her organs, bones and joints. Despite Enola not growing in stature her internal organs will continue to grow causing life threatening complications. Her mother said: 'She has been on the replacement therapy trial since 2009 were she is given the enzyme Vimizim once a week for four hours. 'We know that it isn’t going to reverse what she has but it will reduce some of the symptoms that morquio can cause and make her more comfortable.'

Davis, who hasn't played since picking up a serious injury staring for the New York Knicks in May 2012, revealed all about his unusual experience in a recent podcast. ‘I was actually abducted by aliens two weeks ago,’ he told west coast hip hop website Westcoastrydaz.com. Basketball star Baron Davis claims he was recently abducted by aliens that he described as 'crazy looking people - half human, half ugly-looking mother f*****s' When his hosts asked for more details, he explained he that had been driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in the early hours of the morning what the incident happened. ‘I see this light and it’s a big a**truck. And I said, oh f**k this is going to be traffic,’ he said. ‘Driving, driving and the next thing you know there’s a steel thing and these crazy looking people – half human, half ugly-looking mother f*****s. ‘They were poking me on the nose, looking at my eyes, they had my hands tied and the next thing you know I was in Montabello dude, burning rubber on the way back to L.A. at 4 o’clock in the morning.’ Baron Davis hasn't played since picking up a serious knee injury staring for the New York Knicks in May 2012 . Despite the unlikely nature of the incident, the two-time NBA All-Star sounded deadly serious and he stood by his claim even when his hosts asked him repeatedly if it was true. Davis said he couldn’t explain how he traveled so far, so quickly and said after his ordeal was over he  had to go to a nearby In N Out Burger to calm down. He said he ate two burgers while shaking profusely and wondering what had happened to him. ‘I don’t think it was an abduction cause now I am sharper and s**t. I am retaining information,’ Davis said. Drafted as the third pick in 1999 by the Charlotte Hornets, Davis went on to play for the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers and Cleveland Cavaliers before signing with New York as a free agent in 2011. Outside of the sport he has acted in movies such as 'The Cookout' and guest-starred on TV shows 'Lincoln Heights' and 'The Forgotten'.

"By . Miles Goslett . The BBC Trust is paying one of the Corporation’s former executives a six-figure sum to conduct a secret inquiry into its stars’ earnings. Mark Oliver’s firm Oliver & Ohlbaum Associates will investigate whether the BBC’s top ‘talent’ – including Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Jeremy Clarkson and Fiona Bruce – is being overpaid. More than 250 BBC employees earn at least £250,000 a year and 14 earn more than £500,000 but the BBC refuses to name them. Graham Norton (left) is believed to take home £2.6m-a-year making him the BBC's highest earner while Jeremy Clarkson (right) earns £1m each year . It is understood that Norton is the BBC’s highest earner, on £2.6million a year, with Lineker said to earn £2million a year, Clarkson £1million a year, Fiona Bruce £500,000 and Tess Daly £250,000, leading to fears that ‘talent’ salaries are out of hand. The BBC says that it must pay such wages to keep up with commercial rivals. Yet despite going to the expense of hiring Mr Oliver’s agency, the BBC Trust has already said some details from the report, such as ‘individual talent deals’, will remain secret, preventing licence fee-payers from knowing how much the BBC pays its stars and how these compare to those in the commercial sector. A review is being launched to find out if the BBC's top 'talent' is being paid too much money . Girls' big payday: Fiona Bruce is thought to collect £500,000 while Strictly star Tess Daly gets £250,000, . The BBC Trust maintains the study ‘will compare the size and structure of the BBC’s reward packages with those offered by other broadcasters’. But this has triggered doubts about the ethics of employing a third party to find out what commercial rivals pay when the BBC will not reveal what its own publicly funded employees earn. Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This doesn’t seem a reasonable use of licence-fee money.’ This is the second time the firm run by Mr Oliver – who was the BBC’s head of strategy from 1989 to 1995 – has carried out a review of stars’ pay for the BBC. In 2008, an identical exercise concluded that no employees were being overpaid. Gary Lineker is the BBC's second highest earner taking home a cool £2m-a-year . A Freedom of Information request submitted by The Mail on Sunday to the BBC has revealed that five ‘key staff’ from Oliver & Ohlbaum will work on the project, the findings of which are expected to be published at the end of the year. In addition, an unspecified number of other employees of the firm, based in Notting Hill, west London, will assist. The BBC has refused to say how much it is spending on the review, but an industry insider said this weekend that it is ‘easily more than £100,000’, given the number of staff involved and its scope. A BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘The intention of this review is to ensure that licence fee-payers are getting a good deal on talent. It has never been our intention that the BBC or the Trust will have access to raw pay data of other broadcasters, and no details of individual talent deals for either the BBC or other broadcasters will be published.’","More than 250 BBC employees earn at least £250,000 a year and 14 earn more than £500,000 but the BBC refuses to name them .

"By . Martha Cliff . Forget beef, us Brits have got a new have got a new favourite meat when it comes to roast dinners and even BBQs. And it's a rather rarefied one: sales of venison have reportedly risen by 400 per cent over the last year. The meat, derived from deer, is quickly increasing in popularity with high street supermarkets expanding their venison ranges to cater to the demand. The game meat has increased in sales by 400 per cent in just one year . This news comes following data from market analysts, Kantar Worldpanel who found that sales of the game meat had rocketed by 413 per cent year on year, from £1.2 million in June 2013 to £6.4 million last month. It appears that supermarkets are preparing to cater to this surge in popularity with The Grocer magazine reporting that Sainsbury's will roll out a new venison line this autumn under its Taste The . Difference range. It has also increased the distribution of . its venison lines which include sausages, burgers and diced steak with a . sauce. Tesco are also reported to have rolled out a . seven-strong Tesco Chef's Selection range including venison burgers, . meatballs and steaks from supplier Highland Game across the UK in April. Even low-cost supermarkets have jumped on the bandwagon with a venison Wellington being one of the major players in Asda's Christmas product range this year. The meat has already been revealed as a major player in Asda's Christmas product range . Asda, which is sourcing its venison Wellington from Northern Ireland supplier Finnebrogue, said the launch reflected the increasing quality of its Christmas range and said that shoppers were looking for a 'wow factor.' A spokesman from Asda told The Grocer: 'Finnebrogue has put itself on the map and are bringing venison to the fore but in an easy format.' The Downpatrick-based supplier, which also make the retailer's Extra Special sausage range, has also noticed a surge in the sale of venison and as a result has ramped up production following a £3 million expansion of its facility in January. The surge in popularity could also be down to its health benefits, boasting more protein than any other red meat.

"By . Will Stewart . Four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and an Mi-24 helicopter gunship shot down as Kiev's government leaders claimed they were now engaged in 'war' with pro-Russian forces. At least 30 troops were also wounded in fierce clashes around Sloviansk, epicentre of the unrest in Ukraine's east, amid accusations insurgents were shooting from apartment blocks and using civilians as human shields. A number of civilians were injured as there appeared to be no let-up in Ukraine's alarming bloodshed even as the first funerals were held for victims burned to death in Odessa's fire massacre. Scroll down for video . Ukrainian soldiers stay near of a checkpoint seized by them not far of Slaviansk, Ukraine . At least 30 troops were also wounded in fierce clashes around Sloviansk, epicentre of the unrest in Ukraine's east . The latest flashpoints came as Russia warned that peace on the European continent is now threatened by the deepening crisis, a situation it blames entirely on the new political rulers in Kiev and their Western supporters. But there is increasing evidence of a political bandwagon running in Moscow pressing Vladimir Putin to send tanks into Ukraine to protect pro-Russian citizens from what is seen as attack by a fascist-led government in Kiev. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said the unrest was now 'fraught with such destructive consequences for Europe's peace, stability and democratic development that it is absolutely necessary to prevent it'. Supervising the assault on pro-Moscow insurgents in Sloviansk, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov hit back: 'They are waging a war on us, on our own territory. My mission is to eliminate the terrorists.' And interim president Oleksandr Turchynov warned of new Russian provocations which could erupt on Friday in the wake of commemorations of the defeat of the Nazis in 1945. 'War is in effect being waged against us, and we must be ready to repel this aggression,' he said. The head of Ukraine's national guard, Stepan Poltorak, said 800 well-armed insurgents were surrounded in Sloviansk. Family members mourn 21-year old nurse Yulia Izotova during her funeral in Kramatorsk, Ukraine . At least three people were killed and several were injured in clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in the eastern city of Sloviansk . 'We have bottled them up in the centre', he said. Russia claimed an 'humanitarian disaster is brewing' here and in other towns encircled by Ukrainian troops with medicine and food shortages. In Moscow, two party leaders in the Russian parliament demanded military action in Ukraine, the West's worst nightmare. Sergey Mironov, leader of mainstream the Just Russia party demanded: 'Fascist scoundrels must be crushed in their own nests. We need to get troops there to defend our brothers.' Vladimir Putin has signed a law banning swearing in films, television broadcasts, theatres and the media. And books which contain swear words will have to carry warnings on the cover. Breaking the law – in force from July 1 – will incur a fine of £800 for organisations and £40 for individuals. It is seen as a throwback to Communist rule, when artists and writers were told to avoid 'decadent Western fashions'. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, founded of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party, called for military action ahead of Firday's commemoration known as Victory Day. 'Then the country will breathe freely - and can celebrate another victory,' he said. The strongman Chechen leader joined the chorus declaring he was 'sure' Putin 'will take measures to protect civilians in the Sloviansk and other cities of Ukraine'. With tens of thousands of Russian soldiers close to the Ukrainian frontier, he  warned: 'We cannot sit back and watch when civilians are killed.' Putin's spokesman claimed the West lacked sanity in its approach to the crisis. 'We do not see that Europe and the US are sane in their assessments,' said Dmitry Peskov. The Kremlin also said a new Russian report shows 'grave violations of fundamental principles and norms in the sphere of human rights in Ukraine have acquired a mass scale'. The protestations from Moscow increased Western concerns that Russia is seeking pretexts for deploying troops, possible to ensure referendums take place on Sunday in Donetsk and Lugansk aimed at the regions seceding. The report alleged pro-Kiev protesters wore NATO 'military gear' and that some protesters were wounded by 'NATO ammunition'. Moscow has hugely boosted its military air power in Crimea, and deployed strategic jets and fighter bombers, say experts. Meanwhile, in the Russian-annexed region, a senior Tatar Muslim leader Mustafa Dzhemilev has been silenced. Crimea's pro-Moscow leader alleged: 'There are no doubts that this man has been tasked by Western special services with destabilising the situation.'","At least 30 troops were also wounded in fierce clashes around Sloviansk .

"By . Steph Cockroft . 'Confidence coach' Lydia Frempong, from Cheam, Surrey, falsely claimed £5,000 in benefits by pretending she was unemployed . A life coach hired by Channel 4 to give confidence lessons to staff swindled £5,000 in false benefits by pretending she was unemployed. Lydia Frempong, from Cheam, Surrey, pocketed more than £4,500 in Jobseeker's Allowance and more than £500 in Council Tax Benefit, despite a raft of experience as an events organiser and 'confidence coach'. Frempong, who has a life coaching diploma from Cambridge University, boasts on her website about her 'extensive' experience in the life coach sector, including with the TV broadcaster. Her website also says that she has worked . 'extensively' with media professionals and celebrities 'to aid career progression and . improve confidence'. But Camberwell Green Magistrates' court heard how Frempong scammed taxpayers out of Council . Tax Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance, between . July 2012 and January 2013. The businesswoman, who now runs her own business Butterfly PR, pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly failing to notify Sutton Council about a change in her circumstances, which meant she was no longer entitled to the benefits. After her convictions, she told MailOnline it was an 'oversight' and that she had not intended to 'utilise the system'. She said: 'I have always been a industrious person who has contributed towards society and this particular incident was an oversight as I was trying to establish a new career. 'It was not my intention to utilise the system in this way and I have been working hard since I was a teenager. 'I would like to now put this regrettable incident behind me, pay back what is owed and move forward.' Frempong's scam was revealed during a probe by the benefit investigation team at Sutton Council which found she had been falsely paid £4,525 in Jobseeker's Allowance and £520 in Council Tax Benefit. She was sentenced to 110 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £60. She also paid court costs of £85. Frempong - who was described in court as being of previous good character - was also ordered to pay back . the money. Speaking after the case, Councillor . Nick Emmerson, lead member for revenues and benefit at the council said: 'Thanks to our benefits investigation team we found that Ms . Frempong lied in order to falsely claim thousands of pounds in benefits. 'We . believe in a fair council that supports residents with the benefits . they are entitled to. Ms Frempong has abused the system and must now . return this money.' Frempong pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud at Camberwell . Green Magistrates' Court after falsely claiming Jobseeker's Allowance - . even though she was employed as a life coach, including by Channel 4 . On her website, Frempong describes . herself as a self-made entrepreneur who spent . four years working at the Media Trust - which works with charities in . the media and of which Channel 4's Jon Snow is chair - where she says . she generated £1m worth of revenue . from scratch. She then . created her own business, Butterfly PR, which 'has been responsible for . the success of myriad personalities, events, organisations and . partnerships'. In 2011, Frempong . was also given the 'Leadership in the . Workplace Award' by Business in the Community - a charity endorsed by Prince Charles. 'I would like to now put this regrettable incident behind me, pay back what is owed and move forward' Lydia Frempong . She began working for Channel 4 as an ambassador and workshop leader for a careers advice roadshow, before being hired on a 'freelance basis' to 'deliver . life coaching sessions, encourage personal development and further . career progression for their employees'. At the time of her appointment, Channel . 4 described Frempong as 'an exceptionally talented coach and trainer'. It says: 'As a confidence coach, Lydia is passionate about developing the potential in people, and has a particular interest in coaching young people to develop professionally and emulate her success.' According to her website, her other work includes delivering motivational talks and appearing on key industry panels such as the Ernst & Young and Future 100 Awards. A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'Lydia Frempong has worked with Channel 4 on an ad-hoc freelance basis. She is not an employee of the corporation.'","Lydia Frempong from Cheam, Surrey, has life coach diploma from Cambridge .

Dozens of Calgary police are searching a sprawling farm outside the Canadian city after a tip in the disappearance of a young boy and his grandparents led them to the property. Authorities released a CCTV image of a pickup they believe is . linked to the disappearance of five-year-old Nathan O'Brien and Alvin and Kathryn Liknes, and locals had them at the truck owner's home in less than 24 hours. The late 1980s . - early 1990s green Ford F-150 was seen in the Park Hill area the trio was in around the time they . are believed to have gone missing, police said. A man has been taken in for questioning, but has not been identified because he has yet to be charged with a crime. No stone unturned: Officers are walking every inch of every field on the farm after tips led them to the property . Searching buildings: Police in what resembled Haz-Mat suits also looked through buildings on the property . massive effort: Dozens of police officers shuttled up from Calgary to the rural plot of land to look for the missing five-year-old boy and his grandparents . The property owners are an elderly couple who have lived there for decades and have an adult son in his 50s who lives at home and mostly keeps to himself, neighbors told Global News. A man has been taken in for questioning but has not yet been charged with any wrongdoing, Calgary Police Service Duty Inspector Jow Matthews said during a Saturday press conference. Gone: Five-year-old Nathan O'Brien went missing from his grandparents house sometime Sunday night or Monday morning . 'Police were led to the property yesterday evening following a tip after the public appeal for information relating to the truck,' said Matthews. 'It’s simply a lead that we’re following up… that we believe has some weight.' 'We’re questioning the man and following the lead on the vehicle,' Matthews continued. 'He is a person of interest.' Aerial footage from Global News showed teams of officers walking every inch of the fields on the property and planting orange flags near areas of interest. Officers in what resembled Haz-Mat suits were also seen searching buildings on the massive property. Two other searchers could be seen emptying grain from a large truck one bucket at a time. Police appear to be leaving no stone unturned in their search of the farm. 'They were quite hush hush,' neighbor Jimmy Nevada told Global News. 'The SWAT team was out checking buildings and what not.' Police vehicles lined the street in front of the farm and dotted the plot of land it sits on. 'We want to make sure that we cover every avenue, we want to cover off that ground as quickly as we can,' Matthews said, adding that he expects searchers to be there for a total of 24 to 36 hours. The massive search effort came only . one day after a still of the pickup truck was released to the public in a . nationally televised press conference. Not suspects: Alvin and Kathryn Liknes are not . considered suspects in the case, since investigators found signs of a . struggle in the home . 'We just believe given . the area the vehicle was in, and the fact that it was the night of the . incident and that it drove in the area several times, that there's a . good possibility that the individual, or individuals, may have . information,' Calgary police Staff Sgt.

"By . Ashley Collman . Charges have finally been filed in the murder case of a 28-year-old Kirkland, Washington woman who prophesized her own untimely death. Amy Hargrove was found dead in her bed on January 6, after spending the weekend reuniting with her abusive boyfriend Burrell Cushman, 28. The young mother tragically died after expressing concern her boyfriend, father to her toddler son, would ultimately kill her. 'A piece of paper isn’t going to save my life when he finally gets me, but at least you will know who killed me,' Hargrove wrote in a 2012 restraining order petition against Cushman. Tainted love: Young 28-year-old mother Amy Hargrove (left) was found strangled to death on January 6. Five months later, her allegedly abusive boyfriend Burrell Cushman, 28 (right), has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder for her death . 'A piece of paper isn't going to save my life...but at least you will know who killed me,' are the words Hargrove (right) wrote in a 2012 restraining order against Cushman (center). She let the father of her toddler son back into her life last November, when the no-contact order was still in place . While Cushman was initially considered a person of interest in the homicide, he wasn't officially arrested in the case until Thursday. On Tuesday, Cushman was charged with second-degree murder in King County Superior Court and is currently being held on $1.5million bond. Investigators said it took a while to gather enough evidence to arrest Cushman, who admitted to spending the weekend with Hargrove but said he never hurt her. Police spokesman Mike Murray explained the several months it took to arrest Cushman, saying investigators had to rule out other suspects and wait on crime lab tests results. Hargrove had recently moved back into her childhood home to escape Burrell, but that didn't last for long. Around November, she reunited with the boyfriend because he was the father of one of her children. But even then, she admitted to Cushman's mom that she regretted the decision. Hard to stay away: Hargrove allegedly moved back into her childhood home to escape Cushman, but eventually got back together with her boyfriend sometime around November . 'I cannot stand up for myself of get away from him now without a major disaster,' she texted Cushman's mother, according to a police affidavit. 'I'm scared that I'm not going to live through this once hell (sic) kill me,' she wrote. Hargrove's worst fears were allegedly realized the weekend of January 4-5 when the couple left their son with Cushman's mom for some alone time. Hargrove appears to have been killed sometime on January 5, since records show she stopped using her phone and using social media. That afternoon, Cushman called his mother crying about a fight he had with his girlfriend and told her: 'Mom, I got a bad feeling about tonight'. Hargrove's mother was the one who found her daughter's body, bruised and cold to the touch the next day. A medical examiner ruled that Hargrove died from suffocation. Denials: Cushman told police he left Hargrove's house on January 5, and last saw her alive, smoking marijuana by the slider door . Won't stop: In addition to the murder charges, Cushman is also the subject of a domestic abuse  investigation for allegedly punching his new, pregnant, girlfriend in the stomach last month. Pictured with Hargrove above . Gruesome discovery: Hargrove was found dead at her parents home on the 9400block of NE 130th Place in Kirkland on January 6 . Police responding to the scene found a 'red hot' pan on the stove in the kitchen covered in cooking oil from floor to ceiling. Hargrove's body was partially covered with a blanked that was also draped over a space heater placed up hugh next to the bed, according to the affidavit. Police found no sign of forced entry, robbery or sexual assault. Investigators found DNA belonging to Cushman underneath her fingernails. Cushman was questioned after Hargrove's body was found, and admitted to spending the weekend with her but denied hurting her. He told police that he and Hargrove 'argued multiple times because of his ""wandering eye"". Cushman said he left Hargrove's room the afternoon of January 5, and the last time he saw his girlfriend she 'was alive, sitting and smoking marijuana by the slider door and yelling at him.' In addition to the murder charges, Cushman is also the subject of a domestic assault investigation for allegedly punching his new, pregnant, girlfriend in the stomach last month. Cushman is a three-time convicted felon, with convictions including third-degree assault, first-degree negligent driving and attempting to elude law enforcement. In the 2012 restraining order petition, Hargrove claimed Cushman beat her on a regular basis (even when she was pregnant with his child), raped her at gunpoint and forced her to have sex with one of his relatives. Cushman is set to be arraigned on July 22.","Amy Hargrove, 28, was found strangled to death in her home last January .

Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 on May 23 after years of what he claimed was rejection and ridicule and sexual jealousy because he was a virgin. He took his own life after his shooting rampage and it was claimed in the days afterwards that his family had tried to get him professional help weeks before the massacre. The killer's mother, Li-Chin Rodger, was the first one to realize that something was awry at the time of his killing spree. Promising: Christopher Martinez had planned to study in London for a year before starting law school . Victim: Christopher, 20, was one of six students to be killed in May's attack . Emotional: One day after his son was shot dead, Richard Martinez, center, blamed Christopher's death on 'irresponsible politicians and the NRA' Li-Chin, who have been divorced for many years, received an email from her 22-year-old son shortly after 9pm on May 25 which included a 140-page manifesto. She immediately went to Elliot's YouTube page and saw that he had uploaded a video called 'Retribution' wherein he describes how he plans to slaughter sorority girls. His mother knew something was horribly wrong and she called her ex, filmmaker Peter, and after they watched the video, they called 911. Both parents rushed to the scene separately and reportedly realized they were too late once they heard news reports of the ongoing rampage on the car radio. In the immediate aftermath the parents gave permission to a close friend to speak to the media on their behalf, explaining how Elliot had been receiving professional help for some time. '(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,' Simon Astaire told CNN. 'They thought he was in good hands.' Change: Richard Martinez, who son Christopher was shot dead in May's attack, called for tougher gun laws . Richard Martinez has become a crusader for more stringent gun laws in the wake of his son's killing. In late May, Martinez addressed a crowd of about 20,000 who gathered for the University of California Santa Barbara memorial, the crowd got to their feet and joined his chant of 'Not One More'. Mr Martinez used the memorial to call for an end to gun violence, telling the crowd: 'Too many people have died, and there should be not one more,' NBC Los Angeles reported. 'How many more people are going to have to die in this situation before the problem gets solved?' he asked. 'They [politicians] have done nothing and that's why Chris died ... in my opinion,' Mr Martinez said. 'It's almost become a normal thing for us to accept [mass shootings] ... It's not normal. Life doesn't have to be like this.' Composed: Richard Martinez also read statements from relatives of other victims, including the Hong family who called for 'Hatred to be gone with the wind'","Peter Rodger's first televised interview will air in a special edition of 20/20 on Friday at 10pm .
