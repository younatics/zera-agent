"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old sophomore who held his classmates and a teacher hostage for about five hours Monday at his northeast Wisconsin high school, and then turned one of his guns on himself as police approached, died on Tuesday, police said. Samuel Hengel was pronounced dead at 10:44 a.m., Marinette, Wisconsin, Police Chief Jeff Skorik told reporters. Skorik previously had said the youth was in grave condition at a Green Bay hospital. Hengel shot himself as police broke into the Marinette High School classroom after hearing gunshots Monday night. He initially was taken to a Marinette hospital and later was transferred to Green Bay, Skorik said. All the hostages were unharmed. Skorik said Tuesday that police are still trying to determine a motive, saying the student was well-liked, had no prior law enforcement contact and ""was a good student."" Authorities interviewed Hengel's parents Monday night, he said. ""I was unaware of any problems with this particular student,"" said Principal Corry Lambie. ""He was a student in good standing."" ""We may never truly know why this happened,"" Marinette County District Attorney Allen Brey told reporters. He pledged to provide a complete report on the incident. Authorities lauded teacher Valerie Burd for helping keep Hengel and the other students calm and potentially saving lives. The students themselves also were commended, with police saying they attempted to engage Hengel in conversation and keep him from becoming agitated. ""Five or six"" shell casings from both of Hengel's weapons -- a .22-caliber semi-automatic and a 9 mm semi-automatic -- were found in the classroom, Skorik said. Bullets for those weapons also were found in Hengel's pocket at the hospital, and a duffel bag left in the classroom contained ""numerous live rounds,"" he said. A bomb squad was called in to X-ray and remove the bag, Skorik said. A knife also was recovered, but it was unclear whether it was in the bag, police said. Police entered the classroom, on a below-ground level, after hearing three gunshots Monday. However, based on witness accounts as well as the shell casings, authorities believe Hengel also fired the weapons ""prior to police arrival and prior to the school being aware of the situation,"" Skorik said. It appeared the student did not aim at anyone, however, he said. Bullet holes were found in a desk and in some audio-visual equipment in the classroom. Police initially said the student was thought to have taken over the classroom before school ended about 3:10 p.m. But Skorik said Tuesday authorities think the student entered the class for ""sixth hour"" about 1:30 p.m. and took it over then, firing the first shots -- which apparently went unheard outside the room -- sometime after that. Officials believe Hengel did not bring the duffel bag into class, but asked to use the bathroom, then went to his locker and retrieved it, said school Superintendent Tim Baneck. The student prevented anyone from leaving the room and would communicate only with police via the teacher, Skorik said. Hengel apparently ordered that everyone give up their cell phones. The teacher used a land line telephone in the classroom to communicate with hostage negotiators, Lambie said. He said he was alerted to a possible problem when a parent came to the school and said his daughter had not responded to repeated calls to her cell phone. The office called Burd's classroom on the land line. Burd answered and was told the student's parent was trying to reach her. Lambie said he and his assistant principal went to Burd's classroom about 3:45 p.m. The door was locked, and the room was dark, he said. Lambie said he used his key to open the door and took a couple of steps inside. As he did, the female student whose parent had come to the school left without incident, he told reporters. But Hengel pointed the gun at him and told him to leave, Lambie said. He did so, and called 911. The girl's departure left 24 hostages still in the classroom, Lambie said. Hengel released five others about 7:40 p.m. after they used the bathroom, police said. Students coming to the classroom for their seventh-period class saw a note posted on the door directing them to report to the library, Baneck said. At 8:03 p.m., police positioned outside the classroom heard three gunshots and went inside the room. They confronted the suspect, who then fired one shot at himself. He was treated by medical personnel at the scene before being transported to the hospital. Skorik told reporters that as the incident drew to a close, the suspect received a call and became ""agitated."" He did not know who had called him. The remaining hostages, including Burd, then were put on a bus and brought to the courthouse to be reunited with their families. Parents had gathered in the jury assembly room along with counselors, police and school officials, Skorik said. Witnesses told police that the suspect was communicating with other students, and ""the dialogue at times, I'm told, was light,"" Skorik said. ""There were just general discussions, as far as we've gathered to this point. There was nothing specific identified by the hostage-taker as far as his reasoning behind holding those children in the class with a firearm."" At other times during the ordeal, the suspect was described as being ""quiet and sullen,"" the police chief said. He made no demands or requests of authorities during the incident. Follow-up interviews with the students, Burd and others were under way Tuesday, officials said. The school was closed Tuesday. Baneck said Monday that school officials were working to make counselors available to students and others affected by the incident. Officials plan to reopen the school Wednesday, officials said. Authorities were attempting to determine where the teen got the weapons and how he managed to get them into the school, Skorik said. Baneck said school officials would review the incident and ask if anything could have been done differently. ""If there are some things we could improve upon ... you can be assured we will be implementing that,"" he said. Marinette, a town of about 11,600 residents, borders Lake Michigan about an hour's drive north of Green Bay, Wisconsin. Marinette High School has about 700 students in grades nine through 12, Baneck said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","The suspect dies from a self-inflicted gunshot wound .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes-Benz will head up their own Formula One team next season after the German car manufacturer confirmed they have taken a 75.1 percent share in Brawn GP -- with Ross Brawn remaining as team principal. Mercedes engines powered Brawn's Jenson Button to the world championship this season -- while the team also claimed the constructors' championship. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton, Button's predecessor as world champion, was also sitting behind a Mercedes engine in his McLaren. The partnership between McLaren and Mercedes has been in place since 1995 and ended its 15th season together in 2009. The new team will become known as Mercedes Grand Prix, with Brawn in control, while Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug will work with the F1 team and the engine team of Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines. As part of the deal, Mercedes' parent company Daimler AG relinquished their 40 per cent stake in McLaren, but will remain their engine suppliers for the next six seasons. Daimler AG chief executive Dr. Dieter Zetsche explained in a press release: ""Mercedes-Benz is the most valued and best-known premium automotive brand in the world. ""This brand looks for competition of the utmost quality in all relevant fields in order to continually improve its performance in the face of such new challenges. ""Due to the new Formula One environment, we will face the competition in future on the most important motor sports stage with our own Silver Arrow works team. ""Our new Silver Arrow Formula One team is a great sporting and technical chal-lenge and we will tackle this with sporting spirit and full of enthusiasm."" The move could have ramifications for the out-of-contract Button, with Mercedes believed to favor an all-German partnership of Nico Rosberg and Nick Hiedfeld. Such a move could see Button link up with Hamilton at McLaren and the 29-year-old was believed to have toured McLaren's Woking factory last week. Brawn, who has previously baulked at meeting Button's wage demands, was thrilled with the deal after forming Brawn GP following the withdrawal of Honda from the sport. ""We are honored to be representing such a prestigious brand as Mercedes-Benz in Formula One next year and will be working together to do our best to reward their faith in our team,"" said Brawn on the team's official Web site. ""Brawn GP has been through an incredible journey over the last 12 months. From fighting for our survival to forging a strong relationship with Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines, winning both the constructors and drivers world championships, and now accepting Daimler's offer to buy our team, which will secure its future,"" he added.","Mercedes-Benz will head up their own Formula One team from next season .

"(CNN)  -- In-form superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi go head-to-head in Monday night's El Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the Camp Nou, which is set to have a significant bearing on the Spanish title race. The world's most expensive player Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in Real's 5-1 thrashing of Athletic Bilbao in their last league outing, which kept them one point ahead of Barca, who crushed Almeria 8-0. Messi, the reigning FIFA world player of the year, also netted a hat-trick for the defending champions, who have beaten Real in their last four league meetings. Ronaldo, who was on the receiving end last season as his team were pipped by the Catalan giants for the title, does not expect history to be repeated with his compatriot Jose Mourinho now in charge at the Bernabeu. Capturing sport's biggest characters . ""It could be a decisive match as the two sides are so even and these games could decide the championship,"" the Portuguese told AFP. ""It would be difficult for the losing team to take. ""We are stronger than last season and we go into the match without losing a match and have a lot more confidence and solidity. ""The team looks really good and the coach has given us a lot of confidence."" Mourinho, like his Barcelona counterpart Pep Guardiola, has spent the pre-match build-up trying to downplay the significance of a victory for either side. ""The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent,"" he told the official Real Madrid website. Blog: Are we in for the greatest El Clasico in history ? ""Nevertheless, whatever happens, 25 league games will still remain. I expect a beautiful game in which players help the referee and true football takes center  stage,"" he added. And this from Guardiola, who will be hoping his team can capitalize on home advantage to make it five wins in a row in the biggest derby match of all. ""This will not be decisive though, but whoever does win will surely be considered to be the champions for the next week at least,"" he told his club's official website. Mourinho is guaranteed a hot reception in the Camp Nou, having been a former assistant coach there under Bobby Robson before embarking on his incredible managerial career. ""I don't see any coaches worrying about how they may be received. My concentration won't falter if the stands are against me. I don't care. I just want to play football and enjoy it. That's all,"" claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season. Both teams are expected to be a virtual full strength, with the home side having a doubt over Gaby Milito, who missed training Sunday, while Kaka remains sidelined for Real Madrid. Ronaldo, who tops the La Liga scoring charts with 15, just ahead of Messi, claims the match is so much more than an individual battle between the pair. ""Talking about a duel between myself and Messi is nonsense,"" Ronaldo. ""I am just one player and I don't think I have more pressure than my teammates. We all have the responsibility to perform well. ""I am not obsessed by scoring goals and I am not obsessed by scoring against Barcelona."" Argentina ace Messi has scored in three out of their last four victories over Real, including a double in their 6-2 rout in the Bernabeu two seasons ago. ""Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind,"" Messi told AFP. ""Since the 6-2 at the Bernabeu I guess they have a real desire to beat us and this season they have strengthened with the new signings and (Jose) Mourinho."" The return El Clasico will see Real entertain Barca on the weekend of April 16/17 in the title run-in.","Real Madrid and Barcelona battle it out in Spain's El Clasico in the Camp Nou .

"(CNN) -- To hear Spc. Alexis Hutchinson tell it, the Army forced her to make an agonizing choice between serving her country and taking care of her son. The Army, however, takes issue with the soldier's story and Hutchinson could now be facing serious charges for desertion. When her unit deployed to Afghanistan earlier in November, Hutchinson was missing from the plane. Her lawyer said she refused to go because there was no one to take care of her 10-month-old son, Kamani, and she feared he would be placed in foster care. The Army said the young mother had plenty of time to sort out family issues and has been confined to her post at Fort Stewart, Georgia, while an investigation unfolds. Before shipping overseas, every soldier must sign military Form D-A 53-05, which states that failure to maintain a family care plan could result in disciplinary action. Hutchinson had agreed to such a plan and her mother, Angelique Hughes, took in Kamani in a month before Hutchinson's deployment date. But after a week with the infant, Hughes, who cares for ailing relatives and runs a day-care out of her home, said she felt so overwhelmed that she backed out. ""It was that hard, because he's a very busy baby,"" Hughes told CNN affiliate WTOC in Savannah, Georgia. ""You have to keep an eye on him 24 hours a day."" Hutchinson's attorney, Rai Sue Sussman, said the soldier informed the Army that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of Kamani. Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson said Hutchinson's unit had known for months about its pending deployment and that it wasn't until the last minute that Hutchinson notified the Army of her child-care woes. Like all soldiers who face similar circumstances, Hutchinson received a 30-day extension back in August and September, Larson said. That's ""plenty of time,"" he said, ""to work out another care plan."" On the eve of her unit's departure, Hutchinson was ordered to be on the plane. ""That's when it put her in this horrible situation of having to choose between abandoning her child or disobeying her superiors,"" Sussman said. ""The sense I got from her and the reason I think why she was scared enough to not go and get on her plane was because they would take her child from her."" Less than 24 hours after her fellow soldiers took off from Hunter Army Airfield, Hutchinson turned herself in and was arrested by military police. No charges have been filed. More than 30,000 single mothers have served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, according to a new report compiled by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Former Air Force JAG Officer Michelle McCleur said Hutchinson is not likely to win a legal battle with the Army. ""When soldiers are ordered to deploy, and single soldiers included, they have to have a family care plan in place ... and they need to implement that,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities said there was no danger at Texas A&M University after a report of a gunman on campus Thursday turned out to be a person with a replica weapon. A partial lockdown and campus-wide alert system went into effect after a bus driver spotted what he described as a man carrying what looked like an AK-47, officials said. The alert, known as a ""Code Maroon,"" was issued at 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET). It asked those on campus to ""seek safe shelter until further notice."" About an hour and a half later, an all-clear was given and business resumed as normal at the university, officials said. Texas A&M, located in College Station, Texas, has an enrollment of more than 49,000. It is the home of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, and also home to the Texas Aggie Corps of Cadets, the largest uniformed ROTC body outside of the service academies. Some members of the Corps are on special drill teams and are known to train with mock rifles on campus. Rudder Tower, where the alleged armed man was spotted, is one of the most heavily trafficked parts of campus.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will meet on U.S. Veterans Day with Chinese President Hu Jintao -- while both men are in South Korea -- as part of a hectic schedule of summit meetings, news conferences and cultural events on his upcoming four-nation trip to Asia, top administration officials said Thursday. The 10-day trip to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan encompasses a G-20 summit, an Asia-Pacific Economic Council summit, major holidays in India and Indonesia and bilateral talks with Hu and at least five other leaders, as well as four presidential news conferences, the officials told reporters. It's all part of an administration focus on Asia as a vital region for expanding trade and fighting terrorism, said Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. ""If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time,"" Rhodes said, later adding, ""We see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we're an Asian and a Pacific power."" After three days in India to start the trip, Obama heads to Indonesia to meet with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and attend a state dinner in the nation where he spent part of his childhood. The two-day visit also will include a news conference with Yudyohono, a visit to the Istiqlal Mosque and a public speech at a yet-to-be-determined outdoor venue to the people of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, Rhodes said. ""In that speech, he'll have a chance to talk about the partnership that we're building with Indonesia, but also to talk about some of the themes of democracy and development and our outreach to Muslim communities around the world, while also speaking of Indonesia's pluralism and tolerance as well,"" Rhodes said. ""While a Muslim majority, it's a host to a broad religious diversity, so this speech will give the president an opportunity to discuss some of the themes that many of you have heard him talk about and to do so, again, in a country where he can speak to the importance of Indonesia to him, personally, having lived there for several years in Jakarta as a boy,"" Rhodes added. The trip to South Korea is for the G-20 summit in Seoul, but also will include the bilateral meeting with Hu and a speech to U.S. troops stationed there on the Veterans Day holiday in the United States. Obama's talks with Hu will be their seventh bilateral meeting, along with three others the president has held with Chinese Premier Wen Jibao, for an unprecedented amount of top-level contact with China, noted Jeff Bader, the senior director for Asian affairs of the National Security Council. Bader said U.S.-Chinese relations have always included issues of cooperation and contention, and while attention focuses on the points of disagreement, he cited areas of agreement in recent years. ""We established a strategic and economic dialogue,"" Bader said. ""We've been favorable to greater Chinese participation, a greater role in the IMF and World Bank. We've worked with China, I think, quite well on Iran, on the U.N. Security Council resolution, which was a stronger resolution than anyone I think inside or outside the government would have anticipated when that process started."" Relations with China on other issues, such as climate change and North Korea's nuclear activities, were ""complicated,"" Bader said. He didn't mention U.S. complaints that China's currency is undervalued, resulting in a trade advantage for Chinese goods over American goods that contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. Obama's Seoul visit also includes a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and a news conference, Rhodes said. A message of the trip for North Korea will be the benefits to South Korea from its partnership with the United States and the West, according to Rhodes. ""South Korea and North Korea were basically equally developed 60 years ago and now you see a South Korea that is closely allied with the United States, that has embraced democracy, that has embraced open market reforms, is one of the most dynamic, growing economies and powers on the East Asia stage, but also the world stage, as evidenced by hosting the G-20,"" Rhodes said. In Japan, Obama will speak to a CEO Business Summit that is part of the APEC meeting, take part in the APEC events and hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It will be Obama's first meeting with Gillard since she became prime minister in August of what Bader called ""a close ally"" that has supported the U.S.-led NATO mission in Afghanistan. The trip concludes with a visit to the Great Buddha statue in Yokohama, which Obama visited as a child, Rhodes said. On Wednesday, Rhodes and other officials provided details of the India leg that starts of the trip -- a three-day visit that will include a speech to the Indian Parliament, a state dinner and laying a wreath at the grave of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. By starting in India, the president is signaling the importance of relations with a key economic ally, said Bill Burns, the undersecretary of state for political affairs. ""The simple truth is that India's rise and its strength and progress on the global stage is deeply in the strategic interest of the United States,"" Burns said, noting that Obama has called the U.S. relationship with India a ""defining partnership of the 21st century."" According to Rhodes, Obama will attend a business conference in Mumbai and visit the Gandhi Museum, then head to New Delhi for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the speech to Parliament and the state dinner. The trip also includes a town hall-style meeting with Indian students, a celebration of the Hindu holiday Diwali and a visit to Humayun's Tomb, an architectural precursor to the Taj Mahal. First lady Michelle Obama will accompany the president in India and Indonesia, while the two first daughters will remain home to continue their schooling, Rhodes said.","The president will visit India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan .

"(CNN) -- Romanian Interior Minister Vasile Blaga resigned Monday, three days after thousands of policemen rallied outside the presidential palace protesting a 25 percent pay cut. Blaga called his decision to leave a ""resignation of honor,"" adding he can not accept that the whole ministry is to be blamed for the actions of some protesters, which he called mistakes. The Interior Ministry oversees the police force. The protests prompted President Traian Basescu to call for an inquiry into discipline problems at the ministry. But Blaga said Monday the actions of 6,000 policemen cannot impugn the 150,000 employees who make up the ministry. ""I don't think one's gesture should be extended to all the ministry's employees,"" he said. About 6,000 Romanian policemen protested in front of the palace in Bucharest on Friday, many throwing their caps into the yard. They were unhappy with recent austerity measures that trimmed 25 percent off their paychecks. The officers also demanded that the president and his ministers resign. On Friday, Basescu dropped the police service from his protection detail, saying the protests ""undermined state's authority and the law has been broken with the uniforms themselves."" The next day, the prime minister also dropped police officers from his detail.","Blaga calls decision to quit a ""resignation of honor""

"(CNN) -- A porn actress who was with actor Charlie Sheen in a New York hotel when, according to police, he became emotionally disturbed this week wants his probation on a Colorado assault conviction revoked because of the incident, her spokesman said Thursday. Christina Walsh, who has made adult films under the name Capri Anderson, will fly to Aspen, Colorado, on Monday to speak with Pitkin County officials about the incident, which left her ""pretty shaken up,"" spokesman Kevin Blatt said. Sheen, 45, spent several hours in a New York hospital Tuesday after police responded to an early morning call about ""an emotionally disturbed person"" at the Plaza Hotel, a law enforcement source said. Sheen's representative blamed an ""adverse allergic reaction"" to a medication for the hospitalization. Police did not file any criminal charges against Sheen and none are expected, a New York Police Department spokesman said. While Blatt offered no details about what happened in Sheen's hotel room that left Walsh ""pretty scared,"" he called it ""a hard situation."" Walsh, 22, is a ""young girl"" who has ""never been in a situation like this before,"" he said. Sheen's three months of unsupervised probation from Pitkin County ends on November 2, according to an Aspen court official. Walsh has not contacted anyone in the prosecutor's office about the incident or her plans to meet with them, according to Chief Deputy District Attorney Arnie Mordkin. Without a criminal investigation -- which hasn't happened in New York -- a probation violation case could not be made, Mordkin said. Sheen's conviction there stemmed from his arrest last Christmas Day after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen police he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. A Colorado judge allowed the actor to count his time at a Malibu, California, rehab center toward a 30-day jail sentence after he entered a guilty plea in August to a misdemeanor third-degree assault charge. Sheen initially faced felony domestic violence charges; they were reduced by a plea deal. The son of actor Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen signed a contract last summer to continue with his hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men.""

"(CNN) -- Federal officials and residents across the country gave mixed reactions to U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton's preliminary injunction Wednesday against part of the controversial Arizona immigration law. The ruling at least temporarily blocks police from questioning people about their immigration status. Here are some of the opinions: . Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer . Brewer issued a statement Wednesday afternoon saying she's not ready to give up. ""This fight is far from over,"" she said. ""In fact, it is just the beginning, and at the end of what is certain to be a long legal struggle, Arizona will prevail in its right to protect our citizens. I am deeply grateful for the overwhelming support we have received from across our nation in our efforts to defend against the failures of the federal government. ""I have consulted with my legal counsel about our next steps. We will take a close look at every single element Judge Bolton removed from the law, and we will soon file an expedited appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit."" Earlier in the day, Brewer told reporters she thinks the ruling is a call to action for the federal government. ""I think it is important that they, the federal government, got relief from the courts to not do their job. That means now they have got this temporary injunction, they need to step up and do the job that they have the responsibility to do for the people of America and the people of Arizona."" Department of Justice . ""We believe the court ruled correctly when it prevented key provisions of SB 1070 from taking effect,"" the agency said in a written statement. ""While we understand the frustration of Arizonans with the broken immigration system, a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive. States can and do play a role in cooperating with the federal government in its enforcement of the immigration laws, but they must do so within our constitutional framework. ""This administration takes its responsibility to secure our borders seriously and has dedicated unprecedented resources to that effort. We will continue to work toward smarter and more effective enforcement of our laws while pressing for a comprehensive approach that provides true security and strengthens accountability and responsibility in our immigration system at the national level."" Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu and Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever . The two sheriffs whose Arizona jurisdictions are near the U.S.-Mexico border issued a joint statement denouncing the court ruling. ""Incredibly, even though there is not one person who can legitimately claim to be harmed by a law that has not even taken effect, the result of an injunction is de facto amnesty through non-enforcement of laws against illegal immigration,"" the sheriffs said. ""The ACLU and Justice Department are playing politics in demanding that law enforcement not act to protect the public but failing to do anything about our illegal crossing issue. It is putting our Deputies and the families we've sworn an oath to protect in harms way and we need the Government to stop the lawsuits and start taking corrective action. Help us, don't sue us."" ""The Obama administration has a light touch when it comes to securing the border but a heavy hand when it comes to sicking their lawyers on the people of Arizona. From Washington it might be hard to see the problems that we see every day as a result of our Swiss cheese border. Maybe if they spent some time in our counties they would think about a crackdown on illegal immigration rather than a crackdown on those of us fighting illegal immigration."" American Civil Liberties Union . ""This is a major step that will help protect the residents of Arizona against racial profiling and discrimination, and the Obama administration deserves praise for its principled decision to challenge this law despite pressure to stay silent,"" said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU. ""A single state's frustration with federal policy cannot be allowed to hijack federal authority or dictate federal priorities in ways that impede effective law enforcement, threaten the rights of citizens and non-citizens alike and violate core American values."" U.S. Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl of Arizona . ""We are deeply disappointed in the court's ruling today and disagree with the court's opinion that the Arizona's law will unduly 'burden' the enforcement of federal immigration law,"" the Republican senators said in a joint statement. ""Instead of wasting taxpayer resources filing a lawsuit against Arizona and complaining that the law would be burdensome, the Obama administration should have focused its efforts on working with Congress to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the federal government has failed to take responsibility."" National Council of La Raza . Janet Murguia, president and CEO of the Hispanic advocacy group, supported the ruling. ""Not only did the judge side with the Latino community, she sided with the Constitution,"" Murguia said in a written statement. ""This is an unequivocal victory. The ruling enjoins the crux of the law that would have legitimized racial profiling."" Obama administration . White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton said President Obama has not made plans to make a statement Wednesday on the Arizona immigration ruling. National Conference of State Legislatures . The group said Wednesday that states have filled a vacuum in immigration enforcement. The numbers of state bills addressing immigration has tripled since 2005, according to Ann Morse, program director for the center's immigrant policy project. ""This is an area where states have been involved for some time because the federal government has not,"" Morse told CNN. She expects the ruling to go the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime, the conference will consider enforcement measures, guest worker programs and steps to put immigrants on the path to legal status. The group wants to be a partner with the federal government and is concerned about economic issues, Morse said. League of United Latin American Citizens . LULAC, a Hispanic civil rights group, said the Arizona law would have placed an unfair burden on undocumented workers. ""We were worried about this leading to racial profiling,"" LULAC communications director Lizette J. Olmos told CNN. ""We're very excited [by the ruling], because this is what we've been wanting."" In a written statement, LULAC said it is also concerned about a lack of serious immigration reform. ""Arizona may be frustrated, as are we, with Congress' failure to seriously address comprehensive immigration reform,"" LULAC said. ""Nevertheless, the solution is not a patchwork of varying state laws each trying to be more repressive than the next to force immigrants to go elsewhere."" LULAC favors border control but wants the government to provide a ""pathway to citizenship,"" Olmos said. One provision, the Dream Act, would allow undocumented students to apply for permanent residency. The Center for Immigration Studies . The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates immigration reduction, was disappointed but not surprised by the ruling, said executive director Mark Krikorian. ""If the opponents hadn't turned it into this bogey man it would have been a useful, if modest, tool for the police,"" said Krikorian. He told CNN the Arizona law wasn't intended to usurp federal authority. ""Arizona does not have its own immigration policy, even with the law. They are buttressing federal law,"" Krikorian said. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, member of the House Judiciary Committee and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform . ""The federal government has a right and a responsibility to enforce existing laws, but when they fail to meet that responsibility, we should not stand in the way of the states that take action to respond to the very real threat of border violence, drug cartels and human smuggling,"" Issa said.

"(CNN) -- As many as 100 homes could be affected by flood waters in Wisconsin due to the failure of a 120-year-old sand levee along the Wisconsin River. The levee, near the city of Portage in Columbia County, began to give way Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service's Milwaukee/Sullivan office. Patrick Beghin, a representative of the Columbia County Emergency Operations Center, confirmed to CNN Monday that the levee had in fact failed. ""Once the levee completely fails ... it is unknown how far south the flood waters of the Wisconsin River will travel,"" the Weather Service said Sunday night. Portage Mayor Ken Jahn later told CNN that while the levee hadn't completely broken yet, it had deteriorated.  Local prison inmates were being used to help with sandbagging, he said. The levee is located on the south side of the Wisconsin River, just south of Portage. The weather agency urged residents to move to higher ground. Roadways, including parts of Interstate 39, could close. Authorities in Portage worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week. An alert sent out by Columbia County Emergency Management (CCEM) on Sunday urged residents near Blackhawk Park to evacuate immediately ahead of the flooding, which is expected to wash out a main road leading to about 150 residences. ""Emergency vehicles including police, fire and EMS will not be able to reach residents,"" the statement said. Kathy Johnson, the deputy director of the county's emergency management department, said Sunday it was unclear how many residents remained in the area. ""Anyone in there right now won't be able to come out,"" she said. A Red Cross shelter was opened at a nearby church to accommodate displaced residents. The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday, Beghin said.   Portage won't be considered to be out of danger until the river has dropped below flood levels, he added. Beghin noted that the flooding situation is not as widespread as it was during a similar 1993 flood, even though the river has now crested at a higher level than it did 17 years ago. The Wisconsin River crested around 12 a.m. Monday at 20.56 feet -- roughly 3.5 feet above flood level, according to Beghin and the National Weather Service, putting major pressure on the Caledonia-Lewiston levee system. Forecasts suggest the river at Portage will undergo a second peak in height on Tuesday morning, adding more pressure to the compromised levee. Officials with the Department of Natural Resources have been monitoring the failed levee for days and trying to repair problem areas.  But the levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- ""without any engineering design or adherence to any standards,"" the Natural Resources department said in a statement last week. ""This is a 120-year-old relic,"" Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources spokesman Greg Matthews said Sunday. ""It's made of sand. ... A modern levee that our engineers would be familiar with would be constructed of steel and concrete."" The levee's failure comes after a week of rainfall that dumped as much as 11 inches of rain in parts of Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota.  Portage itself, however, did not receive any of the heavy rain. Floodgates along the Menominee River in Niagara, Wisconsin, were opened in recent days to ease pressure on dams. Video showed a torrent of water gushing from an overflowing dam. ""I have never seen the water rage down like it is,"" CNN iReporter Jason Asselin said. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding. ""Even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they're still in flood, so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days,"" Jeras said. ""Many of these rivers are all going to be dumping into the Mississippi River which then in turn will rise up and we'll see some flooding there, maybe in La Crosse and the Winona areas later in the week.""

"Paris, France (CNN) -- More than 270 previously unknown works by Pablo Picasso recently came to light when a retired electrician sought to have them authenticated by the late artist's estate, the Picasso Administration said Monday. But in a strange twist, 71-year-old Pierre Le Guennec finds himself slapped with a lawsuit filed by the artist's son, Claude Picasso, and five other heirs who say the works are stolen. The lawsuit was first reported Monday by the French newspaper Liberation. The works -- a collection of cubist collages, drawings, lithographs, notebooks and a watercolor -- were revealed in January when Le Guennec contacted the Picasso estate by mail to request certification of authenticity. Along with the letter, Le Guennec included 26 photographs of previously unpublished Picasso pieces. He sent similar photographs of other works in his possession in March and April before traveling from his home in the south of France to the offices of the Picasso Administration in Paris with all 271 pieces. Christine Pinault, Claude Picasso's assistant and an employee of the Picasso Administration, said the artwork was reviewed by the family and others in the administration, who determined that the works are all authentic. The family's lawsuit, filed September 23, charges that Le Guennec hid stolen goods. France's Central Office for the Fight Against Traffic in Cultural Goods seized the pieces from Le Guennec's home on the French Riviera on October 5 and is holding them in a vault at its Nanterre office, northwest of Paris. Pinault said that one of the reasons the Picasso family is taking Le Guennec to court is because he hasn't adequately explained how he came across the works. Le Guennec ""hasn't given any response, not how, when or why"" the works were taken, she said. Jean Jacques Neuer, a lawyer for the Picasso family, also expressed skepticism to French television. ""We are dealing with a huge number of works, and it doesn't make sense that Picasso would give 271 works,"" he said. ""There are no documents which prove that this man was Picasso's close friend. It is simply unbelievable."" According to Liberation, Le Guennec worked as an electrician for the Spanish artist in the last three years of his life. The works are from a period spanning 1900 to 1932, according to the newspaper. Picasso, who lived most of his adult life in France, died in 1973. CNN's Winnie Andrews and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","A 71-year-old retired electrician sought to have 271 unknown works authenticated .

"(CNN) -- Iran has declared a two-day public holiday in Tehran after air pollution hit dangerous levels. All schools, public offices, universities and banks in the Iranian capital will be closed Wednesday and Thursday, the Islamic Republic New Agency reported. Tehran's downtown skyline was barely visible Tuesday. Residents have been asked to avoid outdoor activities and encouraged to use public transportation. Health warnings have been issued informing people suffering from lung and heart conditions to stay at home, as well as the elderly and children, according to Iran's Ministry of Health's website. Police officers, taxi drivers and other workers who are forced to work outside are required to wear surgical masks while on the job, the ministry said. This is the second time in less than a week Iran has declared a public holiday due to extreme pollution. Tehran shut down last Wednesday to cut down on emissions and traffic. The government says despite a 40 percent drop in traffic since the last holiday, the pollution has reached critical levels. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos says conditions could worsen due to a combination of dry air, low wind and lack of rain. Iran has fought pollution for decades, specifically in the sprawling Tehran metropolis which is home to an estimated 12 million people. The city already implements traffic plans that require a special permit to drive though downtown Tehran. Cars must also alternate driving days, depending on their license plate numbers. According to research by Tehran's municipal government, over 80 percent of the pollution is caused by some 4 million cars operating throughout the capital, state-run Press TV reported. ""In our long-term plans to solve the pollution problem, we will get rid of old and dilapidated autos, standardize our auto manufacturing, upgrade the quality of our fuel and our mass transit system,"" Mohammad-Javad Mohammadizadeh, head of Iran's Environmental Protection Agency said, the semi-official Mashregh news reported Monday. Mohammadizadeh also said the government is considering artificially creating rain and wind. About 2,500 people in Tehran die every year because of health problems caused by pollution, Iran's Environmental Protection Agency has said. CNN's Shirzad Borzorgmehr contributed to this report.","Tehran's schools, public offices, universities and banks close Wednesday and Thursday .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors took a major step Tuesday toward banning  medical marijuana dispensaries in the county's unincorporated areas. A proposal for the ban in unicorporated areas was unanimously endorsed by the county supervisors and is  scheduled to be formally adopted on December 7, officials  said. The ordinance would then take effect 30 days later, officials  said. Meanwhile, the Orange County Board of Supervisors also approved Tuesday, by a 4-1 vote, a first reading of an identical ban. A second and final reading is scheduled, also for December 7, a spokeswoman said. ""Attracting crime and other nuisances, these facilities have a negative impact on the communities where they've operated -- leading more than 100 cities and nine counties in California to pass similar ordinances,"" said Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich.  ""Since many municipalities in Los Angeles County currently have either a ban or moratorium, adjacent unincorporated communities would become the obvious location of choice for dispensary operators -- creating an undue burden for residents in these areas."" Both measures address a growing number of illegally operated medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas of the two counties. Officials cited health and safety concerns, saying food products containing marijuana that are produced without regulation could contain potentially harmful ingredients, food borne disease and pesticide residue. The proposals in the first and third largest counties in California mark another setback for advocates seeking to advance marijuana into mainstream society. Earlier this month, California voters rejected a proposal to legalize the drug, though medical marijuana is legal throughout the state. The Los Angeles County ban affects unincorporated communities with a population of 1.5 million people. In Orange County, the ban would affect 119,000 people, a spokeswoman said. In 2006, Los Angeles County revised its zoning regulations to allow for medical marijuana dispensaries. But Los Angeles County officials are now concerned about a growing number of illegally operating dispensaries. Los Angeles city officials recently began a crackdown on such illegal dispensaries within the city. Almost all Orange County cities have taken a hard line against medical marijuana dispensaries, partly because officials contend that criminal activity is prevalent near the storefronts, according to a November 17 memo by Orange County Public Works Director Jess Carbajal. No cities within Orange County allow for marijuana stores except for Laguna Woods, Carbajal said. Twenty-two cities have prohibition ordinances, and nine more have urgency moratoriums against the dispensaries, Carbajal said. Tuesday's legislative action occurred as the National Cannabis Industry Association was formed the same day, as the first national trade group representing the interests of the multi-billion-dollar cannabis industry and its consumers. The group materialzes in the wake of Arizona voters legalizing medical marijuana this week, becoming the 15th state to do so. ""It's hard to believe that either county would take such an action when we're sitting in the midst of an economic depression and they're turning down good jobs in the county -- not to mention the millions in sales taxes -- and then putting in their place vacant buildings,"" said Aaron Smith, the association's executive director. As for the illegal stores, Smith said he understood such concerns but questioned a ban to remedy the problem. ""It's such a legitimate concern but they are using a sledgehammer approach. If they are concerned about them operating illegally, then have oversight,"" Smith said.","Marijuana industry spokesman criticizes bans as ""sledgehammer approach""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pilot of a doomed plane that crashed, killing 50 people, said ""Jesus Christ"" and ""We're down,"" seconds before the plane hurtled from the night sky into a house outside Buffalo, New York, in February. An investigator walks past the wreckage from a plane crash in Clarence Center, New York, in February. The last sounds heard in the cockpit were First Officer Rebecca Shaw saying ""We're"" and then screaming at 10:16 p.m. on February 12, according to a transcript of the cockpit recording. Seconds earlier, the pilot, Capt. Marvin Renslow, said, ""Jesus Christ,"" as a sound ""similar to stick shaker"" was heard, the transcript said. Renslow said, ""We're down,"" and a thump was heard before Shaw said, ""We're"" and screamed. The National Transportation Safety Board released the transcript of the cockpit recording on Tuesday as it began a three-day hearing in Washington on the crash.  See how crash of Flight 3407 unfolded » . Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one man in the house. About five minutes before the crash, Shaw had shared with Renslow her fear of flying in icy conditions, according to the transcript. ""I don't want to have to experience that and make those kinds of calls. You know I'dve freaked out. I'dve [sic] had like seen this much ice and thought, 'oh my gosh, we were going to crash,"" Shaw told Renslow. The NTSB's preliminary investigation determined there was some ice accumulation on the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, but that ""icing had a minimal impact on the stall speed of the airplane."" Watch more on the NTSB investigation » . In a story Monday, the Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a ""stick pusher,"" which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. Colgan Air, the operator of Continental Connection flights, said Monday that Renslow had never trained in a flight simulator with the safety system that activated just before the plane went down. Colgan said there is no regulatory requirement that it provide hands-on training with the ""stick pusher."" ""A stick pusher demonstrated in an aircraft simulator is not required by the FAA,"" the airline said in a statement. ""And thus was not included in Colgan's Q400 training program."" The Federal Aviation Administration said its standards do not require hands-on practice with the safety system. ""That's a significant problem,"" veteran pilot Douglas Moss told CNN. Moss, an expert in stall recovery, believes flight simulator practice with a stick pusher should be mandatory for aspiring pilots. ""It's similar to picking up and throwing a groundball in baseball. You can study it academically all you want to but you really need to develop the proficiency, the skill, the muscle memory required to do that,"" said Moss. Renslow had failed five pilot tests, known as ""check rides,"" three of which occurred before he joined the airline, Colgan Air said. Renslow had revealed only one of those failures to the airline, according to Colgan. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said Tuesday that the board's hearing will not address who is to blame for the accident. ""Over the course of this hearing, we will continue to collect information that will assist the safety board in its examination of safety issues arising from this accident,"" he said. He said those issues are: airplane performance, cold weather operations, a sterile cockpit, flight crew training and performance, and fatigue management.

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday afternoon, President Obama will meet with Republican Congressional leaders for the first time since the midterm election. The White House meeting had been dubbed the ""Slurpee summit,"" but it's going to take something stronger than a flavored ice shake to cut through the deep distrust that's accumulated between these two parties. The Kool-Aid that gets passed around Washington most often these days is the belief that our political opponents are sworn enemies. It is an idea compounded by partisan media that demonizes even minor disagreements. But it wasn't always this way. In the past, Democrats and Republicans could disagree on policies throughout the day, then meet together for a drink or dinner. Their children went to school together. Their families saw each other on the weekends or at worship services. But now congressmen fly home from Washington as often as possible. There is very little time for across-the-aisle socializing and much more time for accusing opponents of being socialist. Our political leaders don't get to know each other as people. That's where the cigarette comes in. It's a strange fact that Obama and speaker-elect John Boehner have been known to smoke, while the majority of Americans have given up this once common vice. It is a streak of illogic and self-destructiveness in otherwise disciplined and ambitious men who have climbed to the top of their field without wheezing. So if Boehner and Obama are both going to be tempted to sneak out for a smoke at some point during their bipartisan summit, here's a suggestion: Do it together. Have an honest off-the-record conversation and get to know each other as individuals. These two men come from very different backgrounds. Boehner was one of a dozen children whose father ran a bar in Ohio; Obama was raised by a single mother in Hawaii after his father returned to Africa. But they are both examples of the American dream, and they both love their country. Sharing a smoke is an opportunity to acknowledge that they're both hugely accomplished but still flawed individuals. It's an opportunity to admit that, yes, they have serious philosophical differences but that, for the good of the country, they need to find a way to work together, and that begins with a conversation. Unguarded, off-the-record socializing was an important reason the closely divided Congresses of the 1950s worked so effectively. Then Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson smoked and drank and played cards with his Republican counterparts. Of course, he was then considered a conservative southern Democrat, and that made it easier to reach across the aisle during the Eisenhower administration. The decline of both progressive Republicans and conservative Democrats has made the partisan gulf wider. But even in the epic philosophic fights that accompanied the Watergate era and the Reagan administration, House Speaker Tip O'Neill would famously have a drink with President Ford or President Reagan after a long day of principled differences and parliamentary maneuvers. It was a recognition of a forgotten American wisdom - that our political opponents are not our enemies. In contrast,  let's cite just one small recent example of how far we've fallen. On Monday, Republican Rep. Joe Barton created a PowerPoint presentation, first reported by the Huffington Post, in his bid to secure the chairmanship of the Energy Committee. It compared Republican congressional leaders to General Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley, and General George S. Patton in ""battle against the Obama administration."" The only problem here is that this would, by implication, make the president and his Democratic allies the Nazi German army. This is unhelpful in creating a tone of mutual respect and constructive engagement. But we seem to be getting desensitized to such loaded comparisons. Once Obama and Boehner get past the interpersonal niceties, there is some common ground substance to discuss. Friendly recognition of Obama's decision to announce a two-year pay freeze for all federal workers would be a step in the right direction. It was a policy proposal advanced by many Republicans in recent months. It should be treated as the beginning of some good faith bargaining going forward. Likewise, there might be some compromise on extending the tax cuts for households that make less than $1 million a year. On the deficit and debt front, Obama and Boehner could agree to back the bipartisan deficit reduction panel if it comes back with proposals. The deep distrust and persuasive hyper-partisanship that has suffused our political debates makes that kind of common ground conversation almost impossible.  But the time for campaigning has ended. The time for governing has begun again. Sharing a smoke -- however unwise or un-PC that might sound -- or a drink or a meal every once in a while is just one way to jumpstart a relationship. In a democracy, government cannot be a warfare of interests. It depends on people in our government honoring principled disagreements but always keeping in mind that what unites us as Americans is more important than what divides us. The responsibility of leadership is to repair some of the broken trust in American institutions. That effort must extend beyond photo-op bipartisanship. It must be built on the foundation of honest conversation and getting to know each other as people rather than partisan caricatures with cloven hooves and horns. A cigarette summit isn't a one-step solution, it's just the start of a conversation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","President Obama and new Republican congressional leaders meet this week .

"(CNN) -- When one of Brazil's newly-elected congressmen rose to give their victory address, his speech was delivered with all the confidence of a political pro. ""The 150,000 people who believed in me can rest assured that I will become a great politician,"" he told Brazil's Globo TV network. But the man elected as a federal deputy in Rio de Janeiro was anything but the stereotypical statesman. It was, in fact, Romario, one of Brazil's most feted and controversial footballing legends who helped his nation win the 1994 World Cup. The former Barcelona striker is now a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) and, despite having relatively little political experience, won a seat in the country's lower congress with the sixth-highest number of votes in the city. If that was not unusual enough, Romario's former international teammate Bebeto has also completed the move from pitch to politics in the South American nation's most recent elections, securing 30,000 votes for the governing Democratic Workers' Party (PDT) and a place in Rio's state legislature. The pair are heroes for many Brazilians, with the so-called ""Diabolical Duo"" having helped to secure the country's fourth world title at the 1994 finals in the U.S. And they are just two of the new wave of politicians who have been elected in Brazil, including the country's newly-appointed President Dilma Rousseff. Both have said they want to improve participation in sport as well as the lot of the poor in their country, and voters seem willing to back the unconventional politicians despite their lack of experience. ""Romario and Bebeto made a big number of fans during their career, and for many they are idols. They did well in the soccer fields and won many championships -- so why not give them a chance to become politicians?"" said Julio Sobral, a voter from Sao Paulo. ""The population are tired of the same old story: professional politicians promise lots during the campaign, then never deliver."" But Mariana Menezez, another voter from Sao Paulo, disagrees and describes the situation in Brazil, where voting is compulsory and many unusual candidates are often elected, as ""embarrassing for Brazilians that take the elections seriously."" ""Romario and Bebeto are very popular footballers, so most people don't even care about their proposals -- their popularity is enough,"" she said. Simon Kuper, football author and sports columnist for British newspaper The Financial Times, believes that the reason such former players are elected without any experience is because voters can relate to them in a way they cannot with career politicians. ""Footballers have not historically got into politics because they are not often educated -- Romario is not educated but he is associated with the poor as he came from a poor background himself,"" Kuper told CNN. ""Even before he decided to become a politician he had said he wanted to help the poor and many people identify with that."" It is this perceived connection with the poor that perhaps explains the allure of footballers who turn to politics. Many have tried with varying degrees of success. Despite being raised in the slums of Liberia's capital Monrovia, George Weah -- a national hero following a career that saw him play for AC Milan and Chelsea, as well as becoming the first and only African winner of FIFA's World Player of the Year award -- was very nearly elected president of the African nation in 2005. George Brock, a former International editor of British newspaper The Times, thinks the political climate in developing countries like Brazil also contributes to footballers and other candidates from the world of sport being voted into office. ""Some political systems have existed unchanged for decades and insist that candidates have years of experience, so it wouldn't happen as easily there,"" Brock told CNN. ""In Brazil the political parties have been shaken up over the last few years by the victories of former president [Luiz Inacio] Lula [da Silva]. They are not as well entrenched so it allows different candidates to get in."" But Brock also believes that those sports personalities can compete against more sophisticated and experienced rivals because they gained their popularity outside the political sphere. ""Coming from outside the political class works as an advantage. Those that are extremely well-known have an enormous advantage as they don't have to establish themselves. ""You have to show some aptitude to get there though -- lots of famous people decide they want to be involved in politics but then they realize that they aren't suited to it."" Yet the career move is common among footballers. Romario and Bebeto are following in the footsteps of Pele, arguably football's greatest star, who was Brazil's Minister of Sport. Other footballers who have enjoyed notable political careers include Albert Gudmundsson, the first professional footballer from Iceland, who in the 1980s served as his country's minister of finance and minister of industry. Kaj Leo Johannesen of the Faroe Island's also succeeded in swapping football for political office. The current prime minister of the Danish autonomous region enjoyed a 15-year career as a goalkeeper from 1986 until 2001, representing his country four times. Elsewhere, Gianni Rivera, the former AC Milan and Italy player, is currently a member of the European Parliament while Tottenham Hotspur's Russian forward Roman Pavlyuchenko won a seat in regional council elections representing Vladimir Putin's United Russia party in 2008.  Back in Brazil, only time will tell whether the duo of Romario and Bebeto can enjoy the same success in politics as they did on the football pitch. The ever-confident Romario certainly has every belief he will score as many goals in politics as he did for his former football teams. ""I'm still learning the trade. I'm not a full politician but I was the best in my profession and was always under pressure. Now it's the same thing, but in a different area. The people can rest assured I will score a lot of goals in Brazil.""","Two members of Brazil squad who won the World Cup in 1994 have moved into politics .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has been given a one-game touchline ban with another suspended after two of his players received late red cards in their Champions League win over Ajax last week. Midfielder Xabi Alonso and right-back Sergio Ramos were both sent off in the dying moments of Real's win in Amsterdam after getting second yellow cards for inexplicable acts of time-wasting with their team leading 4-0. ""The Spanish club's coach Jose Mourinho has been suspended from coaching activities for two UEFA club competition matches, of which the second is deferred for a probationary period of three years. He was also fined €40,000, UEFA announced on its website Tuesday. UEFA confirmed that the punishments were for ""improper conduct"" but gave no further details. Five-star Barcelona thrash Real Madrid . The dismissal of the pair leaves them banned for Real's final Group G match with Marseille, which is of no consequence with the team already qualified for the last 16.

Alonso and Ramos were also both fined by UEFA, while goalkeeper Iker Casillas and reserve keeper Jerzy Dudek were punished after being shown on television allegedly passing messages to them from the dugout. Spanish international teammates Alonso and Ramos were fined €20,000 each, with a €10,000 fine given to Casillas while Dudek was ordered to pay €5,000 .

"(CNN) -- Last year's world champion Lewis Hamilton has claimed pole position for Sunday's inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix while his successor as Formula One's top driver, Jenson Button, qualified fifth. Hamilton will be looking to end a disappointing year for McLaren with victory in the season finale at the new Yas Marina circuit, but even with a win can do no better than hold onto his fifth overall placing in F1's first day-night event. The 24-year-old will start a race from the front of the grid for the 17th time in his career, and the fourth in the last seven races, after setting the fastest time in all three sessions. He clocked a best lap of one minute 40.948 seconds as the sun set on Saturday evening to head off the Red Bull duo of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. Vettel, whose bid to prevent Button clinching the world title ended last time out in Brazil, timed 1:41.615 while Webber recorded 1:41.726. ""The car is the best it has been all year. It was a smooth lap, and it just kept getting better and better,"" Hamilton told reporters. ""The place is just stunning. They all said it would be a great event, but it's mind-blowing. It's a great place to come to, a great country. The weather has been great and the people are so respectful and so welcoming. I hope we can put on a great show tomorrow."" Button's bid to ensure the first all-British front row since 1995 came to nothing as he was out-qualified by teammate Rubens Barrichello for the 10th time this season. The Brazilian is expected to be making his final race outing for world champions Brawn, who are expected to sign Nico Rosberg from Williams. The German, who announced during the week that he will be leaving the British team, qualified ninth as Toyota's Jarno Trulli and BMW Sauber duo Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld took sixth, seventh and eighth places. Kimi Raikkonen, who will be making his final race appearance for Ferrari, finished outside the top-10 for only the third time this season, and will start in 11th behind Toro Rosso's Sebastien Buemi. Heikki Kovalainen's chances of keeping his drive with McLaren took a blow as he finished 15th after suffering gearbox problems. The Finn, fastest in Friday's practice sessions, was just ahead of two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who along with Renault teammate Romain Grosjean failed to make it beyond the opening 20-minute session. Alonso, at least, can look forward to joining Ferrari as Raikkonen's replacement, but Frenchman Grosjean faces an uncertain future as he has failed to take his chance since taking over from the sacked Nelson Piquet Jr. Former world champions Ferrari will prop up the grid as veteran Giancarlo Fisichella again struggled ahead of what could be the final race of his career as he will be the team's reserve driver next year when the injured Felipe Massa returns.","Last year's world champion Lewis Hamilton claims pole position for inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- As the global community commemorates World AIDS Day on Wednesday, international health organizations report both promising and sobering trends. While the United Nations says new HIV infections have declined by almost 20 percent worldwide over the past decade, the estimated number of children living with HIV or AIDS in 11 Asian countries has increased by 46 percent between 2001 and 2009, the World Health Organization's South-East Asia office said Wednesday. ""In 2001, an estimated 89,000 children were living with HIV/AIDS,"" said Vismita Gupta-Smith, public information and advocacy officer for WHO's regional office in New Delhi, India. ""In 2009, there are an estimated 130,000 children living with HIV infection,"" including recent HIV infection, advanced HIV infection and AIDS. The 11 countries in the region are Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Liste. But a report by a United Nations program released last month shows some encouraging news, including drops in AIDS-related deaths and new HIV cases. Data from the 2010 global report by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) shows that an estimated 2.6 million people became newly infected with HIV, compared with the estimated 3.1 million people infected in 1999. Also in 2009, approximately 1.8 million people died from AIDS-related illnesses, compared with the roughly 2.1 million in 2004, according to UNAIDS. Among young people in 15 of the most severely affected countries, the rate of new HIV infections has fallen by more than 25 percent, led by young people adopting safer sexual practices, according to UNAIDS. ""We are breaking the trajectory of the AIDS epidemic with bold actions and smart choices,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS. ""Investments in the AIDS response are paying off, but gains are fragile -- the challenge now is how we can all work to accelerate progress."" But not all the news from the UNAIDS report, which covered 182 countries, was good. ""Even though the number of new HIV infections is decreasing, there are two new HIV infections for every one person starting HIV treatment,"" UNAIDS said. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the region most affected by the epidemic, with 69 percent of all new HIV infections, according to UNAIDS. In seven countries, mostly in eastern Europe and central Asia, new HIV infection rates have increased by 25 percent. UNAIDS said in the Asia-Pacific region, 90 percent of countries have laws that obstruct the rights of people living with HIV. Despite the lower numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths, UNAIDS said the demand for resources is surpassing the supply. ""Donor governments' disbursements for the AIDS response in 2009 stood at $7.6 billion, lower than the $7.7 billion available in 2008,"" UNAIDS said. ""Declines in international investments will affect low-income countries the most -- nearly 90 percent rely on international funding for their AIDS programs.""","The estimated number of children with HIV/AIDS in 11 Asian countries increases 46 percent .

"(CNN) -- Wright County Egg, one of two Iowa farms at the center of this past summer's salmonella outbreak and massive egg recall, won federal approval Tuesday to sell to consumers eggs produced at two henhouses. ""During the outbreak, I said that FDA would not agree to the sale of eggs to consumers from Wright County Egg until we had confidence that they could be shipped and consumed safely,"" said Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg in a statement. ""After four months of intensive work by the company and oversight, testing, and inspections by FDA, I am satisfied that time has come."" The outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis sickened more than 1,600 people and triggered the recall of more than a half-billion eggs. Wright County Egg, of Galt, Iowa, had not shipped eggs to consumers from the two hen houses since August. In the summer, the FDA found what it termed ""deplorable"" conditions at Wright County Egg after the company conducted a nationwide voluntary recall of shell eggs that it had shipped since May 19, 2010. Shell eggs from Wright County Egg were sold to distributors and wholesalers in 22 states and Mexico, who then distributed the shell eggs further. According to the FDA statement, Wright County Egg took the following corrective steps at the barns on one of its six farms: . -- The laying hens present in these houses at the time of the outbreak have been removed and the houses cleaned, sanitized and tested to ensure that they are no longer contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis. -- Infected pullets were replaced with Salmonella enteritidis-negative pullets that have been vaccinated. -- A rodent problem has been corrected and a system put in place to control and monitor them. -- Corrective actions against contaminated feed included cleaning and disinfecting the feed mill; eliminating eggshells, meat and bone meal from the feed; and testing of feed ingredients and feed for Salmonella enteritidis. ""Corrective actions continue to be implemented for Wright County Egg's remaining houses, operating on six farms,"" the FDA said. ""The agency will work with Wright County Egg officials to assure appropriate steps are taken before permitting resumption of shipping to the shell egg market from other houses and farms."" Wright County Egg said it is meeting requirements that are more stringent the FDA's egg safety rule, including worker retraining and extensive testing. ""Extraordinary measures have been put in place to put our egg farms at the forefront of food safety and to protect the health of our birds, and our team has worked tirelessly over the past several months to ensure that the past situation is never repeated,"" Wright County Egg chief operating officer Peter DeCoster said in a statement Tuesday. After the recall, fresh eggs at facilities believed to be contaminated were sold to ""breaking plants"" that break the eggshells, pasteurize the eggs and turn them into liquid or other form used in a variety of products, officials said. That step was meant to kill any pathogens. The two barns resuming shell egg production will produce about 72,000 dozen eggs per week, or about 3.7 million dozen eggs each year, according to Wright County Egg. About 800,000 eggs per week are still going to ""breaking plants."" Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Hampton, Iowa, have worked to correct problems so that they could again ship shell eggs directly to the table. In October, the FDA allowed Hillandale Farms start shipping its eggs from three of its henhouses. According to the FDA, since August, three egg-producing houses owned by Hillandale had been extensively tested and have been found to have no evidence of Salmonella contamination.","FDA gives approval for Wright County Egg to sell eggs from two henhouses .

"(CNN) -- In a nationally televised address Monday, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner expressed her sorrow for the loss of her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, and gave thanks for the outpouring of support that followed. Tearful at times, Fernandez said that each day she continues to govern, but that her life has been changed. Nestor Kirchner, who was president from 2003 to 2007, died last week from an apparent heart attack. ""I've heard that this is the most difficult time. In reality, it's not,"" Fernandez said. ""It's my most painful moment. And pain is something different than difficulties or adversity."" In her political and personal life she has faced adversity, but it doesn't compare with the pain she feels, she said. ""It's the biggest pain I have had in my life,"" Fernandez said. She described Nestor Kirchner as her companion for 35 years in life as well as in the ideals they shared. The president thanked the thousands of people who paid their respects by wanting to see him or praying for him, she said. People gave rosary beads, flowers and soccer jerseys that she will keep, she added. ""I want to thank that immense and formidable display of affection and love, which he deserved,"" she said. Among youths who sang and marched in memory of Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez said she saw the her husband's face reflected in theirs. In addition to the great responsibility she feels for governing Argentina, Fernandez said that she now feels compelled ""to honor his memory and honor his government, which transformed and changed this country.""","Former President Nestor Kirchner died last week .

"(CNN)  -- Russia's former tennis world No.1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov is backing his country to come out on top in the race to host football's  2018 World Cup. Kafelnikov told CNN that he was confident they would get the nod when the decision is made by FIFA's executive committee in Zurich on Thursday, but said the competition was tough. ""It's hard to compete against major footballing countries like England or Spain (joint bidders with Portugal) but we still think we are going to do it."" Kafelnikov, a two-time grand slam champion, was born in Sochi, which was chosen to host the Winter Olympics in 2014. He admitted to be ""laughing"" when that decision was made, but has been pleasantly surprised by the pace and scale of the preparations in his home town. ""I stopped laughing and now when I go home I am amazed by the construction and right now I believe Sochi will be a very successful host of the Olympics."" He went on: ""I'm sure Sochi will succeed and I'm sure if Russia gets the World Cup we would succeed as well."" ""All the people are behind it and the government has invested so much money,"" he added. Kafelnikov, 36, also helped his country to win the Davis Cup and took gold in the men's singles at the Sydney Olympics. In the countdown to Thursday's vote, a number of sports stars from Russia have thrown their weight behind a bid which is gathering momentum. Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin is a bid ambassador as well as captain of their Russian team. He is convinced the footballing legacy will help swing the vote Russia's way. ""We have never had a World Cup. Hosting it here would open up new minds and new hearts for the game. It would be a completely new chapter for the FIFA World Cup itself,"" he told their official bid website.

"(CNN) -- The number of girls being raped has increased sharply since fighting intensified in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a humanitarian group said Tuesday. A survey of children at refugee camps finds rapes of girls under age 17 are increasing. Also, the recent fighting between rebels and the Congo government has heightened the threat of children being recruited as soldiers, said World Vision. ""A silent war has been waged against women and children,"" said Sue Mbaya, the humanitarian group's Africa advocacy director. ""Women and girls in the hundreds have been targets of opportunistic and brutal rape, while children are also being targeted for recruitment or re-recruitment as child soldiers."" World Vision said they surveyed children at six refugee camps in the country, finding that 120 girls under the age of 17 reported being raped in October. That's compared to five reported cases in April and June. Mbaya was scheduled to address the issue Tuesday during a report to the United Nations Security Council. The fighting, which began in August, prompted the U.N. Security Council to approve sending more than 3,000 troops in coming weeks to bolster the 17,000-strong peacekeeping force already there. A U.N. envoy has also been sent to Congo to conduct peace talks between the government and rebel leader Laurent Nkunda. The spiraling violence in eastern Congo has displaced an estimated 250,000 people -- many of whom have fled to refugee camps. The fighting is spurred by lingering tensions over the 1994 slaughter of ethnic Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighboring Rwanda. Nkunda has said his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo.","Aid group says rape reports increase as fighting intensified .

"(CNN)  -- With many workers stuck at their desks during the late-morning swearing-in of President Obama on Tuesday, more people than ever went online to watch live video of the historic inauguration. A group crowds around a laptop to watch the inaugural events in Washington. News sites, including CNN.com, shattered records for viewers watching live streaming video online. And, sometimes for the first time, news sites carried video feeds on their front pages. About 7.7 million people watched the inauguration on Tuesday online at the same time, according to Akamai Technologies Inc. That likely makes the inauguration the single most-watched event in the history of live Web video, according to the company, which handles Web traffic for more than 150 news sites worldwide, including nytimes.com, Ustream, Viacom, WSJ.com and others. Across the day, nearly 27 million people watched streaming video on CNN.com Live on Tuesday, according to CNN spokeswoman Jennifer Martin. That's more than five times the site's previous record, set on Election Day, when 5.3 million people watched streaming video of the day's events. CNN.com Live estimates that it streamed 1.3 million simultaneous video feeds just before Obama's inaugural address Tuesday. That may be a record for live video on the Internet. YouTube set a record with 700,000 viewers on a variety show on Election Day in November, the Los Angeles Times reported. The record has not been confirmed by third-party sources. The New York Times declined to release its Tuesday numbers, but spokeswoman Stacy Green said nytimes.com saw more streaming Web users than ever. CBSNews.com also reported a record day for online video, said Sarah Cain, a spokeswoman for the network. Sites tried to attract viewers in new ways, linking their news coverage with social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. Obama himself got in on the action, posting this message to his Twitter account after the November 4 election: ""We just made history. All of this happened because you gave your time, talent and passion. All of this happened because of you."" For some viewers, the inauguration was a first-time experiment with streaming video online, and the high traffic on most sites didn't always make that transition easy. Some news sites' coverage froze during the inauguration, according to Keynote Systems Inc., which tracks Internet performance. Keynote Systems spokesman Dan Berkowitz said the Web's top 40 sites slowed by as much as 60 percent by the time the ceremony started at 11 a.m. On CNN.com, some streaming-video watchers who were pushed into a temporary ""waiting room"" were shown this tongue-in-cheek message: ""You made it! However, so did everyone else."" Chris Ariens, editor of the blog WebNewser, said he watched live online video coverage from CNN, MSNBC, ABC and CBS. All froze, leading Ariens to revert back to a television in his office. ""I think the bottom line was, while it was great to be able to, from the ease of your desktop, watch some of the coverage, when push came to shove, you had to go back to television,"" he said. A blogger for CBSNews.com acknowledged trouble with its online video. ""Just as massive crowds filled the National Mall in Washington, millions of users flocked to online video feeds,"" James M. Klatell wrote in a CBSNews.com blog entry Tuesday. ""Maybe we're not as far into the Internet Age as we thought."" The hiccups in Web video should not be discouraging for viewers or news companies, said Al Tompkins, who teaches broadcasting and online news at the Poynter Institute, a school for journalists in Florida. If anything, he said, the trouble with streaming video should show companies there's great consumer demand for video online. ""They need to know that if they build it they will come, and [Tuesday] was a great example that there is a demand for video,"" Tompkins said. Some viewers turned to radio and other forms of media to fill in the gaps in online video technology. Others gathered around office computers to watch the ceremony online. Tompkins said viewership of Web video was high Tuesday partly because it was available on so many sites -- and because many workers were trapped at their desks during the inauguration. Clint Cantwell, who works in public relations in New York, left his office near Times Square briefly to take in the excitement outside. Then he returned to his desk to watch streaming coverage. The video stalled at times, but the audio worked, and Cantwell said he genuinely enjoyed watching an inauguration for the first time online. ""In the past, you pretty much had to be at home or in an office with television to be able to experience what's in Washington,"" said Cantwell, who also sent photos to CNN's iReport, a public submission site that saw an unprecedented 12,000 entries on Tuesday. Although the inauguration set records for Web video, it's unclear exactly how the ceremony ranked against other news events in terms of total hits online. Globally, Akamai reported, 5.4 million visitors were visiting Web pages per minute at noon Tuesday, with most of the crowd in North America. Four other news events have garnered more Web attention than Tuesday's inauguration, according to Akamai's Web site. The top-ranking news event in terms of views per minute was Obama's election in November, with 8.6 million views per minute. A World Cup match and two basketball games also ranked higher than the inauguration. CNN.com partnered with Facebook, the social networking site, to let online friends share commentary while watching the inauguration live. Facebook reported unprecedented traffic during the event, with the site averaging 4,000 status updates per hour Tuesday morning. The online comments reportedly peaked at 8,500 updates per minute during Obama's inaugural speech. News consumers have been turning to the Internet in increasing numbers for years. Last year, for the first time, the Pew Research Center reported that more Americans said they got most of their national and international news online than in print. Tompkins, the journalism teacher, said it's up to news companies to keep advancing the way they cover big events.","More people than ever go online to watch live video of inauguration .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan planned to check herself into a substance abuse rehab program Monday, a source close to the actress said. The source did not reveal which rehab program Lohan had chosen. Lohan's entry into rehab comes three days after a Los Angeles, California, judge ordered her to jail without bail in the wake of a failed drug test. She spent just 14 hours in jail because another judge allowed her to post a bond Friday evening. She spent 23 days in a court-ordered rehab program at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center last month, following 13 days in a Los Angeles County jail. ""Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away over night,"" Lohan wrote in a September 17 Twitter message. ""I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."" Her father, Michael Lohan, has been urging his daughter to go to rehab voluntarily. ""Finally, they listened to me,"" he said Sunday. He said on Friday that he was praying that defense lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley ""does the right thing and advises her to go right into rehab now, and show the judge she's serious, because in 30 days when she goes back before the judge he can do whatever he wants."" Lohan posted a $300,000 bail and was released from jail late Friday night, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said. A judge granted Lohan bail Friday night, overturning a decision earlier in the day that sent the actress to jail until a probation revocation hearing four weeks away, a court spokesman said. The bail terms required Lohan to be fitted with a SCRAM alcohol-detection bracelet, Los Angeles County Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini said. Judge Patricia Schnegg granted Lohan's bail after Holley filed documents just before court closed Friday afternoon, Parachini said. Judge Eldin Fox ordered the preliminary revocation of Lohan's probation Friday morning based on a probation report saying she tested positive for controlled-substance use. The probation revocation hearing was set for October 22. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident, she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills, California. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu, California, drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica, California, police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap.""","A source close to the actress did not reveal which rehab facility she's entering .

"(CNN) -- After six and a half days of deliberation, an Australian jury convicted a surgeon dubbed ""Doctor Death"" in the deaths of three of his patients, Australia's national news agency said. Indian-born Dr. Jayant Patel, 60, was found guilty of three counts of manslaughter and one count of grievous bodily harm in a Queensland Supreme Court, the Australian Associated Press said. He had pleaded not guilty in the deaths of Mervyn Morris, Gerardus Kemps and James Phillips and in the bodily harm of Ian Vowles. He entered the courtroom with his wife, Kishoree Patel, also a doctor. He stood with his head cast low and appeared calm as the verdicts were read out, AAP said. Patel, who was extradited from the United States to stand trial, will be sentenced Thursday. The verdict culminated 15 weeks of trial during which prosecutors told the jury about how Patel was an egotistical man who caused deaths and injuries by performing wrong operations, AAP said. Prosecutors argued that Patel was criminally negligent in operating on the three men at Australia's Bundaberg Base Hospital, where he was director of surgery between 2003 and 2005. The government made the case that Patel was a bad surgeon driven by ego and that he caused the deaths or injuries by performing the wrong operations on the wrong patients. Victims' families told CNN Australian affiliate ABC news they felt vindicated. Kemps' widow, Judy, listened to the verdict in court. She said she had not been sure if she would ever see the day when Patel was convicted. ""At one stage I thought it wouldn't. It's been a long five years, but it's all over,"" she told ABC. Patel was licensed to practice medicine in New York state in 1980 and was fined and put on probation for ""gross negligence and incompetence"" in 1984, according to Australia's extradition complaint. A few years after he was licensed in Oregon in 1989, his employer required him to obtain a second opinion for certain procedures, and state regulators prevented him from performing some kinds of surgery in 2000, the complaint stated. Patel arrived in Bundaberg, sugar industry center, in early 2003. The controversy over Patel in Australia mounted when concerns about his competency were voiced in Queensland's state legislature. A lawmaker had been tipped off by a senior Bundaberg nurse, ABC said. Patel resigned and returned to Portland, Oregon. From there, he was extradited last year to Australia.","Indian-born doctor, found guilty in 3 deaths, will be sentenced Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Attackers shot a mayor-elect at least five times at a veterinary clinic in a Mexican border state Friday night, officials said. Ricardo Solis Manriquez was in critical condition at a local hospital after one of the bullets hit him in the head, said Carlos Gonzalez Estrada, a spokesman for the attorney general's office in Chihuahua. Solis, the mayor-elect of the town of Gran Morelos, was scheduled to take office October 9. The shooting was the latest in a string of attacks against elected officials in Mexico, where at least four mayors have been killed in the past two months. A leading gubernatorial candidate also was killed in late June. On Thursday, authorities said gunmen killed Prisciliano Rodriguez Salinas, the mayor of Doctor Gonzalez, a small town in the border state of Nuevo Leon. Political parties in Mexico were quick to condemn the violence. ""Both events, the latest in a chain of episodes of violence that threaten to destabilize the rule of law in many cities of the country, cannot go unpunished and demand an immediate response,"" said Hortensia Aragon, general secretary of the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution. Aragon said in a statement that the attacks were ""cases that exemplify that the Mexican political class has once again become cannon fodder due to the inability of the federal government to contain the violence that prevails in our country."" President Felipe Calderon condemned the Nuevo Leon attack. And his National Action Party also issued a statement asking state authorities to investigate and punish those responsible. Authorities have said drug cartels were suspected in earlier deaths of the politicians, a relatively recent development in the government's bloody war on organized crime that has seen more than 28,000 people killed in less than four years. But Nuevo Leon State Attorney General Alejandro Garza y Garza told reporters Friday that the death of Rodriguez, who was killed on his ranch Thursday, might not be connected with organized crime, state-run news agency Notimex reported. ""The form of operating is not directly how organized crime does it, so we could be dealing with another type of event,"" he said.","A mayor-elect is in critical condition after being shot in the head .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi continued their hot goalscoring runs as Real Madrid and Barcelona moved ominously clear of their La Liga rivals in Spain on Saturday night. Ronaldo followed up his four strikes from last weekend with another two as Real came from behind to beat Hercules 3-1 and stay a point clear of second-placed champions Barcelona. Third-placed Villarreal trail Real by four points ahead of Sunday's trip to Sporting Gijon. Real, held 0-0 by third-division Murcia in the Copa del Rey on Tuesday, looked like suffering another humiliation after going behind only three minutes into the game in Alicante -- the first time the Galacticos have trailed in Jose Mourinho's first season as coach. Former France World Cup winner David Trezeguet headed home David Cortes' right-wing cross to continue his good scoring run since joining from Italian club Juventus as promoted Hercules raised hopes of repeating their upset wins over Barca and Sevilla earlier this season. But Real's depth in attacking strength finally told seven minutes after halftime, when Angel Di Maria followed up to equalize after goalkeeper Juan Calatayud failed to deal with Ronaldo's long-range dipping shot. The world's most expensive player wrapped up Real's seventh win in nine league starts with two late goals in the space of three minutes. Both came after Mourinho took off central defender and introduced Karim Benzema, with Ronaldo pouncing from close range after the France forward's shot was blocked by Calatayud. The Portugal forward then took his tally to 11 goals this season after Benzema broke down the right and cut back a perfect low pass. Messi has 14 goals in 12 appearances following his double in Barcelona's 5-0 thrashing of 10-man Sevilla, who were left in sixth place -- nine points off the lead. The Argentina forward forced a shot home in the fourth minute as Sevilla struggled to keep Barca at bay, and netted a fine individual effort on 67 after winning the ball just inside the visitors' half. Spain striker David Villa ended his recent goal drought as he also scored a double. The first came in the 24th minute as he collected Messi's pass, cut in from the right and curled a superb shot into the far corner. The second was the last kick of the match -- a low, angled drive. Sevilla's task became mammoth when French defender Abdoulay Konko was harshly sent off just before halftime, having received two bookings in the space of three minutes. Dani Alves extended Barcelona's lead eight minutes after the interval with a superb opportunist effort as he anticipated Ivory Coast midfielder Romaric's headed backpass and leaped to volley the ball over goalkeeper Javi Varas. In Saturday's opening match, Valencia lost ground on the leading duo with a 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Real Zaragoza. Valencia, who host Scottish club Rangers in the Champions League on Tuesday, fell behind in just the second minute as Maurizio Lanzaro scored -- but the Italian defender put through his own net just before halftime. Zaragoza had second-half substitute Ander Herrera sent off in the 67th minute, but held on to move off the bottom on goal difference. In Italy, title hopefuls AC Milan suffered a 2-1 home defeat by injury-hit Juventus ahead of Wednesday's crunch Champions League clash with Real. Alessandro Del Piero became his club's record scorer on 179 with the second goal as fourth-placed Juve moved to within four points of leaders Lazio, who travel to Palermo on Sunday. Fabio Quagliarella headed the opener from Paolo De Ceglie's 24th-minute cross, and Del Piero doubled the lead in the 65th minute before Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late consolation. Third-placed Milan remain a point behind defending champions Inter, who beat Genoa 1-0 on Friday. In Saturday's other Serie A game, AS Roma moved up to seventh place with a 2-0 win at home to Lecce, which saw both teams reduced to 10 men. Argentine defender Nicolas Burdisso and Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic scored in the second half before teammate Francesco Totti and Lecce's Ruben Olivera were sent off for fighting. Totti will now miss next weekend's Rome derby clash with Lazio.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores another two goals as Real Madrid beat Hercules 3-1 .

"(CNN)  -- If you use mobile data services outside your wireless carrier's network coverage area, you could get a nasty surprise in your bill. Data-roaming charges can be outrageously expensive, even totaling thousands of dollars in a single month. Also, carriers often don't make it obvious to phone users when and where data-roaming fees might apply, or how fast they can add up. But that could be changing. At its December open meeting, the Federal Communications Commission may vote on a proposed rule that would mandate automatic data-roaming agreements between carriers and address consumer worries by requiring reasonable prices for this service. In April, the FCC ordered all wireless carriers to automatically allow voice calls to roam across networks. The data-roaming proposal would do the same for data traffic, i.e. mobile Web surfing, running apps and other actions. The stakes here are much higher than just data-roaming charges. Network neutrality -- the contentious principle that broadband providers should maintain equal Web access to all and not offer favorable delivery speeds to certain clients -- may be at stake with this vote. Recently, Politico's Kim Hart explained: ""The debate is the latest skirmish in the larger battle over broadband reclassification. To impose the rule, the FCC would need to change the legal framework that governs broadband services -- an idea pushed by net neutrality advocates but vehemently opposed by many Republicans and internet providers. ... Enacting a data-roaming rule would be politically expedient for FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, who has faced legal setbacks in his quest to make wireless networks more open."" The two largest U.S. carriers -- Verizon and AT&T, which together serve over 60 percent of U.S. mobile subscribers -- strenuously oppose this move. These carriers claim they already have negotiated dozens of data-roaming agreements with smaller carriers. According to Fierce Wireless, ""The arguments by the nation's largest operators stand in stark contrast to filings by smaller wireless carriers, which argue the FCC should mandate automatic data roaming as it has already done with voice calling -- an effort intended to give smaller carriers a chance to compete against larger operators."" The carriers also have a more fundamental objection to the proposed data-roaming rule: They claim the FCC does not have the authority to regulate the data side of their business. Taking the carriers' side against the FCC in this fight are some powerful politicians -- most notably Florida congressman Cliff Stearns, the ranking Republican on the House Communications, Technology and the Internet Subcommittee. Stearns may take over leadership of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee when Republicans gain control of the House in 2011. Earlier this month, when rumors began circulating that the FCC might move to vote on data roaming, Stearns issued a a statement opposing the vote. ""Ramming through internet regulations would ignore the will of a bipartisan majority of Congress and the American public,"" he said. ""It would further impede economic growth and job creation."" The FCC sidestepped this vote in the agenda for its November 30 open meeting. Without explanation, the agency last week announced it will delay its December meeting by a few days, until December 21. The agenda for the December FCC open meeting has not yet been published. If a vote on the data-roaming proposal appears on that agenda, the FCC might be able to get this rule approved under the wire, increasing its ability to pursue its net neutrality plans, before a more hostile Congress moves in.","The FCC may be prepared to vote on a proposed rule that could limit wireless data-roaming charges .

"(CNN) -- If you were to ask a group of Quakers or Mennonites whether it's OK for police or soldiers to use rubber bullets against rock-throwing children, you wouldn't be surprised if they said, ""Absolutely not!"" They are well-known for their commitment to pacifism. But what if you were to put the question this way: ""When soldiers are firing against demonstrators, would it be better if they used rubber bullets rather than metal?"" ""Obviously it is,"" they would probably say, ""But they shouldn't be firing at all in the first place!"" The Roman Catholic Church is well-known for having its own issues with rubber. The answer it traditionally gives to the use of condoms -- an answer that mystifies and outrages so many people, particularly in this age of HIV/AIDS -- is ""absolutely not!"" So it caused quite a stir in a book-length interview published last week in which Pope Benedict XVI seemed to give a different answer. He stood by his position that condom distribution was not the answer to the AIDS epidemic, which could only really be dealt with by fidelity in marriage and chastity outside of it. However, he surprised many people by acknowledging that were a prostitute to use a condom to prevent infection, that should be seen as a step toward greater moral responsibility. But this different answer is not a sudden change of mind on the part of the Catholic hierarchy. It is the answer to a different question. The pope was not asking himself whether it's OK to use condoms. He was addressing the following question: ""If someone has already decided to have sex outside a married relationship (perhaps even outside a heterosexual relationship), is it better to do it with or without a condom?"" It's obviously better to do it with a condom because, as the pope pointed out, the person is obliged in that situation not to risk infecting a partner or being infected. If the intercourse is heterosexual, the person is further obliged not to risk conceiving a child that will not be brought up in a stable family and might not see the light of day at all. Though the Roman Catholic Church has always been clear in its position on the immorality of intercourse outside of marriage, Pope Benedict has done us all a favor by observing publicly that the use of a condom in such circumstances can be understood as a sign of a burgeoning moral awareness. It is this issue of responsibility that has always been the sticking point. People have presumed that in its condemnation of condom use, the Catholic Church is somehow encouraging irresponsible, unprotected sex. But in fact it's been discouraging everything except faithful monogamous sex. Its teaching about artificial contraception has only ever been about marriage; it has never had anything to do with any other kind of sexual activity. Intercourse between husband and wife should always be open to conceiving new life; therefore, contraception was considered wrong because it was seriously unnatural. The problem is that all condom use came to be thought of as absolutely wrong, not just wrong in marriage. If using condoms were absolutely wrong, then it must be wrong for gay men to use them, too. If it were absolutely wrong, then it must be wrong for fornicating teens to use condoms, too. A disastrous misunderstanding! However, church authorities have usually avoided the more complex explanations -- no ""maybe,"" no ""in certain conditions."" That's because they believe that the public just wants a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" -- and preferably a ""yes."" They fear that anything other than an absolute ""no"" will be interpreted as an absolute ""yes."" And, it should be added, they have unjustly censured highly qualified moral theologians who have dared to say ""maybe."" That a pope has now introduced a ""maybe"" has evoked a flustered reaction. Official clarifications are given that then need further explanation. Churchmen argue over whether what he said is anything new, whether it represents a major policy change or whether it is just really the same old line. In many respects, it is an old line. But the old line was never the simple ""no"" it has so long been thought to be. The Catholic moral tradition has always been much more sophisticated than that. The pope's statement only seems new. Since the 1968 encyclical letter Humanae Vitae, which reaffirmed the teaching that artificial means of contraception was not acceptable in a marriage, Rome has been trying to hold the line by refusing to deal with ""what if ..."" and ""perhaps."" In the Catholic tradition, it has always been assumed that those inevitable questions would be dealt with in private conversation between priests and people. Yet for many, that big public ""no"" made them hesitate to engage in such conversations, and the Catholic Church has not shown itself adept at handling the public debate about condoms and HIV. When the pope commented during his African journey last year that condoms were not the solution to AIDS in Africa, he was seen to be just giving the same old knee-jerk Catholic moral response, so out of touch with reality. Yet his comment was based on other observations of a social and scientific nature, and it is to this that he returned briefly in the interview which has caused such a stir. He acknowledges something that has been obvious all along in the Catholic tradition: It is rare to find a moral question that is a simple issue of ""yes"" or ""no,"" so we need to learn moral reasoning and responsibility, not just blind obedience. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Madigan.","Dan Madigan says Catholic church has long had an answer on condom use: ""Absolutely not""
He says pope surprised by saying prostitutes' condom use more morally responsible .
Church teaches: No sex outside marriage, no condoms; new comments aim at unmarried sex .
Madigan: Pope's comments reflect a more sophisticated strain of Catholic moral tradition ."
"CNN)  -- Samir Nasri scored two superb goals to give Arsenal a 2-1 win in a London derby against Fulham to go top of the English Premier League on Saturday. Previous leaders Manchester United had to sit out the action as their game at promoted Blackpool fell victim to the cold snap in England leaving Arsenal and Chelsea the chance to lead the standings. Chelsea looked set to be the beneficiary as Didier Drogba's penalty put them ahead at Stamford Bridge against Everton. But in the second half the visitors hit back through a late Jermaine Beckford goal and were unfortunate not to seal three points as Chelsea's poor recent league form continued. Carlo Ancelotti's men have won only once in six games and have seen United and Arsenal leapfrog them in the standings. Arsenal have 32 points from 16 games, one clear of United, who have played a game less, and two ahead of faltering Chelsea. Manchester City are also taking closer order in the title race with a 1-0 home win over Bolton giving them 29 points from 16 games. Carlos Tevez gave them a fourth minute lead at Eastlands but they had Aleksandar Kolarov sent off in the second half and had to battle hard for the three points. Tottenham Hotspur are in fifth, six points adrift of their north London rivals Arsenal after drawing 1-1 at Birmingham. Sebastien Bassong gave them a 19th minute lead but Craig Gardner equalized nine minutes from time to deny Spurs victory. Arsenal were grateful for two inspired moments from French international midfielder Nasri, who fired them ahead at the Emirates after 14 minutes as he fooled two defenders before shooting high into the net, having been played in by Russian star Andrey Arshavin. Fulham drew level on the half-hour mark as Clint Dempsey set up Diomansy Kamara, who curled the ball in from 12 yards. But Nasri put Arsenal ahead again with 15 minutes left as he took advantage of a layoff from Robin van Persie to beat a defender and then visiting goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer with another flash of individual brilliance. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger singled him out after his ninth league goal of the season. ""His goals were outstanding. He showed skill, calm and intelligence and it underlines how important confidence is,"" Wenger told BBC Sport. In other games, Blackburn beat Wolves, who are now bottom, 3-0 to bounce back from their 7-1 defeat last weekend to Manchester United. Wigan and Stoke drew 2-2.","Arsenal beat Fulham 2-1 with Samir Nasir scoring twice to go top of English Premier League .

"(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa had emergency surgery for a fractured skull after a freak crash in final qualifying for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix. Felipe Massa receives attention after his high-speed crash in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying. The Brazilian careered off at the 200kph Turn Four at the Hungaroring after being hit in the helmet by flying debris from rear wing of the Brawn GP of compatriot Rubens Barrichello. 2008 championship runner-up Massa was stunned and lost control as his Ferrari flew into a tire wall at high speed. He was airlifted from the circuit to the AEK Hospital in Budapest and later underwent an emergency operation for the damage to his skull. Massa is in intensive care on a respirator and remains under observation in an induced coma. ""The condition of the driver is serious, but stable,"" said a hospital spokesman. After the frightening incident, Fernando Alonso claimed a surprising pole position in a chaotic end to Saturday's proceedings. The Massa accident happened at the end of the second qualifying session and the action was suspended while officials checked for debris. When the third and final qualifying session got underway it was Renault's Alonso clocked the fastest time of one minute 21.559 seconds. Sebastian Vettel, second in the title race to Jenson Button, will start alongside Alonso on the front row, with his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber qualifying third. Button was only eighth fastest with  Brawn GP teammate Barrichello 13th best, their worst qualifying performance of the season. Button delayed his final qualifying run while his car was checked out after the earlier incident. Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth best for the improving McLaren team with Nico Rosberg in fifth for Williams. With the electronic timing system lost to the pit lane and the television coverage, former two-time world champion Alonso was at first unaware he had taken his first pole of the season. ""We have made a good step forward and the car did improve in the last two races. We are more competitive, but I don't think we are as quick as these two guys (referring to Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber),"" he said. ""We will try to win, but being honest and realistic, our target is to get some good points,"" added the Spaniard.","Felipe Massa suffers high-speed crash in qualifying for Hungarian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho insisted his team can still win Spain's La Liga despite their humiliating 5-0 defeat to arch-rivals Barcelona in the Camp Nou on Monday night. Mourinho admitted Real had suffered a ""much deserved loss"" in the first Clasico clash of the season, but claimed it was not a true reflection of the abilities of the two sides. ""It wasn't an embarrassment,"" the 47-year-old told a post-match press conference. ""It's the biggest loss of my career but it's an easy loss to swallow because it's a loss in a game that you have no chance of winning."" ""[There was] a team that played to its maximum potential and a team that played very poorly. It's a much deserved loss, but again, it was an easy loss to swallow."" Five-star Barcelona thrash Real Madrid . It was Mourinho's first defeat since arriving at the Bernabeu and left reigning champions Barcelona two points clear of Los Blancos at the of the top of the standings. But with 25 matches still remaining in Spanish season, the Portuguese is still optimistic his team can hit back. ""The league championship will be decided a long time from now,"" he said. ""After the match, I told the players that the league isn't over yet. We have to have mental fortitude. ""When you win important things, you have a reason to cry for joy and when someone scores five against you, you have to leave with an eagerness to play the next game. ""Barcelona is a finished product. Real Madrid, even though it has been playing well, isn't a finished product. But the result today was not indicative of the difference that exists between both teams."" The match had been billed as a clash between two of the world's best and most evenly-matched teams, but Pep Guardiola's men dominated in front of their home fans. They were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes through goals from Xavi and Pedro. A brace from David Villa and a late strike by substitute Jeffren completed the humiliation and Barca coach Guardiola could not have been more satisfied. ""How we did it, that makes us proud,"" he told the club's official website. ""Now just let us sit back and enjoy that win."" He singled out Argentina ace Lionel Messi, who emerged on top in his personal duel with Real's fellow superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. ""Messi is the best of them all.

"(CNN) -- A tractor-trailer slammed into a school bus driven by the mayor of a Louisiana town Friday morning, critically injuring two children. Twenty-one children -- ranging in age from 5 to 17 -- were on the St. Landry Parish school bus when it was hit while pulling back onto a highway in central Louisiana, Louisiana State Police said in a news release. Earlier Friday state police indicated that the crash left three children -- ages 5 and 15, plus one more whose age was unknown -- in critical condition. As of 5 p.m., Port Barre High School Principal William Duplechain said, 19 students had been treated and released from hospitals, and two remained in critical condition. They included a kindergarten student, who was unresponsive, according to the principal. The other was a middle-schooler who was placed in a medically induced coma so surgeons could operate on his broken leg. Gil Savoy, a substitute bus driver, was driving the students when the accident occurred, Port Barre Town Clerk Toria Comeaux said. Savoy is the mayor of Port Barre, a community of about 2,400 people some 30 miles north of Lafayette. He had pulled over on the side of U.S. 190 and, after all the students had boarded, began to slowly move forward ""with all of his warning devices still activated,"" according to Louisiana State Police. At that point, an 18-wheel truck driven by David Cox, 52, of Dallas, Texas, rammed into the bus from behind, police said. Comeaux said that the truck, which she was driving behind, had debris coming off it at the time of the crash. Both Savoy and Cox suffered minor injuries, with ""routine toxicology samples"" taken from both, the state police said. No one has been charged, and the investigation is ongoing. Video from CNN affiliates KLFY and KATC showed severe damage to the back of the bus and to the tractor-trailer's front. Anthony Standberry, a St. Landry Parish school board member, told KLFY that the speed limit on that stretch of U.S. 190 is 65 mph. He said he favors working with parents and school officials to remove all bus stops along major highways. CNN's Max Newfield and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: 21 children were on a Louisiana bus when it was hit from behind Friday .

"Munich Germany (CNN) --  -- I am originally from Cologne but I moved to Munich more than 12 years ago. I chose to live in this city because of the Eisbach river wave where you can surf on a rapid. For most people around the world Munich is only known as ""Oktoberfest City"", the town of beer drinkers and pretzel lovers. Most people don't know that Munich is also considered to be a surfing Mecca because of the famous standing wave right in the centre of the city at the Eisbach river. For me it was vice versa. Through surfing this rapid I discovered the Oktoberfest. And since then I've been hooked. Even weeks and days before the beer fest starts, the whole city gets crazy. You must imagine, a city with about 1.5 million inhabitants gets visited by about six million people. Tourists of all different nationalities are arriving, flight prices to Munich double and the main train station is crowded at all times. But also locals from Munich begin to get all excited, start to count the days and get prepared. The stores where you can buy the original Bavarian costumes, the ""Lederhosen"" for the guys and the ""Dirndl"" for the ladies, are so packed that you can hardly enter. This year me and my friends from the Eisbach did a special Oktoberfest warm-up as well. Some days before the beginning of the Oktoberfest we went surfing on the river in ""Lederhosen"" and ""Dirndl"" instead of wetsuits. It was one of the most fun surf sessions I ever experienced. But let's come back to the ""Wiesn"" -- that is how locals call the ""Oktoberfest"" -- and have a look at what a typical tour should include. A good Oktoberfest visit usually starts with a fresh ""Mass"" of beer. If the weather is nice, you should have it in the sunshine in one of the beer gardens outside of the tents. The most typical food that goes perfectly with it is either one of the giant pretzels or a half a grilled chicken. They say that the ""Hendl"" (Bavarian for grilled chicken halves) are especially good at the Oktoberfest. That is maybe why about 500,000 of them get eaten up during the two weeks. After you have enjoyed your first beer and some good food, you should check out some rides. There are the traditional ones. like Tobogan, a slide that has been at the Oktoberfest for 75 years. To go up, you hop on a conveyer and usually there is a big crowd of people having a blast, just watching who can make it up there without falling. If you are a tourist you should also take a ride on the Riesenrad (Ferris Wheel). It might look a bit lame but it is 55 meters high and you will get a beautiful view over Munich. If you feel like competing with your friends, visit the so called Teufelrad (devil's wheel), a turning wheel where people can jump on. The challenge sounds simple. Just stay on the wheel. It gets tricky when the wheel is spinning faster and faster and punching balls swing by. After you had fun on the rides and bought your girlfriend a heart made of lebkuchen (ginger cake), it is time to go to where the real party is and help the locals drink more than 60,000 hectoliters of beer. Visit one of the 14 big beer tents run by six Bavarian breweries. All you want to do now is to climb up on one of the benches and dance and sing with the crowd. Usually, the tents are packed with people. So don't be shy, just ask some people if you and your friends can join to their table. People are usually in a very good mood and very open. You wonder how many people meet the love of their life at the Oktoberfest. To have the best time at the world's biggest public festival, there are some useful tips. 1. Don't wear Lederhosen made of plastic or cloth. You will look like a tourist. If you want to buy traditional Bavarian Lederhosen, make sure that they are nearly too tight. On the third day of wearing them they will just be fine. And once you've invested in the outfit, you can still use it for Halloween. 2. Make friends with the ladies delivering the beer. Never be cheap with your tip, otherwise you might wait for your next beer for hours. And do get out of the way of the waitresses. They are very busy and will run you over. Before drinking, it's crucial that you say ""Prost"" and clink your mug while making eye contact with everyone at the table. 3. Oktoberfest on a weekday is way more relaxed and much more fun. So if you don't have to, don't visit the Oktoberfest on a Saturday. The whole place is packed with people and often the tents have to close because of the crowds.  The beer at the Oktoberfest is much stronger than usual. So be careful that you eat loads before you start enjoying your beer, otherwise Oktoberfest might become an event you don't even remember. 4. Make sure you bring plenty of cash because you can't pay for your beer with a credit card. There are ATM cash machines at the Oktoberfest but the lines can be long. A good tip to keep your belongings safe: put your money and valuables inside a money belt and frustrate pickpockets who sneak around. 5. Don't try to get up on stage and sing with the band. It might sound strange to you but they actually don't like it. 6. Last call at all the big beer tents is at 10.30pm, one hour before closing time. If you leave the Wiesn at 10pm you can avoid the people-traffic-jam on the way to the bus and train stations. Also, Munich is very walkable. You can exercise by burning off some of the beer calories . 7. Open up to people. After several (or even one) litres of beer you and everyone else in the tent start losing inhibitions, so it's really easy to make new friends at Oktoberfest. So once you've found a seat at one of the tent's tables and ordered a beer, don't be shy -- introduce yourself to those around you. Even when you go just by yourself, you're going to have a blast. But smoking is banned in the tents. 8. Sleeping is the best way to keep your body fit -- not on the street or the sidewalk, though. Go ahead and sleep your heart out at the place you're staying. If you remind your body every now and then how it feels like to have more blood than alcohol running in your veins, your time at Oktoberfest will be a lot more fun. 9. Don't miss the Wiesn parties. Around the Theresienwiese and in the city plenty of clubs start the ""After-Wiesn"" right after closing the tents to make sure you can dance, party and have fun all night long. Watch out for flyers and talk to locals . 10. If you get sick, don't do it close to the river because people might want to go surfing there. Be sure you also take some time outside of the Oktoberfest. There is plenty to do in Munich. Apart from the Eisbach river my favorite places are the campsite next to the Flosslände and the Isar beaches. Breakfast at the Gärtnerplatz, a beautiful little square, is always a great way to start the day. To relax I go running or biking in the English Garden, Munich's biggest park, or just hang out in on its huge meadow. I also like having ""Steckerlfish"" (grilled fish) with a fresh beer at the beergarden ""Chinesischer Turm"" or visiting the museums ""Haus der Kunst"" and ""Pinakothek der Moderne"" (perfect on a rainy afternoon). Another amazing spot is the castle ""Schloss Nymphenburg"" which will make you feel like you're in a fairytale. Just come by, take a long walk in the park of the beautiful castle and at the castle canal and see for yourself.","Don't wear Lederhosen made of plastic or cloth. You will look like a tourist .

"Washington (CNN) -- A pair of Russian aircraft buzzed a U.S. warship off the Arctic coast of Russia on consecutive days last week, leading the U.S. Navy chief of naval operations to raise the issue with his Russian counterpart, a Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said. The first incident occurred September 10 in international waters of the Barents Sea. A U.S. military official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the incidents, said a Russian Il-38 maritime patrol aircraft flew about 50 yards off the side of the guided missile frigate USS Taylor at just about 100 feet above sea level. The official said the aircraft made several passes near the ship. The next day a Russian Helix helicopter circled the Taylor, also at low altitude. The official described the activity as ""abnormal"" operating procedure, because of the risk of an accident at such close range. Adm. Gary Roughead, the U.S. chief of naval operations, discussed the matter with his Russian counterpart, Adm. Vladimir Vysotskiy, according to Lapan. Lapan said the ship's crew did not interpret the Russian overflights to be hostile, but said the two sides are still talking to determine whether standard maritime procedures were followed. The two admirals met earlier this week during a visit of Russian military officials to the Pentagon. The incidents were disclosed by U.S. military officials only after that visit was over.","Two Russian aircraft made separate close approaches to the USS Taylor, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Beijing blasted a Chinese dissident's Nobel Peace Prize win Friday, calling the decision to award Liu Xiaobo the honor ""blasphemy."" Ma Zhaoxu, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said the award is supposed to be given to those who ""promote national harmony, international friendship"" and work toward peace. Liu is serving an 11-year prison term after being sentenced in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power. He is the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. ""Liu Xiaobo is a convicted criminal sentenced to jail by Chinese justice. His acts are in complete contradiction to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Ma said. The selection of Liu was made by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, whose president said the dissident won for his ""long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China."" However, Ma said that while China and Norway have recently had ""good relations,"" the committee's decision would harm future dealings between the two countries. The Nobel Committee stood by its choice and said it had expected China to react strongly. ""We have a very strong tradition of awarding the prize to human rights activists of many different kinds,"" Geir Lundestad, director of the Nobel Institute, told CNN. The institute assists the committee in selecting the prize each year. Lundestad cited German pacifist and journalist Carl von Ossietsky in 1935, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel in 1986, Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991 and Iranian campaigner Shirin Ebadi in 2003 as examples of human rights activists who have won the prize. ""This is a tradition we are very proud of, and this is a tradition for which the Norwegian Nobel Committee has received much applause,"" Lundestad said. ""We felt that if we were serious about this tradition, we did have to come to terms with the question of China in this perspective, and this is what we then did this year."" China's strongly worded response came in stark contrast to glowing reaction from around the world. Pu Zhiqiang, a human rights lawyer who is Liu's friend, said the prize indicates that Liu will have a huge impact. ""I doubt the Nobel will help Xiaobo right this moment, but in the long run, it will leave a legacy that is sure to help bring democratic reform and freedom to China, that will far outlast Liu's life,"" Pu said. ""Awarding the Peace Prize to him is the international community's recognition of the increasing voices among the Chinese people in pushing China towards political, legal and constitutional reforms,"" said the Dalai Lama, who won the prize in 1989. ""I believe in the years ahead, future generations of Chinese will be able to enjoy the fruits of the efforts that the current Chinese citizens are making towards responsible governance.""","The award will harm relations between China and Norway, spokesman says .
Spokesman for foreign ministry says Liu Xiaobo's actions contradict the purpose of award .
The award is supposed to ""promote national harmony,"" he says ."

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome to November! And to a new week of CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. First up today, a story that spans multiple continents. First Up: Security Concerns . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We will continue to pursue additional protective measures for as long as it takes to ensure the safety and security of our citizens. I have also directed that we spare no effort in investigating the origins of these suspicious packages and their connection to any additional terrorist plotting. AZUZ: The president's talking about a suspected terrorist plan that spread from the Middle East to Europe and almost to the U.S. Officials got a tip and stopped it this past Friday. The president mentioned suspicious packages. There were two of those. One was found on a plane in the United Kingdom. The other, on a plane in Dubai. Each of the packages had an explosive device hidden inside a computer printer. Officials say those explosives were designed to be set off remotely; they could be triggered with a cell phone. Saudi Arabia warned the United States about the packages. The U.S. told Britain. And then U.S. and British officials told the Middle Eastern nation of Yemen. Authorities think these bombs came from an al Qaeda terrorist group inside Yemen. The packages were found on cargo planes, but officials think the bombs might also have flown on passenger planes. Both of them were inside packages that were headed to Chicago, Illinois; never made it there. Brian Todd looks at why someone might have wanted to send these explosives on a cargo plane. (BEGIN VIDEO) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was an intelligence tip, not a random check, that led to the discovery of the suspicious package at the airport in Britain. That's according to British police sources. One of the world's top air security experts says the contents, a manipulated toner cartridge, and the origin of the package had to have set off alarms. Some things about this particular shipment just didn't seem right to you? RAFI RON, CEO, NEW AGE SECURITY SOLUTIONS: Yes. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Yemen is not known to be an exporting country for the printers' ink, certainly not to the United States. So, I think there is already something in the nature of the shipment that I would say supposed to draw our attention. TODD: Rafi Ron, former top Israeli air security chief who now advises the Boston and San Francisco airports, says packages in cargo planes are not screened as tightly as those in passenger aircraft. Not every package on a cargo plane is X-rayed. Ron says that's because terrorists typically don't want to bring down cargo planes. But if the intended targets are elsewhere, those procedures could change, at least temporarily. Homeland Security officials say, because of this incident, we'll see heightened screening of cargo at most major airports, more explosive trace detection, more use of imaging technology. Rafi Ron says areas like this in the U.S. and elsewhere also need more security -- the perimeters around the cargo loading areas and where the planes are -- because even though they have security, they are much more out in the open. But a crucial screening system is in place. It's called the Known Shipper program. Officials at the TSA and UPS tell us it's basically an intelligence-sharing network for cargo. Government security agencies around the world work with private companies, businesses and the transporters like UPS to track everything about a given package. (END VIDEO) Turkey Bombing . AZUZ: Police investigators are trying to find out who's responsible for a bomb that did go off in a Middle Eastern country this weekend. It happened in Istanbul, largest city in Turkey, a nation a little bit bigger than the U.S. state of Texas. At least 32 people were wounded in the attack, some of them seriously. But according to police, the suspected suicide bomber was the only person killed. Shoutout . APRIL WILLIAMS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's first Shoutout goes out to Mr. Berg's 6th grade humanities block at Beaver Lake Middle School in Issaquah, Washington! How many U.S. Senate seats are up for election this Tuesday? Is it: A) 33, B) 37, C) 100 or D) 435? You've got three seconds -- GO! This year's midterm elections will determine 37 U.S. Senate seats. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Midterm Elections . AZUZ: You've been hearing about it for awhile; now, this week, you are going to hear results. The midterm election is tomorrow! Voters will be heading out to polls all across the country, casting their ballots for national, state and local candidates. There's a lot at stake in these elections. Right now, Democrats have a majority in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives. Republicans are expected to make some gains on Tuesday. The big question is whether they'll win enough seats to take over the majority in either of those chambers of Congress. Meanwhile, the candidates are still out there trying to rally up support. DINO ROSSI, (R) SENATE CANDIDATE, WASHINGTON: I think the country needs to go in a very different direction. And this is really just a lot bigger than just me and one race. This is really about the future of this country. SEN.

AZUZ: Football, baseball, basketball: A lot of sports fans go all out when they cheer for their teams, especially when they're at the stadium. In Japan, there's one soccer stadium that's looking at ways to turn all that fan energy into... energy. Kyung Lah shows us how some fans can root for their team and the environment at the same time. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, TOKYO: In the game of football, there are few certainties, except for this: fans on their feet, pounding, jumping, never stopping for two hours; energy for the players on the field. But Mie Kiyota, who works for the Vissel Kobe team, saw something else. MIE KIYOTA, VISSEL KOBE [TRANSLATED]: ""There's got to be some way to harness their energy in some sort of eco-friendly way,"" she thought. LAH: It turns out, there is. In Japan, the J.R. train began capturing the energy commuters made while walking through the turnstiles. And at Kokwio Station's main Tokyo headquarters, the company is developing its own floor panels which capture the energy of human foot traffic. So, Kiyota convinced the team to join in the emerging kinetic energy panel field. Vissel Kobe bought 24 panels, which landed under the feet of the fan section, where Kazuya Yamashiro is glad his girth is helping the environment. KAZUYA YAMASHIRO, KOBE VISSEL FAN [TRANSLATED]: ""I'm bigger than the other fans,"" he says... LAH: ...pointing out that he's able to produce more energy with each heavy jump. The power cord, says Kiyota, carries the fans' energy to a power box, to batteries. The amount of real energy produced in this testing phase is actually quite small. Because the last game was a tie, these three AA batteries were charged. But the stadium is using the energy produced for a real purpose: to power flashlights for the night games. Just the beginning, pledges Kiyota. Do you envision a day when this entire stadium will have this type of energy flooring? KIYOTA [TRANSLATED]: I think so. I hope one day this system will be in every seat, producing more clean energy. LAH: The team hopes football stadiums around the world will see Kobe's small experiment and want to jump in. The biggest stumbling blocks right now, practicality and price tag. (END VIDEO) Facebook Chat . AZUZ: Your questions. My answers. Our very first Facebook conversation of the school year is tonight.

AZUZ: ...though there won't be a photo booth like you saw in that video. It'll just be us, text and our computers. A student recently asked me why so many of our Before We Go segments involve cats. I said it's 'cause cats are crazy. This one's just cute! It's an 8-week-old lion cub, a new addition to the National Zoo. The swimming lesson's for his own good. Before he's allowed in the habitat for lions, he's gotta prove he can keep his little head above water, in case he falls in the moat and no one's around to fish him out. Goodbye . AZUZ: Needless to say, he passed the test swimmingly, though he had to work to stay afloat; he couldn't just be lion around. And we're sure when he makes his debut at the zoo, he will be lionized.

"Pensacola, Florida (CNN) -- The man who prosecutors said captained a team of masked men dressed as ninjas as they ambushed a Florida home has been found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder. A Escambia County jury determined Thursday evening that Leonard Gonzalez Jr. followed through on his plan and fatally shot Byrd and Melanie Billings in the couple's master bedroom, as one of their nine special-needs children looked on. He was also found guilty of armed home-invasion robbery. During the trial, Gonzalez frequently conversed with his attorneys, shook his head and even smirked. He told Judge Nickolas Geeker that he didn't need to call any witnesses or testify on his own behalf, because ""the evidence speaks for itself."" And after the jury came out to ask a question during their four hours of deliberations, he said, ""I've already been tried and convicted by the media."" But Gonzalez was stoic just before the verdict came in. Meanwhile, members of the Billings family cried in the courtroom, with Byrd's and Melanie's daughter Ashley Markham hugging prosecutors. Gonzalez nodded to the Billings family -- as he'd done earlier Thursday -- after he was fingerprinted and led away. The jury of 11 women and one man deliberated for four hours before reaching the verdict. In that time, they requested to see a 14-minute surveillance video, culled from 16 cameras around the Billings house that were set up around the house to watch the nine special-needs children that the couple had adopted and were in the house of the time of the murder. One video showed a masked man -- who Frederick Thornton, a member of the group, identified as Gonzalez -- shooting Byrd Billings once in each leg. Another video showed a scene from a girl's bedroom as a red van packed with people arrives outside the house. The girl gets up from bed as the masked men enter the house, then hides under the covers pretending to sleep after hearing the commotion nearby. The van was owned by Gonzalez. A camera was not in the master bedroom. But Thornton said that Gonzalez led the Billings' couple into the room. And expert witnesseses showed how Gonzalez shot Byrd Billings once in the head and twice more as he lay face down on the floor, and then shot Melanie Billings through the head and chest. During closing arguments, Assistant State Attorney John Molchan painted an involved picture depicting Gonzalez as the ringleader who hatched the plan, formed the team, outfitted six other men with guns and clothes, then led them as they barged into the Billings' large home in Beulah, Florida. He said Gonzalez was motivated by ""simple greed"" -- pointing to testimony from the defendant's wife that the family's business, a karate school, had gone under and they had dwindling means to take care of their six children. Leonard Gonzalez knew Billings, who gave $5,000 to a self-defense charity he started, and he knew he had money, Molchan said. Gonzalez provided the all-black clothing, boots and guns and briefed the attackers prior to the invasion, according to Molchan. He said that Gonzalez also did ""all the talking [and] all the muscling"" when the group entered the residence. ""The puzzle pieces all come together, and they prove an ugly story,"" said Molchan. ""There is no doubt that Leonard Patrick Gonzalez is the man who had his finger ... on the trigger."" John Jay Gontarek, one of Gonzalez's attorneys, criticized the state's case as overly reliant on circumstantial evidence and two men, Rakeem Florence and Thornton, who confessed their involvement and named Gonzalez as the leader of the band of masked men and the shooter. Florence said there was no mention anyone would be killed until he overheard Gonzalez say he was ""going to kill somebody"" minutes before they went to the house. Prosecutors called the testimony of the two -- who were age 16 and 19, respectively, when the crime took place -- measured and reliable, and supported by the other evidence in the case. But both Florence and Thornton, who have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for their roles, admitted first lying to family and law enforcement before changing their stories. ""They're hanging their hat on the testimony of those admitted liars,"" Gontarek said of the prosecution. DNA tests on the 9 mm pistol and bullet casings that killed the Billings' couple did not conclusively point to Gonzalez, Gontarek pointed out. He said, too, that there was minimal effort to clean the alleged murder weapon. ""We don't have to prove who the killer was,"" Gontarek said. ""No matter how tragic this murder is, if you have one reasonable doubt, then you have a duty to return a verdict of not guilty."" Florence and Thornton testified that Gonzalez said they were after $13 million of money laundered from ""the Mexican mafia."" A small safe that was stolen and later found in the back yard of one of Gonzalez's friends contained prescription medication, family documents and some jewelry. Two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that a second safe at the home contained at least $100,000. In final comments, Molchan reminded the jury of Gonzalez's own words after he first spoke to police, when he reportedly said, ""I'm in deep, I'll take the heat."" ""The defense attorney labeled [Leonard] Gonzalez as being somewhat goofy,"" said Molchan. ""Folks, he's not goofy. He's a murderer -- a plain, cold-blooded murderer."" The penalty phase in Gonzalez's trial starts Friday morning, Judge Geeker said. In Session's Jean Casarez and Nancy Leung contributed to this report.","NEW: A jury finds Leonard Gonzalez Jr. guilty of two counts of first-degree murder .

"(CNN) -- Now in its 37th year, the Glastonbury festival has built a reputation as the mother of all music festivals, with the biggest names in rock music gladly accepting invitations to play the Pyramid stage year after year. Yet for all their combined wealth and fame, it is festival's organizer who remains the true star of Glastonbury. Festival guru Michael Eavis is, by his own admission, ""a bit of a puritan."" Michael Eavis is the one of the most un-rock and roll people you are ever likely to meet. By his own admission he is ""a bit of a Puritan"". He worships, with his 95 year-old mum, Sheila, at the local Methodist chapel every Sunday, and abhors drink and drugs and smoking. Yet his twin passions for music and people inspired him to start what would grow into Britain's foremost music festival. Born in 1935, Eavis was educated at Wells Cathedral School in Somerset. He left school when he was just 15 years old to join the Union Castle Shipping Line as a trainee midshipman. He spent four happy years plying the trade routes between Britain, South Africa and Kenya before, at the age of 19, his father -- a farmer and Methodist preacher died of cancer. It was initially with some reluctance that Eavis accepted his inheritance of 150 acres, 60 cows and an overdraft, and returned from his life at sea to run Worthy Farm. At the same time he embarked upon his first marriage to Ruth, which produced three children before they divorced in 1964. The idea to stage a festival took seed in 1970 when Eavis and Jean Hayball (his future wife) snuck into the Bath Blues Festival and saw Led Zeppelin perform their set. Eavis has often described that moment as an epiphany. ""Something flashes down and you suddenly change,"" he said. Later that year, on September 19th Eavis organized a Pop, Folk and Blues Festival at Worthy Farm charging £1 and offering free milk to festival goers. Marc Bolan -- who arrived in a velvet covered Buick car - topped the bill after The Kinks had pulled out at the last minute and although the festival made a loss of £1500 -- Eavis had hoped it would pay off his mortgage and allow him to farm ecologically -- it was deemed a success. The following year the festival was renamed the ""Glastonbury Fayre"" with an attendance of 12,000 and the famous Pyramid stage was erected for the first time. After the ""impromptu"" festival in 1978, where 500 travelers arrived unannounced from Stonehenge, the festival began to regain momentum. By 1981, it was officially called the ""Glastonbury Festival"" and began its attachments with political and charitable causes. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament benefited to the tune of £20,000 and by the end of the decade Greenpeace, Oxfam and local charities were all benefiting from donations. But by now, Eavis was facing annual opposition from local residents and the district council who threatened to revoke the festival's entertainment license. Matters came to a head in 1990 when travelers, who were looting the site clashed with security guards resulting in 235 arrests and £50,000 of damage to property. The rest of the decade proved more peaceful and crowds soared to over 100,000, but the millennium would close on a tragic note for Eavis when his wife and mother of the festival, Jean, died of cancer in 1999. A wicker sculpture was ceremoniously burned in her honor and fireworks illuminated the sky. In 2002 the festival underwent the biggest overhaul since it's conception. Steel fencing ringed the site and music event's organizer Mean Fiddler took over the running of ticketing and security, successfully stopping troublemakers and ticketless fans from entering the site. Some people accused Glastonbury of selling out and caving in to consumerism, but without such measures it would never gain it's license. Far from denting its popularity, the festival has gone from strength to strength with a record 180,000 people attending in 2007. Eavis will raise £2m for charity this year with Greenpeace, WaterAid, Oxfam, I Count and a range of local charities all benefiting from the festival. The 2007 finished as usual, with people shouting their thanks to Eavis. Covered in mud, they all joyfully tell him what a fantastic time they have had. Eavis receives the praise graciously. He signed off his post-festival message on the Glastonbury Web site saying: ""If I ever needed encouragement to carry on, you have all given me loads of it. Thank you again for everything."" For now, it's time for Eavis to go back to farming and look forward to 2008.","Eavis, who abhors drink and drugs, has hosted the festival since 1970 .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- An unscripted, shocking moment during last year's MTV Video Music awards dominated Sunday night's show, with Kanye West and Taylor Swift putting their feelings to music. Taylor Swift sang a ballad of forgiveness for West -- the rapper who interrupted her acceptance speech at last year's show, while West's song seemed to acknowledge his reputation as a jerk. ""Who you are is not what you did,"" Swift sang. ""You're still an innocent."" ""Let's have a toast for the scumbags,"" West sang in his hook.  Other lines were unprintable because of graphic language. Swift, who has built a career writing songs about men who have done her wrong, penned her song -- ""Innocent"" -- earlier this year ""about her feelings about last year's VMAs,"" her representative told CNN. There was no immediate information from West's representative about his song, which ended the show. West also was the target of jokes from show host Chelsea Handler. She lampooned by West by giving tips on how to fend off people stealing a spotlight. Another celeb made fun of her own bad behavior early in the show. Lindsay Lohan, fresh out of jail and rehab, appeared in a backstage skit with Handler, who was wearing an alcohol-detection bracelet like the one Lohan recently wore. ""Wake up, Handler, pull it together,"" Lohan said as she slammed Handler against a wall. ""You're a menace. Do you think anyone will work with a drunk? Take it from me, they don't."" Handler made her first stage entrance wearing a model of a house on her head, a joke aimed at Lady Gaga, who is known for creative and often bulky costumes. Gaga won two awards early in the show -- including for best female video and best pop video. Each time she struggled to reach the stage because of her dress, which she explained was ""too heavy to walk in."" Eminem, who opened the show in a duet with Rihanna, won for best male video and best pop video. The rapper didn't come on stage to accept because he had already left the building to catch a plane to New York. ""Jersey Shore"" cast members provided humor from a hot tub. Handler jumped in the jacuzzi with the four, including Snooki and the Situation. Teen singing sensation Justin Bieber took the stage outside of the Nokia Theater in downtown Los Angeles during the first hour. Usher followed with a song on the main stage. Linkin Park, Drake, Paramore, B.o.B, Florence + The Machine also were on the list of performers. Last year's show is remembered mostly for what was not planned. West, who walked the red carpet with a bottle of cognac in his hand, jumped on stage after Swift was announced the winner over Beyonce in one category. ""Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm gonna let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time,"" he said, snatching the microphone from Swift after she had won her award. Swift stood onstage, speechless, clutching her award. The cameras panned to a shocked Beyonce, while the audience booed and later chanted ""Taylor."" Though Beyonce later afforded the teen singer another opportunity to finish her speech, the West backlash had begun. It cost him his spot on a concert tour with Lady Gaga.","Taylor Swift sings forgiveness for Kanye West .

"(CNN) -- Amid intense public attention, Tyler Clementi's family remained quiet Friday, except to say that their personal tragedy has raised a host of legal issues for the country. ""We understand that our family's personal tragedy presents important legal issues for the country as well for us,"" said a statement from the family of the Rutgers University student who committed suicide after an internet broadcast of him engaged in a sexual encounter with a man. ""Regardless of legal outcomes, our hope is that our family's personal tragedy will serve as a call for compassion, empathy and human dignity,"" the statement said. The legal closure to this case is far from apparent. It's still not clear what charges Clementi's roommate Dhuran Ravi and his friend Molly Wei will ultimately face. The two Rutgers students have been charged with invasion of privacy for surreptitiously placing a webcam in Ravi's dorm room and streaming online Clementi's encounter with another man. Ravi allegedly sent messages on Twitter about the video and invited his friends to watch the video on iChat. On September 22, Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, which spans the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. Rutgers student remembered as dedicated musician . New Jersey prosecutors were determining Friday whether additional charges, including bias, may be brought against Ravi and Wei. ''The initial focus of this investigation has been to determine who was responsible for remotely activating the camera in the dormitory room of the student and then transmitting the encounter on the internet,'' Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce J. Kaplan said. ''Now that two individuals have been charged with invasion of privacy, we will be making every effort to assess whether bias played a role in the incident, and, if so, we will bring appropriate charges,'' Kaplan said in a statement. What is clear, though, is that the Rutgers case has reignited debate over cyber incivility and whether tougher privacy laws are needed in a technologically advanced age when anyone can instantly disseminate information about another person with relative ease. Newark attorney Henry Klingeman, who used to be a federal prosecutor, said that in many cases, it's unlikely that anyone would serve significant jail time on invasion of privacy charges like Ravi and Wei are facing. He said federal laws are stronger, but most cases are tried in state courts. Gathering or viewing sexual pictures without consent is a fourth-degree crime, and broadcasting them is a third-degree crime. ""State laws treat it like a nuisance, like graffiti on a street,"" Klingeman said. He likened cyber-voyeurism to the illegal recording of phone calls and said: ""It took a while for the law to catch up. Now, wiretapping is illegal."" This summer, ESPN reporter Erin Andrews appeared in Congress to express support for federal legislation to strengthen stalking laws. The man convicted of videotaping her through a hotel peephole was sentenced to two years in prison. Her sentence, she said, was a lifetime of looking over her shoulder. The legislation would cover technologies such as electronic monitoring, spyware, bugging and video surveillance, said the bill's sponsor, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-California. Under current law, a victim must have a ""reasonable fear of physical injury"" before a case can be prosecuted, Sanchez said. Sometimes, that is too late. All the facts in the Clementi case are yet to surface. Ravi's lawyer, Steve Altman, told The Star Ledger newspaper that he did not see how, under New Jersey law, Ravi and Wei could be held accountable for Clementi's suicide. ""To my knowledge, whatever the allegations are that justify the criminal complaints filed against the students, would not justify under either legal or common law any culpability for the suicide,"" Altman told the newspaper. What is alleged is that on the evening of September 19, Ravi sent a message by Twitter about his roommate, Clementi. ""Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay."" Ravi tried to use the webcam again two days later, on September 21, according to the Middlesex County prosecutor's office. ""Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes it's happening again,"" Ravi is believed to have tweeted. The next day, Clementi, 18, was dead. A mobile status update September 22 on a Facebook page purportedly belonging to Clementi said: ""jumping off the gw bridge sorry."" ""If the charges are true, these actions gravely violate the university's standards of decency and humanity,"" Rutgers President Richard L. McCormick said after the news of Clementi's death broke. If Ravi and Wei are convicted on the invasion of privacy charges, they face a maximum penalty of five years in jail. The punishment, said Washington privacy lawyer Christopher Wolf, seems too lenient for the crime if it's proved that Clementi's suicide was triggered by the webcam video. Wolf said the Rutgers incident reminded him of Lori Drew, the Missouri woman convicted on three misdemeanor counts of accessing protected computers without authorization. Prosecutors argued that Drew illegally used the social networking site MySpace to humiliate a 13-year-old girl, who authorities said killed herself after receiving derogatory messages. In that case, Wolf said, prosecutors found that there were not any existing laws that allowed them to charge Drew for the crime they said was committed. But in America, Wolf said, revisions in the law will not come easy. ""We also have to remember we have First Amendment laws,"" he said. ""What we really need is a new culture of cyber civility."" When fourth-graders are obtaining Facebook pages, Wolf said, parents can no longer afford to abdicate computer usage rules to the kids because they happen to be more technologically savvy than they are. Wolf said service providers and institutions -- like Rutgers -- need to take more responsibility for online content. ""There isn't an easy solution,"" he said.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- What was Hurricane Karl weakened Friday to a tropical storm after making landfall, but the heavy rain it spawned could still cause mudslides and flash floods in the Mexican interior, forecasters said. Karl was downgraded after coming ashore as a Category 3 hurricane about 10 miles (15 kilometers) north of Veracruz, Mexico, CNN's satellite and radar estimates showed. The storm is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression later Friday or Saturday and dissipate over the mountains of Mexico on Sunday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Friday evening. It added the Mexican government has discontinued all coastal watches and warnings. The storm delivered torrents of rain and fierce winds several hours before it hit land around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET). Photographs sent to CNN's iReport by Ricardo Arcaraz, who lives in Veracruz, showed heavy rain and trees on top of power lines. He reported widespread outages. Maximum sustained winds later weakened to around 70 mph (115 kph) with higher gusts, according to the Hurricane Center. Karl, located about 75 miles (115 kilometers) east of Puebla Mexico, was moving west-southwest at about 9 mph (15 kph), it said. Satellite images and surface observations from Mexico suggest Karl is weakening rapidly as it passes through steep mountains, the Hurricane Center added. High winds remain a threat, though forecasters said they will likely weaken too in the coming days. The homes of at least 3,000 families in central Mexico were damaged, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. ""Tropical storm force winds are occurring in a small area near the center. These winds will continue to spread inland along the track of the center tonight but should decrease rapidly as Karl weakens,"" the Hurricane Center said. Potentially dangerous rain also was forecast. ""Karl is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across portions of south-central Mexico, with isolated amounts of 15 inches possible in the mountains,"" the center said. ""These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides."" Within the past day or so, some 8 inches of rain has fallen in Veracruz, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Some local flooding was already reported, the Mexican Interior Ministry said. Officials closed some roads and urged evacuations for large, low-lying areas in Veracruz. Mexico's National System for Civil Protection issued a red alert, the highest level, for central and southern Veracruz. An orange alert was in place for northern Veracruz and the states of Hidalgo, Tlaxcala and Puebla. A yellow alert was issued for the states of Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi and Oaxaca. Mexican President Felipe Calderon also sent a warning Friday morning on his Twitter account. ""An alert for Hurricane Karl in the nation's central states,"" it said, adding that Karl ""could convert to a Category 4. It will enter through Veracruz around midday."" Texas could be spared any major problems because a storm surge occurs only near the landfall location, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Coastal flood advisories have been issued for south Texas, which means forecasters expect a small amount of coastal flooding but nothing serious, Morris said. A larger threat to south Texas will come from several inches of rain that could cause flooding and mudslides. The area could see as much as 4 inches by Sunday, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in far southern Texas.

"(CNN) -- Injured Formula One star Felipe Massa is looking forward to taking his first steps towards driving again after passing a series of mental and physical tests in Miami. Felipe Massa has been given the all-clear to begin training as he bids to return to the race track. His team Ferrari reported on its Web site on Tuesday that the Brazilian, who suffered horrific head wounds in Hungary in July, had come through the tests satisfactorily on Monday. ""The checks (which included neurometric, impact and cognitive capacity tests) all had a positive outcome, just like the eye exam: everything is in order for Felipe to get back to racing,"" the statement said. ""Now there has just to be carried out some plastic surgery at the brain box, where the spring at the accident at the Hungaroring hit his helmet. ""The surgery will take place in the upcoming days. After a short convalescence Felipe can then gradually start with physical preparations."" The 28-year-old, who finished second in last year's drivers' world championship, said that he planned to take things slowly following the operation. ""I'm very happy about the results,"" he told www.Ferrari.com before returning home to Sao Paulo. ""After the small surgery, in the next few days I can finally start to go to the gym to get back into shape and drive some tests in karts. ""On the track with a Formula One single-seater? Let's take it step by step. At the moment I'm concentrating on taking up physical activities, which is a great step forward."" Ferrari said Massa was expected to be at 100 percent fitness in time for the 2010 season, but gave no indication whether he would return to racing this year -- he has, however, indicated that he would like to drive at his home Brazilian Grand Prix on October 18. His replacement, test driver Luca Badoer, is not expected to drive at the Italian Grand Prix two weekends away after finishing last in his two races so far. Badoer, who stepped into the breach when F1 legend Michael Schumacher was unable to make a shock return to the sport due to a neck problem, was not allowed to test drive the current Ferrari vehicle during the four-week summer break due to this year's regulations. Veteran Italian Giancarlo Fisichella has been linked with Ferrari after finishing second at the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday, but his team Force India insist that he will race for them at Monza. Highly-rated Polish driver Robert Kubica is also in the running to replace Badoer, with his team BMW Sauber dropping out of F1 at the end of this season. Badoer's results aside, Ferrari have enjoyed a renaissance since Massa's injury, with 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen winning in Belgium to end a personal drought of 26 races and placing third in Valencia.","Injured F1 star Felipe Massa passes series of mental and physical tests .

"(CNN) -- Senate Republicans have said no to any piece of legislation related to immigration that extends beyond border enforcement. Most recently, they killed the DREAM Act (it stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) with a filibuster and balked at the late-hour introduction of a comprehensive immigration bill by Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey. The conventional wisdom has been the GOP's position was a good short-term strategy that would mobilize the Tea Party movement in a climate of left-of-center malaise and reinforce Republicans' seemingly inexorable November landslide. There is good reason to believe, however, that obstructing Congress on immigration will hurt the party in this election and in the long-term. With the rise of Latino voters in the United States, obstructing immigration reform could cost the GOP votes on Tuesday and any chance of winning back the White House in 2012 and beyond. The DREAM Act is as American as apple pie. Behind it is the uncontroversial idea that we do not hold children accountable for their parents' actions. Its basic premise is to offer a path to citizenship to children whose parents brought them to this country with or without their consent. In our broken system, once they grow up, these children face deportation to countries they have never known. Under DREAM, they would earn their citizenship by going to college or serving in the military, the latter option being the reason that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appended DREAM to a defense bill. DREAM's message is practical and straightforward: Encourage children of immigrants who have grown up in America to continue studying (good for the economy) or join the military (good for national defense). But the GOP said no, as it said on energy spending, financial regulation and health care. On its face, this has just been the most recent episode in the GOP's broader strategy -- block Democratic efforts and then denounce the Democrats as incapable ideologues. The difference on immigration is that Republicans said no while many simultaneously began supporting nativist state legislation, first in Arizona and then in more than 20 other states. The combination of saying no on DREAM while saying yes to laws that raise the ugly specter of racial profiling has caught Latino voters' attention. Recent polls show that Latino concern about immigration is up. Moreover, since the DREAM Act was introduced in mid-September, LatinoDecisions polls have found that Latino voters have become more likely to cast ballots on Tuesday. Although Latinos remain displeased that Democrats have not passed immigration legislation, the same polls revealed increased Latino awareness of Republicans' obstructionism and Democrats' efforts. Moreover, a Pew Hispanic Center poll found that registered Latino voters are three times as likely to vote for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House (65 percent Democratic to 22 percent Republican). These factors will likely have short- and long-term consequences. In the short term, the GOP's intransigence on DREAM and active promotion of Arizona's law and copycat laws have made the case to Latinos more forcefully than Democrats ever could about the need to vote on Tuesday. Latinos are the single-largest ethnic minority in the United States, and increased turnout in support of Democrats could reduce Republican gains in the House and Senate this week. Long-term, there's recognition in some corners of the GOP that being the party of ""no"" and ""get out"" is a losing proposition. In the 1960s, the party lost African-American voters by opposing civil rights legislation, and they have never been able to bring them back. Today, they risk losing Latinos in the same way. Latino voters are like other voters. They generally care more about the economy more than anything else. In fact, Republican have an ideological advantage with many Protestant Latinos because of the party's close ties to Christian conservatives. President George W. Bush won a majority among Latino Protestants in 2004. But the party has squandered this advantage by turning immigration into a top issue in Latinos' consciousness. A recent LatinoMetrics poll shows that immigration is now of at least equal concern to Latino voters as the economy, and concern over discrimination and racism has surged. Republicans should be concerned not only about Latino voting patterns in this election, but also about how their current position affects their chances of competing in future presidential elections. If Latinos come out as strongly for the Democrats in November as they did in 2008, cooler heads in the GOP may prevail and press for compromise in the lame-duck session and the next Congress. Presidential aspirants, too, may push for an immigration solution in 2011 so that the issue fades away before the next primary season pushes candidates back toward the right. Finally, business leaders could play a key role in pushing the Republicans to their senses. Right-wing groups such as the Chamber of Commerce are already on the right side of this issue. Even Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox News continues to spew bile on immigration issues, has come out publicly for immigration reform. But the ability of these figures to wrest back control of the Republican position in 2011 all hinges on  Tuesday's vote. If the House returns to Republican control, it's hard to imagine Rep. John Boehner -- who would become House Majority leader -- helping the GOP retreat from the precipice on immigration. A Boehner-led House could block any forward progress until at least 2013. For Democrats, the longer-term silver lining of continued GOP obstruction would be the further alienation of Latinos from the Republicans. The short-term tragedy, though, would be at least two more years during which our immigration system would remain broken and 11 million immigrants would remain undocumented in this country, living on the margins of our society without the rights that their neighbors enjoy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Altschuler.","Daniel Altschuler: GOP has opposed any immigration legislation beyond border control .

"(CNN) -- Pre-tournament favorites the Ivory Coast qualified for the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations with a 3-1 victory against Ghana in Angola on Friday night, despite having Emmanuel Eboue sent off. The Elephants have four points from two games, leaving Ghana and Burkina Faso to fight for the other place from Group B, with Togo having withdrawn following the deadly gun attack on their team bus. Ghana's Black Stars will need to show more penetration next Tuesday than they did on a boggy-looking, cut up pitch in Cabinda, with Burkina Faso needing just a draw to go through. Injury-hit Ghana, four-time winners of the tournament, started with captain Michael Essien on the bench as he was deemed not ready to play due to the hamstring problem that delayed his arrival from England. And while his side made it a bright start, it was the Ivorians who took the lead in the 23rd minute after a swift counter-attack, with Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure threading a slide-rule pass behind the defense to Salomon Kalou which allowed the Chelsea striker to square a simple chance for Gervinho to knock into the net. Kalou's clubmate Essien came on at halftime for Mousse Narry and gave his team more presence in midfield, but it was the Ivory Coast who were left to rue strongarm tactics when Arsenal's Eboue was red-carded for a dreadful two-footed lunge on Agyeman Opoku in the 55th minute. Mathew Amoah almost made the Ivorians pay immediately, but his left-foot shot hit the base of the post with goalkeeper Boubacar Barry well beaten. But Ghana paid for their lack of finishing when Siaka Tiene fired in a superb free-kick in the 67th minute, with his dipping left-foot effort from the right-hand side of the pitch clearing the wall and beating keeper Richard Kingson at his near post. Kalou was stretchered off soon after following a collision with a teammate, but the Ivory Coast were comfortable and added a third goal in the final minute of regulation time when his replacement Kader Keita did well to deliver a cross which captain Didier Drogba powerfully headed home at the far post. Ghana were given a consolation penalty in time added on when halftime substitute Asamoah Gyan went down under a 50-50 challenge from Soulemane Bamba, and the Rennes striker got up to slot the goal.","Ivory Coast reach last eight of Africa Cup of Nations with 3-1 win over Ghana in Angola .

"(CNN)  -- When 3-year-old Finnegan Burns fell ill with complications from cystic fibrosis, his parents did what any loving parents would do. Kerry and Patrick Burns put their lives on hold to see their son through his medical travails. Surgery after surgery, hospital after hospital, they remained by their child's side as he fought to recover. This past March, at age 4½, Finnegan lost his battle with this terrible disease. Following the indescribable anguish that comes with the death of a child, Kerry and Patrick might have hoped to resume their jobs and begin the process of moving forward with their lives. What should have been a private and quiet period has instead been marked by a mountain of medical debt, home foreclosure and bankruptcy. Like three-quarters of the families driven to bankruptcy by health-related costs, the Burns family had health insurance when Finnegan became ill. In fact, through a combination of employer-provided insurance, COBRA coverage and state-sponsored care, the vast majority of Finnegan's medical expenses were covered. But to be by their son's side during his treatments, Finnegan's parents both took time off from work. With their reduced income, it was impossible for them to make ends meet. According to a recent study by researchers at Harvard University and published in The American Journal of Medicine, medical costs, including lost wages, copays, deductibles, premiums, coverage limits and uncovered expenses, contributed to more than 62 percent all personal bankruptcy filings in 2007. These costs can bankrupt even those with health insurance they thought was solid as a rock. As Congress moves forward with long-overdue legislation to improve and expand health insurance coverage, we should help the millions of Americans drowning in medical debt get a fresh start. By ensuring that the vast majority of Americans have access to affordable health insurance, the broad health care reform legislation being debated in the Senate will reduce the number of bankruptcies caused by medical debt. Even so, uncovered expenses such as lost wages can drive people to bankruptcy. The Medical Bankruptcy Fairness Act would make it easier for those with high levels of medical expenses to discharge their debt and move on with their lives, by lifting unnecessary and burdensome procedural requirements for people who become insolvent because of unavoidable health costs. For example, under the current system, a prospective bankruptcy filer must complete credit counseling, a requirement that includes a fee and is geared to people whose irresponsible spending led to bankruptcy. For Kerry and Patrick Burns, the counseling was a cruel reminder of their loss. They were unable to, and should not have had to, answer the question: What could you have done differently to avoid your financial hardship? To add to the heartlessness of this nonsensical, government-imposed obligation, the credit counseling was an online program. A person would have seen how inappropriate it was to be asking that question. In addition, the proposed legislation -- which has been offered as an amendment to the larger health care bill and also is pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee as a stand-alone bill -- would give the medically bankrupt increased flexibility in paying attorneys' fees and a greater chance of retaining their homes. The bill, which would cost the taxpayers nothing, does not propose a bailout or handout. It would merely adjust the current bankruptcy rules to make the process less expensive and more accessible for those on the verge of losing everything because of uncontrollable medical expenses. We hope that Congress will swiftly approve this common sense dose of compassion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth Edwards and Sheldon Whitehouse.","Authors tell story of Kerry and Patrick Burns, who lost home, went bankrupt after son died .

"(CNN) -- New York could be the first state in the country to impose a limited ban on a controversial method of drilling for natural gas. This week, the state assembly passed a hydraulic fracturing moratorium bill, which is currently en route to New York Gov. David Paterson's desk.  He will have 10 days from then to take action. In the past, Paterson has expressed concern about hydraulic fracturing, which involves cracking thousands of feet beneath the earth's surface to get at valuable natural gas. It is unclear if the governor will sign or veto the legislation. ""He'll hear what everybody has to say,"" a representative of the governor's office told CNN. She would not provide her name. Interactive: See how fracking works . The assembly voted 93 to 43 Monday night to place a temporary moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, so the state can investigate the safety and environmental concerns. The state Senate passed a similar bill in August. The moratorium  -- which would only be in effect until May -- seeks to halt new drilling permits for horizontal hydraulic fracturing, dubbed ""fracking,"" a controversial method of extracting natural gas. The drilling process has come under scrutiny because of the potential effects on drinking water, public health and the environment. Can shale gas be produced safely? If signed into law, New York would be the first state to impose a fracking moratorium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The proposed moratorium in New York was described as ""misguided"" by Kathryn Klaber, who represents a large natural gas industry coalition in the northeast United States. ""Tightly-regulated, environmentally sound natural gas development in New York can and will deliver a much-needed and long-lasting economic shot in the arm to not only communities along the Southern Tier, but for the entire state, just as it is in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and elsewhere,"" said a written statement from Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition. Using hydraulic fracturing, drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into the shale formation thousands of feet underground under high pressure. Fracturing the shale around the gas well then allows the natural gas to flow freely. The process has raised concerns about whether those chemicals are contaminating the underground water.  Some residents near hydraulic fracturing drill sites along the Delaware River Basin -- located in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania -- have been able to set their water on fire. Watch residents set water on fire . Several residents in rural Pennsylvania have filed a lawsuit against Cabot Oil & Gas, blaming the company for the contamination. The company has said the hydraulic fracturing process is ""proven and safe,"" citing a 2004 hydraulic fracturing study by the EPA that concluded the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids ""poses minimal threat"" to underground sources of drinking water. The EPA is currently reviewing its position and plans to issue its report in 2012. Can the EPA regulate fracking? New York City gets roughly half of its water from the Delaware River Basin, which was recently named the country's most endangered river because of the threat of natural gas. Last month, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for a cautious approach to the drilling. ""The stakes are high,"" Bloomberg wrote in a November 17 letter to the Delaware River Basin Commission's Executive Director Carol Collier. ""The City has invested more than $1.5 billion in watershed protection programs that have resulted in improved water quality throughout our watershed, as well as to our releases downstream, which benefit all members of the Commission, and the 15 million people who rely on the Delaware River watershed for clean drinking water,"" Bloomberg wrote. Over the past few years, technological advances and increased profit margins have spurred increased use of hydraulic fracturing, according to the EPA. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates shale gas will make up more than 20 percent of the nation's total natural gas supply by 2020. Currently, most natural gas is burned to produce electricity or heat and cool buildings. When burned, it emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal. For that reason, most of the country's big environmental groups are cautiously supportive of increased shale gas development. But, with the expansion of fracturing, there are increased concerns about its potential effects on the underground water table, public health and the environment. Read Fortune Magazine's special series on fracking . The concerns have prompted an EPA study of the potential problems with fracturing and public hearings to help decide how to conduct the study are almost finished. The EPA -- which held public meetings this year in Binghamton, New York; Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; Fort Worth, Texas; and Denver, Colorado -- plans to begin its actual study in January 2011 and release initial study results by late 2012.","New York's state assembly passed a limited ban on hydraulic fracturing .

"(CNN) -- They've been in the banking business for more than 200 years, Pictet and Company came to prominence when Europe was booming, specializing in personalized, discrete banking services. Senior managing partner of Swiss bank Pictet & Cie, Ivan Pictet talks to CNN's Andrew Stevens. Since 1980, the company has grown five-fold to be one of the biggest banks in Switzerland. But growth hasn't changed tradition says Ivan Pictet. CNN's Andrew Stevens met with Ivan in China to talk about leading the banking dynasty into today's tumultuous financial water and what really defines Swiss banking. Pictet: I think Swiss banking has changed, it still has a very strong position in the world's banking, but it has changed. Banking secrecy has evolved toward the new legislation on money laundering and so on, so confidentiality is not defined the same way today as it would have been, or not protected today as it would have been 25 years ago. So I think everything is changing but we restrict to some very strong principles, and I think that's very important. Stevens: We've been talking about the fit with the Swiss with private banking -- the Swiss character, the Swiss style -- last year though, you, for the first time, brought in non-Swiss to be investors, managing directors who can invest in the bank, and I'm wondering, does that in some way dilute your brand as a Swiss bank, now you're bringing non-Swiss in? Pictet: Pictet has had a profit participation system since 1991. We were probably the pioneer in Europe and probably the world at that time, so we have distributed large part of our profit to our employees at all time. Today, out of the 3,000 or 2,700 people we have, about 1,400 have a direct participation -- can go from 10 percent to 200 or 300 percent of their salary, so in order for us to keep our best talents, and to stimulate those who would like to join the league, we have created this special group which has a participation, direct participation, in the capital of the bank. Stevens: One of the principles you stick to is that you and your seven partners bear personal responsibility for the losses of the bank, your personal wealth is at stake everyday of the year, how does that impact the way you manage the bank? Pictet: Well it certainly does make us more conservative, in terms of really remaining focused on one business, which is asset management. I mean we never diversify into investment banking or do any commercial activity in terms of banking and so on. We've kept our business very focused and that has helped us also be quite successful.

"New York (CNN) -- A Nicaraguan diplomat based in New York was found dead in his apartment in the Bronx on Thursday, his throat slashed, police said. The consul of Nicaragua in New York, Cesar Mercado, 34, was found by his driver, said Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. A knife was found at the scene, Browne said. The body was found dressed just inside the front door to the apartment, and the door had been left unlocked, Browne said. Investigators were looking at the case as a murder, he said. ""It appears to be a homicide,"" he said. A resident who lives in the apartment below Mercado's told CNN he heard ""screaming and banging"" from Mercado's residence Wedneday night. Mercado lived on the sixth floor of the building. Mercado's driver may have been picking him up to take him to meet with the Nicaraguan delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly, police said.

"(CNN) -- Mohammad Idrissou put Cameroon on course for a spot in the African Nations Cup quarterfinals with a late winner in a topsy-turvy 3-2 Group D victory over Zambia. Zambia bossed the first half and went ahead inside 10 minutes through Jacob Mulenga. A terrible mistake from Zambia keeper Kennedy Mweene allowed Geremi to equalise and Samuel Eto'o gave Cameroon the lead in the 72nd minute. Christopher Katongo thought he had earned a point with an 82nd-minute penalty but Idrissou had the last word for Cameroon just four minutes later. The Indomitable Lions were looking to ignite their campaign after a shock 1-0 defeat by Gabon in their opening match, which was also a first loss for manager Paul Le Guen. But it got worse for the four-time champions in only the eighth minute, and it was experienced center-back Rigobert Song who was the architect of his own side's downfall. Felix Katongo swung in a great cross from the left and, in attempting to head behind, Song instead drew a point-blank save from his keeper. Carlos Kameni, though, could only push the ball out to Mulenga, who was left with a simple tap-in. Zambia should have doubled their lead before half-time. Rainford Kalaba's fierce free-kick was pushed back into the danger area by Kameni but Christopher Katongo could not direct his shot away from the keeper. And that was made to look very costly in the 68th minute when a calamitous mistake from Mweene saw Cameroon draw level. Geremi sent in a hopeful cross from the right wing that the Zambia keeper inexplicably helped into his own net. And the turnaround was complete four minutes later thanks to Eto'o. With Zambia appealing for handball, the striker collected Somen Tchoyi's cross and fired into the far corner. But Kameni handed Zambia a way back into the match with his own rash bit of goalkeeping, scything down Mulenga on the left edge of his penalty area to concede an 82nd-minute spot-kick, which was coolly dispatched by Christopher Katongo. There was another twist to come, though. Four minutes later, Geremi swung in a free-kick from near the halfway line and Idrissou rose above the defence to power his header into the bottom corner. Meanwhile, Gabon added a 0-0 draw with Tunisia to their opening win against Cameroon as they put themselves within touching distance of the last eight. There was little between the two sides at the Nossa Senhora do Monte and a draw was a fair result.","Mohammad Idrissou put Cameroon on course for a last eight spot in the African Nations Cup .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Clothing retailer Gap Inc. has fired an Indian company accused of using child labor to make clothes, the company's president said. Dan McDougall of the Observer said these were among the children working in an Indian factory, making clothing. ""It's deeply, deeply disturbing to all of us,"" Gap President Marka Hansen said Sunday after watching a video of children at work in a New Delhi, India, sweatshop. ""I feel violated and I feel very upset and angry with our vendor and the subcontractor who made this very, very, very unwise decision,"" Hansen said. Hansen blamed the alleged abuse on an unauthorized subcontractor for one of its Indian vendors and said the subcontractor's relationship with the Gap had been ""terminated."" She said the garments allegedly produced by the children represented a small portion of a single order placed with the vendor and that the clothes would not be sold in stores. ""We strictly prohibit the use of child labor,"" Hansen said in a statement. ""Gap has a history of addressing challenges like this head-on, and our approach to this situation will be no exception. ""In 2006, Gap Inc. ceased business with 23 factories due to code violations. We have 90 people located around the world whose job is to ensure compliance with our Code of Vendor Conduct."" The report first appeared Sunday in Britain's Observer newspaper.  Watch how children worked as virtual slaves » . The Observer spoke to children as young as 10 who said they were working 16 hours a day for no pay. The paper described the workplace as a ""derelict industrial unit"" where the hallways were flowing with excrement from a flooded toilet. One 10-year-old boy told the paper he was sold to the company by his parents. ""'I was bought from my parents' village in [the northern state of] Bihar and taken to New Delhi by train,"" The Observer quoted the boy as saying. ""The men came looking for us in July. They had loudspeakers in the back of a car and told my parents that, if they sent me to work in the city, they won't have to work in the farms. My father was paid a fee for me, and I was brought down with 40 other children."" Another boy, 12, said he worked from dawn until 1 a.m. and was so tired he felt sick, according to the paper. But if any of the children cried, he told The Observer, they would be hit with a rubber pipe or punished with an oily cloth stuffed in their mouths. The children were producing hand-stitched blouses for the Christmas market in the United States and Europe at Gap Kids stores, according to the newspaper. The blouses were to carry a price of about $40, The Observer reported. The Gap faced criticism for similar practices in 2000, when a BBC documentary uncovered young girls producing Gap products at a Cambodian factory. But since then, Hansen said, the company has developed comprehensive policies to prevent abuse and protect workers' rights. Hansen said violations of those policies are now ""extremely rare."" She said she does not support closing any factories in India in response to the allegations because it would deprive those working in proper conditions of their income. The Gap also operates Banana Republic and Old Navy stores. It has 3,100 stores around the world. E-mail to a friend .","Clothes giant fires contractor at center of child labor allegations .

"(CNN) -- Closing arguments were made Friday in the trial of Steven Hayes, the man accused of killing three members of a Connecticut family in a 2007 home invasion. Jurors are expected to begin deliberations as early as midday Monday. Hayes, 47, who has entered a plea of not guilty, is currently on trial in New Haven, Connecticut, for the murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters. The killings took place in the New Haven suburb of Cheshire in the early hours of July 23, 2007. The home of Dr. William Petit, his wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and two daughters was invaded in the middle of the night by Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky, prosecutors say. Komisarjevsky will be tried separately. Prosecutor Michael Dearington laid out an elaborate timeline of events, fully implicating both Hayes and Komisarjevsky in the gruesome killings. ""We've reached the point where very shortly this case will be in your hands,"" he told jurors. ""I doubt you could have comprehended how horrendous this evidence would be."" Earlier in the week, a trial witness -- a Connecticut prison officer -- testified that he overheard Hayes confess to another inmate that he killed Hawke-Petit. Hayes also reportedly wondered out loud whether Petit might have been in cahoots with his co-defendant, Komisarjevsky, because Petit had been able to escape. Hayes said he had tied the father in the basement of the home himself, and that he doubted he could have gotten loose without help from Komisarjevsky, the witness -- Jeremiah Krob -- testified. Outside the courthouse, Petit told reporters: ""I really can't dignify that insinuation with a response. I think the evidence put on by the prosecution speaks for itself."" Connecticut State Police Det. Anthony Buglione, who interviewed Hayes following the incident, has testified the duo beat Petit bloody and left him in the basement. The two men then went upstairs and found Hawke-Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit asleep in the master bedroom. After tying Hawke-Petit to her bed, they led the girl to her room, tied her to her bed and put a pillowcase over her head, Hayes told Buglione. They then found 17-year-old Hayley Petit in her room and did the same, he said. After finding a Bank of America account that contained $20,000 to $30,000, they decided to have the mother go to the bank in the morning and withdraw money from her account, Buglione testified. Hayes is accused of taking Hawke-Petit to the bank while Komisarjevsky allegedly stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, the two men allegedly set the home on fire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, had died of smoke inhalation. Petit was the sole survivor. He managed to escape and go to a neighbor's home. Hayes is charged with capital murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, burglary and arson. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Public defender Thomas Ullmann conceded in the defense's opening statement that Hayes killed Hawke-Petit. But otherwise, he said, much of what happened is unclear. ""No one was supposed to be hurt,"" he said. ""What is known is that Steven Hayes kills and assaults Mrs. Petit. ... We concede much, but not all."" In Friday's closing arguments, Ullmann placed much of the blame on Hayes' alleged accomplice, Komisarjevsky, whom he called the mastermind of the home invasion. ""Just because the state has brought 17 charges doesn't mean he's guilty of all of them,"" Ullmann said of Hayes, though he conceded he couldn't explain why his client didn't leave the scene once things began to escalate. But, he said, ""even in flight, Joshua Komisarjevsky was in control."" Dearington dismissed those statements in his rebuttal, saying Hayes ""was part of that whole plan to destroy this family, to take their money and to burn that house down."" In a police interview, Hayes said that his life ""sucked and that he had no money, no car, and not enough to eat."" ""Why didn't he leave?  He didn't leave because of his desire for money,"" Dearington said. He ended his closing statement by asking for guily verdicts on all 17 counts. ""Justice demands it,"" Dearington said. CNN's Michael Christian contributed to this report.","NEW: Court is adjourned until Monday .

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Egypt became the second team to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations with a 2-0 victory over Mozambique in Angola on Saturday night. The six-time champions are guaranteed to finish top of Group C after a second successive victory, and join the Ivory Coast in the last eight. Nigeria kept alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages after edging past Benin 1-0 in Saturday's earlier Group C tie, bouncing back from their opening 3-1 defeat by the Pharaohs four days ago. In a game of few clear-cut chances at the Estadio do Benguelam, Egypt took the lead two minutes after halftime when Mozambique defender Dario Khan turned a low right-wing cross from Hosni Abd Rabo into his own net despite no attacking players in his near vicinity. Mozambique's veteran playmaker Tico Tico squandered a golden opportunity to equalize, while teammate Almiro Lobo had a 58th-minute effort ruled out for offside in a very tight ruling from the match officials. Substitute Mohamed Gedo sealed Egypt's victory nine minutes from time with a superb opportunist effort, volleying home from the edge of the penalty after flicking the ball up when Emad Moteab's deflected pass fell kindly to him. To qualify for the next round, Mozambique, who drew their first match 2-2, must beat Nigeria on Wednesday and hope that Egypt do not lose to Benin. Nigeria's Super Eagles can go through with a draw after Aiyegbeni Yakubu's first-half penalty was enough to beat bottom nation Benin in Benguela. The Everton striker should have scored as early as the 15th minute when he shot wide when clean through on goal, and Benin almost took the lead six minutes before halftime when Stephane Sessegnon hit the crossbar. However, Yakubu made amends three minutes later from the spot after Romuald Boco handled Peter Odemwingie's goal-bound header. The Squirrels were again denied by the woodwork after the break when Sessegnon set up Nouihoum Kobena, while Nigeria had two second-half chances to double their lead. Goalkeeper Rachad Chitou came off his line to deny substitute striker Victor Obinna, while Chinedu Obasi Ogbuke headed wide from close range.","Egypt become second team to qualify for Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan have moved up to second place in the Italian Serie A table, just four points behind city rivals Inter, after Brazilian international Alexandre Pato scored a last-gasp winner to give them a 2-1 victory at Fiorentina. Pato fired home Ronaldinho's cross in the final minute to ensure the Rossoneri moved above Roma in the title race. Fiorentina opened the scoring in the 14th minute when former AC Milan striker Alberto Gilardino tapped-home after Milan had not dealt properly with Stevan Jovetic's pass. But substitute Klass-Jan Huntelaar levelled with 10 minutes remaining, after a superb one-two with Ronaldinho, before Pato won it for Milan at the death. Meanwhile, in the evening's other Serie A match, Udinese fought back to claim a hard-fought 2-1 home win over Cagliari. Brazilian striker Jeda headed Cagliari into a third-minute lead but two goals in as many second-half minutes from Alexis Sanchez and top scorer Antonio Di Natale marked coach Pasquale Marino's return to the club with a victory.","AC Milan move up to second in the Serie A table after beating Fiorentina 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo netted twice on his return from a ban as Real Madrid cut the gap on Spanish leaders Barcelona to two points with a 3-0 victory at bottom club Xerez on Saturday night. The world's most expensive player, who scored twice before being sent off in his previous outing against Malaga last month, also hit the crossbar as Real scored all their goals in the final half-hour. Defender Alvaro Arbeloa broke the deadlock in the 64th minute with a low shot past the Andalusians' goalkeeper Renan Brito before Ronaldo made up for a series of misses. The Portugal forward, who headed against the bar just before halftime, made it 2-0 with 20 minutes to play when he headed home from a cross by Kaka after his fellow expensive pre-season signing drove to the by-line. The Brazil playmaker also set up Ronaldo's second goal a minute later when he selflessly squared the ball to his teammate. The result put Manuel Pellegrini's Real team on 53 points from 22 matches ahead of champions Barcelona's trip to Atletico Madrid on Sunday. Xerez look set for an immediate return to the second division, having earned just 11 points so far this season. Third-placed Valencia lost ground after being held to a 1-1 draw at Sporting Gijon, needing a second-half equalizer from Juan Mata. The mid-table Asturians, who had lost their last four games, took the lead in just the fifth minute when midfielder Diego Castro smashed a drive into the top of the net following a corner. But Valencia, held 2-2 by Sporting earlier this season, hit back as Carlos Marchena and former Gijon player David Villa hit the woodwork. Mata earned a point with 14 minutes left as he gathered a long pass from Ever Banega and slotted past onrushing goalkeeper Juan Pablo. Villarreal gave new coach Juan Carlos Garrido victory in his first home match in charge, defeating seventh-placed Athletic Bilbao 2-1 in a stormy game which saw four red cards handed out and a missed penalty. Joan Capdevila and Nilmar scored in the first half for the home side, who lost 1-0 at Real Mallorca in Garrido's first outing, with Igor Gabilondo having leveled for Bilbao in the 24th minute. The match erupted in the final minutes as Andoni Iraola had his weak penalty saved by Villarreal goalkeeper Diego Lopez, then Javi Martinez and Diego Godin were sent off following an ugly episode of infringements and Athletic coach Joaquin Caparros was also red-carded in the aftermath. Bilbao ended the game with nine men after Pablo Orbaiz was ordered off after an incident with Ariel Ibagaza. In Italy, Roma returned to second place in Serie A with a 4-1 thrashing of Palermo on Saturday. Cesare Bovo's 33rd-minute own-goal put Claudio Ranieri's team ahead at halftime, then goals from Brazilian Julio Baptista and Matteo Brighi made it 3-0 with less than half an hour to play. Sixth-placed Palermo hit back with an 80th-minute penalty to Fabrizio Miccoli, but Norway defender Jon-Arne Riise sealed victory with a superb strike that left the Giallorossi six points behind leaders Inter Milan, who travel to fifth-placed Napoli on Sunday. Fourth-placed Sampdoria climbed to within six points of third-placed AC Milan, who won 3-2 at Udinese on Friday, after a 2-0 home win against Fiorentina. First-half goals from Franco Semioli and Giampaolo Pazzini, against his former club, left Fiorentina in 11th place ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last-16 tie against Bayern Munich.","Cristiano Ronaldo nets twice as Real Madrid cut gap on Spanish leaders Barcelona .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Boys may soon be able to get Gardasil, the vaccine given to girls and young women to prevent infection by four types of human papillomavirus. Gardasil, a vaccine against human papillomavirus, would be given to boys exactly as it is to girls. A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted Wednesday to recommend that the vaccine be made available to boys and young men aged 9 to 26 for protection against genital warts caused by HPV. The vaccine protects against four types of HPV, and two of those are believed to be responsible for 70 percent of cervical and anal cancers, and HPV-associated penile and throat-and-neck cancers. The other two cause 90 percent of genital warts cases, researchers say. At Wednesday's advisory committee meeting, pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., maker of Gardasil, presented data from three clinical trials that the company claims supports broadening the distribution of the vaccine to include males. The trials included more than 5,400 boys and men from six continents and 23 countries. According to Anna Giuliano, an independent scientist at Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, and the trials' principal investigator, ""The data clearly demonstrates that there was a benefit to men in receiving Gardasil. Overall, we saw a 90 percent reduction in disease -- genital warts and pre-cancerous lesions -- caused by HPV in men and an 89 percent reduction in genital warts incidence. ""Essentially, we have a really fantastic opportunity to extend the benefit of the vaccine to men,"" Giuliano said. ""This is a sexually transmitted infection; if we can reduce infection and related diseases in men, we have the potential to have a much broader public health impact by reducing the overall burden of infection and disease in the community at large."" Giuliano said there were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine. There were some minor side effects such as pain at the injection site and low-grade fever. The vaccine would be administered in boys and young men exactly as it's been given to girls and young women: three doses over a period of six months. Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said the cost will be $130 per dose. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 20 million Americans are infected with HPV. There are 6.2 million new infections each year. The CDC says that at least 50 percent of sexually active men and women get an HPV infection at some time in their life. The American Social Health Association says HPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus and puts that number at 75 percent or more. The CDC says that although HPV is very common in both sexes, most men won't develop symptoms or serious health problems, and there is no test to detect the virus in men. The only approved HPV test on the market is for women, for use in cervical-cancer screening. The advisory committee also voted that Cervarix, a new HPV vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline, appeared to be safe and effective for girls and young women 10 to 25 years of age. Cervarix has been approved in Europe. ""This is an important step in cancer prevention for the millions of girls and young women at risk for cervical cancer,"" said Barbara Howe, vice president and director of North American vaccine development for GlaxoSmithKline. ""If approved, Cervarix will provide protection against cervical cancer, a devastating disease that is responsible for thousands of deaths in U.S. women each year."" Still, the panel recommended that Glaxo do more studies that would monitor miscarriages and other problems reported by patients. In a final review, both applications will be considered by the FDA, which usually -- but not always -- follows the recommendations of its advisory committees.","Committee says shots could prevent genital warts in males 9 to 26 .

"(CNN) -- Sin Hwa Dee began operations in the 1970s as a cottage industry in the former soya sauce-producing enclave of Kim Chuan Road, in the Paya Lebar area of Singapore. Mr. and Mrs. Chng Kee started out producing soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in the 1970s. It was founded by the late Mr. Chng Kee, a former soya salesman, who ran the business with his wife, a soya production operator. Together they sold mainly soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in bulk under the Sin Hwa Dee label to the restaurant, hotel and catering industries. In 1990, the company began producing the preserved fruits and vegetables used to make the traditional Lunar New Year dish of Yu Sheng. One of Sin Hwa Dee's factories is dedicated exclusively to the production of Yu Sheng products, while another factory produces noodles for the restaurant and catering industries. Mr. Chng's daughter Jocelyn first decided to introduce the company's products to the foreign market when she attended the SIAL exhibition in Paris in 1992, noting that there was a clear interest in Asian food. Sin Hwa Dee's first premix, the Laksa Paste, was launched into the food services market under the CHNG Kee's label in 1994, followed by the Kung Bo Sauce, the Black Pepper Sauce and their famous chicken rice mix. In 1996, the company invested heavily in equipment and technology to produce sauces and premixes in bottles for the retail market under the CHNG Kee's label. In 2005, Sin Hwa Dee moved into their own building, CHNG Kee's Foodlink, located in Senoko South Road, north of Singapore, with a production team of over 75 employees producing more than 20 tons of sauces per day. Today, their clientele includes Singapore Airlines, Pizza Hut, KFC, Burger King, hotels such as the Ritz Carlton, Conrad International Centenniel, Raffles Hotel, Hilton Hotel, Marriott Hotel, and restaurants such as Lei Garden and Crystal Jade.","Sin Hwa Dee founded by former soya salesman and soya production operator .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid recovered from going a goal behind to beat rivals Atletico Madrid 3-2 on Sunday to return to the top of the Spanish Primera Liga ahead of Barcelona. But they did not have things their own way at the Bernabeu and went into the interval trailing after a flowing Atletico move saw the ball reach former Real striker Jose Antonio Reyes, who curled home a delightful shot to give the visitors the lead. But Real were a different side after the break and levelled in the 49th minute when Xabi Alonso netted from close range. And six minutes later, the home side were ahead when defender Alvaro Arbeloa -- who like Alonso moved to Madrid from Liverpool last pre-season -- superbly cut inside his marker before stroking the ball home. Madrid made it 3-1 in the 62nd minute when top scorer Gonzalo Higuain took advantage of a defensive mix-up to fire home. However, the scoring was still not over and Alonso turned from hero to villain when handling the ball in the area, with Diego Forlan slotting home the resulting penalty. Forlan missed a golden chance to level in the final minute when firing into the side-netting, but Real Madrid held on to move ahead of Barcelona, who scraped a narrow 1-0 victory at Mallorca on Saturday, on goal difference. The victory was Real's 11th in succession and continued their recent domination over their city rivals, with Atletico not winning a derby match since 1999. In other matches, Sevilla's recent poor run of form continued with a 3-0 defeat at Villarreal, for whom veteran Frenchman Robert Pires came off the substitutes' bench to score a superb third goal. Struggling Xerez thumped Valladolid 3-0 in a battle of the bottom two clubs, while Deportivo La Coruna's Champions League hopes took a knock after they slumped 3-1 at home to Getafe.","Real Madrid recover from going a goal behind to defeat rivals Atletico 3-2 .

"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) -- Scrupulously silent in public but colorfully candid in person, the former head of Canada's spy agency didn't hold back in a meeting with a senior U.S. State Department official in July 2008. It was a meeting that he had assumed would stay private and the content classified. According to the cable marked ""secret,"" but now part of the WikiLeaks document dump, Jim Judd admits his spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, or CSIS, was ""increasingly distracted from its mission by legal challenges that could endanger foreign intelligence-sharing with Canadian agencies."" According to the cable, he complains about Canadians having an ""Alice in Wonderland' world view and goes on to describe Canadian courts ""whose judges have tied CSIS 'in knots,' making it ever more difficult to detect and prevent terror attacks in Canada and abroad."" ""The situation, he commented, left government security agencies on the defensive and losing public support for their effort to protect Canada and its allies,"" the U.S. cable says. A Canadian court had earlier that year agreed to release a videotaped interrogation of Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr, who recently pleaded guilty to murder in a special military hearing at Guantanamo. Of the video release, the cable states that Judd told the State Department that ""a videotaped recording of a tearful Omar Khadr at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay would trigger ""knee-jerk anti-Americanism"" and ""paroxysms of moral outrage, a Canadian specialty."" Judd is now retired. The formerly secret WikiLeaks cable has sent Canada into damage control. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said at a press conference Monday that ""these leaked documents that pertain to Canada are in my view ... not something that will harm our relations. I do find it deplorable, though, that documents are leaked in this fashion"" U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton contacted Cannon over the weekend to brief him on the Canadian disclosures in the WikiLeaks documents. WikiLeaks says it has more than 2,000 documents that pertain to Canada, most of which have not yet been released. Intriguingly, this cable from July 2008 refers to Canada's spy agency agreeing to open a channel to Iran's Intelligence service, but added that it was something Judd has not yet ""figured out."" Also in the cable is a reference to Judd saying his spy agency ""responded to recent, non-specific intelligence on possible terror operations by 'vigorously harassing' known Hezbollah members in Canada.""","Jim Judd: Canadians have an ""Alice in Wonderland' world view .

"London, England (CNN) -- Now that a planned cabin crew strike against British Airways is under way for the March 27-30 period, the airline has confirmed ""a number of cancellations for flights,"" according to its Web site. So what should you do if you're holding a BA ticket and planning to fly? Here is some advice. Can I re-book if I am traveling during the planned strike period? BA says that fliers have the choice of re-booking, whether their flight is cancelled or not. It says travelers can ""rebook to travel on another BA flight on the same route up to 355 days in the future at no extra charge, subject to availability."" The airline says that passengers can also book an alternative BA flight from another destination at no extra charge although it will not cover expenses to the alternative airport. Can I cancel my journey? You can cancel you flight and if you decide to BA says it will refund your fare, whether or not the flight is cancelled because of strike action. How will I know if my flight is cancelled? BA is keeping its flight schedule updated on its Web site: BritishAirways.com. Passengers are advised to use their reference number to check if their flight has been cancelled. BA says that it is also informing customers via text and email. How many flights will be cancelled? This depends on the number of crew who ultimately strike and how well BA's contingency plans work, but a BA spokesman told CNN that it expects to carry about 75 percent of booked passengers on its own aircraft during March 27-30. What if I cancel my original booking but then want to rebook on the same flight? You can try and rebook on the same flight, although BA said it will treat such bookings as new, and they will be subject to availability. Will flights be disrupted outside the scheduled flight dates? BA has confirmed that a number of flights will be disrupted between March 27-30. BA advises travelers to keep up-to-date with events on its Web site -- BritishAirways.com. I am booked to fly between March 27-30, what can I do? If your flight has already been cancelled, or is cancelled as a result of strike action, you can rebook onto another BA flight on the same route within 355 days or rebook onto another BA flight from the nearest alternative airport. You also have the option of canceling your booking and obtaining a refund. If your flight is operating between March 27-30 (excluding London City and London Gatwick longhaul) you can rebook onto another BA flight on the same route up to 355 days in the future. BA says no refunds are allowed unless the fare rules allow. Can I switch airlines? If you are thinking of booking flights with another airline, keep in mind that BA is not be obliged to refund your money, if the strike is called off and it can operate the flight as planned, warns the Air Transport Users' Council, Britain's consumer watchdog for the aviation industry. Will British Airways help me cover the cost of meals and accommodation if I am stranded abroad? BA will provide hotel accommodation to passengers stranded abroad because of the strikes. A BA spokesman was unsure if other expenses, such as food and drink, occurred during their enforced stay would be covered, although he suggested passengers could put in claims for ""ancillary costs"" with either BA or their insurance company. How can my insurance help? Cover provided by insurance policies vary, and passengers should check with their insurance providers, according to Rochelle Turner, a researcher at Which?, an independent consumer magazine. Those who booked their flight using a credit card may be entitled to recover at least some of the costs, she said.","British Airlines confirms ""a number of cancellations"" for March 27-30 flights .

"(CNN) -- David Baker was 10 years old when the World Cup came to the United States in 1994, and he still has the blue soccer jersey he bought back then. ""That's when I 'caught soccer' and became a fan. That's when I said, 'Soccer is a great sport,'"" he said. So he was devastated, he said, when the sport's governing body awarded the 2022 tournament to Qatar rather than the United States on Thursday. Not only would winning the bid have boosted the U.S. economy, he argued, it would have been great for the development of soccer in arguably the largest sports market in the world. ""It would have been fantastic for the growth of soccer in our country"" at a time ""when it's primed to take the next step forward -- or the next step back,"" the North Carolina pastor said. Soccer opened up a whole new world for him, he said. ""As a 10-year-old kid, I said these countries [that play soccer] are awesome,"" he remembered. ""For me, that was so neat -- to think that when you kick a soccer ball, you can do that with somebody from any country, any religion, any language."" He doesn't expect the United States to have another chance to host the global tournament anytime soon. ""That's why today was so devastating,"" he said. The president of U.S. Soccer, Sunil Gulati, echoed Baker's thoughts. ""There's no way around it: I am disappointed,"" he said minutes after the U.S. bid was defeated. ""Millions of U.S. soccer fans worked hard to bring the World Cup to our country,"" he said. Some of those fans were very big names indeed. Former President Bill Clinton and actor Morgan Freeman made the case for the United States in Zurich, Switzerland, where FIFA executives voted Thursday. ""Maybe America's best claim to this World Cup is that we have the only nation you can put the World Cup that can guarantee that no matter who makes the finals, we can fill a stadium with home-nation rooters,"" Clinton told FIFA executives before the voting. When Ghana knocked the United States out of the World Cup this summer, Clinton said Ghanian-Americans celebrated in Miami and Philadelphia, wrapped in the African nation's flag. American soccer stars Landon Donovan and Mia Hamm, and Attorney General Eric Holder also came out to support the bid alongside Gulati. But it was not to be. Qatar, which promised a carbon-neutral World Cup, complete with air-conditioned stadiums, will become the first Middle Eastern nation to host the tournament, the largest sporting event in the world each time it is held. ""We really wanted this for the country. It would have been great for the sport,"" New York Red Bulls season ticket holder Sebastian Ostolaza told CNN's Richard Roth minutes after the announcement. ""It would have been a lot of fun for everyone and we're extremely disappointed to have heard what happened,"" he said at the team's stadium, where he heard the announcement with friends. But he was gracious to Qatar in defeat. ""I think it's great because soccer is a worldwide sport, and to bring the game back to Asia is going bring fans from over there back into it,"" he said. The United States last hosted it in 1994, when Clinton was president. Team USA acquitted itself well at the World Cup this year, finishing at the top of its group in South Africa before its loss to Ghana. CNN's Kristi Keck Ramsay contributed to this report.","We really wanted it for this country, fans tell CNN .

"(CNN)  -- Football icon David Beckham has told CNN that he believes the momentum is behind England as they battle to win the right to stage the 2018 World Cup when the decision is made in Zurich on Thursday. Beckham, who has played in three World Cups, joined by forces with British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Willliam in a last-minute lobbying offensive of FIFA executive members. England's bid was believed to have been adversely affected by allegations of corruption made against FIFA officials by British media organizations, but the former Manchester United star believes that has been neutralized. ""I think when we arrived yesterday (Tuesday) obviously people were talking about the negative side about what had been said and how the members would be; but I think that's totally turned now,"" he told CNN. ""Us being here, us sitting down with the delegates, us explaining why we want this World Cup in our country, I think has made us and our bid gain momentum that we need."" Blog: Which countries will win the right to host World Cups ? Beckham was a driving force behind London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympics and hopes to work his magic again in his chosen sport. ""I think everybody knows how passionate I am about our country and about playing for my country, but to be able to bring the World Cup to England, it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it."" Beckham, who is now playing for Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS, believes England deserve to host their first World Cup since 1966 on the strength of their technical bid. ""Facilities speak for themselves -- you know the training grounds that we have, the medical facilities that we have the hotels around England that we have. ""But to have the stadiums that we have around our country they don't get much better than that throughout the world,"" he added. Whether Beckham can achieve his dream of taking his three sons to watch World Cup matches in England in 2018 will rest on the decision of 22 members of the FIFA executive committee. They must decide between early frontrunners England, Russia, Spain and Portugal and Belgium and the Netherlands.","David Beckham gives upbeat assessment of England's 2018 World Cup chances .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush loomed large throughout the 2010 campaign even though he has been out of office for nearly two years. The upcoming publication of Bush's memoirs, ""Decision Points,"" offers us an opportunity to consider the relationship between the former commander-in-chief and the Tea Party activists who played such a major role in energizing the GOP this summer and fall. While the Tea Party attacks on President Obama and his policies were front and center, their anger was also directed toward the nature of Republican politics in the age of Bush. The Tea Party movement has opened up a civil war within the Republican Party. Recently these tensions exploded when Bush's top political adviser, Karl Rove, said the Tea Party was not very ""sophisticated."" Former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee called Rove an ""elitist"" and said that ""unfortunately, there is an elitism within the Republican establishment. And it's one of the reasons the Republicans have not been able to solidify not only the Tea Party movement but solidify conservatives across America."" The Tea Party movement was born out of a rebellion against one of President Bush's signature policies: TARP, the bailout for Wall Street investment banks. Tea Party activists have been extremely critical of the willingness of Republicans to turn to the federal government to solve some domestic problems. Bush's support for the financial bailout was part of a longer tradition of Big Government Conservatism that has been around since the 1960s. In addition to national security spending, Republicans in power have always lived with an expansive view of government. Ronald Reagan came to accept the permanence of programs like Social Security and Medicare when he discovered they were more popular than the right wing of his party expected. George H.W. Bush pushed through Congress one of the biggest civil rights initiatives since 1965, the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under George W. Bush, Republicans undertook a series of major government initiatives, including No Child Left Behind and the Medicare prescription drug program. For Bush the question was not government versus no government, but rather, what priorities were most important. When the financial markets collapsed in fall 2008, it was not surprising that he opted to use the federal government to help. Tea Party activists have called for a return to a kind of pristine, libertarian conservatism that they feel once existed. They have attacked all forms of federal intervention and called for their party to embrace a purer form of opposition to big government. A second concern for Tea Party activists has been the political process in Washington. They have frequently employed the rhetoric of good government reformers in explaining what's wrong with the system. The Tea Party has complained that lobbyists on K Street wield too much influence on Capitol Hill. They warn that interest groups will be the biggest beneficiaries of new policies. And they have expressed their frustration about how congressional practices such as earmarks have been used to unfairly allocate public funds. These attacks touch directly on how Republican politics worked throughout Bush's presidency. By 2001, Republicans had learned to work within the political system to advance their objectives and to secure their power. Indeed, between 2005 and 2006, Republicans came under fire for having practiced politics as usual. Investigations revealed that there were tight connections between Republicans and lobbyists such as Jack Abramoff that had been nurtured by the K Street Project. The K Street project was an operation set up after the 1994 elections whereby Republican House and Senate leaders met regularly with lobbyists to talk about legislative strategy and to find possible employment for GOP staffers. Congressional Republicans also relied on earmarks as much as their Democratic colleagues. After all, most voters like their legislators to bring home a little pork. Finally, many Tea Party activists have pushed back against the multicultural vision that President Bush promoted for his party. Since his time in Texas, Bush had worked hard to bring new voters into the Republican coalition, particularly Hispanic-Americans. He stood firm for liberalized immigration policies in 2005, even as hard-line conservatives stifled his proposal to overhaul the system. After 9/11, Bush had been careful to make very clear that he was conducting a war against terrorist networks rather than a war against Islam (to be sure, many of his policies, like the use of torture and the war in Iraq, undercut those efforts). The backlash against Bush's vision of conservatism has been strong. Tea Party activists have focused on issues like immigration restriction and opposition to gay rights. Some leaders were at the forefront of turning the debate over a mosque in New York into a debate over the role of Islam in American life. Bush has also felt that the proper role for him was to stay out of the political arena, which has created a bigger opportunity for these voices. Now that the election campaign is just about over, the party's leaders will have to reconcile the tensions between where the party had been under George W. Bush and where Tea Party leaders would like to see it heading. The impact of the movement on the GOP will create intense pressure on elected officials to listen to what the activists have been demanding if they want their support in 2012. The question will be whether Tea Party activists will decide that the GOP is just no longer a home for them and if other Republicans, like former President Bush, will be left wondering what has become of their party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: George W. Bush memoirs will be published soon .
He says it's a reminder that Tea Party arose out of dissatisfaction with Bush policies .

"(CNN) -- Several U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks show growing anxiety among Chinese officials about citizens getting uncensored online content through Google -- with one Politburo member reportedly angry to find negative comments about himself online. In May 2009, Google approached the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, according to one leaked cable, ""to discuss recent pressure by the Chinese government to censor the company's Chinese website."" Chinese officials were unhappy that the sanitized google.cn, which was established by Google in 2006, contained a link to the uncensored google.com, and appeared especially sensitive about the issue because of the imminent 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests. The redacted cable, dated May 18 and written by Economic Minister Counselor Robert Luke, says U.S. diplomats had been told that ""the root of the problem was China's Politburo Standing Committee member (name redacted)."" Later it says: ""(name redacted) allegedly entered his own name and found results critical of him....He also noticed the link from google.cn's homepage to google.com, which (redacted) reportedly believes is an 'illegal site.'"" In another apparent reference to the Politburo member, the cable says he ""believes Google is a 'tool' of the USG being used to 'foment peaceful revolution in China.'"" The New York Times, which had advance access to the cables obtained by WikiLeaks, says that official is Li Changchun, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Standing Politburo Committee -- its highest body -- and runs the Politburo's propaganda apparatus. He subsequently asked three ministries to demand that Google end its ""illegal activities,"" according to the cable. At the same time the Chinese government was taking commercial steps against Google, instructing state-owned telecom firms to stop doing business with the company -- ""a hard blow because mobile Internet is Google's 'big bet in China,'"" the cable added. Google refused to remove the link on its Chinese site, and its lawyers ""found no legal basis for China's demands."" The dilemma for the company was that it risked ""losing the Chinese market in retaliation for maintaining its integrity and brand,"" the cable said. Google had entered the Chinese market on three principles: it would never disclose to the Chinese government any personal information about its users or their search habits; it would always include a disclosure notice to identify when search results had been removed due to censorship; and it would always provide an uncensored, U.S.-hosted site, subject to U.S. law. Two months later -- in July 2009 -- Google's servers were ""virally infected"" for 24 hours, amid claims that Google was failing to filter out pornographic sites. The embassy's sources, says a cable from that month, believe ""the real reason for the government's wrath is the company's refusal to remove a link to google.com from the google.cn website."" The cable continued, apparently quoting a Google official,: ""(redacted) said the negative press coverage and service outages have caused the company to lose market share.....(redacted) said that, faced with the continual difficulties of doing business in China, the company may even consider pulling out of the market."" The attacks on Google servers continued, with the company reporting in January of this year that it had been the victim of a sophisticated cyber attack originating from China. It said it also discovered that the ""Gmail accounts of dozens of human rights activists connected with China were being routinely accessed by third parties."" So it began redirecting users visiting google.cn to the uncensored content of google.com.hk. A US. cable written from Beijing after that cyber attack said: ""A well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level."" The cable noted: ""An appeal to nationalism seems to be the Chinese government's chosen option to counter Google's demand to provide unfiltered web content."" An unnamed Chinese contact ""stated that PRC operations against Google were 'one hundred percent' political in nature and had nothing to do with removing Google, with its minority market share, as a competitor to Chinese search engines."" The cable also suggested the move might backfire on the Chinese authorities, apparently citing a Chinese contact. ""All of a sudden, (redacted) continued, Baidu (a state-owned internet search engine) looked like a boring state-owned enterprise while Google 'seems very attractive, like the forbidden fruit.'"" However, the cables suggest that the Chinese leadership -- and specifically the State Council Information Office -- believed that the internet in China could be controlled. ""Through the Google incident and other increased controls and surveillance, like real-name registration, they reached a conclusion: The Web is fundamentally controllable,"" according to one source quoted in a cable. Long before the crisis in 2009, Google was running into hostility from Chinese officials. In November 2007, China asked the U.S. government to reduce the resolution of Google Earth images of military, nuclear and other sensitive sites in China. Chinese officials warned of ""possible 'grave consequences' if terrorists exploit the information to harm China."" A diplomat at the embassy said he would report the Chinese request to Washington, but noted that Google is a private company. Other cables suggest close ties between Chinese state enterprises and private hackers in China. According to a cable from the U.S. secretary of state's office written in June 2009, the China Information Technology Security Center ""has recruited Chinese hackers in support of nationally-funded 'network attack scientific research projects.'"" One such enterprise -- TOPSEC -- employed ""a known Chinese hacker, Lin Yong (a.k.a. Lion and owner of the Honker Union of China), as senior security service engineer to manage security service and training."" Another was ""known to affiliate with XFocus, one of the few Chinese hacker groups known to develop exploits to new vulnerabilities in a short period of time."" The cable concludes: ""While links between top Chinese companies and the PRC are not uncommon, it illustrates the PRC's use of its 'private sector' in support of governmental information warfare objectives, especially in its ability to gather, process, and exploit information.""","WikiLeaks cables show Chinese officials were worried about Google .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian residents of Israel threw stones and police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them Wednesday as right-wing Israeli activists marched in the Arab town of Umm al-Fahm. Several hundred police officers were deployed in northern Israel ahead of the march, according to police. The activists, led by Baruch Marzel and Itamar Ben Gvir, are marching to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the murder of the radical Rabbi Meir Kahane and to call for the outlaw of the Islamic Movement in Israel. Ben Gvir shouted into a megaphone, ""We demand to outlaw the Islamic Movement. Only in Israel can Raed Salah [leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement] come and say that Israel needs to be erased ... and nothing is done to stop it. We demand that those who are responsible outlaw the Islamic Movement. Our message is to treat the Islamic Movement with a tough hand."" Police had denied requests for the right-wing activists to hold the protest, citing security concerns. But an Israeli court overruled, saying the march could take place. ""This march is a provocative march,"" Hasan Sanallah of the Islamic Movement told CNN. ""This is a march for inciting violence. They are coming here to show that the Arab minorities in Israel are barbaric, and we want to prove them the other way."" Sanallah described the activists as ""trying to incite violence in Arab towns."" Kahane was an Israeli-American rabbi who founded the Jewish Defense League. He started a political party called Kach, which advocated the imposition of Jewish law in Israel and the expulsion of Palestinians from Israel. The Israeli government banned Kach in 1988 for inciting racism. Kahane was murdered in 1990 in New York by El Sayyid Nosair, an Egyptian-American terrorist convicted of involvement in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. A similar right-wing march took place in Umm al-Fahm in March 2009 and led to clashes between Palestinian Arab residents of the town and Israeli security personnel. About 100 far-rightists marched in the predominantly Muslim town, and Arab demonstrations that erupted after the march left dozens of people injured and at least 10 people detained, police said at the time. Marchers disseminated a particularly hot-button message in Umm al-Fahm that had been setting people off: They demanded that Israeli Arabs be loyal to the Jewish state, a stance considered insulting by many Israeli Arabs. About 20 percent of Israel's population is comprised of Arabs. CNN's Shira Medding, Kareem Khadder and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","Stone throwing, tear gas and rubber bullets are seen during the demonstration .

"(CNN) -- Togo's national soccer team have been officially disqualified from the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The region's governing football body for football has confirmed that the team, known as the ""Hawks"", will take no further part in the tournament being hosted by Angola after failing to appear for their first group game against Ghana on Monday, according to CNN affiliate ITN. The squad flew back home to Togo after three of their traveling party were killed and two players seriously injured by a machine-gun attack which occurred as their bus crossed the border into the northern, oil-rich state of Cabinda on Friday. Group B has now been reduced to three teams: Ghana, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso -- the latter two drew 0-0 on Monday. Angolan authorities have arrested two people involved in the attack, state media reported, while goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale remains in a stable condition in a South African hospital but needs a ventilator as he recovers from being shot. The CAF has also ordered a moment of silence to be observed in memory of the slain Togolese before each match in the first round of the tournament, it announced Monday. There had been conflicting reports about whether Togo would take part after several players were quoted saying that they wanted to stay in Angola and play, before being ordered to leave the country by their government. Later reports then quoted Togo sports minister Christophe Tchao as saying he had requested that the CAF keep his country's place in the tournament open in case they returned to Angola. But the UK Press Association reported that the CAF had received no such request. ""Togo have not taken official steps to come back and play the African Nations Cup,"" it quoted an unnamed CAF official as saying before Monday night's abandoned match. ""The referee has received the order to blow the starting whistle and if the Togolese players are not there, they will have lost the match and will be disqualified."" Meanwhile, Mali and Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita believes the tournament should have been called off in the wake of the attack, PA reported. ""If only the competition had been cancelled,"" he said. ""You can't leave home to die. ""Personally, I have to say that I am scared because I don't know this country. After seeing what happened to Togo, I am scared. You don't know when a problem could happen again. My only worry is returning home. ""Football has become something very important throughout the world, and the image which has been left following the attack is something very bad for African football. We came here to play, not to die."" The head of South Africa's World Cup organising body, Danny Jordaan, has told CNN that his country will not suffer the same security lapses that have occurred in Angola. ""We have shown our ability to safeguard events since 1994,"" Jordaan said. ""In 140 events we have not had a single incident. ""You can draw up a list of countries with that track record and you'll find very few in the world.""","Togo's national soccer team officially disqualified from the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations .

"(Mental Floss) -- It's tough being brilliant. It's even tougher when you hate your own masterpieces. 1. Tony Kaye The forgotten history of ""American History X"" Before director Tony Kaye embarked on his first feature film, 1997's ""American History X,"" he'd already been declared a genius of the advertising world. Kaye was famous for taking months to craft the perfect 30-second commercial, and his meticulousness only bolstered his reputation. Top brands including Guinness and Volvo sought out his services, because he was just that good. But Kaye was more than a perfectionist; he was an egoist and an eccentric. During a period of unemployment in the mid-1980s, Kaye ran a full-page ad in London's ""Evening Standard"" proclaiming, ""Tony Kaye is the Greatest English Director Since Hitchcock."" He also attempted to start his own art movement, which included an ""exhibition"" of a homeless man in London's Tate Gallery. So, perhaps it should come as no surprise that ""American History X"" turned out the way it did. Studio execs at New Line Cinema were impressed by the concept behind Kaye's pitch -- to create a film about a former skinhead who tries to keep his younger brother from following in his footsteps. But after shooting 200 hours of footage and delivering a rough cut to the producers, Kaye still wasn't satisfied with the movie. He wanted to tweak the storytelling, and the studio agreed to give him another eight weeks to complete the project. During those two months, Kaye did virtually no editing. Instead, he went to a Caribbean island to consult with poet Derek Walcott, who plied the director with a few vague ideas about how to improve the film. Upon returning, Kaye decided to add in footage of actual neo-Nazis, but he had no idea how long that would take. Exasperated, the studio execs eventually pried the movie out of Kaye's hands, and New Line released an earlier cut of the film. At that point, Tony Kaye lost it. He sued the studio for $200 million and demanded that Humpty Dumpty be credited as the director. He also spent $100,000 on print ads that trashed the movie. In interviews, he badmouthed the script and claimed that actor Edward Norton had been wrong for the lead role. Yet in spite of Kaye's insistence that the movie was horrible, ""American History X"" went on to garner terrific reviews -- not to mention a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Edward Norton. Mental Floss: Ten hit songs you thought were about women (but aren't) 2. W.H. Auden The poem that wouldn't die . W.H. Auden's best-known poem, ""September 1, 1939,"" was written the day that Germany invaded Poland, launching World War II. From the moment it was published in The New Republic that year, the work was instantly popular -- but Auden wanted to revise it. He thought parts of the poem rang false. He especially hated its most famous line: ""We must love one another or die."" Auden later reflected, ""That's a damned lie! We must die anyway."" So in the next version of his poem, Auden altered the text to read, ""We must love one another and die."" Even after making the change, Auden continued to despise the line. In subsequent versions, he resorted to cutting the entire stanza, and eventually decided he wanted to do away with the piece altogether: ""The whole poem, I realized, was infected with an incurable dishonesty -- and must be scrapped."" To Auden's dismay, people kept reading and quoting ""September 1, 1939."" The poet was particularly irritated when President Lyndon Johnson used the poem in his 1964 ""Daisy"" TV spot attacking opponent Barry Goldwater. The ad featured a little girl plucking petals off a flower, as the image of a nuclear explosion emerges behind her. As the mushroom cloud balloons to fill the screen, President Johnson says in a voiceover, ""We must either love each other, or we must die."" After seeing the ad, Auden said, ""I pray that I never be memorable like that again."" 3. Frederic Remington The way the west was lost . Decades before the movies of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, Frederic Remington's illustrations created the mythic American West. During the 1880s and 1890s, readers devoured his depictions of grizzled cowboys and sinewy horses, reproduced by the hundreds in magazines and books. He illustrated ""Teddy Roosevelt's Ranch Life and the Hunting-Trail"" in 1887 and was a correspondent during the Spanish-American War in 1898. But the artist wasn't much of a cowboy himself. Born in New York, Remington went to art school at Yale, where he spent more time playing football than studying his craft. At age 19, he headed out West for a few years, visiting Montana and New Mexico and even making a go of sheep ranching in Kansas. However, he found the work difficult and tedious and soon returned home to New York, where he lived for most of his life. While his experiences on the frontier inspired his most famous works, Remington grew tired of painting crowd-pleasing cowboy scenes year after year. He wanted his work to become more abstract and expressive. He even began branching out into sculpture. But the public wasn't interested in his experiments in modernism; his cowboy paintings were paying the bills. On January 25, 1908, Remington became so frustrated while painting a particularly tricky scene that he decided to burn the canvas. He built a bonfire on his front lawn and torched the unfinished painting; then he proceeded to toss his other work into the flames. He ended up destroying more than 100 paintings that night, with millions of dollars in art going up in smoke. ""They will never confront me in the future,"" he wrote. Indeed they didn't. Remington's sculptures became his most lasting work. Today, one of his bronzes, ""Bronco Buster,"" sits next to President Obama in the Oval Office. Mental Floss: Ten of the best fictional parents . 4. R. Crumb Drowning his own kitten . Indie cartoonist Robert Crumb became famous in the 1960s for his cast of raunchy characters, including Mr. Natural and the ""Keep on Truckin'"" guys. But his best-known creation was the smooth-talking, sex-crazed Fritz the Cat. Ballantine Books published a paperback collection of Fritz' tales in 1969, and a copy ended up with animator Ralph Bakshi. An up-and-coming genius in his own right, Bakshi was looking to make an animated movie for adults, and Fritz seemed like perfect source material. When Bakshi approached Crumb with a movie deal, the cartoonist waffled. He'd lost interest in Fritz years ago, but he also didn't want to turn down Bakshi. To avoid making a choice, Crumb left the decision up to his wife, who thought both the film and the immediate paycheck were good ideas. It turned out that Crumb had good reason to be hesitant. Bakshi didn't feel obligated to stay true to the original work, and he used Fritz as a vehicle to voice his own views -- depicting hippies as would-be fascists, embracing toilet humor, and including unexplained violence. Bakshi presented the material as an attack on the 1960s -- a decade that had been very good to Crumb. When Crumb previewed the finished film, he was appalled. The politics were bad enough, but in Crumb's words, the toilet humor suggested a ""real repressed"" attitude toward sex. It was too late to change anything, though, and ""Fritz the Cat"" was released in theaters. The first animated film with an X rating, Fritz became a hot topic and earned massive amounts of publicity. Bakshi, for his part, was hailed as a breath of fresh air in the field of animation. But Crumb got his revenge. A few months after the movie's release, he drew a comic titled ""The Death of Fritz the Cat,"" in which he killed the character with an ice pick to the head. The cat was finished, and Crumb refused all future adaptations of his work. 5. Ludwig van Beethoven Turning a deaf ear . In addition to being a brilliant composer, Ludwig van Beethoven was a shrewd businessman. He dedicated most of his work to wealthy benefactors, with the hope that they'd keep giving him money. But in the early 1800s, Beethoven decided to shift his strategy and honor the man he admired the most -- Napoleon Bonaparte. Beethoven believed in the egalitarian ideals of the French Revolution, and he saw Napoleon as a charismatic leader who was making a real effort to reform government. In 1803, the star-struck composer named his third symphony the ""Bonaparte"" symphony. Of course, when Napoleon proclaimed himself emperor of France in May 1804, Beethoven was horrified. The composer ripped apart the title page to his symphony, yelling, ""Now, too, he will tread underfoot all the rights of man, and indulge only his ambition. He will exalt himself above all others, and become a tyrant!"" After cooling off a little, the composer decided that the symphony was still good, but he changed the title. He renamed it the ""Eroica"" symphony, dedicating it to a generic ""heroic man."" The passionate work is still one of Beethoven's most-performed pieces. To this day, the library of Vienna's Musikverein concert hall keeps an original copy of the composition on display -- complete with Napoleon's name violently scratched out.

"(Mashable)  -- Google Editions, the Internet giant's book store business promised for last summer, is set to launch before the end of 2010, the Wall Street Journal reports. Google Editions will have a significantly different sales model from most competitors, such as Amazon's Kindle store or Apple's iBookStore. Instead of purchasing books through a single online store, Google will let users buy them either from Google or from independent bookstores and then tie them to a Google account, which will enable them to read the books anywhere and on any device they please. Originally, Google Editions was supposed to launch even earlier in 2010, but that didn't happen; in May, Google's Manager for Strategic Partner Development Chris Palma said the launch is slated for June or July 2010. Now, Google product management director Scott Dougall claims everything is set for a launch by the end of 2010 in the U.S. and in the first quarter of 2011 internationally. ""Because of the complexity of this project, we didn't want to come out with something that wasn't thorough,"" said Dougall. Google's partners for the launch, as well as the revenue share Google will offer to publishers and independent bookstores are unknown at this point. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has refuted allegations that he paid prostitutes to attend parties he hosted at his various homes. Last month it was announced Silvio Berlusconi and his wife Veronica Lario are to divorce. In an interview with Italian magazine ""Chi,"" the 72-year old denied he had ever paid for sex. ''I've never paid a woman. I never understood where the satisfaction is when you're missing the pleasure of conquest,'' Berlusconi told Chi. According to Italian press agency ANSA, Berlusconi accused Patrizia D'Addario -- the woman who alleges she was paid to spend the night with the premier in November -- of being involved in a plan to make up false accusations against him. D'Addario last week told an Italian newspaper that a local businessman now being probed by magistrates paid her €1,000 ($1,408) to attend a dinner at Berlusconi's Rome residence along with other young women -- what she described as a ""harem"" -- and she was back a few weeks later to spend the night with the premier, Reuters.com reported. But Berlusconi told Chi: ''Behind the (investigators') probe in (the southern city of) Bari there's someone who gave Ms D'Addario very detailed and very well paid orders.'"" Do you think the allegations against Berlusconi affect his ability to govern? When asked if he suspected D'Addario was ""setting a trap"" for him, he replied: 'If I did I'd leap a thousand miles away.'' Berlusconi's private life has been in the spotlight since his wife, filed for divorce in May following reports that her husband went to the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old girl. The prime minister denied having an inappropriate relationship with the girl. Berlusconi and Veronica Lario have been married for 19 years. Earlier this month, Spanish newspaper El Pais published what it said were five exclusive photographs of racy parties at Berlusconi's villa on the island of Sardinia. The photos, including one which showed scantily clad women, were blocked from use in Italy by a judicial order after Berlusconi complained of an invasion of privacy. The three-time prime minister's public life has been no less controversial. While campaigning for local elections in Sardinia in January, Berlusconi was asked by reporters to comment about an interior ministry proposal to deploy troops on city streets after a series of sexual assaults on women. ""We can't think of deploying a large force,"" Berlusconi said. ""We would have to send as many soldiers as there are beautiful girls. And I don't think we would manage.""  Watch more on the scandal surrounding Berlusconi » . After being accused of ignoring the seriousness of sexual violence, he said he meant his remarks as a ""compliment"" and noted that ""women have to be defended."" In another controversial comment, during the run-up to the 2008 Italian general election, Berlusconi claimed right-wing female politicians were better looking than their left-wing counterparts. In an interview with CNN recently, the former media tycoon said he now felt his job was a burden. ""I'm still doing everything that I'm doing with a great sense of sacrifice. I have to tell you I don't like it. Absolutely. I would rather be doing what I was doing before or doing something else now,"" he said. ""I'm here because unfortunately right now Berlusconi is considered the only leader capable of holding the center-right together. Despite the swirl of scandal Berlusconi remains popular, consistency scoring approval ratings of more than 60 percent.

"(CNN) -- The nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization wants to sound the alarm on school resegregation, and is hoping a national educational summit will bring attention to what its members consider a huge problem, according to a news release from the NAACP. The organization will meet for three days later this week in North Carolina, where the Department of Justice is planning to investigate policies relating to resegregation, the statement says. Leaders from the group will be joined by grass-roots organizers from across the country from Thursday through Saturday for the first national NAACP summit on education in three years, the statement says. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss comprehensive education reform with an urgent focus on resegregation in the nation's school districts, the NAACP said. According to the organization, over two-fifths of black students attend ""extremely segregated schools,"" up from less than one-third in 1988, which the NAACP considers the height of desegregation. The summit was named in honor of Daisy Bates, former president of the Arkansas State Conference of the NAACP and advisor to the Little Rock Nine, the statement said. Those nine students desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous is to deliver the keynote address on the first day of the summit, which will be held in Raleigh, North Carolina.","The three-day Daisy Bates educational summit will examine resegregation in nation's schools .

"(CNN) -- One of the key aspects to gaining control of the fast-moving cholera outbreak in Haiti is the simplest of human necessities, actor and activist Sean Penn told CNN's ""AC360°."" People must stop using contaminated water, he said, noting that they will only do that if clean water is provided. ""So, whether that's through filtration systems or trucked in water, this is going to be the essential element -- water, water, water,"" Penn said in an interview that aired Monday. Penn, a co-founder of Haitian relief organization J/P HRO, visited Haiti over the weekend -- days after news broke about the cholera outbreak in the earthquake-ravaged country. ""It's bad,"" Penn said of the conditions in the Caribbean nation, devastated by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on January 12 which killed nearly a quarter million people, left more than 1.6 million people homeless and destroyed homes, commercial buildings and basic infrastructure. And the cholera outbreak has made a bad situation worse, he said. ""What we know about it at this point is that it is affecting a very regional area, in particular the epicenter of it, but it's spreading very fast,"" he said. Penn also told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was concerned about whether there were enough medical supplies and personnel available in Haiti to treat those infected by the fast-moving outbreak. Reaching patients with medication and treatment within a specific time frame is of the utmost importance, he said, and medical supplies could be caught up in bureaucratic processing at warehouses. ""Now we have this terrible epidemic, and if it hits camps... we're going to have a devastation that nobody wants to see,"" he said. The actor's relief organization runs one of the many camps sheltering Haitians until more permanent housing is available, and Penn said his camp is preparing to treat patients with cholera if that becomes necessary. ""We're stockpiling [supplies] now, but it's slow, and our access has been disappointing to those supplies in country. We have those things that we're initiating ourselves, and with support, we'll be able to do a lot more,"" he said. With the help of Oxfam, J/P HRO's camp has chlorinated water, Penn said. ""While it's not pleasant to drink, it's safe to drink and to wash with and to wash fruits and vegetables with. There are many, many camps that don't have those services,"" he said. iReport: Experiencing cholera in Haiti . In the interview, Penn also weighed in on the slow pace of the recovery effort in Haiti, one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere. To get people out of camps in Port-au-Prince, he said, 400,000 temporary shelters must be built, he said. So far, 17,000 have been constructed, according to U.S. Agency for International Development. ""The camps are a devastation. We have probably the best-organized camp, and it's a terrible place to live. It doesn't provide dignity, pride, health, security on any human reasonable level. And yet, this is where they're going to be for some time,"" he said. ""I don't want to make predictions on how long it's going to be. Our job is to work every day to give them other options. But it's going to be a long time."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET. For the latest from AC360° click here.","Sean Penn says he visited Haiti over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago I walked out of a mosque in silent protest of the imam's sermon. Outside, the heat of the desert sun could hardly match the fire of the rhetoric being spewed forth inside. The imam was railing against the foreign enemies of Islam and the sinners within. With every genocidal rant came an ""amen"" from the congregation. Some regrettably came from the heart. Others came from those on autopilot putting in their ""time"" at the mosque to fulfill their quota of good deeds. Still others were a tradeoff: penance for their sins, an economy of convenience that was born long before Islam and long sold as the path to heaven of other faiths. It was not the first time I had heard terrible notions of fear and hate peddled in the name of my religion. But that day was different. That day I felt complicit. I had reached a point of intellectual critical mass where my love for my religion overwhelmed my sitting in silence any longer. As I stood up, I stared at the imam to make sure he knew that at least one person would no longer accept the recipe of his revenge. Islam and Christianity were born in the same neighborhood under similar conditions 600 years apart. Christianity came about at a time when harsh rulers subjugated their people, making already difficult lives nearly impossible. The people responded to the message of Jesus as they did 600 years later to the message of Mohammad. Both Christianity and Islam offered simple messages to the poor: Live by the rules and your rewards will come later. TED.com: How Arab cultures are borrowing from western pop culture . Islam came of age at a time of open warfare between what was loosely called Arabia and the occupying Roman Byzantine Empires. It was a religion for the willing believer, further steeled by the Christian Crusades of the 11th and 12th centuries and the Medieval, Papal and Spanish Inquisitions. Many imams today are still preaching in the rhetoric of the seventh century without regard to contemporary reality. But unlike Jesus and Mohammad, they preach not of future rewards for living a just life as Allah promised. Instead, they offer their rewards to those who devote themselves to the genocide of those who they have anointed our enemies. They prefer not to leave Judgment Day to Allah, instead they substitute themselves as a sort of lower trial court. We are now in the Muslim month of Ramadan, a time of dawn to dusk fasting intended to teach Muslims about patience, humility, and spirituality. During Ramadan, more than a billion Muslims will congregate at their mosques. TED.com: Comics provide a window into our world . It is finally time that all of us became more accountable for that which our children will be hearing; tiny differences setting us apart rather than celebrating those positive things that bind all good people together. If we allow small-minded men to spout fear and hate in the name of our religion, we will enable them to brainwash another generation as they did our own. And soon, the next generation will fall into a pit of dissonance. To sit by silently makes us all complicit. As the father of five sons, I worry about who they're going to be using as role models. I worry because all around me, even within my extended family, I see religion being manipulated. As a psychologist, I worry for the world in general, but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world. Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York state. I trained at Bellevue Hospital's survivors of political torture program. And I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership, only to end up being tortured by their heroes. And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero, that just breaks you in so many ways. I left Bellevue, went to business school and started the comic book series ""THE 99."" THE 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran, things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom. TED.com: Comics of bygone New York . Fifteen hundred years after the birth of Christ, men representing the Catholic Church poured hot lead down the throats of Muslims and Jews to get them to accept Jesus as their Savior. Fourteen hundred years after Gabriel conveyed God's message to Muhammad through the Qur'an, a tiny minority of self-aggrandizing Muslims are using the lead of bullets to kill untold numbers in an unspeakable insult to name of Islam. Today, through THE 99, this proud Muslim is using the lead of his pencil to take a stand. For all our sakes, I hope the pencil really is mightier than the sword.

"(CNN) -- They traded in their coveralls for suits, but many of the 33 miners who were trapped for 69 days in a gold and copper mine still sported their protective sunglasses when they appeared at the Chilean presidential palace Monday to accept awards for their ordeal. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera invited the miners, known as ""the 33,"" to a special ceremony in Santiago. The rescuers involved in the operation were also honored. The rescue earlier this month captured the attention of the world, as one by one the trapped miners were pulled to the surface in a custom-made capsule that was lowered through a hole drilled into the rock. The men survived underground for longer than anyone in history. ""If anybody doubted before this accident that faith moves mountains, if anybody doubted that when us Chileans get united we are capable of reaching great goals, if anybody doubted our ability to make great achievements, I think that your example has dissipated those doubts,"" Pinera said, referring to the miners. ""All of those doubts disappeared with what is known today as the Miracle of San Jose, which is the miracle of this story."" The miners have garnered much attentions since their rescue, and many of them still wore the $400 Oakley sunglasses they were given to protect their eyes as the exited the mine. Hundreds of people gathered outside of La Moneda, the presidential palace, and cheered the miners as they arrived. Some wore hard hats and waved flags and posters with the miners' photos. The successful rescue operation was seen as a boost to Chile's image. ""When we found out that the company working the mine didn't have the ability to do the proper search-and-rescue effort, we made a decision. The decision was to assume in its entirety 100 percent of the responsibility,"" Pinera said. The president continued, ""We searched for each one of you as if you were our children, finding you with the help of God, and rescuing you with the support and contribution of thousands upon thousands of heroes, some known, some others anonymously, who gave themselves entirely to the task while you were [trapped] in the depths of the mountain."" The rescue efforts were proof that Chile is committed to doing things right, the president said. ""That day [of the rescue] was a triumph of life over death, hope over pessimism, unity over division, courage over fear, and decisiveness over hesitation,"" he said.","President Sebastian Pinera hosts the rescued miners Monday .

"(CNN) -- On November 25, 1963, representatives from more than 90 countries attended the Washington funeral for President John F. Kennedy. Millions watched the somber events on television. On that day, 1,300 miles to the southwest, the man accused of killing him was quietly and simply buried in Fort Worth, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald's remains were interred in a simple pine coffin with the help of volunteer pallbearers. The deteriorated coffin, which was replaced after Oswald's body was exhumed briefly in 1981, is now up for auction. A Fort Worth mortuary owner is selling the box, which had a bid of $5,000 on Wednesday. Also for sale are an Easter card signed by Oswald, a first draft of his death certificate, funeral records, an embalming table used to hold Oswald's body and assorted mortuary instruments. Bidding ends December 16, according to Nate D. Sanders Auctions of Los Angeles, California. Another seller is auctioning a patch of seat leather from the limousine that carried Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy through the streets of Dallas, Texas, during the shooting November 22, 1963. Funeral director Allen Baumgardner, 68, who assisted at the original embalming, purchased Miller Funeral Home along with all of its property. ""He felt the time was right to sell,"" said Laura Yntema, auction manager at Nate D. Sanders. ""What strikes me about it is what a simple pine coffin it is,"" she said, adding that the company expects the coffin to go for $70,000 to $100,000. Asked about the macabre nature of some of the items, Yntema said ""this is definitely a special situation."" Collectors look at the items more for their historical value, she said. Oswald was buried one day after nightclub owner Jack Ruby (born Jack Rubenstein) fatally shot him at Dallas Police headquarters while he was being transferred to the county jail. The death certificate draft lists ""shot by Jack Rubenstein"" under a section asking how the fatal injury occurred. The name was scratched out because Ruby, who died in 1967, had not been tried. Another death certificate was officially filed. Yntema said she expects the death certificate to go for $10,000 to $20,000 . Oswald's body was exhumed in October 1981 during a fierce legal battle between his widow, Marina, and brother Robert. Conspiracy theories abounded over whether a Soviet agent was actually buried in the grave. Marina Oswald won the dispute, and the coffin was exhumed, according to the auction house. ""As Lee Harvey Oswald's coffin was lifted, evidence of extensive water damage to the casket was apparent,"" said the company. Pathologists identified the decomposed remains as Oswald's, and he was reinterred in a new casket and vault. Baumgardner could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Serious collectors and museums are likely those most interested, Yntema said. The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, site of the assassination, is not interested in the coffin, curator Gary Mack told CNN. ""It doesn't really fit what we collect,"" he said. The nonprofit museum is in a building that once housed the famous Texas School Book Depository. Oswald is believed to have fired on Kennedy from an area that is now part of the museum. The museum is focused more on the events of November 22, 1963, and has a large collection of films, photos and local news coverage archives, Mack said. Mack related an account of the burial of Oswald at Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Park in Fort Worth. Two newsmen from competing news wire services volunteered to serve as pallbearers, he said. The funeral was attended by federal agents, police officers and five family members, according to the Dallas Morning News . Jennie Roberts, a spokeswoman for Service Corp. International, which owns the cemetery, said she could not discuss any details on the grave or visitors because of privacy policies. Visitors are not allowed to take photographs, Roberts said.","Auction house is selling items connected to Kennedy assassin .

"(CNN) -- The world wants to like America. The guiding values that Thomas Jefferson articulated so eloquently -- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- resonate strongly around the world, transcending countless superficial and cultural differences, not because these are American values, but because they are universal values, embedded in the human heart. Americans must outgrow the unbecoming arrogance that leads us to assert that America somehow owns a monopoly on goodness and truth -- a belief that leads some to view the world as but a stage on which to play out the great historical drama: the United States of America versus the Powers of Evil. The language of good versus evil is precisely the language of the fundamentalists whose worldview we oppose. Once we define as evil those who counter us, we lose the moral high ground and begin to descend an exceedingly slippery ethical slope. Sufis teach that we first must battle and destroy the evil within ourselves by shining upon it the good within, and then we learn to battle the evil in others by helping their higher selves gain control of their lower selves. TED.com: Robert Wright explains where compassion comes from . To battle the evil of others by responding in kind and exhibiting equally violent aggressive behavior is to flout the very ethic of our religious traditions; it is also to violate the Geneva conventions, international law, the United Nations, world opinion, and even our own Bill of Rights. If we truly believe that God is on our side, rather than making sure that we are on God's side, we slip into the illusion that sees no measure as too extreme -- a delusion that captivates every extremist heart. We have two powerful tools with which to bridge the chasm separating the United States from the Muslim world: faith in the basic goodness of humanity and trust in the power of sincerity and dialogue to overcome differences with our fellow human beings. This faith and this trust are taught by all the Abrahamic traditions. They define the Abrahamic ethic, which lies at the core of our American Declaration of Independence, and America needs to rely more heavily on them, as do our fellow actors on the stage of history. TED.com: Rev. James Forbes on learning compassion at the dinner table . What's right with America and what's right with Islam have a lot in common. At their highest levels, both worldviews reflect an enlightened recognition that all of humankind shares a common Creator -- that we are, indeed, brothers and sisters. In 1883, when Emma Lazarus wrote the words that celebrate the beautiful lady who stands so resolutely in New York's harbor, she was not imagining an isolationist empire-nation bent only on pursuing its own unilateral vision for the world. Rather, she had in mind a nation resting securely on its foundations of democracy, freedom, and human rights, of which Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, and the other great fathers and mothers of this nation dreamed. It is humanity's dream -- rich with hope and idealism for a troubled world -- that the great lady in the harbor symbolizes. To hold high the lamp of freedom, hope, and friendship is America's greatest gift to the world -- and its sacred responsibility. As I sailed into New York on the cold wintry morning of Wednesday, December 22, 1965, on the Italian SS Michelangelo, I beheld the Statue of Liberty and wondered what America had in store for me. Little did I realize then that I was to discover the riches of my faith tradition in this land. Like many immigrants from Muslim lands, I discovered my Islam in America. I therefore entertain a wish, shared by my reading of my noble scripture, the Quran, regarding all religions, including Judaism and Christianity -- the very same wish entertained by all who have taken part in interfaith dialogue across the ages. TED.com: Karen Armstrong's wish to revive the Golden Rule . I wish for humankind to drink deeply from that rich, nourishing current of spiritual traditions -- those immutable principles of divine origin that have been given form in so many ways in human societies. Religion must be more than mere custom or habit, more than the transient styles and cultural fashions of passing ages. Religion, which speaks to the eternal in us, must be the foundation of a robust, harmonious society and the animating principle of the whole life of a people.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Congratulations! Despite daily news stories of layoffs and companies folding, you have managed to hang on to your job. So why don't you exactly feel like celebrating? While you may be grateful for employment, the fact is that corporate restructuring, budget cuts and a general air of uncertainty take a toll on all workers. What can you do if you are feeling underpaid, overworked, unrecognized or burned out? Money matters . From waitresses expected to serve additional tables because of staff reductions to account executives putting in extra hours to land new clients, many employees are working longer and harder than ever before. Yet while demands on workers may be rising, their paychecks often are not. Blame the employer? Joseph Grenny, co-author of the New York Times bestseller ""Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High,"" cautions against doing that. ""You are responsible for your income -- not your employer,"" Grenny states. He thinks that if you believe you are underpaid for the amount of work you do, you've got three options: . • Persuade your employer . ""Evaluate your contributions to the company and determine if the value you add to the company warrants a raise. If you think a raise is merited, make sure to adequately prepare for the crucial conversation with your employer, and be prepared to share specific examples of how you have benefited the company."" • Supplement your income . ""If you do not think your company is in a position to give you a raise, consider supplementing your income with consulting in your area of expertise, a side business or another source of income."" • Shop around . ""If you feel that you are underpaid and under-appreciated, it might be time to start looking for a new job."" Is ""rocking the boat"" dangerous in this economy? As Grenny sees it, ""Employers these days realize that if today is a soft labor market, it will be tight again sometime in the future. Consequently, you can have more confidence than you might realize in approaching your boss. The key is to build mutual purpose -- to let the employer know you care about the needs of the company while wanting to be fairly compensated yourself."" Beyond a paycheck . Being happy in a job isn't solely about pay. Employees want to know that their talents and efforts are recognized and appreciated by those around them. Janet Flewelling, director of human resources operations for Administaff in Houston, Texas, notes that in many cases when an employee feels he is being overlooked by management it has nothing to do with length of tenure or even job performance. ""During a tough economy, when many companies have experienced layoffs, tensions are high and it is often the case that management is consumed with other concerns such as reducing operating costs or retaining clients."" Flewelling gives the following advice for workers looking to get noticed: . • Take a proactive stance . ""Provide your supervisor with regular status updates of your work and candidly discuss projects and the milestones achieved before he or she requests the information. Taking the initiative to openly communicate with management will not only assist in keeping you top-of-mind, it demonstrates your drive to succeed, which is something no smart manager can overlook."" • Focus on career development . ""Successful companies know retaining employees who want to constantly learn and develop their skills are the best investment they can make and therefore these employees are rarely overlooked."" • Support your company . ""Employers look to employees to support leadership in an economic downturn. Employees should clearly communicate their support to management and let them know that they are ready and willing to pitch in and assist wherever necessary to help make management's vision a reality."" Getting out of the dumps . Irritability, headaches, stomach aches, fatigue and problems sleeping are some ways that job stress can manifest itself. When feeling burned out becomes the norm instead of the exception, it may be time for action. Try a walk at lunch to clear your head. Skip hanging around the water cooler if office gossip is getting you down. Try a power nap after work instead of more coffee, and be sure you're eating something other than junk food from the vending machine. Finally, consider utilizing services of employee assistance programs, which are typically available through insurance providers at no additional cost to the employee. ""Oftentimes, workers do not take advantage of these programs because they do not know they are available or they worry the information will be made accessible to the employer,"" Flewelling states. ""However, that is not the case. EAPs offer confidential counseling and referral services from trained professionals to help employees with problems at work or home, financial concerns, stress, depression and substance abuse, to name a few."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A series of jewelry store robberies in Baghdad on Sunday led to clashes with police and left at least seven people dead, according to police in the Iraqi capital. Among the killed were three store owners and two police officers. Two of the 10 gunmen, who stormed three jewelry stores in western Baghdad's al-Mansour neighborhood, were also killed as they tried to flee the area. The robbers took gold and cash, and eight remain at large. Iraqi security forces have sealed off the area as they continue to investigate. The al-Mansour neighborhood, the site of frequent insurgent attacks, and has seen a great deal of violence since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Authorities believe insurgents are behind some recent robberies to fund their operations.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Attackers wielding rockets and machine guns in northwestern Pakistan struck a NATO convoy carrying fuel to Afghanistan, a local police chief said on Wednesday. Nisar Ahmed Tanoli, the police chief of Noshehra district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said 17 oil tankers and four containers were all set ablaze. This convoy was parked on side of the road, and convoys are generally operated by contracting Pakistani logistics firms, using local trucks and drivers. This is the latest strike on Afghan-bound supply convoys in Pakistan. Azam Tariq, the central spokesman for Pakistani Taliban, said a special squad designated to strike NATO supply efforts made the attack near Quetta, Pakistan. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for an earlier attack on oil tankers, a spokesman for the militant group told CNN by phone Wednesday. Quetta police said 20 oil tankers parked near that city were set ablaze Wednesday, and one person died in the attack. Shah Nawaz, a senior Quetta police official, said more than 12 gunmen in three vehicles opened fire on the tanker trucks.  He said the person who died was killed in the shooting. Nawaz said the gunmen also threw petrol bombs on the trucks. Of the 20 tankers that caught fire, nine were destroyed. At least five other attacks have been carried out on vehicles carrying supplies for NATO forces in the past week, leaving at least six people dead. The Pakistani Taliban has also claimed responsibility for two of the earlier attacks on convoys. ""The oil and the machinery is for logistic support to the NATO forces who killed our innocent sisters and brothers in Afghanistan, which we would never allow,"" Tariq said Wednesday. Pakistan closed the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan -- known as the Torkham border -- after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. A report from a NATO and Pakistan assessment  team concluded that soldiers fired warning shots to let them know of their presence, but the helicopter crews assumed they were insurgents and fired the shots. ""Two coalition helicopters passed into Pakistan airspace several times. Subsequently, the helicopters fired on a building later identified as a Pakistan border outpost, in response to shots fired from the post. The assessment team considered it most probable that they had fired in an attempt to warn the helicopters of their presence. Unfortunately, following the engagement, it was discovered that the dead and wounded were members of the Pakistan Frontier Scouts,"" NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. A second supply route through Chaman -- in the western province of Balochistan -- is open, but the Pakistani Taliban is threatening violence on any route used for NATO purposes. ""Our special squad will make [the] supply line to NATO through Chaman border as impossible as we did in Torkham border,"" Tariq said Wednesday. Nawaz, the police official, said authorities have also felt an impact. ""After closing of the Torkham border for NATO supplies, pressure on the Chaman border has become almost doubled, which is creating security problems for us,"" he said. Tariq said this week that the earlier Pakistani Taliban attacks were carried out as revenge for drone strikes and NATO's attacks in Pakistan. ""U.S. and NATO forces are killing innocent Pakistanis, which is unacceptable, and we will teach them a lesson by such attacks,"" Tariq said. Supply convoys are important for the Afghan war effort. Coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from Pakistan to bring in supplies and gear. In Washington Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said that attacks on fuel convoys interrupt a tiny fraction of U.S. war supplies. ""There have been attacks historically on NATO convoys passing through Pakistan to Afghanistan. And they are sometimes sensational and they are sometimes horrific and they are sometimes deadly and that is tragic,"" Morrell said. ""But if you put this in context and in perspective, we're talking about ... impacting about 1 percent of the supplies that we funnel through Pakistan into Afghanistan.""

"(CNN) -- Malawi's decision to reject pop star Madonna's adoption of a local child has reignited global debate about the ethics of international adoption. Author Melissa Fay Greene poses with her family, which includes biological and adopted children. Some international aid groups have praised the decision as best for the child, a 4-year-old girl named Chifundo James. ""I think it really highlights the bigger picture that there are so many children living in poverty in Malawi, and while Madonna has good intentions ... children would be better off staying in their own communities whenever possible,"" said Karen Hansen-Kuhn, policy director for ActionAid USA, a development group that also works in Malawi. ""We really need to stay focused on the needs of Malawi and of all the children there,"" she added. To get another perspective on the situation, CNN also talked with Melissa Fay Greene, an author and mother of five adopted children. Greene, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, is the mother of four biological children, four children adopted from Ethiopia and one adopted child from Bulgaria. The following is an edited transcript of that conversation: . CNN: What's your initial reaction to the news that Madonna's adoption of a Malawian child has been rejected? Greene: Surprise. ... It was awfully tricky with Madonna's first adoption, when the child turned out to have devoted family members nearby. [The singer's adoption of a Malawian boy was finalized last year.] And if that's true with this child also, it seems a similar sticky situation. That's not the situation for the majority of orphanage children around the world, who don't have caring grandparents or aunts and uncles a short walk or bike ride away. I think it gives people an odd perspective on what international adoption can mean for children who don't have any support network outside the walls of an orphanage. You often hear attacks on international adoption as robbing a child of his or her culture, and that's both true and false. It's true that an internationally adopted child loses the rich background of history and religion and culture and language that the child was born into, but the cruel fact is that most children don't have access to the local, beautiful culture within an orphanage. ... There's a culture in orphanages that children are eager to escape from, and it's a culture of being reared as a group and not being doted upon by parents. For any child, that's the bottom line. The fact is that a human child wants that mommy or daddy or both. We're just wired to want that and to need that. And there's no way an institutional setting can give a human baby what the child needs. It's impossible. So you have to balance priorities. ... I think what some of the human rights group say is absolutely accurate: that international adoption does not begin to solve the problems of the world's orphaned children. It's truly not the answer. ... At the same time, international adoption, even though it doesn't solve the whole problem, it solves a problem for a few. I think it can be a brilliant solution to the problem of adults wanting a child in their lives or wanting more children in their lives and the problem of children who want parents in their lives. CNN: How is it different for a celebrity person seeking an [international] adoption than for yourself? Greene: We don't jet in, take a child and fly out with a child. For an average citizen trying to adopt, it takes most of a year. First of all, you work with a country that already has international adoption regulations in place, so you have a bureaucracy dealing with international adoption. A big part of that is determining that the child is a true orphan, that there is no one who can care for the child. And in the case of our older kids' adoptions, people had to come to court to testify that there was no one to take the children. So you don't run the risk of 'Oh, whoops, there's a grandmother down the street.' ... CNN: There's been some chatter today online questioning why a person wouldn't adopt an orphaned child from their own country. Greene: Within the adoption world, it's a non-issue. There are children all over the world who need families, and some find their children in Philadelphia, and some find their children in Bulgaria, you know? ... It's just outsiders who look on and judge disapprovingly, but then they don't go on to adopt the neighborhood children, right? ... There are many children who need help, and anyone who wants to reach out and adopt a child from foster care or from a Russian orphanage should reach out and do it. CNN: What has the experience been like for your own foster children? Greene: We're a white Jewish family in Atlanta, but Atlanta is a major city for eastern African immigrants. So our children are in touch with the Ethiopian diaspora, and they feel very much a part of that. Atlanta is full of Ethiopian restaurants, markets, festivals. For a while, my kids were playing on weekends with an Ethiopian soccer league. I have an Ethiopian baby sitter who speaks to them only in Amharic so they won't lose their language, and we always have Ethiopian food here. Two years ago, we went back to Ethiopia with the kids and had a big reunion for one of my sons and his extended family ... We just consider ourselves sort of part of this amazing bicontinental family. CNN: The first time you adopted internationally, can you tell me what your ethical considerations were and how you worked through that personally? Greene: Our first adoption was of a boy in rural Bulgaria. An incredibly poor orphanage. The kids were hungry, thirsty, no education. I first met our son, Jesse, when he was 4. He was 4 years old, and he did not know what his own name was ... When he first came, he was just so anxious about food. When he would wake up, he was just shaking, wondering if there was going to be enough food. So I started waking him up with food. He had issues with water. He wasn't sure if there was going to be enough water to drink, so I bought him a little canteen so he could wear his water all of the time. Do I have ethical issues about taking him out of that orphanage? I don't. CNN: Is there anything else you wanted to add? Greene: I admire Madonna. And I don't understand why everyone attacks Madonna. I think that she is in part trying to raise the world's consciousness about the African orphan crisis. You know, 95 percent of the children orphaned by AIDS [globally] are in sub-Saharan Africa. You don't hear world leaders talking about it. Where is the global outrage? ... So, into the breach steps a celebrity. But don't attack her for it, you know. Maybe her methods are not what ours would be, but how many of us are Madonna? But at least she is out there; she's creating a school. Obviously, she's fallen in love with the Malawian children to such an extent she wants to make some of them her own. And I think that it's great. I just don't understand why the world's attacking her. Let other people step forth and do something. At least she's trying. That's my feeling.","Malawian judge rejects Madonna's request to adopt a 4-year-old girl .

"TBILISI, Georgia (CNN)  -- Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili signed a cease-fire agreement on Friday, which the U.S. said means Russian troops must begin withdrawing. The office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who brokered the agreement, said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev also had confirmed Russia's cooperation. ""His country will sign a cease-fire accord with Georgia and scrupulously respect all agreements, including a troop withdrawal,"" Sarkozy's office said. Fighting that started last week has died down in the region, but Russian forces remain. The warfare raged for several days until Sarkozy's diplomatic efforts helped lessen the violence. Sarkozy undertook the role because he holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the priority now was ""all Russian troops and irregulars that entered Georgia with them must leave immediately."" Rice said international observers followed by neutral peacekeepers should be dispatched quickly to Georgia and its separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, where Russia has a peacekeeping mission. Saakashvili warned at a news conference with Rice that ""this is not a done deal yet"" unless it included ways of stopping a repeat. ""We are under Russian occupation,"" he said. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that President Dmitry Medvedev has agreed to sign the document but added that it was not clear whether it has been amended since Russia made the commitment to sign.  Watch Rice demand Russia's withdrawal » . The conflict began late last week, when Georgia launched a military incursion into South Ossetia in an effort to rout separatist rebels. Russia -- which supports the separatists, many of whom claim Russian citizenship -- has peacekeeping responsibilities for the region and responded by sending tanks into the province for what it said was peace enforcement. From there the violence spread into Georgia and Abkhazia. iReport.com: How is the Russia-Georgia conflict affecting you? Under the cease-fire, about 1,500 Russian peacekeepers are allowed to remain inside, and can do patrols about 6 kilometers outside, the ""zone of conflict,"" a reference to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. They are not permitted to patrol in Gori and other Georgian cities and cannot hamper aid distribution or control ports, highways or railroads, the officials said. The limited exception for the Russian peacekeepers is allowed only until a more robust international peacekeeping force can be deployed. Analysts see the conflict in Georgia, which is seeking NATO and EU membership, as having wider international implications as Russia seeks to reduce Western influence on its doorstep. President Bush earlier chided Russia for Cold War-style behavior in its territorial conflict with Georgia, accusing it of ""bullying and intimidation"" as international pressure grew on Moscow to withdraw its troops from the region. Medvedev remained defiant over Moscow's actions, saying Russia had brought peace to the region. Russian troops remained in control of two key Georgian cities despite pledges of a withdrawal. The Russians occupied the cities of Gori and Poti after conflict flared over the breakaway province of South Ossetia.  Watch devastation in port of Poti » . Reports emerged Friday of widespread looting in the decimated city of Gori and witnesses said they heard small-arms fire in South Ossetia, one of the two disputed territories at the center of the conflict. But Russia's military spokesman said Friday that ""there's absolutely no firing"" under way in Georgia and that his government is concentrating on getting humanitarian aid to residents there. Bush said the United States stands ""with the people of Georgia and their democratically elected government.""  Watch President Bush on 'why Georgia matters' » . Medvedev said Russia will ""guarantee"" peace in the Caucasus region but made no commitment to remove Russian forces from Georgia or its breakaway territories.  ""Peace needs to re-established in the region and guaranteed and underpinned so that no one again will get idiotic ideas, and this I see as the main task of the Russian Federation,"" Medvedev said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a news conference with Medvedev, called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from central Georgia, where they remain in control of large areas of the country. International rights body Human Rights Watch on Friday accused Russia of dropping cluster bombs -- outlawed by more than 100 nations -- on Georgia, killing civilians. The claim was denied by Russian officials. A senior U.S. State Department official familiar with negotiations said the version of the one-page, six-element agreement that Rice carried to Tbilisi closed a loophole in the hastily written preliminary peace plan that Georgia and Russia agreed to Tuesday.  View a map of the region » . Under Rice's plan, new wording would clarify that Russian would have a ""very limited to a light patrolling ability, such as a few kilometers outside of South Ossetia, not the right to maintain a presence inside Georgia."" It is unclear how many people have been killed in the conflict, but various claims put the figure in the thousands. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday that it estimated that more than 118,000 people have been displaced by the fighting, citing statistics supplied by the Russian and Georgian governments. About 30,000 people from South Ossetia fled to Russia, according to officials in the Russian region of North Ossetia, and up to 15,000 people from South Ossetia went south into Georgia proper, the Georgian government said. Around 73,000 people in Georgia proper are displaced, including most of the population of Gori. A further 732 Georgians living in Abkhazia were evacuated from the remote Khodori Valley.

"(CNN) -- Turkey's military said it killed at least 15 rebels in operations in northern Iraq earlier this week, but a spokesman for the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Security Forces denied the report, saying Turkey has not conducted any military operation or air assault there in the past two weeks. Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq during an offensive in February. A statement posted on the Turkish armed forces' official Web site said a group of PKK, or members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, was identified in northern Iraq, and said the group was believed to be planning an attack and trying to leak through the border into Turkey. The PKK, labeled a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, is comprised of militants who have been launching attacks against Turkey from bases in northern Iraq. The Turkish military said the PKK group ""came under fire by long-range weapons"" on Thursday, and 15 terrorists were killed. The same region was targeted by a Turkish air assault on Friday, the military said, adding that the number of casualties was not yet available.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Hal Holbrook has made his name playing famous historical figures. He won an Emmy for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in a 1974 TV miniseries, accolades as ""Deep Throat"" in 1976's ""All the President's Men,"" and a Tony as Mark Twain -- a performance he's been giving now for a half-century -- in ""Mark Twain Tonight!"" Hal Holbrook, 83, is nominated for his role as Ron Franz in ""Into the Wild."" But playing Ron Franz, the thoughtful, down-to-earth 81-year-old who bonds with a youthful adventurer in ""Into the Wild,"" was an opportunity he dared not miss, he says in a phone interview. ""This was an opportunity, and a rare one for me, to just play myself, to not do Abraham Lincoln or another character,"" Holbrook says in his familiar rich baritone. ""I didn't want to research anything. I had a very personal reaction to the role."" Holbrook's gut feeling has led to some of the best reviews of his career and a first for the actor: a nomination for an Academy Award. At 83 -- his birthday was last Sunday -- he's the oldest man ever to be nominated for best supporting actor. The Oscars are scheduled for Sunday night. ""Into the Wild"" is due out on video March 4. Holbrook says he's familiar with the kind of adventurousness exhibited by Christopher McCandless, played by Emile Hirsch in Sean Penn's film. Holbrook has gone into the wilderness himself. He's also sailed the open sea in a small boat, accompanied by little more than a sextant and a map. ""No electronics,"" he says. He's even traveled in McCandless' tracks, taking a trip to Alaska the year after the self-named ""Alexander Supertramp"" died. ""They were still talking about him, whether he was crazy,"" Holbrook recalls. Holbrook, who'd also read Jon Krakauer's book about McCandless' journey, says he was sent the script ""out of the blue"" and told that Penn wanted to meet with him the next day. The director, upon discussing the part with him, offered Holbrook the role. Holbrook has nothing but praise for Penn's work on the film. ""To work with Sean Penn might be the best experience I've ever had with a director,"" he says. ""He's so trusting. There was none of this 'Let's discuss the back story' -- he trusts you. He'll take whatever you give him, and begins to open up your sense of freedom. He gives you space to explore whatever the scenes bring out of you. Sean was wonderful."" Holbrook also has high praise for Hirsch, who lost 40 pounds for the role. ""[His performance] was a brilliant piece of work. ... An actor takes his performance from other actors, and in this case it was easy,"" he says, adding that ""I'm astounded he wasn't nominated -- he deserved it more than anybody."" Read Hirsch's view of ""Into the Wild."" But Holbrook also paid tribute to a person seldom considered by the audience: the film editor, in this case Jay Cassidy. By changing the sequence of two scenes, Cassidy gave the film an added power -- which made all the difference to how his performance was perceived, Holbrook says. ""I have never been more aware of an editor's genius as I have in this particular film,"" he says. Referring to the film's back-and-forth chronology, which he calls ""a very daring piece of work,"" he marvels at how Cassidy and Penn fit the pieces together. ""It's quite an achievement,"" Holbrook says. ""The effect it can have on a performance is profound."" Cassidy's work earned ""Into the Wild"" its only other Oscar nomination. Holbrook has had a busy couple months, with his performance nominated for critics' awards as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award. The activity has taken the steadily working actor away from a personal project: his memoirs. ""Trying to fit all these things in -- it ain't easy,"" he chuckles. ""I had to stop [writing] for the last month or so."" He doesn't give himself much of a possibility to win: Slim and none are my chances,"" he says. Still, he treasures the experience. The Oscar nomination ""is like a miracle,"" he says. ""After 65 years or so [of acting], to be nominated for an Academy Award is a great gift.""

"(CNN) -- Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger says he'll take to the skies again -- as soon as he can shake Flight 1549 out of his head. Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, left, and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles say they'll eventually return to work. ""I'll be going back to work as soon as I'm ready,"" said Sullenberger, who along with First Officer Jeffrey Skiles safely guided US Airways Flight 1549 to an emergency landing in the Hudson River last month. Sullenberger, Skiles and veteran flight attendants Sheila Dail, Doreen Welsh and Donna Dent spoke to CNN's Larry King on Tuesday. The captain and his crew have achieved national fame since their January 15 landing, in which all 155 passengers survived. ""My sleep has been disrupted ever since the incident ... It's distracting and it's hard sometimes to turn off my brain at night,"" Sullenberger said. Sullenberger's crew members expressed similar experiences in the aftermath of the incident. All but Welsh, a 38-year veteran who was injured in the accident, said they felt certain they would return to work at some point. Asked why she wasn't in uniform during the interview, Welsh replied, ""I can't yet. I was the one that was injured, and I was the one in water, and it [the uniform] was ripped and bloody, and I just can't put it on yet.""  Watch the crew discuss flying again » .

Earlier this month, the National Transportation Safety Board said both the plane's engines contained the remains of birds, confirming the pilots' report that the engines shut down after colliding with birds less than 2 minutes after taking off. The plane's flight data recorder ""revealed no anomalies or malfunctions in either engine up to the point where the captain reported a bird strike, after which there was an uncommanded loss of thrust in both engines,"" the NTSB said. Sullenberger told ""Larry King Live"" that bird strikes are not ""terribly uncommon,"" though they typically have only minor impact on a plane. Watch pilot and crew describe the bird strike » . ""This was very different,"" Sullenberger said. ""There were many large birds that struck all over the airplane, pelted us like hail and severely damaged both engines.""

Within minutes, Sullenberger decided to land the plane on the Hudson. Was it a miracle? ""I wouldn't say that,"" Skiles said. ""I would still say that it's just everybody did our jobs and we had good fortune, as well.""  Watch Skiles express sense of responsibility to passengers » .

"(CNN) -- As a concept, recycling has lived and died many times throughout its 4,000-year old history. But it always re-emerges as an idea when humans need it most, such as during the Great Depression, and later during World War II, when American companies recycled or reused around 25 percent of the waste stream. A sign in Cheshire, England signalling a recycling drop-off area. Today, the global recycling industry generates $160 billion a year, processing more than 500 million tons of materials. The industry is becoming one of the world's biggest employers. While the official amount of people employed by the industry is 1.5 million worldwide, the real figure -- when you factor in illegal recycling operations in the developing world -- is likely to be much, much higher. The United Nations believes, for example, that as many as 10 million people in China alone are now in the recycling business. What's not to like about recycling? There are some fairly persuasive arguments for recycling, and for using recycled goods. Energy savings is just one of them. By reusing existing materials you are essentially removing the process involved in sourcing the ""virgin materials"" in the first place. Take soda cans, made from aluminum. According to Friends of the Earth, creating a ton of these from scratch takes five times the amount of energy as it would to produce a ton of recycled cans. According to the Bureau of International Recycling (BIR), the companies that manufacture recycled aluminum are using 95 percent less energy than if they were using ""virgin materials."" (For plastics the energy savings are almost as high -- 80 percent, BIR says, while making paper from recycled paper (as opposed to wood) can save 64 percent of energy.) Looking at it another way, according to the National Recycling Coalition, the amount of energy saved in one year by Americans recycling their soda cans, plastic containers, newspapers and packaging represented the energy equivalent of: . Not surprisingly, recycling also impacts pollution levels. BIR says producing paper from recycled paper as opposed to wood can slash air pollution by as much as 74 percent and water pollution by 35 percent; while manufacturing recycled steel results in 86 percent less air pollution. There are different types of pollution savings to be made, reducing the pollution generated by manufacturing the stuff in the first place. And then there is the pollution that results in dumping the waste in landfills, instead of recycling it. A recent report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), for example, has predicted that greenhouse gas emissions from household waste will drop by more than 80 percent by 2020 -- largely because of increases in recycling levels which are diverting waste away from landfills. And the carbon savings can be huge, even when a relatively small amount of effort has been made. The UK has one of Europe's lowest recycling rates when it comes to municipal waste -- 27 percent. Yet, the impact on its carbon emissions has already become worthwhile, according to Waste & Resources Action Programme, or WRAP. WRAP says that these relatively minor efforts already mean a 10 million- to 15 million-ton reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year -- the equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars off the road. What about the costs? One of the main objections to the recycling movement has been the cost factor. Throwing something away is obviously going to be a lot cheaper than going through the hassle of recycling it. And certain materials are going to be a lot tougher to recycle than others, driving up costs and energy spent. But, as a 2004 study by research group GPI Atlantic found out, there are many different ways to measure cost. GPI looked at the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, which back in the 1990s had decided that 50 percent of its trash was going to get recycled instead of landing up in incinerators or landfills. The annual cost to the province of doing this was $18 million more than it would have cost to chuck trash away. But, when different factors were considered, the number looked very different These factors included: . GPI concluded that Nova Scotia was in fact saving up to $125 million simply because it had embraced recycling. The developing world's gain? Arguably, recycling has seen the most economic success in the poorer parts of the world. According to the Earth Institute, the aluminum can recycling business in Brazil now employs more people than its car industry. Brazilians collecting used soda cans have boosted their earning power significantly, earning $200 a month against the standard minimum $81 monthly salary. Then there are the inhabitants of a single 174-hectare slum in India's largest city, Mumbai, that have managed to create a $1.3 billion recycling industry between them, according to the Observer. Dharavi is home to one million slum dwellers, with a quarter of them fully employed (albeit often illegally) in a recycling business which processes 80 percent of Mumbai's plastic waste alone. ""There is a lot to be learned from the developing world,"" the Observer quoted Friends of the Earth's Claire Wilton as saying. ""Where a scavenger mentality, grassroots recycling and sheer necessity can lead to imaginative leaps in redeploying waste."" That being said, the economic impact may be welcomed by those in poorer countries sifting through everyone's trash -- but the health impact still leaves a lot to be desired. Around 70 percent of the world's electronic waste ends up in southern China. A recent study by Hong Kong's Baptist University found that the basic methods employed to recycle these items was having an unsettling effect on people living nearby, specifically women. Women in their mid-20s in one recycling site in Zheijiang Province were found to be carrying the highest levels of cancer-causing toxic chemicals like dioxins and furans than they had seen anywhere else in the world. It is still too early to say what the long-term effects of these chemicals will be on these women, but it is likely that it will become clear when they attempt to have children. Dioxins and furans have been linked to reproductive problems specifically. The researchers found that the women had twice the amount of dioxins in their breast milk and three times as much in their placentas as normal. They were also found to be at increasing risk of experiencing spontaneous abortions the longer they chose to live there.  E-mail to a friend .

"Editor's note: A gunman killed 10 people and himself Tuesday in southern Alabama. It's the most recent example of mass killing sprees that have traumatized communities over the years. Here's how one city responded. In the worst mass shooting in the U.S. at the time, a gunman killed 23 customers in a Texas cafeteria in 1991. (CNN) -- On October 16, 1991, 35-year-old George Hennard drove a pickup truck into Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, and fatally shot 23 people and wounded more than 20 before killing himself. For more than 15 years, the city next to the sprawling Fort Hood military base had the dubious distinction of being the site of the deadliest mass shooting in the United States -- until a student killed 32 people and himself at Virginia Tech in 2007. ""You can never prepare for an incident like this,"" says Killeen city councilman Fred Latham, who was mayor pro tem of the city, which had a population of about 66,000 at the time of the shooting. But Killeen's experience shows a city can survive the grief, pain and stigma of such an incident. About 80 people were in the cafeteria, many of them taking their bosses to lunch for National Bosses Day when Hennard arrived. He methodically chose his victims, most of whom were women, before he was wounded by police and shot himself. Latham, who is 60 and a real estate broker, has been on the city council off and on for 16 years. He spoke to CNN.com Wednesday. CNN: What are your memories of that day in October? Latham: It was a tragic day in our history, Many of the people who were killed or injured I personally knew. It was just a big shock that anything like that could ever happen in our community. CNN: Where were you when it happened? Latham: I was with the mayor and the Waco city engineer, looking at potential road improvements and we just happened to be driving near where Luby's was, and we saw some roadblocks being set up and we knew something terrible had happened. There were police cars and barricades and you had the sense that something was wrong. CNN: What are your memories of the days after the shooting? Latham: The community came together as far as trying to help resolve the issues with the people who were victims or their families who were trying to get through it. There were a lot of human resource agencies that came, American Red Cross, a lot of counselors. It was just overwhelming. I think the phones into Killeen were jammed from people all over the country trying to check on their family members. Luby's was the kind of place that would attract any kind of person. That was Bosses Day that particular day, so you had a lot of extra business there, I'm sure. And many of the people were in our school district. Our school district is one of the biggest employers in the region. So when you had administrators or people in that administration office killed, they're going to be known by many, many people. The commanding general at Fort Hood sent in helicopters and all kinds of extra assistance that might be needed. ...Fort Hood is the major employer in the area. At that time there were some 42,000 assigned troops there and some soldiers were actually killed. You can never prepare for an incident like this from somebody that just goes off. How they pick a destination you don't know. This person drove all the way from Belton, which is about 16 miles to our east. He wasn't a Killeen resident, so how he picked Luby's you don't know. He actually drove through the front window and the people that were in the restaurant thought maybe he had an accident where you try to apply the brakes and hit the gas pedal. .... When he came out shooting, the people were kind of trapped. I was proud of our community as to how they handled the situation and overcame all the adversity. Everybody was concerned about the welfare of the families and the people who were victims, Luby's began a fund to help defray some of the expenses and I think people from all over the country sent money. We formed a committee that helped look at how you disburse the money. I think that was successful and helped some with the aftermath. CNN: What are the emotions that a community goes through? Latham: Grief, just disbelief that something like this could happen, all the same emotions that you go through with any significant death in a family, I suppose. To have at the time...that this was worst shooting anywhere in the world, it gives a stigma that you don't ever want to have for your city. It's similar to the one that happened at Columbine and at Virginia Tech. Nobody has the answers as to why these things happen and the randomness of the person shooting his victims doesn't make any sense. It's not logical, you can't comprehend it. To see death happen to people, they were just there to have a meal with their boss and have a celebration of that and no interaction with the person that perpetrated this act. CNN: Were the churches and houses of worship involved in trying to heal the wounds? Latham: Absolutely, the churches throughout town came to the aid, performing counseling and having funeral services. There was a lot of compassion, if anything good came out of this, it was the fact that we realized that we all really cared more about each other more than we ever thought. CNN: Has the town recovered? Latham: It has been resilient. We've been in a dynamic part of central Texas where the economy has been good for many years. [There's] the resiliency and the strength of Fort Hood, which is one of the most efficient training facilities for the Army and it has continued to grow. A lot of people have retired here and the cost of living is good. There's affordable housing, the weather is good ... then you've got a work force that's educated and disciplined, and they're fairly young. CNN: You talked about the stigma of having the worst mass killing in the world. Latham: The tendency for the news media, each time an event like this happens, they'll list one, two, three, four, five, where the most killings occurred and you're mentioned in that top five. And that's not something we want to be reminded of. CNN: Some people say the stigma can hurt a town economically, but it doesn't seem to have done so in Killeen. Latham: We're a very mobile community. Our population turns over at least 30 percent every five years. Maybe two-thirds of our population [now] weren't even here or doesn't even know anything about this. So we're different from a longtime community that doesn't turn over like that. CNN: What advice would you have for other mayors or other city council people in towns who experience these kinds of incidents? Latham: Well I would accept help from others. You're not in it by yourself. You'll be surprised at the resiliency that you'll have as a community. The faith-based community will come forward, embrace that. You'll get through it, but you won't ever forget the victims or what has happened to the community.","Fred Latham: ""You can never prepare"" for an incident like the one in Killeen, Texas .

Jenson Button could join Lewis Hamilton at McLaren in an exciting partnership for the 2010 season. Button has not yet agreed a new contract with Brawn and McLaren are interested having struggled to land first choice Kimi Raikkonen. McLaren team principal, Martin Whitmarsh refused to rule out a move for Button and create and all-British pairing at the manufacturer. Asked by British newspaper Daily Mail whether there had been talks between McLaren and Button's representatives Whitmarsh said: ""We've talked to a number of drivers. It wouldn't be appropriate to say more than that. ""We'll hire the two best drivers available to us as we always have."" The world champion's manager Richard Goddard also refused to comment on whether he had held talks with McLaren to increase speculation. Button, meanwhile, made a return to Brawn UK headquarters in Brackley and paid tribute to the staff behind his title-winning success.

""Some of us were here from the beginning back in 1998 and I arrived halfway through our journey in 2003 but everyone has put so much work in. ""I know that there have been a lot of very difficult times and over the winter there were times when we didn't think that we would be here at all. ""It's very sad that not everyone can be here who worked on this fantastic car. But the team had to become smaller to continue and together we produced a car that has been exceptional this season. ""To be able to achieve the constructors' and the drivers' championships in our first year, especially after such a difficult winter, is an amazing achievement. It's been a roller coaster of emotions. ""The first few races were magnificent. It looked like it was a walk in the park but it really wasn't. Then we had some difficult races, especially myself but also as a team where we struggled.

"(CNN) -- The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, has escaped serious injury in a car crash in his native Jamaica which wrecked his high-speed sports car. Jamaican flyer Bolt claimed 100 meters gold in Beijing in a new world record time. The IAAF, the world governing body of athletics, gave graphic details of Bolt's lucky escape on its official Web site www.iaaf.org. The 22-year-old, who was driving his BMW M3 with two female passengers, lost control and went off a rain-soaked road. The car ended up overturned in a ditch and Bolt and his passengers had to clamber out through a bed of thorns before being taken to hospital in Spanish Town, near Kingston, as a precaution. Bolt was released after three hours, with his feet strapped with bandages, after undergoing a minor operation to remove embedded thorns from his foot. He told a local reporter: ""Me good man. Me all right, a just few cuts man, me all right."" As a result of the accident, Bolt will miss Saturday's Jamaica International Invitational meeting and is expected to be sidelined for at least a week. ""We will continue to monitor his progress over the next few days,"" Bolt's agent Ricky Simms told reporters. ""It's too early to say if this will have any impact on his training and racing program in the next few weeks."" Bolt is also set to come to England in mid-May to run in a special 150 meters street race in Manchester. A spokesman for the organizers told CNN that they were hopeful the sprint sensation would be fit to turn up. ""We are in constant contact with his management team and everything remains on track for him to come,"" said Norman Hart. Bolt set world records in winning the 100 and 200 meters gold in the Beijing OIympics and claimed a third gold as Jamaica took the 4x100 meters relay. He was given the BMW by his sponsors as reward for his incredible success which catapulted him to global stardom.","Sprinter Usain Bolt fortunate to escape from car crash in his native Jamaica .

"(CNN) -- Police are investigating reports that Zahra Baker, the 10-year-old disabled girl who was killed in North Carolina, may have been raped prior to her death, according to police search warrants that were unsealed Tuesday. The girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, reported Zahra missing on October 9. Police announced that they found the girl's remains on November 11. She had been dismembered. Search warrants obtained by the Hickory, North Carolina, police released Tuesday, give the first glimpse into the grisly events that could have led to the death of the freckled-face girl, who lost part of her left leg at age 5 to cancer. According to one of the search warrants, a tipster told police that Zahra had been at a North Carolina home with two men and one of the men said ""he had done something very bad and needed to leave town."" One of the men was associated with Zahra's stepmother but was not Zahra's father, the tipster said. The tipster also told police that Zahra had been raped by both men and that she had blood on her private area and legs, the search warrant said. The tipster told police that he got the information about the alleged rape from a friend who was told about it from his sister. Police went to the home to see if they could confirm the fourth-hand information and found a mattress at the side of the house that ""had a large dark stain in the middle,"" the search warrant said. The tipster said the men did not admit to killing the girl but did say that they ""might have hit her in the head,"" the search warrant said. Police were also told by an attorney for Elisa Baker that the girl was dismembered. In one search warrant, dated October 27, police say they were looking for ""latex gloves used while the body of Zahra Baker was dismembered."" They also were searching for ""white trash bags used to store body parts,"" the warrant said. In that warrant, police were seeking to search the Hickory home that Zahra lived in with her stepmother and father Adam Troy Baker. No one has been charged in the girl's death. Elisa Baker has been arrested on an obstruction charge after police said she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home in Hickory. Besides an obstruction of justice charge for the ransom note, she is accused of writing worthless checks. Police have said she has been cooperating with investigators, including going with them to a search site. Adam Troy Baker was arrested in late October in nearby Catawba County on eight charges: five counts of writing bad checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Authorities said the charges were unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, and he was later released on bail.","Police say they searched for items used to dismember Zahra at the home where she lived .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- In his latest run-in with the law, rap music mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was arrested at a suburban Los Angeles outdoor shopping mall for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation. Sgt. Shawn Ruda of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said that police deputies spotted Knight late Friday as he was leaving a restaurant in the Universal CityWalk complex of shops, movie theaters and dining areas, which is located about nine miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. At the time, the co-founder of Death Row Records had a warrant issued for him because he hadn't showed up in court. Knight consented to go with police to the sheriff's department's West Hollywood station, Ruda said. There, the 45-year-old was booked and issued a citation to appear in court again on the traffic violation. The whole process took about an hour, according to Ruda. The sheriff's department did not elaborate on the nature of the traffic violation. Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding his record label in 1991 and bringing in such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was in Las Vegas with Shakur in 1996 when the chart-topping rapper was shot to death. Shortly thereafter, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time, along with Shakur's death, public feuds between Knight and some rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and others, contributed to the label's ultimate demise and bankruptcy proceedings in 2006. Last May, Los Angeles police arrested Knight after they say he pointed a gun at a man outside the city. He was charged then with assault with a deadly weapon involving a firearm and with driving under a suspended license, said the Los Angeles Police Department. His lawyer told CNN that Knight was ""100 percent innocent.""","Marion ""Suge"" Knight was arrested late Friday at a suburban L.A. shopping mall .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- No matter what daily newspaper you picked up in Pakistan on Thursday, the headline was on the fallout from the WikiLeaks cables. ""WikiLeaks throws tons of dirt, shame on Pak players,"" read the front page of the English daily The News. The headline on Dawn news said: ""WikiLeaks bombs rock Islamabad."" Pakistani newspapers devoted much of their coverage to the leaked cables that revealed intense mistrust between Washington and Islamabad and deep rifts among Pakistan's most powerful figures, whose statements behind closed doors didn't always match what they said in public. ""These intimate details reveal that relations between Pakistan and the US on the one hand and between top politicians of the country on the other hand are based on total hypocrisy and shamelessness and no one is sincere to any one, neither can anyone be trusted, whether speaking publicly or privately,"" read a column in The News. A column in Dawn news said this: ""That the former top American diplomat in Pakistan thinks the US policy towards this country risks destabilizing` the Pakistani state is, quite frankly, extraordinary. It goes to the heart of the tensions between the two countries, where Pakistan has, sometimes legitimately, though often unfairly, been labeled as a duplicitous and unreliable partner."" ""With such leadership, both political and military, Pakistan's future is really bleak. Whom should we trust? Who is free from the US influence? Can we become a sovereign nation? Can we take our own decisions? Why do we have more faith in Washington than in God?"" read another column in The News. If Pakistanis ran out of columns to read about the leaked cables, there was plenty of television to watch. Coverage of the WikiLeaks dumps dominated Pakistan's dozens of news channels where anchors unleashed sneers and jeers.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials at the Pentagon and State Department denied Friday knowing of any efforts to take down the WikiLeaks website or asking companies to do so. The site's efforts to publish 250,000 diplomatic cables has been hampered by denial-of-service attacks, ejection from its server host and cancellation of its name by its American domain name provider. Each time WikiLeaks has worked out other arrangements to bring the site back online. In written answers to readers' questions posted on the website of the British newspaper The Guardian, WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange alleged ""abusive elements of the United States government"" were behind the site's technical problems. A State Department spokesman disputed that the U.S. government was involved. ""I am not aware of any conversations by the United States government with either any internet host here or any government over there at this point,"" said spokesman P.J. Crowley. A Defense Department official also denied causing the technical problems slowing the WikiLeaks release of secret U.S. government documents. ""I am not aware that the Department of Defense is behind any of the problems that WikiLeaks is experiencing,"" Col. Dave Lapan, Pentagon spokesman, said Friday. ""We are not aware of what is causing the problems that WikiLeaks is experiencing."" Lapan said the military's Cyber Command has both defensive and offensive capabilities but is limited where and how it can operate. ""Cyber Command is to protect DoD networks,"" Lapan said at an off-camera question session with journalists. ""There are other agencies of the U.S. government that get involved in the commercial side. So there are certainly legal and other boundaries that would have to be considered."" The Pentagon's top spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said earlier this week that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates does not want to use the Pentagon's online resources to go after WikiLeaks because the impact of the documents being published is not severe enough to warrant it. The United States is trying to track where WikiLeaks is publishing from, Crowley said. ""What we are doing is, we are tracking where these documents are emerging from.

"(CNN) -- The search for a 3-year-old Alabama boy began just weeks ago, but police now say that no one had seen him since March -- around when, they believe, he was killed by one or two of his parents. John Joseph DeBlase, Heather Keaton and Natalie -- the father, stepmother and 4-year-old sister, respectively, of Jonathan DeBlase -- continued to live in Mobile's Peach Place apartments for months after the boy's presumed death, Mobile police Officer Christopher Levy said Monday. They didn't leave until the summer, after Natalie was last spotted in June -- when police now think she was killed, according to Levy. Still, the search for the two children, whose bodies haven't been found, didn't begin until November 19. ""It's really terrible, as if nobody really cared,"" Levy said of the time that transpired between the sightings and launch of the search. ""That's  what we can't seem to understand at this point."" Both John DeBlase and Keaton are now in custody, and blaming each other for the siblings' deaths. The search for their bodies, meanwhile, continues. Mobile Police Chief Micheal T. Williams told HLN's Nancy Grace on Monday that the father ""gave us an indication of where the two children buried,"" leading to searches for their bodies at two locations over the weekend. ""Our hearts are broken, because these two beautiful children are missing and presumed to be dead,"" Williams said. ""We will continue our searches until we locate the bodies and they are properly buried."" This weekend, authorities started looking in a rural 12-mile swath in southeastern Mississippi, about one hour's drive from Mobile. ""They think that somehow, maybe, one of the children may have been brought here and dumped,"" said Jackson County, Mississippi, Sheriff Mike Byrd. ""But we're not really sure where to look."" Byrd said that he believes that John DeBlase wanted to bury one of the children with a shovel, but tossed the body instead because the ground was too hard. Searchers, some with cadaver dogs, have looked on the sides of nearby roads and in a wooded area. Police have also searched for the children's bodies in Citronelle, about 33 miles north of Mobile, according to CNN affiliate WKRG. The investigation kicked off November 18, when Keaton told Louisville, Kentucky, police that she needed protection from DeBlase, who she claimed was ""holding (her) against my will."" According to the domestic violence petition, signed Heather L. Leavell-Keaton, she said, ""I feel he may have murdered his children, because he said they were non-responsive. He would not let me check on them."" She said John DeBlase  had told her ""choices were made ... and he had to do  what he had  to do."" Keaton herself was arrested last Tuesday, charged with two counts of willful abuse and neglect of a child. Three days later, Randall Melville -- who for two days had been hosting his long-time friend, John DeBlase -- called Santa Rosa County, Florida, police after hearing news reports about the children's disappearance, according to a report from the county sheriff's department. When Melville asked DeBlase about it, the children's father yelled, ""I didn't do it"" and left the home, the report said. Police eventually tracked down John DeBlase, who again asserted his innocence before his arrest Friday. He faces two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts  of abuse of a corpse -- the latter because, Levy said, of his ""disposing of the bodies in the woods."" On Monday, Mobile County District Court Judge Charles McKnight set bail for DeBlase at $206,000 -- $100,000 each for the child abuse charges, and $3,000 apiece for the corpse abuse counts -- reported CNN affiliate WALA. Prosecutors had asked for no bail, given the severity of the crime and saying DeBlase was a flight risk given that he stayed in homeless shelters to avoid being caught. John DeBlase and Keaton had one infant daughter together, according to Keaton's account in the Kentucky police report. Police said one reason Keaton claimed she needed protection from DeBlase was that she feared for the safety of the infant, who was with Keaton in Kentucky. Levy said the two slain children's biological mother lives in Mobile, but she did not have custody ""because, at the time, she didn't have a place to live."" People in and around Mobile, meanwhile, are mourning the loss of the two youngsters. ""We're just heartbroken,"" said Creighton Hobbes, a family friend. ""We miss them. We want to see their little faces... We wanted them back around Christmas."" CNN's Andy Rose and Natisha Lance contributed to this report.","NEW: The Mobile, Alabama, police chief vows the search for the siblings' bodies goes on .

"Editor's Note: Josef Sorett, Ph.D. is an assistant professor of religion and African-American studies at Columbia University. He is an interdisciplinary historian of religion in America with a focus on black communities and cultures in the United States. His research and teaching interests include American religious history, African American religions, hip hop, popular culture and the arts. I'm lucky enough to have a job that requires me to think, read, write, teach and speak about the intersections of religion, entertainment and popular culture in American society. However, long before I began work as a college professor, I attended a church that placed as much emphasis on entertainment as instilling faith. There was a shared sense that the latter goal (i.e. instilling faith) depended upon an ability to perform the former task (i.e. entertaining). I vividly recall the Sunday in 1985 my father took me to the church bookstore after service to purchase a copy of the first Christian rap CD, ""Bible Break"" by Stephen Wiley, an Oklahoma-based youth minister/rapper who became a recurring guest at my church's annual youth retreats. By all accounts, my youth leaders sought to ""keep it real"" even as their real goal was to keep us ""saved."" By no means is ""Bible Break"" great music, but it is certainly memorable. I still can recite its lyrics almost verbatim. These memories inspire much of my current work. I had the opportunity to interview Wiley while writing my dissertation. He shared with me the story of a church where an actual fist-fight broke out as leaders were debating whether to allow him to rap in their pulpit. In dramatic fashion Wiley's experience reveals the common belief that faith and popular culture are (or should be) diametrically opposed. Black churches have always been a place where people have come to sway, to dance, to shout and -- value judgments aside -- to be entertained. To be moved by the Spirit. And sometimes not. In short, there are multiple layers of meaning at the source of what brings folks into ""the House of the Lord."" Churches were the first independent black institutions. They were a place for both worship and politics. In addition to serving as arbiters of things spiritual and political, church was also a space of pleasure and play: a theater, a concert stage and a dance hall. Many prominent black cultural institutions and artists began in churches. The Dance Theater of Harlem and the Harlem School of the Arts both held their first practices in churches. American music legends Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin began their careers in the church, as did contemporary artists Fantasia Barrino and John Legend. To this day, a common thought is that all black entertainers come out of the church. Yet few acknowledge that the church was and is a source and site of entertainment. In today's tabloid-driven, scandal-obsessed celebrity culture, people are reluctant to reconcile the seriousness of a ""Hallelujah!"" with the sensationalism, sensuality and sometimes downright silliness of Hollywood. The writer Rudolph Fisher captured this phenomenon well in a short story that appeared in what is considered the bible of the Harlem Renaissance, Alain Locke's 1925 anthology ""The New Negro."" Fisher tells a tale of two young men in 1920s Upper Manhattan. Debating whether or not to attend a local revival, one of the men ended their exchange as follows: . ""Ought to be a pretty good show when some o' them old-time sisters get happy. Too early for the cabarets; let's go in a while, just for the hell of it... Somethin' funny's bound to happen. You might even get religion."" Clearly, for these men, a revival was as much about pleasure as it was about the promise of salvation. To be sure, this illustration fails to capture all of the many motivations that fill church pews. Yet it suggests that recreation and religion are fundamentally intertwined. Fisher's Harlem, of course, holds a special place in African-American cultural history. Yet his stories are not solely about race or place. Rather, they show black churches to be exceptional even as they are quintessentially American. Recent public debates around black liberation theology often portray black churches as occupying an alternative universe. African-American Christians breathe the same cultural and political air as their churchgoing brothers and sisters of other races. This is perhaps no more clear than in the realm of aesthetics. Most of the fastest growing black churches have adopted the praise and worship format that has long been popular in white evangelical and charismatic congregations. A prime case of this is Byron Cage's ""Breathe,"" a remake of the Hillsong standard, ""This is the Air I Breathe."" More generally, the history of entertainment in the United States cannot be told without holding a special place for protestant Christianity. This is especially the case for American evangelicalism, beginning with the Great Awakenings tremendous revivals of the 18th and 19th centuries, which facilitated the first large-scale embrace of the Christian gospel by African-Americans. In the 20th century, one recalls figures like Oral Roberts, Kathryn Kuhlman and Frederick ""Rev. Ike"" Eikerenkoetter, the list goes on ad infinitum in black and white. These preachers possessed a powerful stage presence. Each was also a media personality with a popular radio and/or television show. Theirs is the same history that helped produce a tradition of black religious broadcasters from J.M. Gates, Lucy Smith and Clarence Cobb to Cartlon Pearson, TD Jakes and Juanita Bynum. Before Juanita Bynum's popular ""No More Sheets"" DVD or Eddie Long's ""Taking Authority"" network, there was Frederick K.C. Price's ""Ever Increasing Faith"" weekly television program. And long before these three there was Elder Solomon Lightfoot Michaux's ""Happy Am I"" radio show. In addition to preachers and their sermons, there is sacred music from Thomas Dorsey's gospel blues to the holy hip hop of the cross movement. There is film: Oscar Micheaux's ""Within Our Gates"" (1919) to Jakes' ""Woman Thou Art Loosed,"" (2004). And there is theater: Langston Hughes' ""Black Nativity,"" to Tyler Perry's ""I Know I've Been Changed"". Perry's plays, movies and sitcoms always offer dramatic morality tales, and they are never short on the rich biblical rhetoric of the black Christian vernacular. The appeal of these clerics and religious celebrities is attributable as much to their entertainment value and media savvy as it is to their spiritual acumen. Collectively, they comprise a veritable black Christian culture industry, complete with countless commodities and commercial opportunities. This is not meant to question the authenticity of any minister or ministry. Rather, it points to the evolving interplay between churches and the matrices of markets, media and culture, a complex set of networks that includes the arts and literature, television and digital technologies, music and movies, fashion and finance. Black churches continue to provide a place where African-Americans go to pray and receive prayer. To hear and to speak ""the word."" To fellowship and to feel the Spirit. And, ultimately, to feel their best, right in the here and now. This is, and always has been, the story of the black church.","Josef Sorett: There is a belief that faith and popular culture are diametrically opposed .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is looking forward to the chance to immediately win back his world No. 1 golf ranking at this week's WGC-HSBC Champions event in China. The American returns to action on Thursday for his first outing since the Ryder Cup in early October, having seen Englishman Lee Westwood end his 281-week reign on Sunday. Woods, No. 3 Martin Kaymer and defending champion Phil Mickelson can all claim top spot in Shanghai this weekend. ""To be number one in the world you have to win regularly, and I haven't done that lately,"" Woods told reporters. ""As in every event I play, I'm here trying to win. ""If ever there was an event that deserved to be the first Asian tournament to impact the top of the world rankings, this is the one. I've referred to it before as the crowning jewel of Asian golf."" After the $7 million event at Sheshan International, where Woods was sixth last year, the 34-year-old will head to Bangkok for a skins tournament celebrating the 84th birthday of the King of Thailand -- the country where his mother was born. The 14-time major winner will defend his Australian Masters title in Melbourne from November 11-14, and then end his season as playing host of the Chevron World Challenge in California in early December. ""I've got three more events this year, and hopefully I can end on a good note,"" said Woods, who has not won a title this year following his marital problems and injuries. ""I'm really looking forward to these events and, hopefully, they will spearhead into a better 2011."" Mickelson, who also won in Shanghai in 2007, believes any player in the 78-man field can win this year's title in the sixth staging of the tournament. ""There are very, very few events each year that have the strength in depth of the HSBC Champions. Every player in the field has the talent and the experience to win; it's a field of winners,"" the American said. ""Everyone wants to be number one in the world but the only way to get there is to win tournaments, and the HSBC is a big tournament, a great opportunity to advance."" The 40-year-old, who won his third Masters title in April but then blew several chances to topple Woods from the No. 1 spot, is paired with Westwood and 2006 champion Y.E. Yang for the first two rounds. Woods will play with U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell and former No. 1 Ernie Els, while U.S. PGA winner Kaymer was drawn with U.S. Ryder Cup adversary Hunter Mahan and England's Paul Casey.","Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Martin Kaymer can topple new golf No. 1 Lee Westwood .

"(CNN) -- There's one thing Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul and his Democratic opponent Jack Conway have in common: They're both finished talking about ""Aqua Buddha."" Conway's controversial attack ad paralyzed both campaigns this week. The spot accuses Paul of once belonging to a group that mocked religion in his college days at Baylor University. The ad features a claim from an anonymous woman who told The Washington Post and GQ magazine that Paul's group forced her to pray to a false idol named Aqua Buddha. At a news conference at the Atlas Machine and Supply factory outside of Louisville, Kentucky, Paul signed a pledge to repeal the estate tax, dubbed the ""death tax"" by conservatives. But most of the questions from reporters were focused on the Aqua Buddha controversy. In a brief interview with CNN, the Tea Party-backed Republican rejected the ad's allegations and slammed Conway for running it. ""I think he ought to be ashamed of himself,"" Paul said. ""In my entire life, I've written and said a lot of things. I've never said or written anything un-Christian in my life."" Answering only a few questions, Paul walked away from the interview. Paul's campaign told CNN on Friday that he will take part in a debate Monday night. He had previously threatened to pull out after Conway raised the Aqua Buddha issue. Conway also resisted questions about the ad at his own campaign events this week. The Democratic candidate and the state's current attorney general now plans to run more issue-oriented spots in the final days of the campaign, letting the Aqua Buddha ad ""run its course."" He still defends the commercial. ""I'm not questioning Rand Paul's faith. I'm questioning his actions,"" Conway said. But some of Conway's own supporters in the state have questioned the wisdom of running the ad. Conway backer and Christian County Judge Executive Steve Tribble told CNN, ""I might not have done it."" Tribble said he understood why Conway ran the spot, noting Paul has said ""some strange things."" A critic of the bank bailouts but a supporter of the new health care law, Conway is running in a state where President Obama is deeply unpopular. He's opted to campaign with former President Bill Clinton instead of Obama. When asked about his reluctance to have the current president at his side, Conway said, ""This campaign's about me versus Rand Paul."" Conway's latest line of attack is that Paul once indicated his support for scrapping the income tax, in favor of what conservatives call the ""fair tax."" It's essentially a 23 percent national sales tax on all purchases. Paul told CNN he's open to the idea but not sold on it. ""I've always said I'll support any tax reform that lowers taxes on everyone. So that's sort of the rule of thumb that would have to be. And that simplifies the tax code. That might be one of the alternatives. So would be a flatter income tax,"" Paul said. Paul has granted few national media interviews since he won the Republican primary in Kentucky earlier this year. In the days following that surprise victory, Paul's libertarian views came under scrutiny after he raised questions about the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Paul never imagined his behavior in college would be fair game. At his news conference, he said the Aqua Buddha ad would discourage future candidates from running for political office. ""Do we want to have a religious test in our country?"" he asked.","NEW: Rand Paul says he'll take part in a Monday night debate that he'd threatened to pull out of .

"(CNN) -- Richard Branson was born in 1950 and educated at Stowe School. It was here that he began to set up Student Magazine when he was just 16. By 17 he'd also set up Student Advisory Centre, which was a charity to help young people. In 1970 he founded Virgin as a mail order record retailer, and not long after he opened a record shop in Oxford Street, London. During 1972 a recording studio was built in Oxfordshire, and the first Virgin artist, Mike Oldfield, recorded ""Tubular Bells"" which was released in 1973. This album went on to sell over 5 million copies. Since then many household names, including Belinda Carlisle, Genesis, Phil Collins, Janet Jackson and The Rolling Stones have helped to make Virgin Music one of the top six record companies in the world. Branson formed Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984, and it is now the second largest British long haul international airline and operates a fleet of Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 aircraft to locations including New York, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and Tokyo. During 1997 Virgin took over Britain's two most run-down rail franchises, CrossCountry and the West Coast Main Line. In addition to his own business activities, Branson is a trustee of several charities including the Virgin Healthcare Foundation, a leading healthcare charity which was responsible for the launch of a health education campaign relating to AIDS in 1987. The Foundation has also become involved in a lobbying campaign called Parents Against Tobacco, which aims to restrict tobacco advertising and sponsorship in sport. His help in the initial funding of charity projects helped that organization to raise over £100 million ($200 million), through campaigns such as Comic Relief and many other charities. To keep his adrenaline levels high, Richard has been involved in a number of world record-breaking attempts since 1985. In 1986 his boat, ""Virgin Atlantic Challenger II"" rekindled the spirit of the Blue Riband by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in the fastest ever recorded time. This was followed a year later by the epic hot air balloon crossing of the same ocean in ""Virgin Atlantic Flyer."" This was not only the first hot-air balloon to cross the Atlantic, but was the largest ever flown at 2.3 million cubic feet capacity, reaching speeds in excess of 130 miles per hour (209 km/h). Still after the ultimate adventure, in January 1991 Richard crossed the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Arctic Canada, the furthest distance of 6,700 miles. Again, he broke all existing records, with speeds of up to 245 miles -per hour in a balloon of 2.6 million cubic feet.

"(CNN) -- Citizens of the Ivory Coast headed to the polls Sunday for a repeatedly delayed presidential election -- the first in a decade for the top cocoa-producing west African nation. The election pits incumbent Laurent Gbagbo against 13 challengers, including opposition leaders Henri Bedie and Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara, a former economist for the International Monetary Fund, was banned from previous races. Bedie is seeking a comeback after being ousted in a 1999 coup. The election also features the nation's first female presidential candidate, Jacquline Oble, who was the youngest minister in the previous Cabinet. The Ivory Coast was once one of Africa's success stories, but a 2002 civil war plunged the nation into political instability. Analysts hope the election, which has been delayed for five years, will bring lasting peace. U.S. envoys applauded the final election date after years of delay. ""The United States is convinced that credible elections are key to resolving Cote d'Ivoire's decade-long crisis and are central to political reconciliation and creating conditions that will result in good governance and economic development,"" the U.S. Embassy in Abidjan said in a statement. ""Political stability and the rule of law are vital building blocks for a prosperous and sustainable future."" The United Nations said it has bolstered its 8,650 troops already there amid reports that local rebels are threatening to disrupt the election. U.S. President Barack Obama said the nation's citizens are entitled to a fair election. ""The Ivoirian government, the candidates, their supporters, and all political  actors have an obligation to ensure that the long-delayed presidential elections  are held in a peaceful and transparent manner,"" Obama said Thursday. If there's no clear winner, a runoff will be held on November 28, the United Nations said. The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa bean producer, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","The election pits incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo against 13 challengers .

"(CNN) -- ""If 'don't ask, don't tell' is repealed and you are assigned to bathroom facilities (that have)] an open bay shower that someone you believe to be a gay or lesbian service member also used, which are you most likely to do?""  -- Question on 2010 Department of Defense Comprehensive Review Survey of Uniformed Active Duty and Reserve Service Members* . It seems that ensuring shower security for American soldiers and Marines is critical to maintaining our global military pre-eminence. If our brave men and women cannot comfortably bathe in environments free from the risk of homosexual lust, how can we expect them to battle armed Taliban insurgents and other enemies? In order to assess the gay shower hazard and other threats to military readiness if the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy were repealed, the Department of Defense surveyed American troops over the summer. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, found the results reassuring. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ""Repeal of the law will not prove an unacceptable risk to military readiness. ... I believe our troops and their families are ready for this,"" although he acknowledged, ""some soldiers and Marines may want separate shower facilities."" Sen. John McCain, despite having promised in 2006 to respect the judgment of military leaders, disputed the results of the survey. He questioned whether the sample size was representative and noted that soldiers and Marines in combat units were especially concerned about the effects of repeal. Insisting that ""one of our highest responsibilities is to the men and women of our armed services,"" the Senate's self-declared straight-talker demurred, ""it may be premature to make such a change at this time and in this manner, without further consideration of this report and further study of the issue by Congress."" While the government certainly has profound responsibilities to the men and women of our armed services, it is not clear why the precise breakdown of their opinions on ""don't ask, don't tell"" matters one whit when assessing whether gays and lesbians are permitted to serve with them. When President Harry Truman ordered the armed forces to integrate in 1948, he did not first commission a survey asking white soldiers what they would do if they had to share a shower bay with a black soldier. If he had, the response in an era of segregated bathrooms would have been unenthusiastic to say the least. There had been some 1940s military surveys about integrating the armed forces; they showed that opposition by white soldiers ran as high as 80 percent. But as Truman knew, civil rights are not a matter of popular opinion. ""Whereas it is essential that there be maintained in the armed services of the United States the highest standards of democracy,"" he wrote in the executive order, ""there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin."" Of course, most of those who support the military's prohibitions against gays and lesbians reject the analogy. They do not believe that America's servicemen and women deserve equality of treatment without regard to sexual orientation. But if gays and lesbians have no right to equality of treatment, why bother with surveys at all? The military could just bar them from serving, as it used to. Or they could even take the matter to the logical extreme by emulating the old racist segregationists. If sexual orientation is not a civil rights issue, why not create segregated units? Gays and lesbians could have their own barracks, their own ships and their own shower bays. They could even design their own uniforms, adding to those dull dress whites with optional leather pants, fishnets and sequined cocktail dresses. Not only would segregated units aid military recruitment, they would boost morale among the straight troops by siphoning now-closeted gay and lesbian troops into the new homosexual units. Straight soldiers and Marines would no longer have to worry about being surreptitiously ogled in the shower by gays and lesbians pretending to be straight, so they would be able to battle Taliban insurgents with even more unity and effectiveness. There is one potential problem. Because of a shortage of homosexual officers, straight officers would have to lead homosexual units until new gay and lesbian officers could be trained This might cause morale problems among the straight officers. Fortunately, officers are likely to have private showers, avoiding at least one problem. They could also be selected from among those who indicated that if they were assigned to a shower bay with gays or lesbians, they could choose the answer: ""Take no action."" Other than the officers and the uniforms, the homosexual units would be equal in every way to the straight units: separate but equal. It's a perfect solution. Unless, that is, sexual orientation is a civil rights issue after all. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolraich. *Answers: 1) Take no action 2) Discuss how we expect each other to behave and conduct ourselves while sharing a room, berth or field tent 3) Talk to a chaplain, mentor, or leader about how to handle the situation 4) Talk to a leader to see if I have other options 5) Something else 6) Don't know .","Michael Wolraich: Military asked troops what they feel about sharing showers with gays .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in the Tamaulipas state attorney general's office gave conflicting information Monday over whether authorities are pursuing a pair of suspects in the case of a U.S. citizen who disappeared during a sightseeing trip on the U.S.-Mexican border in South Texas. While Luis Homero Uvalle, a spokesman for the office, told CNN the suspects are two brothers who are ""well known to this area"" -- identifying them only as ""El 27"" and ""El 31"" -- Ruben Dario-Rios, the chief spokesman for the attorney general said, ""We have nothing official about suspects in the disappearance of David Hartley. I do not know where that is coming from."" Dario-Rios said the lead investigator, Rolando Flores, has not indicated that there are suspects. David Michael Hartley went missing September 30. His wife, Tiffany, told authorities her husband was shot and killed during a sightseeing trip on Falcon Lake, which bisects the international border. On Monday, Tiffany Hartley, along with David Hartley's mother, Pam, appeared on several morning talk shows asking for information that will help investigators find those responsible for David's death and find his body. ""Until we have him back, it's not final,"" Tiffany Hartley said on NBC's ""The Today Show."" On Sunday, the U.S. Border Patrol, the Coast Guard, and Parks and Wildlife officials were back on the U.S. side of the lake searching for new evidence in the case, Gonzales said. Mexican authorities were searching their side of the lake as well, he said. Authorities from both nations are conducting separate searches and are coordinating and holding regular meetings, State Department spokeswoman Virginia Staab said. But because the disappearance happened on the Mexican side of the border, the United States cannot prosecute or make arrests in the case, the sheriff said. Tiffany Hartley was on several CNN shows Thursday recounting what happened on Falcon Lake. She also talked about her feelings about people doubting her account of the alleged attack. Hartley said on HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell' that ""I know what I know."" ""As long as I know the truth, God knows the truth,"" she added. ""And other than that, it almost doesn't really matter to me, because I know what happened that day."" Falcon Lake is on the Rio Grande in Zapata and Starr counties in South Texas.

"Washington (CNN) -- Voters have given Republicans a mandate to cut government and roll back the Obama administration's health care ""monstrosity"" in the next Congress, the incoming speaker of the House of Representatives said Wednesday. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, is poised to lead the House following the GOP's massive gains in Tuesday's midterm elections. He told reporters that he and President Barack Obama have agreed to work together but called the results a vote for ""a smaller, less costly, more accountable government."" And the administration's hard-won overhaul of the U.S. health care system ultimately will be on the block. ""The American people are concerned about the government takeover of health care,"" Boehner said. ""I think it's important for us to lay the groundwork before we begin to repeal this monstrosity and replace it with common-sense reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance in America."" For his part, Obama blamed the anemic economy for the ""shellacking"" his fellow Democrats experienced, but he acknowledged that his policies hadn't done enough to bring down high unemployment. His administration has ""stabilized"" the economy and spurred private-sector hiring, ""but people all across America aren't feeling that progress,"" Obama said. ""I've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make,"" Obama said. The president faced reporters a day after voters replaced at least 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives, handing control of the chamber to the Republicans for the first time since 2006, according to CNN projections. In the Senate, Democrats lost at least six seats but retained control of the chamber, according to the projections based on analysis of exit polling. In the latest result, Democratic incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado defeated Tea Party-backed Republican Ken Buck, CNN projected on Wednesday. Asked about claims by Republicans, especially Tea Party conservatives, that his policies are taking the country in the wrong direction, Obama cited the economy's reversal from monthly job losses to private sector job growth since he took office as proof that things were improving. But he also conceded, in reference to an auto-related campaign analogy, that the argument could be made that ""we're stuck in neutral."" Obama said he's looking at ""all ideas that are on the table"" to boost economic growth after the deepest recession since the 1930s and won't dismiss any proposal ""because they're Democrat or Republican."" At the same time, Obama said, it would be a ""misreading"" of the election results if anyone believed that the American people want to spend the next two years trying to ""relitigate"" his administration's overhaul of health care or other major legislation of his first two years in office. Republicans throughout the campaign blasted Obama's signature health care overhaul, the Affordable Care Act, after voting all but unanimously against it in Congress. Obama called the process of passing the bill ""an ugly mess"" and ""something that I regret"" but added: ""The outcome was a good one."" The health care law, parts of which are just taking effect, requires Americans to buy health insurance, provides subsidies to bring down the cost of those policies and bars insurers from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions. Despite the stated goal of Boehner and other Republicans to repeal the health care bill, the Democratic majority in the Senate makes it unlikely that will happen. More likely is legislative gridlock on health care and other issues, with the GOP-led House pushing for spending cuts, deregulation and other measures that will die in the Democratic-controlled Senate. In Tuesday's vote, Democrats were battered by an economy that is still struggling to create jobs, with unemployment at 9.6 percent, and an energized conservative electorate fueled by the anti-establishment Tea Party movement that emerged in 2009. Exit polling showed voter dissatisfaction with both parties, as each received a 53 percent unfavorable rating. Michael Steele, the head of the Republican National Committee, said Republicans were humbled by the opportunity for ""a second chance"" at power. ""I heard that all across the country, people saying, you know, 'you guys better not screw this up, because you're next on the list if you do,' "" Steele said. Obama called both Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, late Tuesday to offer his congratulations. On Wednesday, he called for unity and an ""honest and civil debate."" ""What yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here, that we must find common ground in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges,"" the president said. But McConnell, who led repeated filibusters of Obama administration efforts in the Senate over the past two years, told reporters that voters were rewarding GOP opposition. ""It seems to me the best strategy for the other side would be to listen to the voters yesterday,"" he said. ""They made a clear statement about what they'd like to see done. If the president comes in our direction, obviously we want to make progress for the country over the next two years."" Andrew Card, who was White House chief of staff under former President George W. Bush, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that it was Obama's responsibility ""to take the wake-up call that came yesterday."" The rise of the Tea Party movement added a new element to the election cycle, roiling Republican races by boosting little-known and inexperienced candidates to victory over mainstream figures in GOP primaries across the country. ""I don't think there's any question that if it were not for the Tea Party, the Republican margin in the House of Representatives would not be as high as it's going to be,"" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said Tuesday night. ""They gave a lot of enthusiasm and fuel to the Republican Party."" Tea Party-backed Republicans Rand Paul in Kentucky and Marco Rubio in Florida won their Senate races, according to the projections, but other candidates backed by the group lost key Senate races, including Sharron Angle to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada, Buck to Bennet in Colorado and Christine O'Donnell to previously unknown Democrat Chris Coons in Delaware. Republican candidates were strong in governors' races, with at least 10 gubernatorial seats switching from Democrats to Republicans, CNN projected. Often overshadowed during midterm campaigns, governorships can affect national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates. Conservative candidates also made strong gains in state legislatures. The Republican State Leadership Committee estimated that at least 16 state legislative chambers had moved from Democratic to Republican control in Tuesday's voting. Those changes have the potential to reverberate far beyond the state level. By seizing control of legislative chambers in several key states, the GOP significantly strengthened its hand heading into what promises to be contentious congressional redistricting process, where legislatures decide how congressional districts are drawn. That can mean the difference between an incumbent having an easy path to re-election -- or seeing his or her district drawn out of existence altogether. The long and bitter campaign season drew more than $3.5 billion in spending, making it the most expensive nonpresidential vote ever, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. The economy was rated the most important issue by 62 percent of voters, far eclipsing health care reform (19 percent), immigration (8 percent) and the war in Afghanistan (7 percent), according to the exit polling. Most voters, 88 percent, rated economic conditions as not good or poor, and 86 percent said they were very worried or somewhat worried about the economy, the exit polling showed. High unemployment amid a slow recovery from economic recession has been a dominant issue, with Republicans accusing Obama and the Democrats of pushing through expensive policies that have expanded government without solving the problem. Obama has led Democrats in defending his record, saying that steps such as the economic stimulus bill and auto industry bailout were necessary to prevent a depression, while health care reform and Wall Street reform will lay the foundation for sustainable future growth.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Attackers in Pakistan have hit another convoy carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan, killing one person, authorities said. The attack, which occurred Monday, was the fourth attack in as many days on convoys carrying fuel to support the NATO forces. Gunmen fired on a convoy of oil tankers in the Kalat district of Pakistan's western Balochistan province, said Bashir Ahmed, a police official in Kalat. One person died, police said. Attackers struck two convoys on Friday and a third on Sunday. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for two of those attacks, a central spokesman for the militant group told CNN by telephone Monday. One of the attacks took place Friday against a convoy of NATO supplies near Shikarpur in the southern Sindh province. The other took place Sunday in the capital of Islamabad, killing three local guards. Azam Tariq, the Pakistani Taliban spokesman, said both the recent attacks on NATO supply efforts were carried out as revenge for drone strikes and NATO's attacks in Pakistan. ""U.S. and NATO forces are killing innocent Pakistanis, which is unacceptable, and we will teach them a lesson by such attacks,"" Tariq said. On Monday, Islamabad police said four people were arrested in connection with the Sunday attack, which also left eight drivers injured. A convoy was attacked in Baluchistan on Friday, killing a driver and his aide. The Taliban has not claimed responsibility for that attack. The convoys are operated by contracting Pakistani logistics firms, using local trucks and drivers. The Pakistani Taliban said a special squad has been appointed to hit U.S. interests in Pakistan, especially NATO supply efforts. ""The special squad is fully capable to cut off the route for NATO supplies by carrying attacks on the trucks,"" Tariq said. ""I give final warning to the drivers and the owners of the trucks to stop working for NATO, otherwise our squad will make them exemplary,"" Tariq said. Pakistan halted NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan Thursday after officials blamed cross-border NATO helicopter fire for the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers. The troops were killed when three NATO helicopters crossed from Afghanistan into Pakistani airspace early Thursday and attacked a military outpost, the government said. On Monday, NATO's secretary general said an investigation has been launched into the incident. ""I expressed my regret for the incident last week in which Pakistani soldiers lost their lives, and my condolences to the families. Obviously, it was unintended. Obviously, we have to make sure we improve coordination between our militaries and our Pakistani partners,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said he expects findings of a NATO probe into the Pakistan incident to be released Wednesday night. Morrell also said the U.S. military is hopeful that the closed supply route from Pakistan to Afghanistan will be opened ""as soon as possible,"" but the closure has not affected the ability to supply NATO troops. ""We are making progress on that front,"" Morrell said at a news conference on Tuesday, in reference to talking to Pakistan's government about reopening the Torkham gate. Morrell said that the fuel convoy attacks by the Taliban have affected about 1 percent of the supplies that move from Pakistan to Afghanistan. The route is most important for fuel transport but said even if the gate remained closed for a while, the ability to supply fuel to troops in Afghanistan would not be affected, he said. Journalists Nasir Habib, Nasir Dawar and Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","Attack on convoys carrying fuel for NATO troops was fourth in four days .

I don't think there's much doubt because of public opinion polls that Republicans are going to take over control of the House of Representatives. That's almost a foregone conclusion.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The world economy is placing a bet on its future with China, but some Chinese are placing bets on their future with plastic. In rebalancing the world economy, analysts have said U.S. citizens should take cues from the Chinese, where 40 cents of every dollar of disposable income is saved, compared to 3 cents of every dollar in the U.S. But there are worrying signs in China that some young consumers are starting to emulate the worst habits of U.S. consumers -- like 27-year-old Yuan Shuai in Beijing, whose credit card bets on his future have turned into overwhelming debts. In the last two years, he got seven cards from seven banks and wracked up $29,000 in debts. ""I spent money on eating and having fun,"" he said. ""That's all."" Unemployed and studying to be a taxi driver, Yuan now has debt collectors from banks turning to his father, Yuan Yizhong, for bill payment. ""The banks told me they could lend to him because he's an adult,"" his father says. ""Now they hold me responsible and threatened me."" With no laws for bankruptcy protection in China, those threats can be real. ""If you cannot pay it back you either have to go to parents or friends to pay back for you, or you got to jail,"" said Yeongwen Chiang, a consumer expert. Credit card issuance is up 32 percent in China in the past year, according to China Market Research and the National Bureau of Statistics. Credit card debt is up more than 130 percent to $838 million. That still pales compared to U.S. credit card debt, but the quick rise have some observers alarmed. With the decrease in exports during financial crisis, China has been working to build domestic consumption, offering subsidies on cars, home appliances and other big ticket items. That has helped China to continue to grow through the recession. During the October holiday week celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, Chinese poured $83 billion into the economy - a 20 percent increase in spending from the same holiday period last year. By comparison, retail spending in the United States fell 6 percent in September compared to the same time last year. But some of the increased spending in China is with money the consumers didn't have. In the first six months of this year, the number of Chinese consumer with credit card debts more than two months overdue rose 133 percent. For the Yuan family, credit card debt will take years to pay back. ""I have only one son, and he failed to live up to my expectations,"" Yuan's father said. CNN's Emily Chang, Fareed Zakaria and Kevin Voigt contributed to this report .","Although Chinese credit card debt is far behind the U.S., it's beginning to mount .
New credit cards jumped 32 percent the past year .
Chinese card debts more than two months overdue rose 133 percent this year ."
"(CNN) -- Paul Ivy will never forget his first time seeing ""Night of the Living Dead."" ""I was 12 years old and it was beyond cool to see zombies attacking those hapless people, smashing in windows and feasting on human flesh,"" iReporter Ivy remembered. ""No way would my real parents let me watch that sort of thing, but it was fine with my cool comic-shop-owning hippie other parents [those parents being Jay and Helen Knowles, parents of Ain't It Cool News founder Harry Knowles]."" Ever since that day in 1976, zombie movies were one of the Olympia, Washington resident's favorite genres. Like many fans, he holds the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" in high regard: ""Except for one silly scene involving bikers throwing pies at zombies, the whole movie has great dramatic tension and a genuine feeling of horror,"" he said. Ivy isn't alone. Zombies have undergone a renaissance in recent years, starting with the remake of ""Dawn"" in 2004, and last year's surprise hit horror-comedy ""Zombieland."" Not only that, but ""zombie walks"" have cropped up all over the world lately, and they're not just confined to events like San Diego Comic-Con in California. With vampires being all the rage -- with the ""Twilight"" movie series and also TV's ""True Blood"" and ""Vampire Diaries"" -- it seemed only natural that zombies would be next to get their own TV series. AMC, the home of Emmy darlings ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad,"" has decided to adapt the comic book series ""The Walking Dead,"" set to premiere Sunday, October 31, at 10 p.m. ET. Ask anyone who has read the series, about a comatose Southern police officer who wakes up in the midst of a zombie apocalypse, and almost all of them will rave about it. Thus, the expectations for the series are very high. AMC had an eye-catching display (a gruesome re-creation of a scene from the first episode) as part of their massive presence at Comic-Con. They also put on a zombie walk, which was expanded worldwide on Tuesday. And, of course, the show has reached out to fans on social media, giving them oodles of information on the show before its debut. So what is it that makes fans so excited about this particular take on zombies? ""I enjoy the mix of characters, with many different ages and races represented,"" Ivy said. ""They are a cross-section of people with varying skills, not a bunch of soldiers. They must come to grips with their new world and fight to survive in it."" ""I think people love the source material because no character is sacred, no character is safe, and anyone -- even the most beloved and innocent people in the comic -- could be killed at any moment,"" said Blair Butler, comic book expert for G4's ""Attack of the Show"" -- and one of many fans of the book's creator, Robert Kirkman. ""I hope the show manages to capture that sense of ever-present danger."" ""We're all big fans of the comics and have been reading them from the beginning,"" said Kyle Puttkammer of the Atlanta, Georgia, area ""Galactic Quest"" comic book stores. ""'Walking Dead' and Kirkman's other series, 'Invincible,' sells very well in both our stores because we recommend it often."" One of his employees even tried out to play a zombie on the show, which shoots on location in Atlanta. Robert Soto of Dallas, Texas, said the series got him back into reading comics after hearing so much about it: ""It did not disappoint. It was more than just zombies. The stories were about people. They have complex relationships and as a reader you really identify with them, which makes it difficult when those characters die."" Butler agrees that the humanity of the characters are what sets it apart. According to the books, ""human beings pushed to the limit -- people who have been reduced to their basest instincts to survive -- are far more terrifying than any zombie,"" she said. Those who have had a chance to see the show early are cautiously optimistic. ""The first episode should make any fan giddy,"" said iReporter Keith McDuffee of Cliqueclack.com. ""That's not to say that it's a shot-for-page remake of the first part of the series, but there's no doubt it's respectably faithful. In fact, I'd say the changes made in the first episode are for the better."" Praising the show's emphasis on humanity, not to mention its realistic makeup effects, Screenrant.com's Kofi Outlaw said it was ""that rare adaptation which enhances everything that is great about its literary source material."" So, the question remains: Will those who aren't as familiar with the comic book or who aren't already fans of the zombie genre tune in? One thing ""The Walking Dead"" most certainly is (as one might imagine), is extremely gory and violent. That would probably be tough for mass audiences, although it wasn't much of a problem for ""The Sopranos."" Whether the show will garner the same popularity or critical praise as ""Mad Men"" or ""True Blood"" remains to be seen. Either way, members of its devoted fan base already have their plans made for Halloween night.","New AMC series ""The Walking Dead"" has a passionate fan base .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans took voters' distress over the stubborn jobless rate and stalled economy and turned it into a sweeping takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives in Tuesday's midterm elections, while Democrats were able to hang onto their majority in the Senate, though in smaller numbers. With results still coming in, the extent of the Republican takeover of the 435-member House was still to be determined. But CNN projected that Republicans would win at least 60 more House seats than they currently hold to wipe out the Democratic majority of the past four years. President Barack Obama called House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio to congratulate him. They had a brief but pleasant conversation, according to Boehner's aides. The two discussed working together to focus on the top priorities of the American people, which Boehner has identified as creating jobs and cutting spending. Boehner thanked the president for the call. Republican candidates also were running strong in governors' races, while Democrats were guaranteed of holding at least 50 of the 100 Senate seats with a handful of close races still outstanding, according to the projections based on CNN's analysis of exit poll data. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, retained his Senate seat by defeating Republican Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite. An energized conservative electorate, fueled by the anti-establishment Tea Party movement that emerged in 2009, helped Republicans to what could be their biggest gain in congressional elections in decades. ""It's clear tonight who the real winners are, and it's the American people,"" said Boehner, who is expected to become House Speaker in January when the new GOP majority takes over. ""With their voices, the American people are demanding a new way forward in Washington,"" Boehner said, calling for conservative policies favored by the Tea Party such as cutting spending and reducing the size of government. Tea Party-backed Republicans Rand Paul in Kentucky and Marco Rubio in Florida won their Senate races, while another GOP candidate, John Boozman, will defeat incumbent Democrat Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas, according to the projections. In Indiana, conservative Republican Dan Coats was the projected winner to take over the Senate seat held by retiring Democrat Evan Bayh, while the GOP's Ron Johnson toppled Democratic incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold in Wisconsin. The projected victories by Coats, Boozman, Johnson and John Hoeven in North Dakota gave Republicans four pick-ups in the Senate. However, Democrat Chris Coons was the projected winner over Republican Christine O'Donnell, another Tea Party-supported candidate, in Delaware's Senate race for the seat formerly held for decades by Vice President Joe Biden. In Connecticut, Democratic Attorney General Richard Blumenthal will defeat Republican Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive, for the Senate seat held by retiring Democrat Chris Dodd. Another big Democratic victory came in West Virginia, where Gov. Joe Manchin was projected to win the Senate seat formerly held by the late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, who died earlier this year. The projected victories by Coons, Manchin and Blumenthal were vital for the Democrats' chances to retain their majority in the Senate. But Obama's former Senate seat in Illinois went to Republican Mark Kirk, who defeated Democrat Alexi Giannoulias. Whatever the final make-up of the Senate, it will include no African-American members. The only current African-American senator, Roland Burris of Illinois, is retiring, and none of the three African-American candidates won on Tuesday. Both Paul, the son of Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, and O'Donnell rode Tea Party support to defeat mainstream Republican candidates in their GOP primaries. Paul's projected victory to claim the seat held by retiring Republican Sen. Jim Bunning showed the influence of the movement that emerged in 2009 in opposition to expanded government and the growing federal deficit. At the same time, the loss by O'Donnell could badly hurt Republican chances to win majority control of the Senate. Many Republicans believed the veteran congressman whom O'Donnell beat in the primary, former Gov. Mike Castle, would have defeated Coons. Another Tea Party backed candidate, Republican Carl Paladino, will be handily defeated by Democrat Andrew Cuomo in the New York governor's race, the projections show. CNN projects Democrat Jerry Brown will defeat Republican Meg Whitman in California for the governorship now held by Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is stepping down under term limits. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who gained national attention for her support of Arizona's controversial new immigration law, defeated Democrat Terry Goddard to retain office. In other gubernatorial contests, Republicans Bill Haslam in Tennessee, Sam Brownback in Kansas, Rick Perry in Texas, Nikki Haley in South Carolina, Susana Martinez in New Mexico, Mary Fallin in Oklahoma, Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania, Matt Mead in Wyoming and Rick Snyder in Michigan will be victorious, according to the projections. Democratic winners for governor included incumbents Martin O'Malley in Maryland and Deval Patrick in Massachusetts, the projections showed. Republicans needed a net gain of only three governorships Tuesday for a majority nationally. Often overshadowed during midterm campaigns, governorships can impact national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates. Exit poll data analyzed by CNN showed the economy was the dominant issue on the minds of voters and indicated that key constituencies shifted from supporting Democrats in 2008 to voting for Republicans this time. For example, senior citizens who comprised 24 percent of the total electorate supported Republicans much more strongly on Tuesday than they did two years ago, the exit polling showed. According to the data, 39 percent of senior citizens voted for Democrats, compared with 49 percent in 2008, while 58 percent supported Republicans, compared with 49 percent two years ago. One reason is likely opposition to the health care reform bill pushed through Congress over Republican opposition by President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders. While Obama pledged the reforms would improve Medicare, Republican opponents warned of service cuts and higher costs. The long and bitter campaign season drew more than $3.5 billion in spending, making it the most expensive nonpresidential vote ever, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. The rise of the Tea Party movement added a new element to the election cycle, roiling Republican races by boosting little-known and inexperienced candidates to victory over mainstream figures in GOP primaries across the country. No matter how many of the so-called Tea Party candidates win against Democratic opponents Tuesday, the influence of the movement has shifted the Republican agenda to the right. ""They tell me they want people who can work together in Washington,"" DeMint, one of the leading backers of Tea Party candidates, said in his victory speech. ""I tell you this: I'm ready. I'm ready. Anyone whose guide is the constitution and whose goal is limited government, I'm ready to work with them today. But I'm not going to compromise with anyone who doesn't believe in that."" Exit polling showed voter dissatisfaction with both parties, as each received a 53 percent unfavorable rating. The economy was rated the most important issue by 62 percent of voters, far eclipsing health care reform (19 percent), immigration (8 percent) and the war in Afghanistan (7 percent), according to the exit polling. Most voters, 88 percent, rated economic conditions as not good or poor, and 86 percent said they were very worried or somewhat worried about the economy, the exit polling showed. Voters across the country offered a variety of reasons for their choices Tuesday. In Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, restaurant manager and internet entrepreneur Stephen Smith, 40, went to the polls hoping ""that the entrenched incumbents get booted out of office,"" he said. Melissa Bacon, 24, of Sacramento, California, cast her ballot partly for the thrill of the experience, she said. ""You don't get to vote every day. It's sort of its own holiday. You research the issues, vote and then wait to see if your position was the majority. It's as exciting to me as the World Series last night,"" she said on the heels of the San Francisco Giants' victory. Nadya Alvarez of Parrish, Florida, went to the polls with her son to teach him about the importance of voting. ""My youngest is almost 2 years old, and I showed him the ballot, and he wanted to help fill in the circles,"" said Parrish, 28. ""It is good to teach them from an early age to be involved in the welfare of our country and that we all have rights and duties to preserve."" Unemployment, at a rate of 9.6 percent amid a slow recovery from economic recession, has been the dominant issue, with Republicans accusing Obama and the Democrats of pushing through expensive policies that have expanded government without solving the problem. Obama has led Democrats in defending his record, saying that steps such as the economic stimulus bill and auto industry bailout were necessary to prevent a depression, while health care reform and Wall Street reform will lay the foundation for sustainable future growth. Observers warned that the expected Republican gains offer little chance of compromise or bipartisan approaches on major issues. Boehner already has signaled little appetite to negotiate with the White House or congressional Democrats, saying last week that ""this is not a time for compromise."" In the Senate, legislative gridlock is likely as Republicans strengthen their current minority of 41 seats. Obama and Democrats accuse Senate Republicans of using obstruction tactics as a political tool, showing the distrust and animosity that already exists. Democrats are also wary of a recent comment by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who told the National Journal, ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" The first test of a new relationship will come in mid-November, when Congress convenes a post-election lame-duck session to try to clear unfinished legislation before the newly elected Congress gathers in January. Among other issues, lawmakers must decide whether and how to extend Bush-era tax cuts. CNN's Tom Cohen, Michael Pearson, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett, Deirdre Walsh, Paul Steinhauser, Rebecca Sinderbrand and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","An energized conservative electorate helps Republicans to historic gain in midterms .

"(CNN) -- Three men who were convicted of killing three Cub Scouts 16 years ago will have their cases reviewed in a court hearing to see whether they should be granted a new trial, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday. Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley were convicted in the 1993 deaths of 8-year-olds Michael Moore, Christopher Byers and Steven Branch. The boys' bruised and mutilated bodies were found in May 1993 in West Memphis, Arkansas, their arms and legs hogtied with their own shoelaces. The court Thursday remanded the cases back to the lower court. The ruling means Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley will be able to present new evidence that could exonerate them. Echols' attorneys said at a hearing in September that they want to present DNA evidence not available at the time of the trial, as well as testimony that supports arguments that Echols and the two others are innocent. ""We are very pleased that the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered a new evidentiary hearing to review the convincing evidence of the innocence of Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley,"" Echols spokesman Lonnie Soury said. ""These young men were convicted of a brutal crime someone else committed, and we hope the state moves quickly to overturn their convictions and seek to prosecute those responsible."" The case, known as the West Memphis 3, has gained advocates including some of the victims' parents. Pamela Hobbs, Branch's mother, said last year that she was once convinced of their guilt but began to consider the DNA evidence and believes the prosecution's case was flawed. ""We are asking the Arkansas Supreme Court to right a terrible wrong, overturn their convictions and grant Damien as well as Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley a new trial,"" said Dennis Riordan, the lead attorney on the case, in September. The Arkansas Supreme Court, in its ruling, said that the circuit court erroneously interpreted the Arkansas DNA testing laws and that the three should have been granted an evidentiary hearing. Testing of the DNA in question was conducted between December 2005 and September 2007, according to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The material included hair from a ligature used to bind Moore and a hair recovered from a tree stump near where the bodies were found, court documents said. The hair found in the ligature was consistent with Branch's stepfather, Terry Hobbs, while the hair found on the tree stump was consistent with the DNA of a friend of Hobbs', according to the documents. Police have never considered Hobbs a suspect, and Hobbs maintains that he had nothing to do with the murders. Echols received a death sentence for the slayings, while Baldwin and Misskelley were sentenced to life in prison. Now 35, Echols said in September, ""I miss the things that most people take for granted, things people don't want, like rain."" Echols wrote in his 2005 autobiography, ""Almost Home,"" that police questioned him a day after the bodies of the second-graders were found. The teens -- Echols was 19 at the time, Baldwin was 16, and Misskelley was 17 -- were arrested a month later. Prosecutors successfully argued that the defendants were involved in a satanic cult and that punctures and cuts on the boys' bodies indicated a ritual sacrifice. In addition, prosecutors secured a confession from Misskelley, although his defense attorneys argued that he had a learning disability and an IQ of 70. They also claimed the confession was coerced, with neither Misskelley's parents nor an attorney present, and riddled with inconsistencies. A Little Rock, Arkansas-based group trying to raise awareness about the West Memphis 3 case has brought in celebrities such as singer Eddie Vedder and actor Johnny Depp to a recent public rally.

"(CNN) -- A Florida homeless man strangled and used an ax to bludgeon to death a 58-year-old who had been counseling him, only to be arrested days later after trying to sell the victim's collector coins, police said. David-Israel Zenon Murillo was charged with first-degree murder and dealing in stolen property on Monday, five days after Matteo Giovanditto was found dead in his home, a spokeswoman for the Osceola County Sheriff's Department said. Following tips from Murillo, detectives found ""the murder weapon,"" which sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain described as a hatchet or small ax. The murder was the first ever recorded in the 14-year history of Celebration, a Disney-developed town five miles south of the Magic Kingdom. While being led into court Monday, Murillo accused Giovanditto of attempting to sexually assault him, saying ""he tried to put something in my drink while I was over there."" ""He was a sick, sick man,"" Murillo said. ""He had what was coming to him."" The sheriff's spokeswoman, Twis Lizasuain, said that Murillo was a transient, living most recently in a wooded area near Kissimmee, Florida. Giovanditto was a counselor who worked with Murillo, and even had a small head-shot of the suspect among those on his computer. The two had known one another for the past year, Lizasuain said. Giovanditto was found dead in his apartment on November 29, and a tip led police the next day to his vehicle in Kissimmee, about 10 miles west. Osceola County Sheriff's deputies brought Murillo in for questioning on Sunday, after discovering that he'd tried to sell some of Giovanditto's coins. Murillo told police that the two were together on November 24, when he ""became enraged and struck Giovanditto with an ax that he found in a closet,"" a sheriff's department statement said. He admitted he continued to hit the victim, even slamming his head into the kitchen floor. The medical examiner's office later concluded that Giovanditto died from blunt force trauma and strangulation, according to the release. The next day, after getting a search warrant, police found Giovanditto's iPad, cash and collector's coins at Murillo's campsite in Kissimmee. Investigators on Monday searched a canal in the area, looking for more evidence based on information from Murillo, as well as a lake near his campsite, Lizasuain said. She said police canvassing the campsite have already found ""significant evidence that corroborated what the suspect told the detectives."" Murillo is fully cooperating with the detectives,"" said Lizasuain. ""We have a great deal of information (because of) what he has provided to them."" Days after Giovanditto's death, police stormed the house of another Celebration resident, Craig Foushee, after a standoff. Foushee killed himself, police said. The two incidents, while unrelated, rattled residents of the picture-perfect town. ""It does have a unique flavor or flair that isn't found in a lot of places,"" resident Chris Stellwag said last week of Celebration. ""(But) it's not like living at Disney World. It's a real town, (with) real issues.""","NEW: Police find the ""murder weapon,"" described as a hatchet or small ax .

"(CNN) -- Three young brothers from Michigan remain missing despite the efforts of police and volunteer searchers working since the boys' disappearance during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Residents in the small city of Morenci, Michigan, held a candlelight vigil Sunday night for Tanner Skelton, 5, Alexander William Skelton, 7, and Andrew Skelton, 9, who were last seen at their father's home on Thanksgiving. The father, John Skelton, was arrested last Tuesday upon his release from a mental health facility where he was being treated after a suicide attempt, according to Morenci Police Chief Larry Weeks. Skelton -- charged with parental kidnapping -- is fighting his extradition from Ohio, authorities said last week. A hearing is set for December 14. Although investigators have found ""a number of items,"" they have not determined the children's whereabouts, Weeks has said. Local authorities and federal investigators have been assisting with the search. Weeks has said authorities are skeptical of the information Skelton has provided. Skelton said he left the three boys with a woman, whom he identified as Joann Taylor, the morning before he tried to take his own life -- in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide attempt. Skelton said Taylor was supposed to take the boys to their home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, Ohio, on November 26, Weeks said. But the boys never arrived. Earlier, authorities determined that Skelton had no ""established relationship"" with the person he named as Taylor, and they aren't certain she even exists. Authorities have been asking for the public's help, hoping someone saw Skelton's blue 2000 Dodge Caravan that was believed to be carrying the boys along a 25-mile stretch of road between Morenci and Holiday City, Ohio. The last time someone other than a family member saw the boys was at 5 p.m. on November 25, according to Weeks. Police say Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry-blond hair and blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds.","Tanner Skelton, 5, Alexander William Skelton, 7, and Andrew Skelton, 9, remain missing .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- An alarm sounded when Alejandro Rea walked out of a Hollywood Boulevard clothing store earlier this month, signaling that he may be leaving with merchandise he didn't pay for. Rea is deaf, so he didn't hear the alarm or the shouts from a security guard ordering him to stop. The 28-year-old kept walking out of the Forever 21 until he was tackled and placed in a choke-hold by the guard. It was a drama that played out in front of dozens of tourists gathered on Hollywood's Walk of Fame and near Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Pablo Rea, also hearing-impaired as are other members of the family, said it was frustrating watching the guard wrestle his brother for several minutes. ""I can see my brother saying he couldn't communicate,"" Pablo Rea said Thursday, speaking through an interpreter. ""It was like an immediate attack and my brother went limp and then he got in a choke-hold and became purple."" Rea's lawyer, John Henrichs, is threatening to sue the store for using excessive force and causing injuries to Rea, something Forever 21 acknowledged in a statement. ""We recognize that the security guard used excessive force, which is against our store policy and have suspended him indefinitely,"" the store said in a news release. An advocacy group for the deaf wants the clothing store chain to train workers to be more sensitive to hearing-impaired customers. ""We're making sure that it won't happen again,"" said Patricia Hughes, CEO of the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness (GLAD). Video of the incident, shot by Joshua Fountain using his cell phone, has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times since it was uploaded to YouTube. ""His eyes were watery,"" Fountain, from Long Beach, California, said. ""He was practically purplish, reddish, so he was suffering, and he was continuing tapping on the security guard's arm, telling him 'I've had enough, I am submitting.'"" Alejandro Rea has not seen the video, since he has been held in a Los Angeles jail since his August 7 arrest. His court date is August 24, and he hasn't been able to pay his $56,000 bond. Instead of a misdemeanor shoplifting charge, he faces felony second-degree robbery. His alleged violent resistance to the security guard and his prior arrest record apparently played a role in the more serious charge, the lawyer said. Rea was convicted twice before on misdemeanor petty theft charges, in 2002 and 2008, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney's office said. Henrichs said it doesn't matter in the civil case if he was shoplifting, since it did not justify the brutal treatment by the guards. ""The security guard, the same one, when they took him back in the office, threw him against the wall twice and so he has injuries from that and he is entitled to be compensated for that,"" Henrichs said. Forever 21 could avoid a lawsuit with a settlement, Henrichs said, that should include a donation to Patricia Hughes' organization. ""Maybe they can turn a negative into a positive with donation to GLAD for sensitivity training for security workers,"" he said. Pablo Rea has simple advice for security guards. ""They should have tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention,"" Rea said.","Because he is deaf, Alejandro Rea could not hear the alarm or guard's shouts to stop .

"(CNN) -- After his plane ripped into pieces as it crashed Sunday night in a Utah neighborhood, the pilot was found burned and banged up but coherent, according to a witness. The Cessna 210 single-engine plane went down shortly before 6 p.m. in a residential area of Roy, Utah, according to Ogden police dispatcher Brittany Dean. The plane had been cleared for landing at nearby Ogden Airport when it crashed, said Mike Fergus of the Federal Aviation Administration. Gary Cox was in the neighborhood, attending a family birthday party, when the power went out right after the plane went down. He told CNN affiliate KSL that he and a few other people found a man, later identified as the pilot, lying on the ground. ""He was confused, hurt and in a lot of pain,"" Cox said. ""But he was able to answer questions and get where he needed to be."" The plane's engine sat in the front yard of a house, Cox said, with other parts strewn throughout the neighborhood. Roy fire Chief John Ritchie told KSL that the pilot was talking when he was transported to a local hospital, where he was in critical condition Sunday night. Two occupied homes -- one with three people inside, the other with two -- caught fire after the crash, Ritchie said. But no one inside was hurt and, within about an hour, firefighters were able to put out the fires. The crash knocked out power for 1,700 homes, starting at 5:58 p.m., said Margaret Oler of Rocky Mountain Power. By 7:10 p.m., power had been restored to all but 875 customers. A nearby elementary school was opened as a temporary shelter for those without heat and lights, Ritchie said. Visibility was minimal at the time of the crash, as the National Weather Service had issued a dense fog advisory for the area. That warning remains in effect until 9 a.m. Monday. Roy is about 6 miles southwest of Ogden, with the affected neighborhood near Ogden-Hinckley Airport. CNN's Greg Morrison and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","NEW: Power has been restored to all but 875 of 1,700 homes .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Tomas continued to lose brawn in the Caribbean Sea on Monday morning after pummeling the island of St. Vincent over the weekend, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 5 a.m. ET Sunday, Tomas, a tropical storm with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph),  was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Curacao, according to the Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at about 14 mph (22 kph). Tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the center of Tomas. Tomas moved over the Caribbean Sea after leaving heavy rain and wind on St. Vincent. More than 1,000 people entered shelters on St. Vincent as Tomas struck the island, an emergency official said. Two people were injured, including one critically, when they tried to repair roof damage during the storm, said Michelle Forbes, acting director of National Emergency Management. Tomas also left downed trees that blocked many roads, Forbes said, and large areas of the island lacked power. More than 100 homes sustained roof damage, she said, and authorities expected the number to rise. The main hospital on the island, Milton Cato Memorial Hospital, lost power temporarily but was able to get a generator up and running, according to Forbes. Tomas was forecast to continue heading west over the next day or two. The Hurricane Center said restrengthening could begin by late Tuesday. A projection map shows the storm turning north later this week. Tomas could approach Haiti on Friday, possibly as a hurricane. Tomas could deal a harsh blow to Haiti as the impoverished nation is still recovering from a devastating earthquake in January and is currently dealing with a cholera outbreak. But ""Tomas could still hit anywhere from the Dominican Republic to eastern Cuba,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- First came a political row over the rightful winner of Ivory Coast's presidential election. Saturday, two men laid claim to the West African nation's highest post. Incumbent Laurent Gbagbo defied international appeals to step aside and was sworn in as the new president in a formal ceremony inside the presidential palace that was broadcast live on television. Less than an hour-and-a-half later, his rival, Alassane Ouattara, told reporters that he, too, had taken the oath of office and asked Prime Minister Soro Guillaume to form a new government. Abidjan, under a 7 p.m. curfew, saw an eerie calm fall Saturday evening. But the political chaos heightened fears that the Ivory Coast -- known as Cote d'Ivoire in French -- would once again plunge into the unrest and bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. The Constitutional Council declared Gbagbo the winner Friday, invalidating earlier results from the Independent Electoral Commission which handed Ouattara the victory with 54.1% of the vote. The Constitutional Council said Gbagbo had won the election with 51.45% of the vote to Ouattara's 48.55%. It tossed out votes it said were marred by fraud in northern regions that were considered Ouattara strongholds. It was the job of Y.J. Choi, the special envoy in the Ivory Coast of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, to review and sign off on the results. Choi said that, even if Gbagbo's complaints were taken into consideration, Ouattara was the winner. ""Having evaluated all the tally sheets, 20,000 of them yesterday evening, we are in a position to know what happened really,"" Choi said in a telephone interview from Abidjan. ""With absolute certainty, we know that Ouattara won the election."" With his credibility in question, Gbagbo defied calls from international leaders to respect the will of Ivorian voters by taking the oath of office in front of a room full of supporters and military commanders. ""These past days I have noticed serious cases of interference,"" Gbagbo said. ""The sovereignty of Cote d'Ivoire, is not negotiable. My responsibility is to defend it."" Meanwhile, the African Union stepped into the fray and said it would entrust former South African President Thabo Mbeki to help determine a rightful end to the dispute. ""The purpose of this mission is to facilitate the rapid and peaceful conclusion of the electoral process and the efforts to find a way out of the crisis in (the Ivory Coast) on the basis of relevant (African Union) decisions and instruments and through consultations with the concerned actors,"" said a statement from the intergovernmental organization. French President Nicolas Sarkozy appealed for calm and urged military and civilian officials to respect the will of the people. U.S. President Barack Obama warned Gbagbo:  ""The international community will hold those who act to thwart the democratic process and the will of the electorate accountable for their actions."" Ouattara, a former economist for the International Monetary Fund who served as prime minister, had been banned from previous races. Gbagbo's critics said the incumbent stoked tensions by accusing Ouattara of masterminding the civil war. Ouattara has denied the allegation. Once a prosperous nation and a driving force in West Africa, the Ivory Coast spiraled downward into instability after fighting erupted between the government-held south and discontented Muslim rebels living in the north. Thousands of people died in the conflict. Ouattara enjoys popular support in the rebel-held north and now, with both candidates claiming they are president, the potential exists for more bloodshed. The streets of Abidjan have already seen violent clashes in the past few days. Journalists Francois Xavier Menage and Eric Agnero contributed to this report.","Laurent Gbagbo was named president by one council in the Ivory Coast .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United claimed a controversial 2-0 victory at home to Tottenham on Saturday night to keep up the pressure on English Premier League leaders Chelsea. United stayed within five points of the defending champions, who came from behind to beat Blackburn 2-1 earlier in the day, following a bizarre incident late in the match at Old Trafford. Nani was allowed to put the ball into the Tottenham net while goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes was trying to take a free-kick, after the Portugal midfielder handled when he went down having vainly claimed a penalty. The linesman instantly flagged, but referee Mark Clattenburg over-ruled him and awarded United a second goal to the fury of the visiting team -- who have been on the wrong side of several controversial decisions at Old Trafford in the past decade. United boss Alex Ferguson said Nani had correctly played to the whistle. ""Nani looked back and looked at the referee, and the referee said play on, so what can he do but put the ball in the net,"" Ferguson said. ""You can look at the referee and look at the linesmen and blame them, but the goalkeeper should know better. He's an experienced goalkeeper. I thought he made a mess of it. ""I thought it was a penalty first of all and I think Nani felt he handled the ball. But the referee didn't blow for it."" Fifth-placed Tottenham extended their historically dreadful run at United's home ground to 21 years without a victory, but had been in the match until the 84th-minute incident. Park Ji-Sung hit the base of the Spurs post in the eighth minute, but Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart rattled his compatriot Edwin van der Sar's woodwork with an even more spectacular effort just after the half-hour mark -- a day after the goalkeeper's 40th birthday. United took the lead five minutes later as Tottenham paid for poor defending, with Serbia center-back Nemanja Vidic stealing in unmarked to head home Nani's curling free-kick. Van der Sar then did well to keep out a fierce shot from Luka Modric, but Tottenham lacked the potency to equalize despite their smooth passing game, with boss Harry Redknapp bringing on Roman Pavlyuchenko and Peter Crouch to replace Robbie Keane and Van der Vaart. Chelsea, still missing injured England midfielder Frank Lampard, needed an 84th-minute winner from Branislav Ivanovic to see off Blackburn, who earlier in the week announced the club is poised to be the first in the Premier League to have Indian owners. Zimbabwean striker Benjani Mwaruwari had headed a 21st-minute opener for his first goal for Rovers, from El-Hadji Diouf's cross, but former France striker Nicolas Anelka leveled three minutes before the break after Didier Drogba nodded down Florent Malouda's cross. Blackburn could have led again in the 81st minute but striker Jason Roberts missed a golden chance, and the Londoners immediately pounced for the winner as Serbian defender Ivanovic headed home Yuri Zhirkov's cross. ""Blackburn could have scored before our goal and we were a little bit lucky,"" Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""To win here was important because they were better. We were not great again. Blackburn put us under some pressure and we were not able to play our football."" Arsenal claimed second place on goal difference above Manchester United after snatching victory at home to bottom club West Ham, with Alex Song heading a late winner following an end-to-end London derby. France midfielder Samir Nasri hit the crossbar with a long-range free-kick and England winger Theo Walcott struck the post after coming on as a substitute, while former England goalkeeper Robert Green kept the visitors in the game with a series of fine saves. But Cameroon international Song finally broke the deadlock with two minutes to play with a diving effort from fullback Gael Clichy's cross. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told reporters that captain Cesc Fabregas should be available for Wednesday's Champions League trip to Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk despite suffering a hamstring twinge. However, Manchester City's hopes of a first league crown since 1968 were dented by a second successive defeat, this time at lowly Wolverhampton, which left the club eight points behind Chelsea. Beaten 3-0 by Arsenal last weekend, City went ahead in the 23rd minute with a penalty from Emmanuel Adebayor -- who was partnered up front by Mario Balotelli in the absence of injured captain Carlos Tevez. But Serbia midfielder Nenad Milijas equalized on half an hour and David Edwards -- who headed against the post in the first period -- gave Wolves a first win since the opening day of the season with a 57th-minute strike. But Wolves remained second from bottom on goal difference below Liverpool, who travel to Bolton Sunday. Everton moved up to seventh place with a 1-0 win at home to Stoke City, with Nigeria striker Yakubu scoring his first goal since April in the 67th minute. Fulham climbed to eighth with a 2-0 victory against Wigan, with U.S. international Clint Dempsey netting both goals in the first half for the home side.","Manchester United third on goal difference after beating fifth-placed Tottenham 2-0 .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- After harsh criticism and controversy, the 2010 Commonwealth Games will officially begin Sunday in New Delhi, India. It's the first time India has hosted the international sporting event between countries of the former British Empire. Britain's Prince Charles, representing his mother, Queen Elizabeth, arrived in the Indian capital Saturday. He, along with Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil, will officially declare the games open at a ceremony at Jawarharlal Nehru Stadium. Excitement filled the air in New Delhi after days of fears that India simply would not be ready in time. Athletes had expressed alarm over the poor condition of their village. Others charged shoddy construction and slammed the government for corruption. The games afforded India an opportunity to promote a shiny image as an emerging power. The government spent billions on a new international airport, additional metro lines and fresh landscaping along dingy Delhi roads. Still, India remains a country with millions of poor people, who this week felt brushed aside as the new India tried to put its best face forward. People like Shanti, a 65-year-old beggar, who said she was detained by police for sitting on the side of a street, where she always sits, hoping that passers-by will drop a few coins in her hands. Or Mala Mangla, who sells balloons on the streets. She said police have told her to disappear for at least a month. India, they said, was trying to hide them from foreign visitors. They said beggars have been warned to stay off the streets. So have vendors and children who are commonly seen going from car to car begging. And shanties have been torn down. ""There has been a very strong movement by the government .. to get rid of the filth and to portray the beautified and shining India,"" said Maushmi Basu, a migrant worker activist. Police and government officials contacted by CNN did not return calls. The Indian government maintains that it respects the rights of the poor. But there are also laws against begging and putting up structures without proper permits and begging is illegal in New Delhi. The games have been a tough act for a nation that has never hosted such a large international event. Months earlier, Parliament was forced to deal with accusations of corruption in the planning of the games. Two weeks ago, gunmen fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi and injured two Taiwanese tourists. A car blaze turned out to be a crudely manufactured bomb. And a militant group warned that it planned to target the games. Indian law enforcement authorities responded with a heightened security plan, placing thousands of extra forces on the streets of the capital. If all that weren't enough, two days before athletes were scheduled to begin arriving, complaints rang out across the globe about their shoddy living quarters. ""You know, construction dust is still there, filth, excrement, it really is disgusting in parts and it really requires a professional deep clean throughout the entire complex,"" said Michael Hooper, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Games Federation. As if to amplify Hooper's complaint, a pedestrian bridge leading to Nehru stadium collapsed that same day. India's image was slipping faster than a rocket. Two world-class athletes canceled their trips, citing security and health concerns. Entire teams threatened to do the same, while others delayed their arrival date.

"Monai, Indonesia (CNN) -- Saluhu stares at the mass grave where his youngest son is buried. He struggles to comprehend the split second that changed his life forever. He relives the moment he started to run inland with his family after feeling Monday's earthquake and hearing the distant roar of the tsunami. ""My youngest son's hand slipped out of my wife's hand when the tsunami hit us. It just slipped,"" Saluhu says. ""We didn't know where he was. We couldn't see a thing -- it was pitch black."" Nine-year-old Warisman is one of 30 victims in the village of Monai on the Indonesian island of South Pagai, one of the areas worst hit by the tsunami. Most of those who died had run into the village church, around 350 meters inland, thinking it was far enough. It wasn't. All that remains of the church are the foundations and small pieces of concrete and steel, ripped apart as if it were paper. The villagers tell us the tsunami hit approximately six minutes after they first felt the earthquake. For some it simply wasn't enough time to flee to higher ground. It's hard to overstate how remote these Indonesian islands are. Aid agencies are struggling to reach them, and harsh weather and torrential rain kept one aid ship out at sea for 16 hours before it was safe to dock near the devastated area. The Monai villagers say an aid helicopter dropped rice and water to them Thursday, but a CNN crew was the first to actually land there. Their food is almost completely gone. There is no shelter from the harsh storms, and the majority of the survivors are still hiding in the hills -- too scared to return to their destroyed village at sea level.","Villagers fled to village church, but it wasn't far enough .

"(CNN) -- Former French national coach Raymond Domenech is suing the French Football Federation (FFF) for unfair dismissal, demanding 2.9 million euros after his sacked in the wake of France's disastrous World Cup campaign. Domenech was fired by the FFF in September for ""serious error"" and -- under French law -- a person dismissed under such circumstances has no right to severance pay, although they can dispute the charge before an employment tribunal. Domenech's lawyer, Jean-Yves Connesson, told AFP: ""We are requesting 2.9 million euros spread over two payments. ""The first is for 400,000 euros and includes compensation for dismissal. The second is for professional and moral prejudice and is worth three years salary,"" He added: ""You don't manage a collective crisis by sacking one individual. An amicable parting of ways was a possibility. ""The federation came up with totally unfounded reasons for the sacking, and went through with it in an irregular, brutal and aggressive manner."" Domenech lost his job after France failed to qualify from the group stages in South Africa, amid player unrest that saw his squad boycott a training session. However, Connesson believes his client has a good chance of winning his case. He told AFP: ""We can't forget Domenech is the only coach to have qualified France for three consecutive major international tournaments (two World Cups and one European Championships). ""And we sack him for a serious error! Those are not valid reasons and we want to prove that in front of a judge. ""It is difficult for him to bounce back. Stained by the accusations of serious error means that 17 years of his career has been erased by the stroke of a pen.""","Former French national coach Raymond Domenech is suing French Football Federation .

"(CNN) -- California voters rejected the legalization of marijuana Tuesday, according to a CNN projection based on exit polling. Supporters of Proposition 19 argued that the ""prohibition"" of marijuana -- much like that for alcohol decades ago -- has created a violent criminal black market, led today by international drug cartels. But opponents prevailed Tuesday. They asserted that even if the proposition were to pass, federal law still prohibits individuals and groups from manufacturing, distributing and possessing marijuana for recreational use. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he will continue to enforce that federal law. Opponents also said that driving under the influence of marijuana would be a public threat. Supporters said the measure could have generated tax revenue from the $14 billion-a-year marijuana business in California and save the state hundreds of millions of dollars annually by ending the arrests of 61,000 Californians a year for misdemeanor marijuana possession. California has already legalized medical marijuana. Legal cannabis for the rest of us? A measure that would have legalized medical marijuana in South Dakota also failed, according to another CNN projection based on exit polling. Results were still pending for a similar medical marijuana measure in Arizona. A total of 14 states and the District of Columbia have already legalized marijuana for medical care only. Meanwhile, among the many initiatives on ballots Tuesday, four states -- Utah, Arizona, South Carolina and South Dakota -- approved a measure that will guarantee workers the right to vote by secret ballot on whether they want union representation, according to CNN projections based on exit polling. The anti-union measures are considered pre-emptive strikes against a federal legislative proposal that would allow unions to organize workers by relying on sign-up cards instead of secret ballots, The proposed Employee Free Choice Act would allow unions to organize workers with a ""card check."" Business groups have opposed this draft legislation because, they claim, employees could be coerced into checking yes on a card to unionize. Workers rights groups say the proposed ""majority sign-up"" law would reduce opportunities for employers to threaten or fire workers wanting a union, said spokeswoman Zoe Bridges-Curry of the advocacy group American Rights at Work. Meanwhile, Colorado voters were projected to reject an anti-abortion amendment that would have defined a ""person"" as ""every human being from the beginning of the biological development of that human being,"" according to a CNN analysis of exit poll data. Arizona and Oklahoma voters passed a measure Tuesday allowing residents to opt out of President Barack Obama's federal health care reform and its requirement that people have insurance, according to a CNN projection based on an analysis of exit poll data. But in Colorado, voters rejected a similar measure that would give voters the option of not participating in the federal health care reforms, including the insurance requirement, according to a CNN projection based on exit polling. The approvals were a rebuke of the administration's controversial health care reforms. Experts question whether such state laws could be implemented because they seek to pre-empt federal law, and the matter could eventually end up in court, said Jennie Bowser, an elections analyst with the conference. Voters in many states cast ballots on other controversial measures Tuesday, including balancing budgets. In all, 37 states offered 160 ballot proposals, and the initiatives had no single unifying theme this November, unlike in 2004 and 2006, when voters saw same-sex marriage dominate ballots, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Among its nine initiatives, California offered a proposition that could reduce government gridlock by lowering the minimum needed for the legislature to approve a state budget, making it a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority. Only two other states require two-thirds. Among other controversial or interesting measures: . Under Rhode Island Question 1, voters were projected by CNN to reject changing the official state name from ""State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations"" to simply ""Rhode Island."" In the wake of scandal in the governor's office, Illinois voters approved a constitutional amendment (HJRCA 31) that will allow for a recall of a governor and a special election to choose a replacement -- a process that exists in 18 other states. For the measure to pass, the ""yes"" votes must total at least 60 percent of those voting on this question or a majority of those voting in the overall election. Arizona voters were projected by CNN to approve Proposition 107, which called for an affirmative action/discrimination ban. The amendment to the state constitution would prohibit the state from granting preferential treatment or discriminating against any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, skin color, ethnicity or national origin.","California voters reject legalizing marijuana, CNN projects .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday a closed Texas food processing plant tested positive for a bacteria that has been linked to the deaths of four people. The Texas Department of State Health Services on October 20 ordered SanGar Fresh Cut Produce to immediately stop processing food and recall all products shipped from its San Antonio plant since January. The move came after state laboratory results showed Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that can cause severe illness, in chopped celery at the plant. Four people died when they contracted listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the SanGar plant, said Carrie Williams, a department spokeswoman. State health authorities came to this determination while investigating 10 cases in which people with serious underlying health problems contracted listeriosis over an 8-month period. Six of those cases -- in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the SanGar plant, the state health services department said. Four of those people died, as did one other person who authorities believe got listeriosis from another source not connected with SanGar products. The FDA inspected the company's premises and said it issued a summary of its findings to the company on October 26. It said it found the bacteria in processed celery and in multiple locations in the plant, including food contact surfaces. The listeria found in samples ""matches the DNA fingerprint of the clinical cases of listeriosis reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services,"" the FDA said in a statement. SanGar had independent Quanta Lab of Selma, Texas, test the plant for listeria. Results came back negative, SanGar attorney Jason Galvan told CNN. ""The FDA and the state have not turned over to us the documentation supporting their findings,"" Galvan said. ""We cannot comment on these most recent findings until the documentation is provided for independent evaluation by our experts."" Still, the company in recent weeks brought in an independent listeria expert to look at protocols, said Galvan. The entire facility, including its machines, were cleaned, said Galvan. About 100 SanGar workers have been idled by the plant closing, and the company needs to reopen soon if it is to survive, Galvan said. A November 17 administrative hearing on its status is scheduled, and SanGar is working with the agencies on reopening, he said. ""We're pretty optimistic about having the company up and running before the hearing,"" the attorney said. ""We're not going the litigation route."" In October, SanGar denied wrongdoing, saying it has had ""an excellent record of safety and health"" over the past three years. State health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company's plant. SanGar processes a wide variety of products -- including three varieties of lettuce, peppers, carrots, cucumbers and various cut-up fruit, as well as salad, fruit and soup mixes, according to the company's website. They are distributed primarily in sealed packages to restaurants, hospitals, schools and other large institutions that serve food. Besides the bacteria, inspectors found a condensation leak above a food product area, dirt on a food-preparation table, and hand-washing problems at the San Antonio plant, the state health department said. The FDA said Wednesday inspectors found several other problems, including hoses making contact with food, bagged carrots being stored on a wet floor, a lack of adequate drainage areas, foods not being stored at the proper temperature and a failure to safely clean utensils and equipment. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium found in the soil, in water and in animals that carry it without showing signs they are sick, according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can get into vegetables from soil or manure that is used as fertilizer. The strain of bacteria is relatively resilient -- with an incubation period of three to 70 days, Williams said -- and some foods can be contaminated after cooking but prior to packaging. The bacteria have been tied to listeriosis, which sickens about 2,500 Americans and contributes to the death of 500 people annually, the CDC reports. The Texas health department is taking the lead in the investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC. The state justified its closure of the SanGar plant, citing Texas law that authorizes such actions if conditions pose ""an immediate and serious threat to human life or health.""","FDA says lab results at Texas plant tested positive for listeria .

"(CNN) -- Hill Harper, star of the CBS series ""CSI: NY,"" founded the Manifest Your Destiny Foundation to empower young people through mentoring, scholarship and grant programs. Harper, who is also a best-selling author and a graduate of Harvard Law School and the Kennedy School of Government, served on the Blue Ribbon Panel that selected this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes. He recently spoke to CNN about the Heroes campaign and his philanthropy. Below are excerpts from that interview. CNN: Why did you decide to name your organization the Manifest Your Destiny Foundation? Hill Harper: Well, the name comes from the subtitle of my first book [""Letters to a Young Brother: Manifest Your Destiny""] and so what I wanted to do was take some of the profits from that and create this foundation. I started to find that a lot of our young people just don't have mentors. They don't have individuals to help them navigate their journey. ""Manifest your destiny"" means what it is: If you have a dream, if you have a goal, let's figure out how to get you there. The foundation started in 2005, and to date we've had 120 kids go through the program. But we've had nearly 2,000 kids be touched by the program, whether it's us going out and speaking to groups of kids and donating books or having them come to our toy drives and then getting some kind of lessons. CNN: One of your programs specifically targets teens between eighth and ninth grades. Why is that? Harper: I'm very proud of the Summer Empowerment Academy because, if you look at the data with the dropout rates, a lot of times you can predict who's not going to make it through high school. An eighth-grader, coming out with a 2.8 [grade-point average] or below, their chance of dropping out of high school -- if you're a male, particularly an African-American male -- is almost 80 percent. And so we want to catch these kids who are potentially falling through the cracks as they make this transition, to really bolster their foundation for getting through high school and getting on to college. It's free to all the students. Right now it's in Los Angeles alone, but we're looking to expand it nationally. CNN: Did you have any mentors who helped you succeed? Harper: My father, obviously, and my mother were inspirations. My uncle, Frank Harper, he was an absolute mentor for me. I had a professor in college, professor Martin Martell, he pushed me. He said I wasn't working hard enough even though I was doing well, and he said: ""Well isn't good enough. We want you to excel. We want you to be excellent."" So I had people who really pushed me, and most of us, we either rise or fall based on the expectations that are placed upon us. And I think there's too many of our young people out there where we're not expecting enough of them. We're expecting less. And even when we look in the mirror, oftentimes we're expecting less and less of ourselves. And so what's that about? So I really am in that camp of ""let's go for it."" Let's go big. Dream big, and then double your dreams, and you still haven't dreamed big enough. CNN: Turning to CNN Heroes, what was it like being on the Blue Ribbon Panel? Harper: I really enjoyed it. It was very humbling but at the same time inspiring, because everyone -- even the individuals that weren't ultimately chosen [for the Top 10] -- were very inspiring. It reinforces that there are so many out there doing good things for others that you'd never know about or hear about. That's why CNN Heroes is a very special and a much-needed thing. CNN: You've been to ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" before. How does it compare to other awards shows you've been to? Harper: I love it because you get into Hollywood awards season and oftentimes it feels like Hollywood is giving Hollywood awards. This is giving out awards to people who aren't connected in any way shape or form to Hollywood or anything like that -- there's no nepotism or old-boy or old-girl network. We are literally celebrating what's best and what's right, people who are serving others. I just really enjoyed being there. CNN: Why is it important to recognize everyday people changing the world? Harper: Because at the end of the day, that's the only way the world is going to change. Change happens from the bottom up -- all of us as individuals deciding that we will and we do have an impact. We've just come through voting season, and so many people think, ""My vote doesn't matter."" What if the people who are CNN Heroes felt that way: ""I can't change the world."" These people prove that no matter how much you have or don't have, you can have a positive impact and better the human condition and this world so we all win. Their image just reminds us of that and challenges me to be a better person. CNN: What is a hero to you? Harper: For me, it's someone who is living with courage. The root is 'cor' which means heart, and to me all of the CNN Heroes represent courage because they are living from the heart. And that's what they inspire me to do.","Hill Harper is encouraging youth through his Manifest Your Destiny Foundation .

"New York (CNN) -- America's job crisis is a result of decades of shopping on credit and underinvesting in research to fuel new industries, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In a recent cover story in Time magazine and in a special on CNN this weekend. Zakaria traces the growing loss of faith in the American dream and the ways that technology and globalization have put millions of middle-class jobs at risk. The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Thursday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What can we do about the threat to American jobs? Fareed Zakaria: The first thing we have to do is to stop doing what we've been doing for almost 20 years, which is pretending we don't have a problem. We've been kicking the can down the road, we've blamed other people, blamed other countries for these issues. And most important, we've deluded ourselves that there is no crisis because we've kept the economy going by overconsuming. From the 1950s, America had a very stable pattern of consumption. Consumer expenditures made up between 60 and 65 percent of GDP [Gross Domestic Product] -- in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, that was the pattern. Then in the early 1980s, that starts going up, and it goes up to 70 percent of GDP by 2001 and it stayed there ever since. Now this wouldn't be a problem if we actually had that money, but we have been consuming using borrowed money for the last 20 years. So the average American household now has 13 credit cards, 40 percent of which have an outstanding balance. Debt has gone from $700 billion in 1974 to $14 trillion now. This is completely unsustainable. A fundamental way to think about it is that we have to shift this economy from an over-reliance on consumption and move it more toward investment. CNN: How do we do that? Zakaria: Let's talk about what we need first. One of the things I'm struck by in talking to corporate CEOs -- these are all real free-market types -- but they all agree that the key to getting growth and middle-class jobs back is that we make massive investments, investments in technology, investments in research and development, investments in infrastructure. That is in a sense, investing in the middle class, because that is investing in the industries of the future, the industries that will create middle-class jobs. We used to spend 3 percent of GDP on research and development. We don't do that now even though Obama has raised it a lot. I would argue that we actually need to do a lot more than we did in the 1950s, because in the 1950s there were millions of jobs for semiskilled labor, manufacturing jobs, making steel, making cars. All those jobs are under enormous competitive pressure from both technology and globalization. And so we need jobs in the new industries, industries of the future, knowledge based industries, scientific industries. To get those jobs and to make sure that American companies dominate them will take huge investments. CNN: Should they be government investments? Zakaria: That's what's produced the semiconductor industry, it was government investment. That's what created the internet. Al Gore may not have created the internet, but DARPA certainly did. That's the Defense Department venture capital group. And GPS, the technology that's now fueling the next internet revolution, the mobile revolution, that was also a U.S. Defense Department project. Those are now producing hundreds of billions of dollars for the private sector, all started by government funding. Zakaria: The middle class is being hollowed out . There's another urgency. We're falling behind. Just today in the news, on the front page of The New York Times, China has developed the fastest computer in the world. Why was that? Was it because of unfair trade practices or an undervalued currency? No. It was because the government of China has made massive investments in technology ... in many of these areas we've lost a lot of ground. CNN: How can the United States pay for this? Zakaria: I don't believe in a free lunch. For 20 years we've pretended that we can have our cake and eat it, too. We could have tax cuts and prescription drugs for the elderly and a war in Iraq and Afghanistan and nobody has to pay for it. The government did it just as individuals did it -- by borrowing. This is going to cost money and you're going to have to raise revenue. The best revenue raising device is a consumption tax, sometimes called a value added tax, or a national sales tax. Every industrialized country in the world has it. We are the only ones who don't. If we were to have a 5 to 7 percent consumption tax, it would be the lowest in the industrialized world. It would raise a lot of revenue. You could set it up so that the revenues from that tax would only go into investment, none of it is for current expenses. And if there is a consequence of this tax, which is that Americans consume a little less, that ain't the worst thing in the world either. CNN: You wrote in your piece in Time about immigration and skilled labor. How is that a part of the equation? Zakaria: Perhaps the most intelligent investment we can make is in human capital, particularly in talented people in science, math and computers. So what do we do? Well we can try to revitalize science education in America, which we must do, but it's going to be a long slog. We've fallen quite far behind. But we have been this amazing magnet -- the brightest students in the world come to America because we have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we are also seen as a place in which people find it attractive to study and work. But then, after we train all these hundreds of thousands of students from all over the world, the cream of the crop, we throw them out of the country, we tell them don't you dare work here, because that would mean you would invent here, and hire people here, create new companies here, file new patents here, pay taxes here. No, no, no, go back to your country. We've trained them often at taxpayer expense. Someone getting a computer science degree at the University of California at Berkeley is being trained at the California government's expense and is then thrown out of the country. We don't reap any benefits from it. This is a great investment strategy for the future of China and India. But it's a terrible investment strategy for the United States. CNN: What can be done? Zakaria: [New York Mayor Michael] Bloomberg has suggested that everyone who gets a science or math PhD in this country should be given a green card along with their degree. And I think that's a wonderful idea. We should frankly make it incredibly easy for these people to stay here. They are the people who overwhelmingly create jobs. ... Within a year or two they begin to pay back into the system at multiples of what they might have ever cost. And yet because of the usual political paralysis and dysfunction, it is right now unthinkable that we would ever enact a program like that. On the contrary, we're trying to throw more people out. CNN: You don't think there could be consensus on this in Washington right now? Zakaria: The problem in Washington is that the minute one side suggests something, the other side demagogues it. So the incentive to come to the center is vanishing. The minute you try to come to the center, if you're a Republican, Rush Limbaugh will denounce you, Glenn Beck will denounce you. There will be a primary opponent in your district who will be able to raise money. CNN: Will Tuesday's election change that? Zakaria: No. I fear it will actually exacerbate it. A lot of Republicans will get elected, will tell you they are mad as hell about the deficit, and the solution is to cut taxes. This is insanity, cutting taxes will create an even larger deficit. This is math, this is not politics. ... In the face of the problems we have, to have one more experiment in the idea that if we cut taxes, this will somehow goose the economy, we've been there done that. [President George W.] Bush had this massive tax cut and it produced almost no growth. What it did produce was an $800 million hole in the budget. CNN: How does education fit into the picture? Zakaria: The countries that have been able to maintain a manufacturing base, such as Germany, are really worth studying. The Germans have high taxes, they have lots of regulations, they have strong unions and yet they've seen their imports increase year after year. They've weathered the economic crisis very well, they've had 15 months of falling unemployment numbers, and why is that? Because they have really focused on scientific education, technical education, apprenticeship programs, retraining. They focus on high-end manufacturing, they train and retrain their workers. We don't have any such systems in America. We need there to be more of a coordinated effort by government, business and educational institutions -- a triangle of training. We've been too cavalier about letting skills of higher manufacturing erode among American workers. That work has not gone to India or China, that work has gone to Germany and Canada and Japan, other high wage, high income countries.","For decades, Americans have been overconsuming on credit, says Fareed Zakaria .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called the next House Speaker -- Republican Rep. John Boehner of Ohio -- on Tuesday night after mid-term election results gave the GOP majority control of the chamber starting next year. The White House said Obama also called the two top House Democrats -- outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and outgoing Majority Leader Steny Hoyer -- and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. While Republicans won a House majority, Democrats retained their Senate majority, though it will be much narrower than the current 59-41 advantage. In his discussions with Boehner and McConnell, Obama told the two he was looking forward to working with them and Republicans ""to find common ground, move the country forward and get things done for the American people,"" according to the White House statement.

"New York (CNN) -- Judson Box has never known exactly how his son, Gary, died on September 11, 2001. But an unexpected find nine years later has given him a glimpse into his son's final hours. Gary, then 35, had been working as a firefighter in Brooklyn for roughly five years when the terrorists attacked. He did not speak to his father the day of the attack and his body was never recovered, leaving the circumstances of his death a mystery. On September 11, 2009, Gary's sister, Christine, was visiting the Tribute Center when an employee asked her if she was looking for someone specifically. She mentioned her brother Gary, and the employee showed her to a picture of a firefighter in the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel that had a caption bearing Gary's name. But it was not Gary. It was a photo of Brian Bilcher, another member of Gary's fire squad who also perished on 9/11. The discovery compelled Gary's father to dig deeper, clinging to the possibility that there could be a similar picture of his son out there. Box scoured photo archives of the National 9/11 Museum and the memorial's website, which allows users to upload photos from 9/11 directly to the site. After searching one night for more than five hours, Box went to sleep, physically and emotionally exhausted. The next morning, his wife, Helen, called him into the living room as he was eating breakfast. She showed him a photo of a firefighter running through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel toward the Towers alongside cars stuck in traffic. This time, it was Gary. ""I was out of out control, emotionally,"" Box said. ""Thanking God, being so happy that I had something to see."" Eager for more answers, Box contacted the National 9/11 Museum and Memorial in an attempt to track down the photographer. Several months later, the museum gave him the e-mail address of Erik Troelson, a Danish businessman who was stranded in the tunnel on his way to a meeting when he snapped the picture of Gary. Having entered the tunnel before the first plane hit, Troelson was unaware of the tragedy that was taking place outside. ""Suddenly, the girl in the car in front of us got out crying,"" he said. ""Then we turned on the radio and heard the events as they unfolded."" Soon after, firetrucks started racing through the tunnel, but a car with blown-out tires jammed traffic, he said. ""Some of the bigger trucks got stuck, so the guys started walking briskly past us,"" Troelson said. ""Gary Box was one of the guys."" Box and Troelson corresponded via e-mail for months, with Troelson doing his best to recall the day's timeline of events. On Tuesday, the National 9/11 Museum and Memorial foundation arranged for a surprise rendezvous between the men at their annual fundraiser. They shared an emotional moment onstage. Afterward, they spoke at length, with Box expressing his gratitude. ""I think I said about 300 times thank you and God bless you, that's all I could say,"" Box said. ""I think I told him I love you, and I don't tell anybody that."" Nine years after September 11, Box said he still feels the pain of that day. He doesn't have the means to make large donations to the museum, but has sought to promote their cause through his story. ""We need that in this country because too many people forget,"" Box said of the museum. ""I wish everybody could get what I got.""","Gary Box died on 9/11 without speaking to family; his remains were not recovered .

"(CNN) -- Bad weather forced NASA to delay the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery by at least a day Thursday. Mission managers will meet Friday at 5 a.m. ET to re-evaluate weather conditions, NASA said. It was the latest in a series of delays for the 39th and final voyage for Discovery, the agency's oldest shuttle. Discovery's six crew members were scheduled to deliver a pressurized logistics module that will help provide more storage to the space station. ""We've gotten into a configuration now on the space station where we have a lot of stuff and we don't have a lot of space to put it in,"" said Royce Renfrew, lead space station flight director for the mission. The latest launch attempt had been set for Thursday afternoon. Before that, it was expected to blast off Monday, but Discovery was delayed to repair helium and nitrogen leaks in its system. A planned Tuesday liftoff was canceled so engineers could fix a glitch to a backup system that controls a main engine. With 38 voyages to date, Discovery has flown more missions than any other orbiter in the fleet. It also made history along the way, NASA said. Discovery flew the first female shuttle pilot, the first African-American spacewalker and the first sitting member of Congress to go to space.

"(CNN) -- The crew of the International Space Station marked the 10th anniversary of continuous human occupation of the orbiting science laboratory with a typical workday, pausing only briefly for a chat with NASA chief Charles Bolden and questions from international reporters. ""It's kind of mind-boggling when you stop and think about what you've done,"" Bolden told the crew. Bolden is a former NASA astronaut who flew on four space shuttle missions prior to the station's 2000 opening. The football-field sized platform passed the 10-year mark early Tuesday, some 57,361 orbits of Earth after the first crew came aboard, according to NASA. On October 25, the station eclipsed the previous record for constant human living in space, passing the Russian space station Mir. Since the first module, the Russian-built Zarya, launched on November 20, 1998, 103 vehicles have traveled to the station, bringing 196 people to visit or live long-term and conduct science experiments and other work, according to NASA. The station has traveled more than 1.5 billion miles -- the equivalent of eight round trips to the Sun. Human habitation of the station began in 2000. Bolden said the international flavor of the station's construction, supply system and staffing do more to prove that humans can get along than many earthbound diplomats, Bolden told the astronauts. ""You're part of an amazing legacy there on the station,"" he said. People need look no further than the anniversary to recognize the station's most remarkable accomplishment, said astronaut Shannon Walker. ""Ten years of constant habitation in space is an amazing achievement in and of itself,"" she said. But the station has also produced advances in science, medicine and environmental technology that are helping change life on Earth, according to NASA. The agency says more than 600 science experiments have been conducted aboard the station, with results helping produce new strategies to deliver cancer drugs, advances in vaccine development and a possible treatment for a form of muscular dystrophy, among other things. The commemoration of the anniversary was clouded by the station's uncertain future. While the 15 nations involved in the space station program have agreed in principal to continue operating it for another decade, the United States is scheduled to retire its space shuttle fleet after two more flights -- cutting off a main supply route to get materials to the station. While Russian spacecraft and commercial providers are expected to take up some of the slack and help keep the station operating for another 10 years, station crew members acknowledged that the shuttle's retirement will make the station's mission more challenging. ""I think it's not a real problem to supply the station with consumables and some other items, but I think it's a real problem to deliver the results,"" Russian cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri said during a news conference with reporters. ""Now we can deliver only digital data, but sometimes it's necessary to bring back some physical items.""","Monday was the 10th anniversary of a constant human presence aboard the station .
It's now the longest continuously lived-in space vehicle in history .

"Bukavu, Democratic Republic Of Congo (CNN) -- Many of Congo's rape survivors took to the streets Sunday to speak out against sexual violence in a country where it has become a weapon of war. ""My heart is in pain, why are you raping me?"" sang the rape victims, many of whom left hospital beds to join the march in eastern Congo. ""They have had enough, enough, enough, enough,"" said Nita Vielle, a Congolese women's activist, of the women marching. ""Enough of the war, of the rape, of nobody paying attention to what's happening to them."" The United Nations has named the Democratic Republic of Congo the ""rape capital of the world,"" with 15,000 women raped in eastern Congo last year. The attacks occurred in parts of the country where armed rebel groups moved into areas considered to be pro-government but lacking in army or police protection, according to the U.N. Margot Wallstrom, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative on sexual violence in conflict, said recently that one distraught Congolese woman had told her that ""a dead rat is worth more than the body of a woman."" ""It was an expression of how human rights violations against women are still the lowest on a fool's hierarchy of war time horrors,"" she said. Sunday's march was organized by the World March of Women in association with local women's groups. Organizers hoped the march would combat the stigma attached to rape victims and draw international attention to the problem of rape as a war tactic. ""It's just great to have so many women out on the streets,"" said Celia Alldridge, a representative from World March of Women. ""We believe that women should not be made prisoners in their own homes."" Among throngs of marchers, many clad in bright traditional garb and carrying homemade signs, one Congolese marcher echoed that sentiment. ""I tell you, it's a wonderful thing to see all the women together, just for one reason -- for the peace of the women of Congo,"" said Mary Georges. ""This is the freedom of the Congo women."" Last month, a U.N. report slammed Congo's security forces for failing to prevent a wave of mass rapes over several days during the summer. The preliminary report confirms the rape of at least 303 civilians between July 30 and August 2 in the Walikale region of Congo's North Kivu province. The report points to serious shortcomings in the preparedness and response of the local detachments of the Congolese army and the police stationed in the area. It also notes that their failure to prevent or stop the attacks was compounded by subsequent failings on the part of U.N. stabilization mission forces in Congo. The report said the force had not received any specific training in the protection of civilians, and suffered from a number of operational constraints, including a limited capacity to gather information, as well as the lack of a telecommunications system in the area. ""The scale and viciousness of these mass rapes defy belief,"" said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay. ""Even in the eastern part of DRC where rape has been a perennial and massive problem for the past 15 years, this incident stands out,"" Pillay said, ""because of the extraordinarily cold-blooded and systematic way in which it appears to have been planned and executed.""","Rape is a weapon of war in Congo .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Once a star soccer player, Frankie Lobos loves being out on the field, in the open air. But the soccer legend fell on hard times, and became a miner. ""Being on the football field is what I have spent my life doing,"" he says. ""I never wanted to be a miner. Then I was in a mine for 69 days with little chance of surviving."" He was one of 33 miners trapped when his mine collapsed in August. Lobos feared the mine would be his tomb. ""We didn't have days in the mine,"" he says through a translator. ""It was just one long night. A night of complete darkness."" Alone, in the dark and starving. ""Imagine it, a spoon and a half of tuna every 24 hours, then every 48 hours, at the end it was every 72 hours. There was no water left, only the water that was in the machines and we couldn't drink it,"" he recalls. They were running out of everything. The men blindly scrounged for cigarette butts from the mine floor. The only thing they had in abundance was fear. Then, 17 days after the collapse, a drill bore through, bringing both excitement and hope. ""It was chaos. All of us agreed to be calm, but it wasn't possible. That was when we returned from the dead,"" he says. He had only one wish. ""All we hoped for was to see our families again. I dreamed of them every day. I saw all their faces. That was what gave me the will to survive,"" he says. And the family shared his will, toughing it out for weeks in the tent camp near the mine, and raising his spirits over a video conference system. Lobos feared he would never return to his soccer field, right up until the moment the first rescuer arrived in the mine. But it turned out that the miner and the rescuer had already met. Rescuer Miguel Gonzalez also played professional football in Chile -- against Lobos, the man he was about to save. ""He told me 'I played against you,'"" when he arrived. ""I chatted with him about it, about playing with him and I said, 'Make my rescue quick. I want to be with my family.'"" His ascent was quick -- so quick that at one point he panicked, thinking he was falling back into the mine. Gonzalez's rescue of Lobos is not the end of their intertwined destinies. The men will meet once more on the football field in a face off between the miners and the rescuers. President Sebastian Pinera set up the match and joked that the winners get to stay a night in La Moneda, the presidential palace, while the losers have to go back to the mine. Lobos expects to be on the winning side. His glory days may be behind him, Lobos says, but never bet against a Chilean miner.","Frankie Lobos once played pro soccer, but fell on hard times .
He ended up in the Chilean mine that collapsed .
When his rescuer arrived, it turned out they had met before ."
"(CNN) -- Republicans appeared to have regained the majority of U.S. governorships Tuesday night, capturing 10 in states where the previous executives were Democrats, according to CNN projections of exit poll data. But Democrats scored two takeaways, including in California, where CNN projected that Jerry Brown will defeat Republican Meg Whitman for the governorship now held by Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is stepping down under term limits. Brown returns to the governor's mansion in California 28 years after his last term ended. The other takeaway state was Hawaii. GOP women made major inroads, as New Mexico's Susana Martinez, South Carolina's Nikki Haley and Oklahoma's Mary Fallin all defeated their Democratic opponents. A widely publicized battle in New York ended with a projected Democratic victory as state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo slid past Republican favorite Carl Paladino, according to CNN analysis of exit poll data. Son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, the younger Cuomo squared off against Paladino, a businessman and developer, after the Tea Party-endorsed candidate scored an upset victory over former Rep. Rick Lazio earlier in the GOP primary. Cuomo added to Democratic wins in New Hampshire, Maryland and Arkansas, according to the projections. But governorships in Kansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa all have gone from Democrat to GOP, according to CNN analysis of exit poll data. Republicans, however, lost Rhode Island. But Democrats didn't win it either. That's because Independent Lincoln Chafee, a former Republican, was projected by CNN to defeat Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio for the governorship, which had been vacated by Republican Gov. Don Carcieri because of term limits. Chafee becomes Rhode Island's first governor since 1857 who is neither a Republican nor a Democrat. Often overshadowed during midterm campaigns, governorships can impact national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates. Republicans needed a net gain of only three governorships Tuesday for a majority nationally. If the eight-state pickup margin holds, the GOP will have gained a national gubernatorial majority plus five. Tennessee became the first Republican pickup Tuesday evening, when Knoxville Mayor Bill Haslam edged past Democrat Mike McWherter. Haslam will succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen, who was precluded from running again by term limits. In Michigan, Republican Rick Snyder defeated Democratic Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, CNN projected Tom Corbett, who had an 8-percentage-point lead with 84 percent of precincts reporting, as the winner over Democrat Dan Onorato. In Wisconsin, Republican Scott Walker was CNN's projected winner over Democrat Tom Barrett. In Kansas, Sam Brownback won easily over Democrat Tom Holland. In Wyoming, Republican Matt Mead was the projected winner over Leslie Petersen. In Oklahoma, Fallin defeated another woman, Democrat Jari Askins. In Ohio, Republican John Kasich, a former congressman turned pundit, defeated Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland, who was seeking a second term. In Iowa, Republican former Gov. Terry Branstad, who had the job in 1980s and 1990s, defeated Democratic Gov. Chet Culver. And in New Mexico, also a contest between female candidates, Martinez defeated Diane Denish in a race to replace Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson. Addressing her cheering supporters Tuesday night, Martinez hit repeatedly on one theme: ""You were the ones telling me how desperately we needed to move New Mexico in a new direction,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, New Mexico chose a new direction."" In South Carolina, Haley became the state's first female governor by defeating Democratic opponent Vincent Sheheen in a tightly contested race. Haley, a 38-year-old state representative, is supported by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Tea Party activists, and has promised to tackle unemployment and excess government spending by way of a 10-year plan. During a bitter campaign run-up, Sheheen hammered Haley on reports of late tax payments while campaigning on the scandal surrounding the former governor. The governor's race in South Carolina had earned a prominent stage among a series of high-profile gubernatorial elections that some analysts speculate could be a bellwether for future presidential politics. Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Utah, Texas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina returned Republicans to their governor's mansions; Colorado, Arkansas, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts and Maryland did likewise for Democrats. In Texas, incumbent Gov. Rick Perry defeated Democrat Bill White, and Democratic incumbents held on to governorships in Arkansas and New Hampshire, based on projections. In New Hampshire, incumbent John Lynch bested Republican challenger John Stephens, while in Arkansas, Democrat Mike Beebe has defeated GOP nominee Jim Keet. Democratic incumbents also held on in Massachusetts, where Gov. Deval Patrick was projected to defeat Republican Charlie Baker, and in Maryland, where Gov. Martin O'Malley was projected to prevail over Bob Ehrlich. In Baltimore, O'Malley thanked state employees and campaign workers, pledging to ""move Maryland forward"" by creating jobs and in what he described as a ""new economy."" In South Dakota, Republican Lt. Gov. Dennis Daugaard edged past Democrat Scott Heidepriem. In Georgia, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, the Republican candidate, defeated former Gov. Roy Barnes, according to a CNN projection based on exit poll data. Deal narrowly defeated Tea Party favorite and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel for the state's Republican nomination. The national spotlight turned on the Georgia race when national GOP heavyweights Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney endorsed Handel, while Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich backed Deal. In Vermont, GOP Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie was up against Democratic challenger Peter Shumlin. Dubie ran uncontested in the GOP primary, while Shumlin, a state senator, couldn't declare victory in his crowded primary until a recount was certified almost three weeks after the voting. According to Vermont law, if no gubernatorial candidate wins a majority of the vote on Election Day, the responsibility of electing the governor falls to the state legislature, with each state senator and representative casting one vote. Democrats currently hold a decisive 117 to 55 lead in the legislature. In Nevada, Republican Brian Sandoval, who had beaten scandal-plagued incumbent Gov. Jim Gibbons in the primary, defeated Democrat Rory Reid. In Arizona, incumbent Republican Gov. Jan Brewer defeated Democrat Terry Goddard. In Alaska, Palin's successor as governor, former Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell, beat Democrat Ethan Berkowitz, a former state representative. In Hawaii, Democrat and former Rep. Neil Abercrombie won back the governorship for his party by defeating Republican Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona. Republican Gov. Linda Lingle left the seat due to term limits.","NEW: Republicans have knocked Democrats out of 10 governorships so far .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet claimed victory in his bid for a full term Wednesday, but his Republican opponent has yet to concede the race. ""I am humbled by your support,"" the Democratic incumbent told supporters in Denver. ""I won't let you down."" Bennet was appointed in 2009 to replace Ken Salazar, now the Obama administration's interior secretary, and was seeking a full six-year term this year. With 90 percent of the vote, he led Republican challenger Ken Buck by about 6,400 votes out of nearly 1.6 million cast. Bennet fended off a primary challenge from former House Speaker Andrew Romanoff in August and was a top GOP target this year. Buck, a former Weld County district attorney who garnered an upset primary win with Tea Party support, had not yet conceded the race. Before Bennet's announcement, his campaign was still reviewing in what counties still had returns outstanding, and the number of provisional ballots remaining. ""We will have further comment later today,"" the campaign said.","""I won't let you down,"" Bennet promises .

"London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victoria's Secret supermodel-turned-philanthropist. Despite her riches, Nemcova, who grew up with few luxuries in communist Czechoslovakia, told CNN that her most important work is her charity, the Happy Hearts Fund. The model set up the foundation after her near-death experience in the 2004 Asian tsunami. While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not. Here, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the ""Golden City,"" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks. CNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague. Petra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was ""wow."" I was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience. The following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent. CNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words? Petra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the ""golden city,"" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush. I think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty. In five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful. CNN: What was your childhood like? Petra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless. We didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature. And the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood. But it was harder for my parents. Because if you weren't part of the system then you didn't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you. My parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you didn't get enough stamps throughout the year, you would get in trouble. CNN: What happened to you in the 2004 tsunami? Petra Nemcova: I lost my partner and physically, my pelvis was broken four times, I was drowning many times throughout the experience. There were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones. Seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers, there was just a lot of love around in that moment. That's what happens actually if you live through disasters, it brings people together, it shows that we are capable of that compassion, but unfortunately it just goes away after some time. CNN: Tell us about your foundation, Happy Hearts? Petra Nemcova: Happy Hearts is a foundation that I established after the tsunami. It helps children improve their lives after natural disasters through educational and sustainable initiatives. We build or rebuild a school, add computer labs inside and then we build businesses to sustain the school. The education is really a key not just for the children to recover faster from the disaster but also to help them, their families and communities get out of poverty. We help over 23,000 children a year. We give them hope and not just for them but for their parents and communities. The schools elevate the whole community. After the tsunami we went to other countries where disasters happened and one of them was in Indonesia. We work with local partners on the ground and have been able to build 33 kindergartens after the 2005 earthquake and that's something incredible because it really changed so many lives. Our other project is in Peru, where there was an earthquake in 2007 and we have a commitment to build three schools a year. CNN: If you only had 24 hours in Prague, what would you do? Petra Nemcova: First of all I would take my friends and family and I would walk around and go to the Charles Bridge because that is my favorite place. Then I would stop by some exhibitions of some new artist. And then I would go and sit down for some tea perhaps at the Musical House. In the evening I may go to a typical Czech pub and afterwards for a concert because I really love them; they put my mind at ease and inspire me. CNN: How creative is the city? Petra Nemcova: Many people know about Kafka and some of the other famous writers. But there is a lot of interest in music here and in different types of art. That's perhaps because art was suppressed during communist times and you were only allowed to read certain authors. That's why there is such a hunger now for everything that was forbidden. Not just Czech authors but also a lot of American authors because especially anything from U.S. was big taboo and you could not see any movies and you could not listen to any music. I discovered Stevie Wonder seven years ago and I'm still working on learning and seeing more of the great movies. CNN: If Prague were a person, who would it be? Petra Nemcova: I think Prague would be our former president Vaclav Havel. He is a proud person and Prague is a proud city; he's an artist and Prague is artistic; he's an achiever and Prague has achieved so much. He is someone people admire, as they do Prague.","Czech supermodel and philanthropist shows CNN around her ""Golden City,"" Prague .

"(CNN) -- Rangers and scientists have made contact for the first time in more than a year with critically endangered gorillas threatened by a war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a national park announced Tuesday. Young gorillas play in Congo's Virunga National Park in an undated photograph. The Congolese government and rebels agreed to allow the survey team into the gorilla section of Virunga National Park, which rebel fighters loyal to Laurent Nkunda have controlled since September 2007. Only about 200 mountain gorillas were estimated to be living in the park at last count, out of an estimated 700 in the world. The team of rangers beginning a planned monthlong survey spotted a group of gorillas Tuesday known as the Humba family group. The Humba group had nine members at last count, said Pierre Peron of Virunga National Park, and experts are eager to see how many it now includes. Hundreds of rangers had fled the fighting between Nkunda's ethnic Tutsi rebels and the Congolese army and allied militias, leaving scientists with no reliable information about the endangered gorillas.  Take a closer look at the animals » . But more than 100 rangers have returned, park spokeswoman Samantha Newport told CNN last week. At least nine mountain gorillas are known to have been killed last year, including an infant female. Before the rebels took control of the park, 72 of the gorillas were accustomed to human contact. Another 130 or so were not, making it impossible to accurately count them. The gorilla sector of the park lies in a strategically crucial area near the border of Uganda and Rwanda. The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has designated Virunga National Park as a ""world heritage site.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Police who are investigating a major wildfire in northern Israel have detained a 14-year-old boy who admitted smoking a water pipe in the woods near his village, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The wildfire killed at least 42 people and forced the evacuation of thousands of others before it was extinguished Monday, police said. The boy said he threw coals from his pipe in the woods, but then panicked and ran to school after the fire started. Two other teenagers who had been detained Monday have been released, Rosenfeld said. About 1,500 firefighters are still in the area and on standby, police spokesman Rosenfeld said. The fire, which broke out Thursday, forced the evacuations of about 17,000 people and scorched over 10,000 acres around Haifa, Israel's third largest city, threatening businesses, tourism and one of Israel's greenest regions, Mount Carmel. The developments came a day after the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to speed aid to those affected. ""I do not want delays,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. ""I do not want bureaucracy. I want processes to be shortened. I want quick solutions. I want all of the people -- within days -- to be able to return to their homes or to alternative housing, until the reconstruction work is finished."" The Cabinet has approved a series of steps aimed at kick-starting a quick response for victims. The Finance Ministry will allocate 60 million shekels ($16 million) in aid to local communities affected by the fire. Netanyahu instructed that more funding be considered if necessary. The plan will include compensating local governments for damages ""in order to meet the costs of evacuating and absorbing populations, firefighting efforts, clean-up and dealing with infrastructures,"" according to a government statement. The government said Israel's Housing Administration will station mobile structures in the communities to stand in for homes and public structures that were destroyed. A plan will also be formulated to restore animal and plant life affected in the Carmel Nature Reserve. Most of the 42 victims were cadets in Israel's prison service who arrived Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from the Damon prison near Haifa. Among the dead, 40 were apparently burned alive when their bus, traveling along a narrow mountain road, was engulfed by the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. Police said late Monday that a policewoman had died of her wounds, bringing the death toll to 42. In an interview with the newspaper, a firefighter spokesman said the bus was gone in less than three minutes. ""The bus had no chance. They tried to escape but were burned alive,"" the spokesman said. ""It was a horrific scene."" The Israeli military said the victims would be buried with full honors in military ceremonies. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's ""Little Switzerland,"" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","NEW: Israeli policewoman dies, bringing death toll to 42 .

"(CNN) -- A widely anticipated meeting of North Korean ruling party members went off anticlimactically Tuesday, with only the announcement that leader Kim Jong Il was reappointed general-secretary of the party. The Korean Workers' Party last convened its delegates more than four decades ago. On Monday, Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong Un, was promoted to the rank of general, a sign of the transitioning of power to the next generation that was nevertheless buried in the last paragraph of an article by state-run media. Opinion: Change in the wind? That kind of mystery surrounds the man who is widely expected to become the secretive communist nation's next leader. ""They don't release the information, so no one can know,"" said Kang Cheol-hwan, a North Korea defector and activist. ""When he was little, he studied in Bern (Switzerland), in a school for the elite. He got an international education."" Vice guide to North Korea . Little else is known about Kim Jong Un. Two photos of him consistently circulate in news reports outside of North Korea. That's because he's been kept off the radar by the North. Before Kim's promotion to general on Monday, North Korea's state-run media didn't mention him -- there were no family photos showing him as a youngster and no images of him by his father's side, learning to lead. He is Kim's third and youngest son. He's 27 or 28 years old. His grandfather, Kim Il Sung, ruled for nearly 50 years, and a mythic cult of personality was woven around him. His son, Kim Jong Il, took over after Kim Il Sung died of a heart attack in 1994. Kim Il Sung called himself the ""Great Leader,"" and Kim Jong Il calls himself the ""Dear Leader."" Kim Jong Il served a 20-year apprenticeship at his father's side. But with Kim Jong Il, now 68, and in poor health after suffering a stroke, analysts think succession plans have accelerated. In January 2009, South Korean intelligence reportedly intercepted a message circulated around North Korean embassies globally, stating that Kim Jong Un was being prepared for succession. Since then, there has been no further confirmation from any North Korean official source. Recent foreign visitors to Pyongyang, however, say ordinary North Koreans know his name. Schoolchildren are being taught a song called ""Footsteps,"" praising Kim Jong Un, though not by name. What is life like inside North Korea? He was also rumored to have been elevated to the powerful National Defense Committee ahead of Tuesday's party meeting. State media had said the party would assemble to discuss policies, strategies, and tactics. ""North Korea is not a country where Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Il or from Kim Jong Il to Kim Jong Un pass power from one person to another person. The succession goes from one power collective to another collective,"" said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea. ""I see little possibility for clash domestically between different groups."" One key question if Kim Jong Un does inherit leadership: Can he sustain his grandfather's and father's legacy, even as North Koreans go hungry while the country pours money into its nuclear program and military? Kim Jong Il prioritized the military and bypassed the party. He might now be preparing a more dovish course, given the catastrophic economic conditions his country faces after a decade and a half of military confrontation, said Suh Jae-jean, president of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification. Kim Jong Il introduced his ""Red Banner"" policy in 1996, a more militant tack than his father's blend of Stalinism and Korean self-reliance. North Korea has acknowledged producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The U.N. Security Council last year condemned North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket, saying it violated a resolution banning ballistic missile testing. The North expelled U.S. nuclear experts and U.N. nuclear inspectors after the rebuke. Journalists Andrew Salmon and Tomas Etzler contributed to this report.","Kim Jong Un is widely expected to inherit power from his father .

"(EW.com) -- Moviegoers have grown increasingly intense about avoiding ''spoilers'' (probably because of all the information that spills out of the Internet.) In that light, ""Secretariat,"" a benignly inspirational Disney sports drama about the legendary racehorse who won the Triple Crown in 1973, offers a fascinating test case for how much spoilers sometimes don't matter. Going into the movie, we absolutely know that Secretariat, the chestnut Thoroughbred who galloped to triumph through a rare combination of total speed and maximum stamina, will win his three big races (the first time a horse had done so in 25 years.) Yet there he is, in his famous blue-and-white blinker hood, pounding the track at the Kentucky Derby, starting way in the back (as was his style), then overtaking one horse after another, the camera following right on his hooves. And damned if, at that moment, we aren't as excited as children, our hearts in our throats as he thunders to victory, almost as if we had no idea what was coming. When Secretariat is running his races, the movie has a hokey, old-fashioned appeal. It uses a fantastic gospel anthem to stoke our feelings, the Edwin Hawkins Singers' 1969 rendition of ''Oh Happy Day.'' And that song, with its funky-sublime syncopation, its waves of lordly joy, makes us feel that, yes, Secretariat really was a miracle horse, a competitor graced by Someone Up There. Off the racetrack, however, ""Secretariat"" is a sketchy and rather innocuously upbeat movie. The director, Randall Wallace (""We Were Soldiers,"") often seems to be aiming for the same Christian demographic that helped make a hit out of ""The Blind Side."" I personally have no objection to a horse film that views a creature as magnificent as Secretariat with religious awe, but in this case the uplift has a downside. The film is so insistently square it undercuts the very drama it's out to capture. The central figure, Penny Chenery (Diane Lane), is a housewife who knew nothing about running a horse farm when she took over the management of her ailing father's Meadow Stables in Virginia. Penny wins Secretariat in a coin toss (though the film suggests it's her womanly vantage that leads her to foresee how the horse's bloodlines will give him racing strength.) It's a pleasure to see her take charge, fighting her way up in a racehorse world thick with the corruptions of men. Lane, wearing Pat Nixon's hair, makes Penny devoutly traditional but never prim; it doesn't scare her that she's in over her head. She recruits the eccentric trainer Lucien Laurin, played by John Malkovich, and the actor, wearing crazy hats and spouting French whenever he gets angry, makes us feel his horse fervor. Penny, in her devotion to Secretariat's racing career, tears her family life apart. Yet this central conflict comes to very little. (Dylan Walsh plays her husband with just enough mild testiness to make you wish he'd shown more.) Penny's obsession remains flawless, noble, benevolent. The only real drama is that (spoiler!) Secretariat occasionally loses. As long as he's winning, though, this pleasantly rote movie will rouse you. B- . See the full article on EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court has opened a probe into the North Korean shelling of Yeonpyeong Island last month and the March sinking of a South Korean warship, allegedly by a North Korean submarine, to evaluate if the incidents constitute war crimes, the court said Monday. ""The office of the prosecutor has received communications alleging that North Korean forces committed war crimes in the territory of the Republic of Korea,"" the court said in a written statement. ""The prosecutor of the ICC, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, confirmed that the office has opened a preliminary examination."" A preliminary investigation will determine if the criteria are met for opening an investigation under the Rome Statute, the court said. That statute set up the court and governs it. North Korean forces launched an artillery barrage that killed four people on South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island on November 23. Pyongyang accused the South of provoking the attack, which also injured 18 people, because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in Northern waters. In March, 46 South Korean sailors died when the warship Cheonan sank in the Yellow Sea. South Korea, as well as an international investigation conducted by South Korea, U.S., Swedish, British and Australian officials, have blamed a North Korean torpedo for sinking the ship. North Korea has denied culpability. The International Criminal Court, located in The Hague, Netherlands, has had jurisdiction over ""war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide"" committed on South Korean territory since 2003, the statement said. South Korea is a signatory of the Rome Statute and has been a party since November 2002, although it did not take effect in South Korea until February 2003, the court said. North Korea is not a party to the treaty; neither is the United States. The court investigates and prosecutes those accused of crimes including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Other preliminary investigations are being conducted into situations in Afghanistan, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Georgia, Honduras, Nigeria and the Palestinian territory, the court said. Investigations are taking place into situations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Northern Uganda, Sudan's Darfur region, the Central African Republic and Kenya. It is unclear what might happen if the court decides prosecution is warranted. The ICC has no police force and relies on countries who are party to the Rome Statute to turn suspects in. In March 2009, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur in western Sudan. However, al-Bashir has thus far managed to evade custody. Several ICC signatory countries have not cooperated in arresting him. The African Union has warned against his arrest, claiming it will destabilize Sudan. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, a former vice president in the Democratic Republic of Congo, went on trial last month in the ICC. Prosecutors allege Bemba led a militia in attacks on civilians in the Central African Republic between October 2002 and March 2003.","A preliminary investigation will determine whether a probe will be opened .

"Washington (CNN) -- A malfunctioning launch control center for a portion of the nation's nuclear missiles remained offline Wednesday as investigations continued into a weekend computer problem that disrupted communications with more than 10 percent of America's land-based nuclear missiles. Early indications are that Saturday's disruption to one of the launch control centers linked to Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming lasted longer than an hour, Lt. Col. John Thomas said. The problem appears to be very similar to glitches at two other nuclear missile sites in the late 1990s. The United States has 450 land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in its nuclear arsenal. The 50 Minuteman III missiles involved in Saturday's incident are all currently at ""normal operating capability,"" said Thomas, the director of public affairs for the Air Force's Global Strike Command. But while those missiles are typically controlled by five underground launch control centers, only four are currently online, he added. The fifth control center remains offline and is believed to be the source of a computer hardware problem that caused a communications disruption Saturday. It has been electronically isolated from the launch system while the problem is investigated and solved, Thomas said. It's not unusual for a missile squadron to take one of its five launch control centers out of service to perform maintenance, Thomas explained. In fact, he said, an entire squadron of missiles can be controlled by just one control center or even from a command aircraft flying nearby. Thomas said that as soon as computer messages started telling the squadron commanders at Warren Air Force Base that a problem existed over the weekend, closed-circuit television security cameras were used to check each silo and make sure no obvious problems existed. Then, Air Force personnel from Warren were sent to all 50 silos, in a ""not insignificant effort,"" to visually inspect them and make sure they were secure. Some of the missile silos are hundreds of miles from the base. The investigation is still going on, Thomas said, but early indications are that a computer component on the fifth launch control center continually tried to communicate with the missiles in the silos when it wasn't supposed to. He compared it to five people with walkie-talkies and one of them sitting on the button, making it impossible for the other four to use theirs. Once the fifth launch control center was isolated, the other four established communications with all 50 missiles, and the squadron was back to normal, Thomas explained. The process of isolating the problem and getting the other control centers linked back to the missiles took more than an hour, he said. Because of redundancies in the nuclear force, several military officials have said, the president always had the ability to order the missiles to launch. As for the cause, Thomas said it appears the computer hardware problem is very similar to problems in the late 1990s at the two other Air Force bases that control America's intercontinental ballistic missile forces: Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and Malstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The circumstances of those incidents were much like what happened at the Warren base, he said. The Air Force and Strategic Command, which would take charge of the missiles if the president were ready to launch them, is investigating the incident. Thomas said that right now, investigators are ""not ruling anything out."" But he said there is ""no indication of intentional of malicious activity."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates is monitoring those investigations closely, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said.","One launch control center for the nation's nuclear missiles is offline .

"(Oprah.com) -- Grandma's waiting for me on a lone bench in the heat, just beyond her building's shaded front entrance. She's wearing denim capris and a lightweight cable-knit sweater that precisely matches the yellow patent leather moccasins on her feet. Saucer-sized sunglasses block out her face, and her silvery hair is cut short and chic. I didn't want to meet Grandma out here. At 86, she's declared herself done with sunscreen. Couldn't we meet at her room instead? ""It's not a room,"" she snapped. ""That's offensive. This isn't a nursing home. It's my apartment."" More specifically, it's the senior living residence she's come to rule. Social dominance isn't something I ever expected from my grandmother. Except when spending time with the family, she's mostly kept to herself. After my grandfather's heart stopped beating in 1965, Grandma gradually did away with the supper clubs and bowling leagues. Friends who still had husbands, she felt, couldn't empathize, and so she isolated herself. There were kids to feed, bills to pay, clocks to punch. Dating? No chance. Grandma did interact with new men all the time, but as a saleswoman. She picked out shirts and ties, pocket squares and cuff links, like she had for her husband, but in a way that would never again leave her vulnerable to loss. The wall Grandma had built around herself didn't start crumbling until eight years ago, when she moved in to a senior residence in suburban Detroit. Instantly there were people to deal with -- everywhere and at all times. Grandma was the new girl. Seven decades removed from high school, and she was once again confronting the notion of how to fit in. Her first year there, instead of spending winter in Florida with my aunt like she usually did, Grandma opted to stay in Michigan, where it was freezing, primarily so she wouldn't come back to dining hall exile. Oprah.com: Becoming a grandmother . A lot has changed since then. Now Grandma holds an important elected seat on the residents' council, and enforces behavioral standards at the tables where she eats her meals and plays her card games. When one woman dared wag a finger at her over a perceived canasta infraction, Grandma almost snapped it off. When a new resident wanted to sit at Grandma's dinner table, Grandma said the matter had to be put to a vote. Grandma, it seems, had morphed into a senior citizen Mean Girl. Grandma wants to show me her people. When she leads me inside, a hierarchy emerges. Here, there are two types of women: standers and sitters. Mobility is the first obvious social signifier. The more one gets around, the more people one talks to; the more people one talks to, the more friends one makes. Earlier in life, this might be called schmoozing or flirting. Here it's called ""Thank God I Can Still Move."" But sitters, too, have their own pecking order. I notice a group clustered near a woman with a lion's mane of white hair, some chunky orange jewels hanging around her neck. And while she clearly commands a certain respect among her clique, she lacks the mojo of a stander like Grandma, who never stops to sink into the couches where sitters sometimes doze off. ""In the lobby!"" she says, indignant. ""It makes it look like old people live here. If they want to sleep, they should go back to their beds."" Grandma's not shy about publicly vocalizing her disgust for slackers who reflect poorly on the group. When she tells a neighbor her hair looks like a ""dishmop,"" the woman actually replies, ""Thank you for letting me know."" Under her breath, Grandma tells me, ""Here, they appreciate my honesty."" No, she isn't shy with criticism -- Grandma informed me recently that my girlfriend moved out because I'd never make enough money to satisfy a woman, and that my writing had possibly peaked. But she's never really trained her sharp tongue on anyone but family. Her willingness to unleash it here is a measure of her newfound confidence in her position. On the way to current events class, we meet a man who tells Grandma she ""really fills out her outfit,"" as good a catcall as you'll get around here. Earlier, Grandma explained her position on male attention. ""I allow some of the men here to flirt with me,"" she said. ""I tease them, but what do I need a man for? Your grandfather's been gone for 45 years. After him, there's nothing else."" It's obvious she puts some effort into self-presentation, though, as do the other ladies here. Wardrobe matching now serves the same purpose as showing skin once did; sync the beading on your cardigan with the details on your brocade socks and you'll really start turning heads. Oprah.com: The perfect recipe for family . Once class begins, Grandma scolds a woman sitting behind us who believes she is whispering, but whose busted hearing aid has made it impossible for her to gauge what a whisper is. ""We have a speaker!"" Grandma barks. Everyone applauds. The man at the lectern, who is well into his tenth decade of life, continues part two of his three-part series on the collapse of the economy: ""It's hard for young people today,"" he says, ""to earn a decent wage."" Grandma bumps my shoulder with hers. I'm unsure whether the contact is commentary on my occupational status or evidence of a balance issue. Before dinner, as she does every night, Grandma occupies a table just outside the dining room. ""I hold court,"" she says, and almost as soon as she says it, people begin to congregate around her. Every seat is saved for the regular cast -- all standers, no sitters. When a woman who isn't part of the group tries to claim a chair, just for a minute so she can tie her shoe, Grandma tells her she'd better move on, and swiftly; the seat is spoken for. ""Everyone's happy where they are,"" Grandma says. ""If you try to take anybody's seat, they'll kill you."" At dinner I'm quick to say hi to the latest addition at the table, the woman most recently voted in. Her magenta sweater set perfectly matches the detail work on her cane, which marks her as a potential player. The other ladies quickly jump into a conversation about what they should name their Wii bowling team; one suggests the Cougars. Then they try to peer-pressure the new girl into ditching her cane for a walker. Essentially, it's the same conversation younger women have about losing their virginity: all about what other people will think, how it will change you, and how to manipulate a new apparatus without getting hurt. ""You'll get used to it,"" they tell the new girl. ""It's only hard at first."" I keep waiting for Grandma to speak up, but she's surprisingly above the fray, working very hard at cutting up a friend's food. ""Macular degeneration,"" Grandma tells me. The queen bee precisely tracks everybody's ailments. Grandma turns the woman's plate into a diagram for manageable eating, separating the tuna salad from the wax beans from the roasted potatoes, grouping each thing into a perfectly formed triangle. If she's newly emboldened to boss around people outside the family, it seems she's also found genuine strength in being needed, in rediscovering the moxie it takes to give. When the meal is over, Grandma ambles to the corner of the room to retrieve a friend's walker. Grandma shouldn't be getting around without her own walker, but I think she finds it useful here to demonstrate that she still can. On her way back, she stops to speak with a woman whose face looked normal yesterday but today resembles a mask of rotten plums. She has fallen and bruised herself severely. Grandma did this once, too. I'm watching, actually fearing that my new alpha grandma is about to administer some tough love. I'm ready to see tears. But as Grandma walks back toward me, I notice that the woman, so brutally and freshly injured, is somehow...smiling. I ask Grandma what she could possibly have said. ""I've learned compassion here,"" she tells me, simply. She knows I'm stunned. ""I smile at everyone now. I'm finally at peace. You should come to choir practice tomorrow. I want you to hear me sing."" Oprah.com: 8 trick holiday situations and how to overcome them . Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles Police want to question a ""person of interest"" in the theft of nearly all of legendary tennis champion Pete Sampras' trophy collection from a public storage facility. The 14-time Grand Slam titleholder learned that 51 of his 64 championship trophies -- including those marking his first Australian Open cup, five season-ending ATP World Tour titles, two Davis Cup wins and other memorabilia -- were among the coveted items stolen. The theft occurred about one month ago, police said. ""It was a very highly secure storage center,"" said Lt. Robert Edgar, who supervises a Special Burglary Section at Los Angeles Police headquarters.  He declined to give further details about the investigation or the potential market value of the stolen items. Sampras, his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, and their two sons recently moved from their Thousand Oaks, California, estate to Brentwood. Their Thousand Oaks property on the grounds of the Sherwood Country Club is listed for $25 million. Sampras held the No. 1 ranking on the Association of Tennis Professionals from 1993 to 1998.  Those six trophies are also missing. He defeated Andre Agassi at the 2002 U.S. Open before retiring the following year with the most grand slam wins in tennis history. Roger Federer later surpassed his record with 16 major titles.","Sampras and his family recently moved to a new home .

"(CNN) -- Newcastle United have sacked manager Chris Hughton, the first English Premier League dismissal of the season. The 51-year-old Hughton led the club back to the Premier League at their first attempt, following relegation the previous season, and had guided them to 11th place in the table. The Magpies have produced some superb results in recent weeks, notably a 1-0 victory at Arsenal and a 5-1 destruction of north-east rivals Sunderland. However, Sunday's 3-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion meant the club have now gone five games without a win, although they did claim a 1-1 home draw with Chelsea during that period. Explaining their decision, the Newcastle board of directors issued a statement saying: ""The board now feels an individual with more managerial experience is needed to take the club forward."" Hughton, who became Newcastle's eighth manager in six years when he was promoted from first team coach following the club's relegation in 2008-2009, had never held a managerial post before. However, he proved a popular figure with Newcastle supporters, who have been critical of owner Mike Ashley's running of the club in recent years. The mild-mannered Hughton, who has worked without an assistant since October, was unusually angry following Sunday's loss to WBA, locking his players in the changing room for an hour after the match. However, his post-match media comments made little indication that he was expecting to be sacked. Newcastle have put former player Peter Beardsley in temporary charge ahead of an appointing Hughton's replacement. Meanwhile, Italian Serie A side Brescia have sacked coach Giuseppe Iachini after a run of 11 league games without a win which has left them fourth bottom of the table. The club have picked up only three points in the last three months and Saturday's 3-0 defeat at leaders AC Milan proved the final straw for the board.","Newcastle United sack manager Chris Hughton after 3-1 defeat at WBA .

"(CNN) -- Tearful relatives sent messages of love and concern Wednesday night to a 12-year-old girl who authorities believe was abducted by the boyfriend of her dead mother. Virginia police said earlier that someone may be helping Jeffrey Scott Easley, 32, subject of a felony abduction warrant in the case of Brittany Mae Smith. Police are ""still actively searching"" for Brittany, and believe she and the suspect may be camping in the region, Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder told reporters. More than 375 tips have come in. ""I prayed for you everyday since I found out you were gone and will continue to pray until you are found and returned to us,"" Brittany's cousin, Kim Stephenson, said at an evening press conference. Brittany is believed to be with Easley, who met the girl's mother on the internet, authorities said. They do not know if Brittany went with Easley willingly. The pair may be seeking refuge in another state, the chief said. ""As to what relationship Jeff Easley and Brittany may have between them is irrelevant,"" Lavinder said. ""With a child, consent is irrelevant in the eyes of the law. She is a victim."" Authorities provided images of two tattoos, including a red star, Easley is believed to have. Authorities also showed an image of a blue dome tent they believe Easley purchased December 3 at a local Walmart. Easley and Brittany are believed to have bought several other items at a Salem, Virginia, Walmart before they disappeared. Lavinder said the key is finding a silver 2005 Dodge Neon four-door sedan with Virginia tag XKF-2365 that belonged to the girl's dead mother. ""For someone just to drop off the face of the earth -- I think that someone has to be providing them some money or some other support for them to remain unlocated,"" Lavinder said Wednesday. Authorities launched a search for the seventh-grader Monday after officers found the body of Brittany's mother, Tina Smith, 41, inside the family's Salem home. Tina Smith's co-workers contacted police after the woman failed to show up for work Monday morning. Smith's death is being investigated as a homicide, Roanoke County spokeswoman Teresa Hall told HLN Wednesday. She would not provide details of an autopsy. Lavinder asked Easley to safely return Brittany so that she could attend Tina Smith's funeral. ""I thinks it's important that she be able to say goodbye to her mother,"" he said. Police are examining social media sites that may have been used by Easley and Tina Smith. A friend of Brittany Smith told the Roanoke Times that the missing girl called her several weeks ago. Brittany was afraid her mother's live-in boyfriend ""would come over and take her away and hurt her mom,"" Rebecca Kilian, 13, told the Times on Tuesday. Kilian told the Times that Brittany asked her to stay on the phone until her mom got home. Virginia State Police are working with North Carolina, Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Florida to issue alerts in their states for the missing vehicle and Easley and Brittany Smith, authorities said. Police are ""confident"" that the girl is with Easley, Lavinder said. He described Easley as a ""friend of the family"" who ""developed a relationship"" with her. Easley moved in with Smith and her daughter in October, the chief said. After finding Tina Smith's body, police soon got information that Brittany Smith's whereabouts were unknown, leading them to issue the statewide alert. ""We found out pretty quickly that (Brittany) had not shown up for school. Nobody seemed to know where she was,"" said Roanoke County Police Lt. Chuck Mason Monday, according to CNN affiliate WSET of Lynchburg, Virginia, adding that police were concerned her disappearance ""has something to do with the homicide."" Easley, a 265-pound white male, is 5 feet, 11 inches tall, has brown hair and hazel eyes, the Amber Alert says. Brittany Smith is 5 feet tall, weighs 100 pounds, and has straight brown hair and brown eyes. Hall said authorities don't yet have a specific search area, as they are uncertain which direction Easley might be heading or how far he might have gotten. They have asked anyone with information to call 911 or Roanoke County police at 540-777-8641.","NEW: Relatives plead for girl to come home .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll from a plane crash Sunday in Karachi, Pakistan, rose to 12 after an official confirmed the deaths of four people who were on the ground. The four laborers were sleeping in an under-construction building that the plane crashed into, said Pervez George, a spokesman for Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. Additionally, a man on a motorcycle was critically injured when the plane crashed, George said. The plane crashed early Sunday in the southern port city, killing eight Russian nationals on board and sending flames shooting through the sky, a Pakistani official said. The cargo plane took off at 1:45 a.m. (3:45 p.m. Saturday ET) from the Jinnah Karachi International Airport for Khartoum, Sudan, and went down a few minutes later in the Gulistan-e Johar section of Karachi, an area where many Pakistani naval officers live. The plane appeared to hit several buildings that were under construction. The pilot appeared to deliberately bring the plane down in a less densely populated residential area in order to save lives, . Masood Raza, a Karachi district government official, told CNN affiliate GEO News in Pakistan. ""If the plane would have crashed in a (more crowded) residential area, it would have been a very big disaster for the city of Karachi,"" Raza said. The Russian-made cargo plane was carrying relief supplies, including tents, to Africa before it went down. The plane arrived in Karachi on Saturday from Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, George said. A witness told CNN that he saw fire on one of the plane's wings before it crashed. Firefighters, rescue personnel and area residents rushed to the scene, with jet fuel fanning the large flames and huge plumes of smoke. The blaze was put out by 4 a.m., according to George, but rescue personnel continued to comb through the rubble looking for other people possibly killed or hurt. Bystander Mohammed Raees told GEO News that he was injured after flaming parts of a building hit him and the motorcyle he was preparing to ride. Hospital sources told the CNN affiliate that Raees had burns over 60 percent of his body.","Four workers on the ground were killed in the crash .

"(CNN) -- English club Liverpool qualified for the knockout stages of Europe's second-tier Europa League on Thursday along with Paris St. Germain, Besiktas and Dynamo Kiev. Liverpool continued their minor revival since the arrival of new American owners, but allowed second-placed Steaua Bucharest to come from behind and earn a 1-1 draw. Serbia international Milan Jovanovic headed in a 19th-minute cross from Dutch winger Ryan Babel, but Spanish goalkeeper Jose Reina allowed the home side to level with half an hour to play as he failed to keep out a header by Eder Bonfim. That kept Roy Hodgson's team three points clear ahead of the final Group K match at home to Utrecht on December 15. The Dutch club are five points behind their upcoming opponents following a 3-3 draw at home to Napoli -- who have also drawn four of their five matches. Balotelli double helps Manchester City qualify . Edinson Cavani scored a hat-trick to help the Italian club come from 3-1 down and end their hosts' hopes of progressing, while the Serie A outfit can through to the last 32 by winning at home to the Romanians next month. Paris St. Germain qualified with a 4-2 victory over Sevilla that lifted the French side two points clear of the second-placed Spaniards in Group J. Mathieu Bodmer and Guillaume Hoarau scored from two early corners by Nene before the Brazilian midfielder made it 3-0, then Mali striker Fredi Kanoute netted a double for the visitors. Hoarau's second goal just after halftime left Sevilla needing a point from their final game at home to Borussia Dortmund to progress. The Germans kept their hopes alive with a 3-0 win at home to pointless Ukrainian side Karpaty Lviv. In Group L, Turkish side Besiktas went through with a 2-1 win at Bulgaria's CSKA Sofia. Portugal's Porto, who had already qualified, ensured top spot with a 3-1 win at Rapid Vienna, as Colombian striker Falcao scored a hat-trick to move top of the goal charts with seven. Russian club CSKA confirmed top spot in Group F, winning 5-1 at home to bottom Swiss club Lausanne for a fifth straight win. Czech side Sparta Prague will go through in second after drawing 2-2 at Palermo, with the Italian side having two players sent off. In Group D, Spanish side Villarreal moved into top spot with a 3-0 win at home to Dinamo Zagreb, with Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi scoring twice including a first-half opener from the penalty spot. The Croatians had Igor Biscan sent off in the 87th minute for handball, but Marcos Senna missed the subsequent spot-kick. Previous leaders PAOK Salonika are a point behind Villarreal, and two above next month's opponents Zagreb, following a 1-1 draw with Club Bruges. The Greeks led through Adelino Vieirinha's 25th-minute effort, but gave the bottom-placed Belgians a point through Stefan Scepovic's late equalizer. In Group E, Ukraine's Dynamo Kiev booked a last-32 berth with a 4-1 win at previously unbeaten BATE Borisov of Belarus, leaving both teams on 10 points.

"Washington (CNN) -- Superfluous (su-PER-flu-us): Adjective. Unnecessary or needless; difficult to pronounce for a president with a split lip. President Barack Obama grappled with the word Sunday evening at a White House event for this year's Kennedy Center honorees as he read from an opinion by legendary Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. ""It's this lip. It's hard to say,"" Obama said to chuckles from the audience. ""You try it when you've had 12 stitches."" The Chart: What happens when you split your lip . Obama got a dozen stitches in his lip after being elbowed during a pickup basketball game the day after Thanksgiving. He received applause from the crowd when he finally managed to pronounce the word, included in a 1926 dissent from Holmes in defense of the arts. ""To many people, the superfluous is necessary,"" Holmes wrote. ""The theater is necessary. Dance is necessary. Song is necessary. The arts are necessary. They are a necessary part of our lives."" To that, Obama added, ""The men and women here tonight embody that idea. Tonight it is my honor to offer them the appreciation of a grateful nation."" This year's Kennedy Center honorees include country-and-western singer-songwriter Merle Haggard; ex-Beatle Paul McCartney; veteran Broadway composer Jerry Herman; dancer and choreographer Bill T. Jones; and television host and actress Oprah Winfrey, a fellow Chicagoan and an early Obama supporter. At a reception in the East Room of the White House prior to the awards ceremony, the president applauded this year's honorees. ""Each of these honorees help us understand the human experience -- to illuminate our past, to help us understand our present, and to give us the courage to face our future,"" said Obama. While the president spoke of each honoree's accomplishments he used a single sentence to sum up his take on the reigning queen of daytime talk, . ""Michelle and I love Oprah,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Three people have been charged in last year's theft of the famous ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" sign at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, a prosecutor said Friday. The prosecutor, Robert Parys, said he could not immediately confirm details about those charged, but Poland's official PAP news agency reported the main suspect is a Swedish man, Anders Hoegstroem. Prosecutors say Hoegstroem incited two Poles to steal the sign, which sat atop the entrance to the camp, PAP reported. He pleaded not guilty, and would face a sentence of 10 years in prison if convicted, the news agency reported. Hoegstroem was arrested in February in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Swedish court allowed him to be transferred to Poland in April, PAP said. The sign reading ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" -- German for ""Work Sets You Free"" -- was emblematic of the Nazi camps of World War II. It was stolen in December of last year, prompting outrage around the world. The sign was found 70 hours later in a village near Torun, roughly 210 miles (340 kilometers) to the north, and had been chopped into three parts, PAP reported. The men managed to remove the heavy iron sign by unscrewing it from one side and pulling off on the other, police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel said at the time. More than 1 million people died in gas chambers or were starved to death in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex; about 90 percent of the victims were Jews.","The ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" sign was emblematic of Nazi camps .

"Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- Jakaya Kikwete is heading into his second term as president of Tanzania, after elections left one opposition politician warning that voter apathy could threaten Tanzania's young multiparty democracy . Meanwhile, the losing presidential candidate of another opposition party contended the country's intelligence forces were involved in rigging the election. The acting head of the Tanzania intelligence unit responded by accusing that candidate of lying and by saying all claims of vote rigging were baseless. Although the election took place on October 31, official results were announced on Friday. Incumbent President Kikwete garnered 5.3 million votes out of 8.6 million cast to earn a second five-year term. Of Tanzania's 20 million registered voters, only 8.6 million voters (42.8 percent) turned out to cast ballots, according to elections officials. That left Ibrahim Lipumba, leader of the Civic United Front (CUF) party, to blame voter apathy and Tanzania's National Electoral Commission, saying unless it comes out  with a way to bolster the electoral system, the country's  nascent democracy will be undermined. Lipumba's remarks came in a concession speech he made on behalf of losing political parties . This vote was the fourth general election since multiparty democracy  was restored in Tanzania in 1992, and observers and monitors have  commended the exercise as a free one, but still not fair. A European Union observer team censured the electoral commission on Wednesday, saying  its delays in issuing election results were the cause of chaos in some  constituencies. On Thursday, Martina Kabisama of  Tanzania Civil Society Consortium for Election Observation (TACCEO),  comprising 17 organizations, said the elections were free, but not fair. He cited a low level of awareness on the part of election supervisors,  problems in the permanent voter register, and use of outdated computers as  among factors affecting the election. The first runner-up in the presidential vote -- Wilbrioad Slaa of the Chama cha Demokrasia na  Maendeleo (Chadema) organization -- had 2.3 million votes while Lipumba collected 695,667 votes. Slaa did not appear when vote results were being announced Friday, having stated that the country's intelligence  was involved in rigging the election. That was followed by a denial from the country's top intelligence official. There were seven candidates in this year's general election. For his part, Kikwete  accepted his win, saying he would cooperate with all the parties to build the nation. ""We are all winners, and there is no point for any of us to fight over poles while we are building the same house,"" he said.","Voter turnout is low at only 42 percent .

"(CNN) -- The Renault Formula One team will race under the name and colors of the legendary Lotus brand next year after a change in its ownership. The team will be known as Renault Lotus GP after the French manufacturer sold its 25% stake in the team to Lotus Cars, which is owned by Malaysian carmaker Proton. Renault will continue its involvement in the sport, but as an engine supplier rather than a competing marque. The announcement means two teams will race with the Lotus name and iconic black and gold colors next season, with Tony Fernandes' Team Lotus retaining its place on the grid under its rebranded title.

"(CNN) -- Lerone Clarke of Jamaica held off the challenge of England's Mark Lewis-Francis to win the men's 100 meters title at the Commonwealth Games on Thursday. The 29-year-old stormed over the line in 10.12 seconds, 0.08 faster than Lewis-Francis. Trinidad and Tobago's Aaron Amstrong took the bronze in 10.24. Clarke took advantage of the absence of his better-known countrymen Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell to claim his Jamaica's first gold of the Delhi games. But it could have been even better for the Caribbean nation had Oshane Bailey not missed the final after pulling up with a hamstring injury after the semifinals. Lewis-Francis blamed a loose block for his failure to improve on the silver he won at the European Championships earlier this year. ""That's one of the hardest races I've done this season, there's just that little bit of disappointment knowing what could have been,"" he told BBC television. ""This is an amazing season for me, I want to say one thing: I would've won that. ""My block slipped, that's why it looks like I'm so far behind. I had to run deep within just to get a medal. There's a lot more there."" Meanwhile, Australia's Sally Pearson won the women's 100m in 11.28 seconds, but was later disqualified for a false start. Although no medals ceremony has been held, the official results list on the Games web site promoted Nigeria's Osayemi Oludamola into the gold medal position, with Natasha Mayers of St Vincent and the Grenadines (11.37) taking silver and England's Katherine Endacott getting the bronze. The Australian Commonwealth Games Association is appealing the decision. Leading sprinters Veronica Campbell-Brown, Shelly-Ann Fraser and Kerron Stewart, all from Jamaica, were not competing in Delhi. There was better news for Australia in the swimming pool, with Alicia Coutts claiming her third gold medal of the Games. Coutts had already won the 200m individual medley and 100m freestyle titles. ""It's an amazing feeling,"" she told reporters. ""I didn't think I would get one gold, let alone three - I'm stoked. ""My first win was a huge confidence booster and it's powered me through these Games.""

"(CNN) -- What happened in Yangon's University Avenue as the light began to fade last Saturday took many serious Myanmar watchers by surprise. Not only was Aung San Suu Kyi released from house arrest at the very point the military regime's containment order expired, but within a very short space of time some tens of thousands of her supporters had gathered at her gates, among them many young people who had had no exposure to her before. Any idea that Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, has been successfully sidelined in Burmese politics by her uniformed oppressors evaporated. Even so, harping on the occasion as a ""Mandela moment."" the international media provided a distorted picture. With some deft camera work and biased reporting it would be perfectly possible to sell a lie, say, that everyone in the United Kingdom is a Manchester United football fan. Not true, of course, just as any suggestion that the whole of the Burmese people, except for the senior military, is squarely behind Aung San Suu Kyi would be a misrepresentation. There are those doing quite nicely under the regime, thank you very much, there are ethnic minority members whose principal dream is autonomy, not national democracy, and there are those with little or no interest in politics. Ms. Suu Kyi is not about to assume the reins of government. Even so, it has become obvious that, politically, Aung San Suu Kyi does still command perhaps a greater following inside Myanmar than any other person or entity, whatever the outcome of the sham elections conducted a week earlier. So the question is, what will she do with such momentum behind her? The only certainty is she must tread carefully. While rebuilding her badly fractured party, the National League for Democracy, may seem a priority, how she goes about it could decide whether or not she remains at liberty. Any idea that the State Peace and Development Council (the military junta's formal title) is running out of steam is misbegotten. Senior General Than Shwe and his colleagues have, over the last few years, expended enormous energy shoring up their position -- promulgating a new constitution and choreographing the first elections in 20 years as well as building themselves a brand new and secure capital at Naypyidaw. The generals and the generals alone hold all the actual power. Should Aung San Suu Kyi resume where she left off in 2003 and campaign against the regime, addressing mass rallies up and down the country, then the generals' patience will snap, and the gates of her lakeside villa will once again be locked. Or something worse could occur. Conversely, if Aung San Suu Kyi, once she has recuperated her physical strength, does not return to the hustings, then that would seem to some like moral cowardice, as she would be the first to admit. There is perhaps another way. To remain at liberty and to stand any chance of effecting real change within Myanmar (something she has singularly failed to do thus far), Aung San Suu Kyi might be well advised to step back from the cut-and-thrust of daily politics and begin taking on the role of eminence grise, for which her personality is well suited. Let others rebuild the NLD (if such is to be permitted) while she operates as an intermediary between all the parties concerned, including the ""international community"" and the junta itself. Critics of this view will say that while Suu Kyi has always sought dialogue with the generals, they have never wanted to talk to her. But I suspect there may have been a meaningful sea change. Everything revolves around the trade sanctions imposed on Myanmar by the United States and the European Union (including Britain, the former colonial power). Sanctions have failed, driving the junta into the arms of China. The generals, however, would rather be beholden to no one at all, East or West, and they will be aware that Aung San Suu Kyi has revised her opinions, to the chagrin of some activists. Whereas when sanctions were introduced in the 1990s she countenanced them, now it seems, from recent statements she has made, she has swung to the view that sanctions hurt the ordinary people of Myanmar far more than their rulers. Could it be that the room for maneuvering improbably extended to Suu Kyi at the present time is tied to this? If anyone could persuade the West to drop sanctions, then that person is Aung San Suu Kyi. And, on the premise that politics follow economics, that would be good news indeed. A more prosperous Myanmar achieved through inward investment and all the values that come with that could also be a Myanmar where actual social and political change finally becomes a possibility. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Justin Wintle.","Justin Wintle says excitement over Aung San Suu Kyi release shows her political potency .
The military junta likely will limit her, he says, but she can use her sway to influence change .
He says she should step back from activist politics and help broker end to sanctions .

"(CNN) -- An official with the Vatican criticized the decision to award the Nobel prize for medicine to British doctor Robert G. Edwards for his work on in vitro fertilization, Italy's official news agency ANSA reported Tuesday. Ignazio Carrasco de Paula, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said giving the award to Edwards was ""completely inappropriate,"" according to the news agency. He said Edwards' work had created a market for human eggs and created problems of embryos being frozen, the news agency said. Edwards, known as the ""father of the test tube baby,"" won the Nobel Prize for medicine on Monday. His contributions to developing in vitro fertilization (IVF) ""represent a milestone in the development of modern medicine,"" the award committee said. ""As early as the 1950s, Edwards had the vision that IVF could be useful as a treatment for infertility,"" which affects about 10 percent of all couples worldwide, the committee said. ""He worked systematically to realize his goal, discovered important principles for human fertilization, and succeeded in accomplishing fertilization of human egg cells in test tubes (or more precisely, cell culture dishes). His efforts were finally crowned by success on 25 July, 1978, when the world's first 'test tube baby' was born,"" the committee said. His work has led to the birth of about four million babies, the committee said in praising his work. The prize is worth 10 million Swedish kronor (about $1.5 million). Born in Manchester, England, in 1925, Edwards is based at Cambridge University in England. The announcement marked the beginning of a week of prizes, to be awarded for physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The prize in economics will be announced next Monday.

"(CNN) -- The International Cricket Council has pointed to a lack of ""compelling evidence"" to support match-fixing claims relating to a one-day match between England and Pakistan in September. British newspaper The Sun claimed it had proof that bookmakers knew details of scoring patterns in Pakistan's innings before the match at The Oval in London began. That allegation prompted the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Ijaz Butt, to claim there was talk in bookmakers circles that England's players had been paid ""enormous amounts of money"" to lose the match. Butt later withdrew his comments after the England team threatened to take legal action against him. Now the ICC's anti-corruption and security unit (ACSU) has dropped its investigation into the match, saying there isn't strong enough evidence. A statement on the ICC's official website read: ""The ACSU has verified all the available information and concluded that there was no compelling evidence to suspect individual players or support staff. ""The investigation is now complete but if new and corroborating evidence comes to light then clearly the ACSU will re-open the matter."" The ICC said they would not comment on the case featuring three Pakistan players -- Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif -- who are currently suspended after claims of spot-fixing during the Test series with England, but they did maintain their determination to clean up the game. ICC President Sharad Pawar said: ""We have stressed that we will not tolerate any form of corruption in cricket and that we will work tirelessly to root out those who have acted in a way which brings cricket into disrepute. ""The future of our great sport depends on the public maintaining their confidence in the games they are watching. We owe it to every player, administrator, every cricket lover to win this battle against a very small minority who may wish to corrupt this game."" The ICC also said its Pakistan Task Team will work with the PCB to ""carry out any reforms which may be deemed necessary to restore confidence in the administration of the game in Pakistan."" The ICC also confirmed their intention to pave the way for a world Test championship starting in 2013. It would mean a playoff between the top four ranked Test teams every four years. ""We have agreed in principle to exciting and far-reaching proposals to tackle this most important issue,"" said ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat. ""The proposals, especially introducing more meaningful context, means we now have the potential to follow international cricket that is even more exciting.""","International Cricket Council drop investigation into claims a one-day match was 'fixed'

"(CNN)  -- Hosts India surged into second place in the medals table on Sunday with a mini-gold rush which at last drew large crowds to the crisis-ridden Commonwealth Games. The Major Dhyan Chand stadium was packed to its 19,000 capacity to see India's field hockey team thrash neighbors Pakistan 7-4, with Sandeep Singh starring, to reach the semifinals of the competition. ""All credit to the crowd,"" India coach Jose Brasa told AFP. ""Their support was tremendous, something I have never seen before in any match."" They will now play England with world champions Australia taking on New Zealand. The athletics stadium was also over two-thirds full as women's 800m runner Tintu Luka won her semifinal in thrilling fashion and could win a rare track and field gold for India on Monday. But golds did come for Somdev Devvarman in the men's tennis final and more followed in the wrestling, the most notable from Sushil Kumar in the 66kg category, and shooting events. By the end of the day, India had won 29 gold to England's 26, but still well behind powerhouses Australian, who have 61. Two more followed for the Aussies in the cycling events as Allan Davis and Rochelle Gilmore won their respective road race titles. Sadly, the crowds did not flock to the roadside in New Delhi to watch world class performances from both, particularly Davis, who left pre-race favorite Mark Cavendish of the Isle of Man a well-beaten seventh in a brutal finish in blazing heat. In the track and field, England's Leon Baptiste made his international breakthrough by claiming the men's 200m title while Kenya's Boaz Lalang led a clean sweep of the medals in the event for the East African country. His compatriot and world record holder David Rudisha was one of a number of leading stars to skip the Games as Lalang took full advantage. Another top class performance came from European champion Dai Greene in the men's 400m hurdles as he completed a golden double. But there was more controversy involving officialdom as the women's 200m final failed to go ahead after fastest qualifier Elena Artymata of Cyprus was disqualified for running out of her lane. She appealed but it was turned down and she will not take her place in Monday's final.","Hosts India win a clutch of gold medals at the Commonwealth Games .

"(CNN) -- Florida authorities issued an alert late Wednesday night for a 12-year-old girl that police believe was abducted in Virginia by the boyfriend of her dead mother. The Amber Alert in Florida listed information about Brittany Smith and the man police believe abducted her. Authorities in Virginia  launched a search for the seventh-grader Monday after officers found  the body of Brittany's mother, Tina Smith, 41, inside the family's Salem home. Tina Smith's co-workers contacted police after the woman failed to show up for work Monday morning. Virginia  police said earlier that the girl was abducted by Jeffrey Scott Easley,  32, who met the girl's mother on the Internet. They do not know if Brittany went with Easley  willingly. The pair may be seeking refuge in another state, Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder told reporters. Police have obtained a felony abduction warrant for Easley. Along with Florida, police in Virginia say they are working with authorities in North Carolina, Alabama, West Virginia,  Kentucky and Ohio to issue alerts in their states for the  missing vehicle and Easley and Brittany. Tearful relatives sent messages of love and concern Wednesday night to the 12-year-old girl.

"(CNN) -- The spacewalk Tuesday was meant to replace a video camera and update cable connections to a module of the International Space Station. However, the question every space buff wanted an answer to is: ""What was that I just saw floating away?"" Two objects drifted away during astronauts Fyodor Yurchikhin and Mikhail Kornienko's six-hour assignment. When the first one swam by, even NASA was befuddled as to what it was. ""Meanwhile here on the ground in Houston, flight controllers have been taking a look at the object seen floating away earlier in the spacewalk around 12:44 a.m. Central time,"" said the voice on the live NASA feed of the spacewalk. ""Still working to identify exactly what that object was, but they were able to determine that it does seem to have floated below the space station and it should not pose any sort of a problem for the space station as far as posing a debris threat."" Later, NASA spokesman Rob Navias said the object may have been a clamp used to attach cables, and it might have been left outside during a previous spacewalk. An hour or so after the first fly-by, a small round object made its way into the darkness of space. ""Team here moving the cameras to follow another object that seems to have floated away,"" the NASA voice said this time. ""A small round object that you can see in the middle of the screen here... Possibly a washer or something similar."" Navias said officials will do a photographic analysis to figure out what it was. But, he said, ""It's not unusual at all to have one or two objects float away during the course of a six-and-a-half hour procedure outside an orbiting space station."" The astronauts replaced a video camera that will monitor the docking of future Automated Transfer Vehicles, or supply ships. They will then attach cables connecting the rest of the station to the Russian Rassvet research module.

"(CNN) -- It turns out that the military regime in Myanmar is soccer-crazy and even pondered buying world-famous club Manchester United, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks and published by the Guardian newspaper in Britain. The suggestion to buy United apparently came from the grandson of Than Shwe -- the highest-ranking figure in Myanmar's junta. ""One well-connected source reports that the grandson wanted Than Shwe to offer $1 billion for Manchester United"" says the cable, which was written in June 2009. Turns out Than Shwe is a United fan. Myanmar was at the time recovering from the effects of a devastating typhoon, and Than Shwe decided not to press the idea. The cost of buying the club would have been similar to U.N. estimates of the funds needed to recover from the typhoon. ""The Senior General thought that sort of expenditure could look bad, so he opted to create for Burma a league of its own,"" the cable said. (Myanmar is also known as Burma, especially in the West.) And so was created the Myanmar National Football League. Owners were chosen for the eight professional teams and told to pay players' salaries and build stadia. The cable says one team spends $155,000 a month on players' wages and that several players from Africa and Argentina were recruited to the league. The embassy's contact was asked why owners would spend so much money in building teams. ""When the Senior General asks someone to do something, you do it with no complaints,"" he said, according to the cable. He added that several owners would receive incentives from the regime, such as construction contracts, new gem and jade mines, and import permits. The same cable says it ""has been a huge success, with high attendance and wide national TV and radio coverage."" The embassy's contacts said the creation of the football league ""may be a way for the regime to distract the people from ongoing political and economic problems."" As for Than Shwe's grandson, his dream of sitting in the directors' box at Old Trafford, the stadium where Manchester United plays, may have been dashed. But in an astute political move, a business tycoon named Zaw Zaw made an important signing for his club, Delta United. ""Contacts confirm that Zaw Zaw hired Senior General Than Shwe's grandson to play on the team,"" reads a separate cable.","General's grandson suggested he buy Manchester United, cable says .

Using the iPhone 4's ""retina"" display -- given its name because Apple claims that its pixel density is so high, the human eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels -- EA Mobile's ""Madden NFL 11"" is one of the best-looking HD games on the platform. Play as or against all 32 NFL teams, take advantage of the new Total Defensive Control feature that lets you pause the action to position your defense however you like, and use your fingertip to draw routes on the field. You can even save your best moves and call them as audibles. As with this year's console versions of the game, the GameFlow feature does away with the playbook (on its default setting), so you can spend less time picking plays and more time playing. ""Madden NFL 11"" offers four game modes in all, including a meaty Season Mode to play through an entire 16-game schedule (and make player trades). The game also features head-to-head Bluetooth support for wireless matches with a friend in the same room. Although it's a bit on the pricey side -- especially compared with Gameloft's ""NFL 2011"" game for just 99 cents -- EA Mobile's pocket football game is a great buy. ""N.O.V.A."" Company: Gameloft Suggested age: Teen Price: $4.99 Rating: 3.5 stars out of 4 . In ""Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance"" (""N.O.V.A.""), you play as a retired Marine hero, Kal, who is reluctantly re-enlisted to fight for humankind's survival against aggressive aliens. Played from an immersive first-person perspective, the 3-D shooter takes place in multiple environments, ranging from spaceships to dense jungles to a bustling alien city. Consider it the closest thing to ""Halo"" for your pocket. With more than a half-dozen high-tech weapons at your disposal, plus superhuman powers, you can tackle the solo campaign or create a free account to log online and indulge in multiplayer modes with up to three others. Along with enhanced graphics, the game makers recently added gyroscopic support to better control the action by tilting the iPhone 4 in various directions. ""Zen Bound 2 Universal"" Company: Secret Exit Suggested age: Everyone Price: $2.99 Rating: 3 stars out of 4 . If you prefer a more cognitive experience, ""Zen Bound 2 Universal"" is a relaxing yet challenging puzzle game. While listening to the original 45-minute musical score (or your own tunes, if you prefer), use the iPhone 4's gyroscope and accelerometer to rotate the phone and ""wrap"" the rope around various objects to reach the assigned length -- while ""coloring"" the objects on all sides. More than 100 increasingly difficult levels are packed into this download, including all levels from the original ""Zen Bound"" along with new game play modes.","""Madden NFL 11"" is one of the best-looking HD games on the platform .

"(CNN) -- The Panama Canal reopened Thursday after heavy rains and flooding prompted its closing for only the third time in its storied 96-year history. Officials closed the canal around noon Wednesday after heavy rain in the Chagres River area, caused water behind the Gatun Dam -- which creates Lake Gatun, a significant part of the canal -- to rise. The canal was reopened 17 hours later. The last time the canal closed was in 1989, after the United States invaded Panama to topple strongman Manuel Noriega. Landslides forced the canal to close for several months from late 1915 to mid-1916, just months after it opened. The 48-mile canal is a key conduit for shipping between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The canal was built from 1904 to 1914 by the United States, which had sole control over the channel across the Panamanian isthmus until 1979. Then, after 20 years of joint U.S.-Panama control, the Panamanian government assumed administration on December 31, 1999.","Panama Canal reopens after heavy rains and flooding .

"(Mashable)  -- Android smartphone market share trails iPhone market share by a scant 9 percentage points in a recent study from analysis giant Nielsen. According to statistics on overall U.S. market share, Android is the single fastest-growing mobile platform. By contrast, Apple's iOS shows an ever-so-slight decline. Other operating systems, including BlackBerry and Windows Mobile, show sharp declines over the past quarter. Still, BlackBerry is the top mobile OS by the numbers, with around 30 percent of the total market share. Last month, Nielsen's stats showed that Android was the preferred platform of new smartphone buyers, suggesting that big-budget marketing campaigns for devices such as the Droid lineup and HTC's Evo were paying off. In fact, Androids outsold iPhones for the first time ever in the first half of 2010. Nevertheless, these stats still show iOS devices as the leading smartphones in the Android-versus-iPhone battle. Today, Android has 19 percent of the mobile OS market, while Apple's iOS smartphones have 28 percent. Age also plays a role in which device a given smartphone user is likely to choose. Members of the under-35 crowd were more likely to be seen with an Android than were older folks. And BlackBerry held sway with users over 45. Apple dominated when it came to smartphone users ages 44 and under. Based on these trends, we fully expect BlackBerry devices to sink below iPhones in popularity within the next quarter. And we're sure it won't be too long before Android and iOS are neck-and-neck in competing for smartphone dominance. Do you think the consumer actions behind these trends are based more on device performance and facts or more on personal bias and marketing? We'd love to get your opinions in the comments. © 2010 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","Android market share trails iPhone by scant 9 percent, says Nielsen .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Supporters and members of the gay and lesbian community in Kenya blasted the country's prime minister Monday after he said anyone engaging in homosexual activity should be arrested. ""The gay community is very scared as the Prime Minister's statement will incite more violence against visible gays,"" David Kuria, a spokesperson for the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya told CNN. Prime Minister Raila Odinga made the comments Sunday while attending a rally in the Kibera neighborhood of Nairobi. ""The constitution is very clear on this issue and men or women found engaging in homosexuality will not be spared,"" Odinga said during the rally. ""If we find a man engaging in homosexuality or a woman in lesbianism, we'll arrest them and put them in jail,"" Odinga said. Homosexuality is a crime in Kenya and has a jail term of up to 14 years. The country's new constitution disallows same-sex unions. Gay rights have been a source of contention in Kenya in the past. In February an armed group raided a government health center that provides HIV/AIDS services to the community. The group insisted they were trying to ""flush out the gays,"" according to a Human Rights Watch report. A spokesperson of the prime minister's office, Dennis Onyango told CNN that the comments made by Odinga were off the cuff and were not a directive to arrest anyone. Kuria said the comments triggered state-sponsored homophobia. ""All the years of hard work we've done to curtail intimidation, violence and blackmail towards homosexuals has now been adversely reversed,"" said Kuria. Lawrence Mute of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission says that the prime minister's comments unwisely encourage hate crimes based on assumed sexuality. ""Under the bill of rights, people should be treated equally regardless of their sexual orientation,"" Mute said. Lillian Leposo contributed to this report.","Prime minister says gays, lesbians to be arrested .

"Saugus, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The image is still vivid after 65 years. Bob Attubato and his fellow sixth-grade classmates rushed to the window just in time to see a crippled twin-engine bomber trailing smoke and flames over their school. ""Suddenly, we heard this unearthly sound coming over the school,"" Attubato recalled. ""It just reverberated through the building."" As the class stood there and watched, the plane's wing and engine broke off and it disappeared from view.  A loud explosion followed. Attubato later learned that the pilot, Army Air Force Maj. Doak Weston stayed with the B-25 until it crashed on a nearby golf course, giving his five-man crew time to bail out and missing nearby homes. The event faded with time, but Attubato never forgot that day. He and others campaigned to honor the heroic pilot. One of these was Dave Paquin, whose father was one of the surviving crew members. Sgt. Frederic Paquin  parachuted from the burning plane that day, landing in a tree. Dave Paquin said his father used to joke about that being the only tree he climbed down that he never climbed up. Paquin's father died 15 years ago, but he still feels a debt of gratitude to Weston. ""My father owes his life to him,"" he said. Recently, the mayor of Melrose, Massachusetts -- where Weston's plane crashed on the golf course -- agreed to honor the pilot's heroism. ""In Massachusetts, we have many great historic events and some for whatever reason just get passed by,"" Melrose Mayor Robert Dolan said. ""I just couldn't imagine that this individual doesn't have some remembrance for what he has done."" On September 24, 2010 -- 65 years to the day of the accident -- the city held a ceremony on the eighth tee at the Mt. Hood Golf Club in Melrose, overlooking the site of the crash. Aside from the occasional golf cart passing by, it is a quiet, peaceful spot. At the conclusion of the service, Dolan lifted a sheet off a small stone engraved with the names of Weston and the crew he saved. Helping him to unveil the monument was Michael Weston, who was only 3 when his father died. He was overwhelmed by the city's gratitude. ""I'm just very impressed,"" he said. ""It's just made me very happy."" Weston traveled with his family from California to attend the service. Until coming to Melrose, he said, they never had a full appreciation of what Doak Weston had done or what his sacrifice meant to this community. Weston graciously accepted the thanks given to him by the veterans and residents who lined up after the service to shake his hand. He said he knows their gratefulness is really directed at his father. They want to honor the memory of a man who gave his life for others. Michael Weston has the same feelings towards the father he never really knew. ""There are lots of people who follow that instinct to do the right thing for their fellow man,"" he said.  ""That's what he stood for to me.""","Maj. Doak Weston piloted a B-25 as it went down north of Boston, Massachusetts .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission is urging would-be voters to turn out for the scheduled voter registration session in January, in hopes for a ""free fair and credible elections in 2011,"" a Commission spokesman said Thursday. ""This reassurance is necessary against the backdrop of the theft of some Direct Data Capture machines at the Lagos airport, "" said Kayode Robert Idowu, a Commission spokesman in a press statement. On Tuesday, 20 voting machines were stolen at the Lagos airport, out of a total of 6,000 brought into the country by Zinox Technologies Ltd., Idowu said. Sixteen machines have been recovered so far and security agents are investigating the case, he said. The equipment, meant for registering voters for the upcoming election in Nigeria, is comprised of laptops and webcams. It was stolen from a clearing point at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, said  Idowu. The equipment was the first consignment ordered to help register voters for the 2011 elections. The presidential election is expected to take place in April 9. President Goodluck Jonathan, who became president after the death of Umaru Yar'Adua earlier this year, is running for election to the office. He will be challenged in the primaries by another former vice president of Nigeria. Atiku Abubakar is the consensus candidate put forward by a bloc of leaders from Nigeria's influential Northern Political Leaders Forum, which announced in September that it would name someone to take on Jonathan in the presidential primaries for the People's Democratic Party. Abubakar served as vice president under Olusegun Obasanjo from 1999 to 2007. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must shift to between regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket with Yar'Adua, who was from the north. He was elected in 2007. Because Jonathan took office after Yar'Adua's death in May, the northern leaders say the presidency should rotate back to the north. Jonathan disputes that. Voter registration for the presidential election will be January 15-29.","Equipment stolen from an airport clearing point .

"(CNN) -- China's top foreign policy official met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il Thursday and the two sides ""reached consensus"" about defusing tensions on the Korean peninsula, officials said. The meeting marks the first between Kim and a top official from China since the flareup between the two Koreas. ""The two sides reached consensus on bilateral relations and the situation on the Korean Peninsula after candid and in-depth talks,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. She did not elaborate on what Kim discussed with the official, Dai Bingguo, during the latter's visit to Pyongyang. Tensions on the Korean peninsula escalated following North Korea's shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island last month, as well as the March sinking of a South Korean warship -- allegedly by a North Korean torpedo -- and recent revelations that it is enriching uranium for nuclear weapons. North Korean officials have been pushing for the resumption of six-party talks including China and Russia. China has also called for ""emergency"" talks among all the six countries -- North Korea, South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia -- to address the tensions on the Korean peninsula. But the United States has thus far refused, looking first for proof that North Korea is serious about not stoking military tensions and serious about stifling development of its nuclear program. For the second day in a row, the head of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff called on China to use its influence instead to rein in North Korea to prevent a full-blown crisis. China is North Korea's strongest ally and largest trading partner. ""I actually believe that because these provocations continue and seemingly at a frequent interval, that the danger is going up and that steps must be taken to ensure that they stop,"" he said at a news conference in Tokyo.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- An oil pipeline struck by an explosion in a volatile region of southern Yemen Tuesday is operated by a South Korean company, Yonhap news agency reported, citing local authorities and company officials. Officials believe attackers might have carried out a strike that caused a leak in the 204-kilometer pipeline operated by the state-owned Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC). The blast took place in an oil field in Shabwa province that produces 10,000 barrels of oil a day, the agency reported. Explosives were found near the site and news reports are linking al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to the incident. Yonhap says KNOC has been developing oil fields on four sites in Yemen since 2007, and the Korean Embassy in Yemen says it is working with local authorities to come up with a cause of the blast. U.S. officials believe that AQAP is behind the recent plot to send bombs from Yemen to the United States and the pipeline incident comes as troops attempt to capture U.S.-born militant Anwar al-Awlaki in the Shabwa region. The group is based in Yemen, which has emerged as a major operating base for al Qaeda and other terror groups. Yemeni authorities are intensifying operations to capture U.S.-born al-Awlaki, according to a senior Yemeni government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Al-Awlaki -- who has not been linked to the recent plot -- is regarded by the United States as a terrorist and propagandist who has become an important operational figure within AQAP. U.S. officials have confirmed that he is on a CIA and military hit list to be captured or killed.","The incident occurred in Shabwa province .

"Dabola, Guinea (CNN) -- Violence and voter intimidation in Guinea's eastern region has forced the displacement of thousands of ethnic Peul who support presidential candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo, according to an official for the Red Cross in Guinea and local officials of Diallo's party. The West African nation's long-awaited, much-delayed second round presidential runoff between Diallo and Alpha Conde is scheduled for Sunday. But more than a week of violence and intimidation that has forced thousands of people to leave their homes in the towns of Siguiri, Kouroussa and Kissidougou in eastern Guinea has soured what would be the nation's most credible democratic presidential vote in its 52-year history. Are you there? Share images and video with CNN iReport . Ananie Kashironge, head of media relations for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Conakry, the nation's capital, told CNN on Tuesday that 2,800 people were displaced on October 29 and 30 alone. In addition, commercial trucks filled with ethnic Peul and all their possessions have been leaving the eastern towns of Siguiri (about 800 kilometers from Conakry) and Kouroussa (about 580 kilometers from Conakry) every day for the past 12 days, and local officials for Diallo's UFDG party say a total of 15,000 to 20,000 Peul have been displaced around the country. Most of the displaced people have traveled west to the Fouta Djallon region, where they have relatives, the officials say. After a rally for Conde in Conakry on October 22 in which dozens of supporters fell sick after drinking contaminated water and yogurt, ethnic Malinke people attacked Peul in Upper Guinea, especially in Siguiri and Kouroussa, for days. Those displaced spoke of Malinke men looting and burning Peul-owned businesses and demolishing homes where Peul lived in Siguiri. Officials for Diallo's party said they registered the deaths of three Peul in Siguiri, one who had been fatally beaten and two who had died after being struck by stones. Conde, whose father is from the Malinke ethnic group, draws much of his support from the majority Malinke region of Upper Guinea, where most of the violence happened. Diallo, an ethnic Peul, has his base of supporters in the northwestern Fouta Djallon region. Sabo Camara, the campaign director for the UFDG party in Dabola, a town on the border of the Fouta Djallon and Upper Guinea regions where many Peul have stayed or passed through, said the violence seemed planned. ""They don't want [the Peul] to vote and we heard that they even put out a communique on local radio saying that if [the Peul] stay there until election day they will kill all of them,"" Camara told CNN on Monday. ""We estimate that 15 to 20,000 people have passed through or stayed in Dabola"" since October 22,"" he added. ""Many told us that meetings had been organized, and razors and knives distributed to get rid of the Peul by force."" One displaced man said those who forced them out made no secret of the reason. ""They told us, 'Come election day not a single Peul will vote here,' which is why they chased us away,"" said Thierno Barry, who left Siguiri with his family and all their belongings and was heading for his village of origin in the Fouta Djallon region. And a displaced Peul woman traveling from Siguiri who asked not to be named for safety reasons told a similar story. ""They gave out a list of people from the Peul ethnic group and said that they have to leave before the election or they will be killed,"" she said. Camara said the authorities in Siguiri and Kouroussa, members of a military junta who has ruled Guinea since December, 2008, did not do anything to stop the violence. ""We are under the impression that the authorities are complicit. Otherwise how can there be such trouble for four, five days without the authorities intervening,"" he said. Cheik Kaba, a Malinke businessman in Kankan, an upper Guinea city some 120 kilometers from Siguiri, told CNN that anti-Peul violence had spread to Kankan but had been contained because of local peace efforts. Conakry supporters of Conde's RPG party ""called us to say that [the Peul] poisoned RPG members. ... Everyone wanted to destroy everything here, but we reasoned with them and made them understand that it is our country and Guinea belongs to everyone, so they left them alone,"" Kaba said. Dr. Mohamed Saliou Camara, professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida and author of a book on Guinea's independence leader, told CNN recently that ""ethnicity becomes truly a problem when politicians resort to it to compensate for their lack of viable ideological platform and political program to meaningfully mobilize the electorate."" The number of displaced people has once again complicated efforts to hold a credible second round of presidential elections. Siaka Toumani Sangare, the retired Malian general in charge of Guinea's electoral commission, told journalists at a press conference on Monday that the government was taking measures to ensure that those displaced will be able to vote. But with thousands of displaced people now in remote villages with electoral cards left behind in Siguiri and Kouroussa, it will be very difficult for the inefficient Guinean government to reach all those affected. ""We are very scared because this is a dangerous precedent, a very dangerous precedent,"" Sabo Camara said. ""If people who have lived in a place for 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, are told to leave the houses they have built, the businesses filled with their goods, it's really quite worrying.""","Ethnic Peul have been targeted, Red Cross and local officials say .

"(CNN) -- Years after his death, baseball legend Honus Wagner hit a home run for a group of nuns, who will use proceeds from the sale of his extremely rare baseball card to do charitable work. Texas-based Heritage Auctions conducted the internet auction, which concluded Thursday night with a winning bid from Doug Walton, whose family owns seven stores in the Southeast specializing in sports cards and collectibles. ""I have been in the market for this card for a long time,"" Walton told CNN. ""It is the Mona Lisa of baseball cards."" Walton paid $262,900, Heritage said, with $220,000 of that going to the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The card's price beat initial estimates by $162,900. Both the card and the account of how it came to be sold make for compelling stories. Like other stars of the early 20th century, Wagner, a Hall of Famer with the Pittsburgh Pirates, appeared on tobacco company cards. The T206 cards were made between 1909 and 1911. Wagner's likeness was removed, either because he opposed being associated by young fans with tobacco or because he wasn't being paid enough by the company, said Chris Ivy, director of sports sales for Heritage Auctions. Only 50 to 60 T206 Wagner cards are believed to exist. One in near-mint condition sold for $2.8 million in 2007. The Catholic order, which has a facility in Baltimore, Maryland, obtained the card when the brother of one its nuns died earlier this year, leaving several baseball cards to the congregation. Neither of the siblings has been identified. Never mind that the card's sides had been trimmed to fit in a scrapbook, that it was laminated and lost some paper on the back, leaving it in poor condition. It's an authentic T206 Honus Wagner card. ""The fact that this was in her brother's collection since the 1930s and no one knew it"" makes its history special, Ivy told CNN. The Catholic missionary and teaching order said Wagner's name ""is blessed to us now."" ""We're very grateful to have the extra funds to help the School Sisters of Notre Dame where we minister in more than 30 countries,"" said Sister Virginia Muller, treasurer of the order's Atlantic-Midwest area, in a statement. Walton, managing partner of Walton Sports Cards and Collectibles, said he's tried three previous times to buy a Wagner card, but was outbid. He plans to have the card make the rounds of the company's stores in Tennessee, Florida and South Carolina. He concedes he paid about $60,000 more than the card is worth, but ""the back story made me spend the extra money on it."" About 75 percent of his pursuit of the T206 card was emotion, he said. ""I'm a very stubborn person.""","Rare Honus Wagner baseball card sold at auction .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Deaths in Indonesia mounted on Saturday from the volcanic eruption spewing scorching ash and gas, and the country's leader is stationed near the scene to coordinate relief efforts. At least 81 people are now dead after the powerful Friday eruption at Mount Merapi, in Central Java, bringing the total number of deaths to about 120 people since the volcano began erupting October 26, hospital officials said. Friday's flare-up is being called Merapi's largest so far, unleashing ash clouds and gas that have reached villages in areas many thought were safe from the volcano's eruptions. Volcanic ash has also hindered air travels with delays, cancellations and altered flight paths. International airlines have canceled at least 50 flights on Saturday from the capital, Jakarta, about 280 miles away from the volcano. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has temporarily moved to the nearby big city of Yogyakarta to help direct relief operations. ""Our burn unit has been working overtime to handle the volcano's victims,"" Banu Hermawan, a spokesman for Dr. Sardjito Hospital in Yogyakarta. ""The forensic team is also working hard to identified bodies with severe burns."" Another hospital official said only 11 people have been identified because many of the victims were severely burned. Yudhoyono has instructed the military to assist relief efforts by building facilities and field hospitals in the area. He has also ordered the Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare, which oversees several ministries, to coordinate faster and more efficient relief. The president announced that residents will receive compensation for livelihoods and animals lost to the eruptions. The government will buy endangered cows on the volcano, he said. Many of those who live on its slopes raise cattle and risked their lives by staying or returning to feed their cows. The children's charity Plan International has launched an appeal to help 20,000 people fleeing the mountain. ""People were fleeing in panic and only have what they could carry,"" said Nono Sumarsono, acting country director of Plan International, said Friday. He said there is an urgent need for food, water, mats, blankets and hygiene kits -- items that the group is already distributing. Workers are also in the process of getting emergency latrines and setting up temporary schools for children. Mathias Eick, regional information officer with the European Commission's humanitarian aid department, said Friday that many residents were expecting a minor outbreak, but the eruptions had become much worse. Lava balls have rained down on villages and houses have burned, Eick said. Streets and cars are covered in ash, and people are wearing face masks. ""This is a major humanitarian crisis,"" he said. Merapi continues to spill hot ash cloud and rumbles consistently, according to data from the Indonesian Volcanology Technology Development and Assessment Agency. The data also indicates the hot ash cloud that hit a village near the crater was around 450-600 degrees Celsius (842-1,112 degrees Fahrenheit). The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi is famously unpredictable. An eruption killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930. In addition, last week a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's coast, triggering a tsunami and killing at least 449 people. Hundreds more were injured. CNN's Kathy Quiano and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","The president is directing relief in Yogyakarta .

"(CNN) -- Palm oil plantations have a pretty bad reputation among eco warriors. Often the rows of oil palms replace primary rainforest, after it's been mercilessly cleared by logging companies, sometimes illegally. But now the growing pressure from consumers and environmental groups has started to result in changes on the plantations. The owners are not ripping up the multi-million dollar farms, but some are at least making a nod towards a more sustainable way of growing palm oil. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil(RSPO) is a recent initiative to give the industry a better reputation, and brings together representatives from the entire supply chain of palm oil, from the producers and the banks that finance them, to the retailers, and even the consumers. To become certified, plantations must adopt a raft of one hundred greener measurers, including set aside areas along rivers where jungle can regenerate. Some plantation managers are taking it further though, planting endangered trees, enriching these buffer zones with species that are fast disappearing elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The planting will never replace the tens of thousands of hectares of lost jungle, but it is a significant departure from past attitudes. Geoffrey Cooper is one of the last European planters left in the Malaysian palm oil industry. He talks like an evangelical environmentalist, which belies his background as a plantation manager for more than a quarter of a century, in both Asia and Africa. He grew up in Malaysia after his parents arrived from Scotland in the mid 1950s when his father took up a plantation engineer's job, and is passionate about his work. But what inspires him even more is the chance, as he sees it, to leave a legacy of environmental creation. Cooper manages a 10,000 hectare estate, formerly a sugar plantation, know as ""United International Enterprises"" for United Plantations (UP), about three hours north of the capital, Kuala Lumpur. UP is Danish-controlled and in 2008 was the first plantation company in the world to become certified by the RSPO. Cooper thinks despite the terrible reputation the industry has earned, it is possible to take some small steps to start making palm oil more sustainable. ""We've got to start somewhere, we can turn the clock back there's no doubt about it. And we as a group are committed to do that and so are some other big plantation players in the country,"" says Cooper. ""We'll be looking at getting 300 to 500 diverse tree species and I expect we will plant something like 20,000 trees in our gene bank area, from the current 7,500 already planted since the past two and a half years."" He's consulted a local ""tree guru"" James Kingham on most of the plantings. Kingham is also a former planter, but now runs a rare tree nursery comprising 3 million seedlings of rare and endangered trees. ""I am one of the guilty ones, the very guilty ones, where we have felled thousands of acres when I was with a big company in Johor [to make way for palm oil trees],"" says Kingham. ""So I wanted to start something different, something for the future. Back then no one was talking about climate change, it really started as a hobby."" But now his hobby could be vital to stop some of these trees becoming extinct. Kingham is also being courted by the biggest publicly listed plantation conglomerate in the world, Sime Darby. Kingham says this giant company, with more than half a million hectares of plantations, is buying 200,000 seedlings from him each year. RSPO criteria mean plantations have to have 2 to 4 percent of their acreage set aside; Sime Darby is stocking some of these areas with rare trees. It may take more than 50 years for the seedlings to reach their maximum height, with some growing to more than 75 meters. Specimens like the Shorea Macrantha are critically-endangered; there are perhaps just a few hundred left in the wild. Paradoxically, now they are flourishing in an otherwise ecologically barren setting. In terms of processing the palm fruit, measures are being taken towards being a little greener. Each palm tree produces 12 to 14 bunches of bright red fruit per year, each containing 3000 to 5000 fruits each the size of a walnut.

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- The jury began deliberations Thursday in the trial of Brian David Mitchell, accused of kidnapping 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart in 2002. The jurors will decide whether Mitchell, 57, was legally insane when he snatched Smart at knifepoint from her bedroom on June 5, 2002. Smart testified at the monthlong trial that he led her to a makeshift camp in the canyons above her home, ""sealed"" her as his spiritual plural wife and raped her. U.S. District Dale Kimball instructed jurors that in order to acquit Mitchell under the insanity defense, they must determine he was mentally ill and that his illness was so severe it kept him from knowing right from wrong. Defense attorneys mounted the insanity defense for Mitchell, trying to convince jurors that Mitchell was so delusional he could not understand his actions were wrong when he abducted Smart. Several mental health experts testified for the defense, offering diagnoses that ranged from delusional to psychotic to paranoid schizophrenic. When a defendant acts out in court . Prosecutors produced their own mental health experts, who testified that Mitchell was little more than a narcissistic pedophile who used religious dogma and claims he received revelations from God to get what he wanted. Smart spent nine months with Mitchell and his legal wife, Wanda Barzee, at makeshift camps in the Utah mountains and at a homeless camp outside San Diego, California. Now 23, Smart was the star witness for the prosecution. She said Mitchell raped her nearly every day of her captivity, some days more than once. She initially was kept tethered between two trees and treated ""like an animal,"" she testified. Later, she was allowed to accompany Mitchell and Barzee into town, but was forced to wear flowing religious robes and a veil. She was not permitted to speak to other people, she said. Mitchell claimed to be a prophet named Immanuel David Isaiah, who would take 49 wifes and battle the Antichrist in the end times. Afterward, his family would hold exalted positions in the new kingdom. Smart said her job was to teach the new wives how to perform sexually. She said Mitchell claimed she was preordained to be his wife but never spoke of his destiny with outsiders. Many times, she said, he used his revelations to justify drinking, smoking or viewing pornography. Mitchell, Smart and Barzee were stopped by police in Sandy, Utah, on March 12, 2003. Smart was reunited with her family, and Mitchell and Barzee were charged by state authorities. When those cases bogged down over whether they were mentally competent to stand trial, the case moved to federal court. Barzee, 64, reached a plea bargain and is serving 15 years in prison. She testified for the defense and described Mitchell as a manipulator who took advantage of her religious beliefs.

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A cholera outbreak in Haiti continues to spread to previously unaffected areas in rural communities, killing 442 people and hospitalizing 6,742 others, the Pan American Health Organization said Wednesday. Health authorities are concerned that the situation may worsen as Tropical Storm Tomas approaches the impoverished nation, still recovering from a devastating January earthquake that killed 250,000 people and left 1 million homeless. Tomas is projected to pass over Haiti on Friday. Health officials set up six cholera treatment centers in Port-au-Prince, the nation's capital. Four of the centers are fully operational, the Pan American Health Organization said. Four more are planned. Officials hope to create 2,000 beds in the treatment centers, the health agency said. In addition, the agency said, cholera treatment tents will be established at 14 hospitals in Port-au-Prince as soon as Tomas clears the island nation. Cholera is an intestinal infection caused by ingestion of bacteria-contaminated food or water. The infection causes watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if not treated promptly. About 80 percent of cases can be cured by rehydrating the patient, the Pan American Health Organization said. The disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world, particularly in developing countries. There are an estimated 3 million to 5 million cholera cases and 100,000 to 120,000 deaths every year worldwide, the health agency said.","NEW: Cholera causes up to 120,000 deaths worldwide every year .

"(CNN) -- An abandoned car sits in the Mexican desert outside Juarez, Mexico, the doors and trunk wide open. Under a blanket in the trunk is a body. Hands tied together. A bullet in the head. This was freelance journalist Jeff Antebi's introduction to the war between rival drug cartels in Juarez. The 40-year-old photographer, also known as the founder of the music company Waxploitation, traveled there to observe and document the violence that has gripped what many call the most deadly city in the Western Hemisphere. ""When I arrived in Juarez,"" says Antebi, ""within an hour, over the police scanners, a body has been found. And maybe 30 minutes later, another body. ""And then another body. And by the end of the day, it was 10. The next day, 10. The next day, 10."" More than 2,000 people have been murdered in Juarez so far this year, according to police. Just this week, two students from the University of Texas at El Paso were shot and killed there. The Mexican government estimates that as many as 28,000 people have been killed by the cartels since 2007, when Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels. Army troops entered the fight, and the level of violence from the cartels escalated dramatically in response. ""The cartels kill indiscriminately,"" says Antebi. He arrived on the scene last December, just in time for the Christmas season. In the past, he had photographed many places where people live in poverty and despair, from the Gypsy camps of Europe to the slums of Haiti and Brazil. But in Juarez, he says, there is a unique sense of dread. ""The average ordinary resident of Juarez, their life is in danger every day."" ""You just never know if some distant cousin, perhaps, has done something, and someone is exercising revenge on them by killing you,"" he says. As a precaution, Antebi traveled with a local reporter familiar with the lay of the land. And he avoided being out on the streets at night. ""The cartels,"" he says, ""own the night."" While visiting crime scenes throughout the city, Antebi discovered a chilling fact about police. ""Only in Juarez do the good guys wear masks."" Police officers routinely wear ski masks when out in public, or investigating crime scenes, to conceal their identities and protect the safety of their families. For that reason, Antebi says, he was careful to not photograph unmasked police officers. ""Those photos might be used to target law enforcement personnel when they are off duty."" There was another reason to be careful when photographing officers. ""You might be taking a photo of a policeman who is secretly working for a cartel,"" Antebi says. ""That's something that makes murder scenes so ominous."" Politicians are also at risk of becoming targets. This summer, Antebi returned to Juarez to photograph the national elections. Elections held amid conflict are of particular interest to Antebi. He has photographed elections in Afghanistan and Southern Thailand, among others. But Antebi says the violence of the Mexican election season was eye-opening. ""Two weeks before the elections, several candidates in the state of Chihuahua were assassinated."" And other politicians, says Antebi, received gruesome threats. ""The prime candidate for mayor of Juarez,"" he says, ""had a severed head left on the front door of his house."" The result, according to Antebi, is that few politicians dare to openly challenge the cartels. Journalists are in danger as well. Mexico's National Commission on Human Rights says 65 journalists have been murdered since 2000. A recent front-page editorial in El Diario, the biggest daily paper in Juarez, has sparked national controversy. ""What do you want from us,"" the editorial asks the cartels. ""You are currently the de facto authorities in this city. ... Tell us what you expect from us as a newspaper."" The editorial was published after the assassination of one of the newspaper's photographers. Antebi says the government is trying to crack down on the cartels, and has arrested many key figures over the last two years. But he believes those efforts have only provoked even greater violence. ""It's a very sad city to be in,"" he says.","Journalist Jeff Antebi is documenting the drug cartel wars in Juarez, Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Counting was under way Sunday in Myanmar's first election in 20 years, a poll that critics say is aimed at creating a facade of democracy. Polls closed Sunday and officials results were not immediately available, though critics say that the outcome was all but certain to be favorable to the ruling military junta. Riot police roamed streets in the city of Yangon, the former national capital that is also known as Rangoon. Election workers for the Union for Solidarity and Development (USD) had campaigned in the countryside, where many rural residents didn't know how to vote. The party is supported by the governing junta of mostly of ex-military members. ""These are our candidates for this region,"" a USD election worker told one resident. ""It is not important to put down the name of the party, but the people have to know our symbol and make their mark right here."" Because many citizens in rural areas know so little about the political process, election workers said they also had to show people how to vote. ""I am not just campaigning for our party,"" the election worker said. ""I am educating the people on how to vote. Many people don't know how to vote."" Their word is very influential -- especially in rural areas, where most people in the nation live. ""I don't know anything about the election,"" one woman said. ""If someone tells me what to vote, I will follow that guideline."" Opposition parties like the National Democratic Force (NDF) are complaining that a lack of money is keeping them from running and campaigning in most areas of the country. An NDF representative said the party will only contest in about 15 percent of constituencies. Several residents said they did not expect any change as a result of the election. ""Nothing will change after the election,"" a farmer said. ""The government is not trying to convince us. We don't matter to them because we are poor."" Not that it seems to matter to him. ""I don't care who will be elected,"" he said. ""I don't know whom I will vote for because I have no knowledge of politics."" Government critics say the election is a sham, and Nobel Peace Prize-winning democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has rejected voting in the elections, her lawyer said. The National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, announced in March that it would not participate. A new law forced the NLD to choose between honoring Suu Kyi as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections. ""Since NLD is not participating in this coming election, she doesn't want to vote,"" her lawyer Nyan Win said in October. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide election victory in 1990, but the military junta rejected the results. This year, the generals refused to allow international monitors to oversee the election and recently overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. In October, the military regime rejected international monitoring of Sunday's elections. ""Since we have many experiences in election, we don't need experts on this issue,"" said Thein Soe, chairman of the election commission. ""And since we have all ambassadors who are representing their countries, we don't think we need to invite any special group to observe the election since all the ambassadors are here and can watch it on election day,"" he added. U.S. President Barack Obama strongly criticized the elections in a statement Sunday. The elections, he said, ""were neither free nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted standards associated with legitimate elections. The elections were based on a fundamentally flawed process and demonstrated the regime's continued preference for repression and restriction over inclusion and transparency."" Opinion: Why the U.S. must not give up on Myanmar . One of the biggest flaws was the imprisonment of more than 2,100 political prisoners, who were denied the opportunity to participate, Obama said. The biased electoral commission left opposition candidates sidelined, he said, and the junta has denied registrations for some ethnic parties and canceled the vote in certain ethnic areas. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also criticized the country's rulers on Sunday. Speaking during a visit to Australia, Clinton said the country was holding ""flawed elections that once again expose the abuses of the military junta."" And in a statement issued later Sunday, she said the generals ""missed an opportunity to begin genuine transition toward democratic governance and national reconciliation."" ""Burma's leaders must come to realize -- after five decades of sustained internal conflict, economic mismanagement, and international pariah status -- that Burma needs a better way forward, a way that does not rely on suppression but rather strives to create a truly democratic and prosperous future for the Burmese people,"" Clinton said. The United States continues to insist on the ""immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners,"" including Suu Kyi, and will maintain its sanctions against leading members of the regime, she said. Suu Kyi has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest, and the regime recently passed a law that made her ineligible to run because of a court conviction. The Nobel laureate has called the law unjust. A Myanmar court convicted Suu Kyi in August 2009 for breaching the terms of her house arrest after American John Yettaw swam uninvited to her lakeside house in Yangon and briefly stayed there. In February, a court rejected her appeal for release. Suu Kyi's current house arrest is due to end in mid-November, but her lawyers are skeptical that the military junta will release her. Her supporters have said her latest conviction was a way to remove her from the election campaign.","Obama says voting was not free or fair .

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- A federal appeals court cleared the way Friday for the resumption of the trial of Brian David Mitchell, the man charged in the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart. Mitchell, 57, is charged with snatching then-14-year-old Smart at knife-point from her family's Salt Lake City home early on June 5, 2002. In court papers, his lawyers have indicated they will raise an insanity defense. The three-judge panel vacated the temporary stay it issued Thursday, which halted the trial just after the defense had begun its opening statements in a Salt Lake City federal courtroom. The trial will resume Monday at 8:30 a.m., the court said Friday. Defense lawyers asked for a mistrial so the proceedings could be moved to another city, arguing ""serious error and irreparable harm"" could come because of juror belief in Mitchell's ""factual guilt"" before hearing any evidence. Smart is scheduled to be the prosecution's third witness following her mother, Lois, and sister, Mary Katherine. Smart was abducted before dawn on June 5, 2002, and led to a campsite that ""was her prison for the next four months,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Felice Viti said in his opening statements Thursday. She was stripped, dressed in a robe and brought into a tent for an impromptu ""wedding."" And then, the prosecutor said, she was raped. In the months that followed Smart's disappearance, her anguished parents, Ed and Lois, became a familiar sight in the media as they continued to plead for their daughter's safe return. But no one expected what happened in March 2003, when Smart was found walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy in the company of Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who called himself Emmanuel, had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. Utah prosecutors charged Mitchell with six felony counts of kidnapping, sexual assault and burglary. But in July 2005, a Utah district judge ruled him incompetent to stand trial, leaving him in custody at the Utah State Hospital. The state case against Mitchell was put on hold when federal authorities stepped in. A grand jury in 2008 indicted Mitchell and Barzee. Judge Dale Kimball in March found Mitchell competent to stand trial. Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in federal court in November 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison. She also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap Smart's cousin a month after Smart was kidnapped. She was given a sentence of one to 15 years, to be served concurrently with the federal sentence and given credit for the seven years she had spent in custody. As part of her plea agreement, Barzee agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband. However, her name does not appear on a witness list filed by federal prosecutors -- and does appear on a list of witnesses filed by the defense. Mitchell's attorneys earlier attempted unsuccessfully to move his trial, saying it should be held outside of Utah because publicity in the case had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial.","NEW: The trial will resume Monday morning .

"(CNN) -- Police in southern Afghanistan have arrested the father-in-law of a woman whose nose and ears were chopped off after she was accused of bringing shame to her family. Authorities in Oruzgan province said Haji Sulaiman, 45, was the one who held Bibi Aisha at gunpoint and ordered five others -- including her husband -- to cut her. Juma Hemat, the Oruzgan police chief, said the arrest took place about two weeks ago and that Sulaiman confessed to the crime. Read a behind-the-scenes with Aisha then and now . ""The file of Sulaiman was completed by police and submitted to the attorney general's office in Oruzgan province,"" he said. 'Bibi' and 'Haji' are both honorifics -- 'Bibi' meaning 'lady,' and 'Haji' a term of respect for someone who has performed the pilgrimage to Mecca that is required of all able-bodied Muslims. Read more about Aisha's story . ""When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out,"" Aisha said, describing the attack to CNN in March. ""It felt like there was cold water in my nose. I opened my eyes, and I couldn't even see because of all the blood."" Aisha said her mutilation was an act of Taliban justice for the crime of shaming her husband's family. At 16, she was handed over to her husband's father and 10 brothers, whom she claims were all members of the Taliban in Oruzgan. ""I spent two years with them and became a prisoner,"" she said. She eventually ran away but was caught by police in Kandahar. And although running away is not a crime, in places throughout Afghanistan, it is treated as such if one is a woman. Eventually her father-in-law found her and took her back to her abusive home. She was taken to a Taliban court for dishonoring her husband's family. The court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off, an act carried out by the six men in the mountains of Oruzgan, where they left her to die. But she survived. She was brought to the United States where she received reconstructive surgery and a new life.

"Washington (CNN) -- In Washington, most speeches by representatives of other countries are, well, diplomatic, carefully written to avoid controversy. A speech by Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Wednesday broke that mold. Speaking off-the-cuff for much of it, Komorowski gave a frank and, at times, sarcastic evaluation of U.S.-Polish relations. Citing Wikileaks disclosures of State Department cables, which some Polish officials believe show the United States put relations with Russia ahead of Poland's security interests, Komorowski said: ""Like in marriage -- from time to time its worth taking your wife for a date."" Translation: The United States should not take Poland for granted. ""It's like a mantra that's mumbled, some slogans are specifically repeated, and quite often there is no practice behind them,"" the Polish President said. ""Today I spoke with President Obama about it. Perhaps I used slightly different words but I want to repeat the same: I simply believe that very much has gone the wrong way in Polish-American relations. And this can be testified to by leaks from different American cables."" Komorowski also complained about the requirement that he submit visa form to visit the United States. Referring to 18th century Polish heroes of the American Revolutionary War, he said: ""Pulaski and Kosciusko today would also have to fill in the visa forms if they wanted to come to the United States."" Komorowski said, when he filled in his U.S. visa form, he was asked ""whether I am involved in prostitution or if perhaps I was involved in genocide or whether I was a terrorist."" ""Well, I don't take it as an insult,"" the Polish president added. ""I'm not a prostitute. But I have to tell you when I had to answer the question whether I was a terrorist my hand shook a little. Because I do not want to lie. I do not want to lie to the United States. ""But I had some doubt. At the time of the Communist regime I was considered to be a terrorist. It was the language of some of the charges formulated by the prosecutor in the Communist state. So I did not know: Should I write the truth or lie in that form? So my suggestion is to skip that form. ... It's not understandable for us. It's nonsense.

"(CNN) -- An Illinois woman walked away from a car crash that killed her husband, authorities believe, but they have found no trace of her other than footprints in the snow leading to a road. A search was in its third day Tuesday for Tanya Shannon, 40, of Ransom, Illinois, according to the LaSalle County, Illinois, Sheriff's Office. Ground operations began at 9 a.m. with air operations starting at noon, Sheriff Tom Templeton said. ""They're looking,"" he told CNN sister network HLN. ""They're expanding their search area just a little."" Shannon was last seen along with her husband Dale Shannon, 41, at a Christmas party Saturday night in Streator, about 17 miles west of Ransom, relatives told CNN affiliate WGN and the Chicago Tribune. ""They were dancing together, really cutting up a rug,"" Dale Shannon's sister Donna Baker, who was at the party, told the Tribune. She said the couple -- married 20 years with four daughters ages 4 to 15 -- left the party arm in arm. Her brother was sober, she told the newspaper, and was driving his wife's car. About 1:45 a.m. Sunday, a deputy on patrol in a rural area of Brookfield Township found a one-car traffic accident, the sheriff's office said in a statement. ""The deputy found a male occupant of the vehicle in the driver's seat deceased,"" the statement said. ""Evidence at the scene indicated that a second person was also in the vehicle at the time of the accident. Further investigation revealed that the second person was possibly the wife of the deceased driver."" The car slid backwards into a pole, Templeton said, with enough force to break the backs of both the front seats. A relative told the Tribune Dale Shannon's back was broken. Footprints were reportedly found leading from the car to a nearby road. But there, Tanya Shannon's trail ends. ""There's nothing for us to believe there's any issues other than exactly what happened, a traffic accident that claimed her husband's life, that she was at least able for a period of time to walk away from and move up to the roadway,"" the sheriff said. ""And once she was on the roadway, that's where we lost track of her."" He said he couldn't speculate on whether or how badly Tanya Shannon was injured in the crash. ""She was at least able to get up to the road,"" he said. Police have her cell phone, he said. Police have not ruled out the possibility that Tanya Shannon was picked up by someone. But ""if she was able to walk and able to move, how come she hasn't contacted any of her family?"" Templeton told WGN. Tanya Shannon was last seen wearing a red dress -- described by the Tribune as a ball gown -- and a gray fleece hooded jacket, police said. The dress should have made her easy to spot in the rural, snowy landscape. ""We were told from the family she was an extremely loving mother,"" Templeton told the Tribune. For her to just leave with no warning ""would be incredibly out of character,"" Templeton said. ""To be out in the elements as they were that night, dressed only as she was, it's very doubtful that you can survive terribly long."" The crash site was remote, Templeton told the newspaper. A nuclear power plant lies to the north, but the area is surrounded by farmland. ""It's crazy,"" Baker told WGN. ""We're holding on to every ounce of hope we have, just to hope for (a) safe return. ... It's been like a nightmare you can't wake up from. If anybody has anything, seen anything, please, please contact us, because these four girls need something."" Search and rescue operations have so far involved dogs and aircraft from the Illinois State Police, along with more than 50 searchers, according to WGN and the sheriff's office. Tanya Shannon is described as being 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 125 pounds, with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and green eyes, according to the sheriff's statement. She also wears glasses. It's very mysterious what might have happened to Tanya,"" Baker told the Tribune. ""We checked the area hospitals and nothing, so we don't know if someone picked her up and took her somewhere. We just don't know."" Templeton said he's never seen a case like this in his 12 years as sheriff. ""Anything that's even remotely close has been gone over several times,"" he told the newspaper. Anyone with information regarding Tanya Shannon's whereabouts is asked to contact the LaSalle County Sheriff's Office. Ransom is about 70 miles northeast of Peoria, Illinois.","Search for Tanya Shannon stretches into third day .

"(CNN) -- Fluminense-playmaker Dario Conca has been named Brazil's player of the year for the second consecutive season, after he helped the Rio de Janeiro-based side to their first domestic title in 26 years. Argentine Conca created 18 goals over the course of the season, more than any other player in the league, and played a leading role as the club secured only its second Brazilian championship. A goal from striker Emerson was enough to give O Tricolor a 1-0 victory over relegated Guarani on Sunday, and ensure Muricy Ramalho's team finished the season top of the standings. Ramalho has now won the league in four of the last five seasons, after he won a trio of titles in a spell with Sao Paulo between 2006 and 2009. Conca, who has never been capped by Argentina, expressed his determination to build on this season's title triumph. ""I'm pleased to be considered a fans' favorite at Fluminense and I hope to win a lot of titles here,"" the 27-year-old told the official FIFA website. The midfielder also stated he has enjoyed playing for the club and hopes to represent Fluminense for the rest of his career. ""I've had the support of the fans, the squad and the coaching staff. I feel really at home at Fluminense and I'm treated so well here. If it were up to me, I'd finish my career here."" Turning his attention to the international scene, Conca revealed he hopes his achievements in Brazil will catch the eye of Argentina coach Sergio Batista. ""I dream of playing for my country's national team, it would be a huge honor. I left Argentina at a very young age and that makes things a bit trickier. ""But I'm still very optimistic and I'm hoping that Fluminense's good campaign this year will boost my chances.""","Dario Conca has been named Brazil's player of the year for a second consecutive year .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A powerful car bomb exploded outside a regional television station in Spain's Basque region Wednesday after police got a warning call from the separatist group ETA, authorities said. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero says ETA is losing all the battles. The blast occurred in the city of Bilbao around 11 a.m. (5 a.m. ET). The warning came an hour ahead of the bombing and gave police enough time to evacuate the area, including some 500 people working at the government-run Basque regional TV, known by its initials EiTB, and in other nearby offices. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the blast shattered the glass facade of the TV station's new headquarters. It was the first major attack blamed on ETA since police arrested two of its suspected top leaders recently. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States. Last month during an anti-terrorism raid in France, authorities captured the man then considered to be the overall chief of the Basque separatist group. Authorities said the suspect, Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu, 35, alias ""Txeroki,"" was in charge of both ETA's military and political, or policymaking, wings. Just three weeks later, on December 8, police arrested Txeroki's alleged replacement, Aitzol Iriondo Yarza, 30, the new suspected head of the ETA commandos. He was also arrested in France, ETA's traditional rear guard base just across the border from Spain.  Watch the explosion » . After that, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said ETA was more ""isolated"" than ever and he ruled out fresh talks with them. ""The end of ETA can be seen only with the push from the rule of law,"" Zapatero said in an interview on December 18 with CNN affiliate Cuatro TV. He said police had arrested 365 ETA suspects in the past two years, notably the two recent suspected top ETA leaders and their alleged ETA chief predecessor, who was detained last May, also in France. On Wednesday after the Bilbao blast, Zapatero told an audience in southern Spain that ""ETA can attack but it is going to lose all the battles."" Top Spanish officials have repeatedly warned that ETA is not yet finished. An ETA communique during the autumn threatened many targets, including government-run media outlets. The previous major car bomb blamed on ETA was on October 30 at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, which injured 27 people and caused extensive damage. The Bilbao bomb comes two years after ETA's car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two men and destroyed a parking garage. There are about 600 ETA convicts or suspects in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in the two countries have told CNN.","Bomb explodes outside a television station in Spain's Basque region .

"Washington (CNN) -- At first glance, it's a hoax: a storefront for a Museum of Unnatural History, complete with a bizarre animal skeleton visible through the front window and unicorn tears for sale. It's perfect for luring in curious children. But when volunteers get kids past the upside-down coyote hanging from the ceiling and the owl with an elephant trunk, they shape young minds with after-school tutoring, writing workshops and books written by kids. ""I think the kids are tricked in and then, as they are talking to the person at the front desk, they are learning about what's going on in the tutoring center,"" said Gerald Richards, the chief executive of 826 National, the nonprofit network of tutoring centers that look nothing like classrooms. The Washington ""museum,"" which set up shop in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in October, was the latest branch to open. Each of the eight centers has an imaginative storefront that helps raise money and encourage creativity among students. In Seattle, kids are lured into the writing lab by the Greenwood Space Travel Supply Co., which sells intergalactic peace treaties and travel cups. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, Liberty Street Robot Supply & Repair sells robot emotion upgrades, fruit powered clocks and robodentures. The original chapter opened eight years ago at 826 Valencia St. in San Francisco's Mission District. (As it spread, the original address inspired the name 826 National.) It was co-founded by Dave Eggers, author of ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"" and founder of the publishing house, McSweeney's. Early on, organizers at 826 Valencia St. learned the space they'd rented was zoned for retail, so they needed to come up with something to sell. The space looked a bit like an old pirate ship. ""Someone thought, 'Why don't we sell pirate gear and see what happens?'"" Richards said. Since then, it has been fronted by The Pirate Supply Store, where shoppers can purchase hooks, peg legs and plank-by-the-foot. Now, Richards said, profits from stores account for 20 percent of the teaching that goes on in the writing center. And the imagination enticements work. 826 National is on track to serve 24,000 students this year through its tutoring centers and school outreach programs. Sisters Teah and Janea Green have been visiting 826DC most afternoons since it opened. ""This place is awesome,"" said Janea, 10, as she worked on her multiplication homework with volunteer Matt Lemanski. ""I really, really need help with my homework and my parents are busy sometimes."" ""Sometimes we do poetry, sometimes we do math,"" said Teah, 9. When she doesn't have homework, she works on the story she is writing about a mermaid named Katopia. Writing is the primary focus at 826 centers, which also work with middle school and high school students. It also publishes books written by students. Their latest, ""I Live Real Close to Where You Used to Live,"" is a collection of student letters to First Lady Michelle Obama. It will be in bookstores on December 15. The letters run the gamut from asking if Obama cooks with an Easy-Bake Oven at the White House, to a suggestion that she use robots to keep drugs off the streets. The book is a companion to one that came out last year that contains letters to President Barack Obama, ""Thanks and Have Fun Running the Country."" Profits from the book sales are used to support the tutoring centers. Kathleen Yancey, an English professor at Florida State University, said the 826 National centers complement the learning that goes on in classrooms. Schools are about college and job readiness, and tests that prove it, Yancey said. Those demands don't leave much time for playful reading or imaginative writing, even if it could help some students learn. ""If you want people to engage in activity, you find a way for them to have fun with it. 826 is a genius at that,"" said Yancey, a past president of the National Council of Teachers of English. ""If [students] don't take any pleasure in it, they won't actually practice it. When they have fun, they won't quit on you."" Fun is what draws students in, too. ""It's OK to be strange,"" said Richards, the 826 leader. ""It's OK to be magical, it's OK to be whimsical.""","826 National is a network of writing centers tucked behind imaginative storefronts .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United have qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League as Group C winners, despite being held 1-1 at home to Valencia on Tuesday. United went into the match on the verge of creating history. No side had ever gone through all six group games without conceding a goal -- but a clean sheet against their Spanish visitors would have seen the Premier League giants achieve that feat. However, that dream died in the 32nd minute when Michael Carrick lost the ball to Alejandro Dominguez -- who perfectly teed up Pablo Hernandez to give Valencia the lead. With both teams already qualifying for the knockout stages, a Valencia win would have seen them go through as group winners. And they remained on course for the three points until the 63rd minute when  Anderson scored a rare goal to earn United a draw, the Brazilian midfielder reacting quickest after Park Ji-sung's shot was parried by goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Scottish champions Glasgow Rangers finished third in the group -- and take the Europa League place in the process -- after drawing 1-1 at Bursaspor. Top scorer Kenny Miller opened the scoring for the visitors in the 19th minute when he superbly lashed home a left-footed shot from 12 yards out. But the Turkish hosts collected their first-ever Champions League point when Sercan Yildirim stabbed the ball past goalkeeper Allan McGregor with 11 minutes left. Defending champions Inter Milan had already qualified for the knockout stages, but their run of poor form continued as they were thrashed 3-0 at Werder Bremen in Group A. A Sebastian Proedl header and a Marko Arnautovic volley sealed the points for the Bundesliga side, with Claudio Pizarro adding the third near the end. A victory would have seen Rafael Benitez's side go through as group winners, but their heaviest defeat in Europe for five years allowed Tottenham to win the group on 11 points after a thrilling 3-3 draw at FC Twente. An end-to-end encounter saw Spurs go ahead when 40-year-old goalkeeper Sander Boschker completely missed a Peter Wisgerhof backpass, allowing the ball to dribble into the net. The home side levelled with a twice-taken Denny Landzaat penalty, but Jermain Defoe put the London side ahead early in the second half from close range. A Roberto Rosales header brought Twente on level terms again, but another Defoe goal looked to have sealed the points for Tottenham. However, a superb Nacer Chadli free-kick ensured the match finished all-square. The result meant that Twente qualified for the Europa League in third place but Werder Bremen go out of Europe altogether despite beating Inter. Tournament favorites Barcelona ended their Group D campaign with another victory, as a second-string side eased to a 2-0 home win over Rubin Kazan. Andreu Fontas put Barca ahead with a deflected effort and Victor Vazquez sealed the win eight minutes from time. The result means Barca finish top of the group with 14 points, while Russian side Rubin finished third to reach the Europa League. That result ensured FC Copenhagen went through in second place regardless of the outcome of their match against Panathinakos, but the Danish side went through in style -- winning 3-1 to become the first team from their nation to reach the last 16 stage. A Martin Vingard strike, a Jesper Gronkjaer penalty and a Djibril Cisse own goal secured the victory, with Cedric Kante grabbing a consolation goal for the Greek side, who finished bottom of the group to go out of Europe. German Bundesliga strugglers Schalke have saved their best form for Europe this season and they finished top of Group B after a 2-1 success at Benfica, who will now go into the Europa League. Lyon have qualified in second place, but the French side needed a late Alexandre Lacazette goal to earn a 2-2 home draw with Hapoel Tev Aviv. The Israeli side would have finished third but for conceding two minutes from time, a goal which means their European adventure is over for this season.","Manchester United qualify for the last 16 of Champions League as Group C winners .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid saw off city rivals Atletico Madrid 2-0 on Sunday night to maintain their leadership of Spain's La Liga. First half goals from Ricardo Carvalho and Mesut Ozil within the space of six minutes settled an incident-packed derby in which both sides carved out a string of chances. It left Real a point clear of champions Barcelona, who beat Getafe 3-1 in an earlier kickoff in which both teams ended with 10 men. Former Chelsea defender Carvalho took advantage of a deflected pass to run through to score the Real opener while German international midfielder Ozil scored direct from a free kick. Barcelona kept the pressure on with a display of superb attacking football with Lionel Messi putting them ahead midway through the first half after a fine pass from David Villa. Villa added the second before halftime and it was 3-0 after the break as Messi set up Pedro Rodriguez. Manu del Moral pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Barca's Gerard Pique handled in the penalty area and was sent off for his second bookable offence. Getafe later had Derek Boateng sent off for a second yellow card. Third-placed Villarreal kept up their title challenge with a 4-1 home win over Athletic Bilbao to maintain their 100 per cent home record. Villarreal fell behind when Fernando Llorente headed home but Nilmar quickly equalized. Santi Cazorla put Villarreal ahead before halftime and with Athletic down to 10 men after Jon Aurtenetxe was shown red, Guiseppe Rossi added a third and Jefferson Montero completed the scoring.","Real Madrid beat Atletico Madrid 2-0 to stay top of Spanish standings .

"(CNN) -- Cold weather frosting much of the country spared Florida's citrus crop Tuesday, but more near-record lows expected overnight will pose another challenge. ""We came through last night in pretty good shape,"" said Andrew Meadows, a spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual. ""We had some reports of mid-20s scattered across the citrus belt but it wasn't for any duration."" Fort Lauderdale recorded its lowest temperature on record for December 7, dropping to 40 degrees Tuesday morning. The old record was 42, set in 1841. The National Weather Service issued hard freeze warnings for Tuesday night into Wednesday morning for much of the Florida panhandle, with freeze warnings and watches extending as far south as Hollywood. Parts of Alabama and Georgia were also under a freeze warning. Meanwhile, parts of North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Vermont were under winter weather warnings Tuesday for additional snow. Some areas have already received as much as a foot of snow. At least one death was blamed on the cold in South Carolina. In Marion County, the coroner said Tuesday that a 47-year-old man found dead Monday outside a home in Mullins apparently died of hypothermia. The unusually early cold weather is the result of a blocking pattern over the Atlantic Ocean that is helping to allow freezing air from Canada to flow into the eastern half of the country, said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""Basically, the cold weather pattern is going to remain for the next two weeks,"" he said. ""There will be a couple of days where it will warm up before we get the next surge of cold."" The sprawling system has dumped snow from Minnesota east to Virginia, with more expected Tuesday and Wednesday. While nothing as drastic as snow is forecast for Florida, the prospect of another near-freezing night had Salvation Army officials in Fort Lauderdale preparing for twice as many homeless people to make use of their shelter. ""The first cold night, not so many come in,"" said Sally Gress, director of development for the Salvation Army office in Fort Lauderdale. ""We're expecting about 100 as people realize how cold it is. It's cold and it's getting colder."" In Coral Springs on Florida's west coast, Michigan resident Rob Brown was reveling in what he considered to be warm weather as he worked in a long-sleeved T-shirt at the family Christmas tree stand. For the past 15 years, Brown's family has cut trees from their farm in Greenville, Michigan, to sell in south Florida. ""You work, you don't break a sweat,"" he said of the weather. But his customers aren't so fond of the conditions, he said. ""The colder weather definitely does put them more in the Christmas spirit, but I think it's too cold for them. They wake up in the morning and it's 35 degrees and they think it's the end of the world,"" he said. Although the chilly temperatures left the Deep South shivering, the upper Plains states were bearing the brunt of the cold snap. Overnight lows in parts of Montana and North Dakota dipped into negative territory Tuesday morning, and they bottomed out in the teens across broad areas of the Upper Midwest. ""We had above-normal temperatures for much of the fall and I think this is the first really good winter outbreak of the year and people just aren't really used to it,"" according to Brian Korty of the National Weather Service, who said there may be a silver lining to the early cold. ""Usually when you get a very cold December across the eastern part of the country, usually the pattern flips and very often you will see a warm January and February.""
