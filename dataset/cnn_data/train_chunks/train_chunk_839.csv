"By . Martha De Lacey . Meeting an eligible young gentleman in a bar and taking him home with you probably won't pose, er, genealogical problems in countries with large populations... but it might in Iceland, where there is a population of just 320,000 and everyone is, ultimately, descended form the same family tree. The threat of accidental incest was all-too real for three Icelandic software designers who have created a smartphone app that aims to prevent exactly such sticky situations by informing people precisely how closely related they really are. The online Iselandingabok database - which helps Icelanders to trace their family history - had already been set up by anti-virus software developer Friðrik Skúlason. But now three designers from  Sad Engineer Studios have developed it to include an incest alarm, activated by 'bumping' two phones together. The new app advises that when you meet a stranger in a bar you 'bump your phones before you bump in bed' The three developers of the Book of Icelanders app (which is available on Android phones) are Arnar Freyr Aðalsteinsson, Hákon Þrastar Björnsson, and Alexeander Annas Helgason. They told Digital Trends that the app's motto is: 'Bump in the app before you bump in the bed.' They said: 'We added a birthday calendar to make sure you don’t forget your relatives birthday. The app even reminds you on the date, to guarantee you won’t forget it. The other big feature we introduced was the Bump. This feature enables users of the app to bump two phones together to instantly see how they are related. 'The ""Incest Prevention"" is a fun feature that the user can enable through the options menu which will notify him with both text and sound if the one he bumps with someone who is too related to him.' One review of the app on Google's Play Store scored the software 4.5/5 and said: 'If I would have had this app last year I probably wouldn't have gone home with my cousin.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Glow-in-the-dark trees could soon be a natural alternative to electric street lighting, according to scientists. Researchers at the Glowing Plant project from California have transferred the glowing genes seen in fireflies, in to plants to make them glow-in-the-dark. The team is now hoping to extend the technique to larger plants and trees, and use them to replace electric lights. Scroll down for video . A team of scientists from California has developed bacteria than can make plants glow-in-the dark. They have taken genes from fireflies, glow worms and other bacteria that create naturally-occurring light and added it to household plants. The team is hoping that luminescent trees could replace electric street lighting . The genes used in the Glowing Plant project are taken from glow worms and fireflies that create natural light through what's called bioluminescence. The genes are added to agrobacteria, and this agrobacteria transfers these genes to the plants, which makes them glow-in-the-dark . Luciferase is an enzyme used in bioluminescence. The name comes from Lucifer. Lucifer is Latin for lucem ferrem, which means 'light-bearer'. Fireflies, glow worms and jellyfish can regulate how much light they produce by using different lucieferases in a range of ways. The enzyme can also be found in some bacteria and Jack-O-Lantern mushrooms. Antony Evans from the University of Cambridge, with Stamford PHDs Kyle Taylor and Omri Amirav-Drory have been creating glow-in-the-dark plants in a DIY biolab in California. The team were inspired by fireflies and glow worms that both produce what's called bioluminescence. Bioluminescence is the process that makes these creatures produce naturally-occurring light from their bodies. The team start off by getting glowing protein enzymes called Luciferase, from the genes of fireflies or from bacteria. They then use software called Genome Compiler to make it possible for the plants to read what those genes are. The genes are then made in labs and shipped to the team in California. This chart from the Glowing Plant project shows how the team creates the glow-in-the-dark plants, which could be used to replace electrical street lighting . The Californian scientists have tested their technology on a range of plants in their DIY biolab. Anyone who pledges money to the project's Kickstarter campaign can get a glow-in-the-dark rose, or be given the chance to buy one before anyone else . Evans and his team put these genes into liquid agrobacteria and the bacteria is poured over the plants. Agrobacteria is able to transfer genes into plants, and when these glowing genes are added, they are transferred to the plants, which makes them glow-in-the-dark. To create these genes, the scientists have had to redesign the DNA sequence. They have successfully managed to create small glowing plants and are now asking for extra funding, via a Kickstarter campaign, to use the technology on larger plants and trees. The campaign ends on 7 June. So far it has had more than 5,000 backers and raised over £183,000.

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Danny Talbot beat Adam Gemili to win the 200 metres at the Sainsbury’s British Championships and immediately targeted Commonwealth gold, European gold and breaking the 20-second barrier. For once, this is not typical sprinters’ testosterone-fuelled trash talk, but a genuine possibility. Talbot is 23 years old and hungry for success, with a point to prove after being overlooked for a place in last year’s World Championship team. Concentration: Danny Talbot (second from left) wins the 200m final at the Sainsbury's British Championships . Winning roar: Talbot wants more and is hungry for Commonwealth and European gold . Target: Tablot knows breaking the 20-second barrier in the future is not out of his reach . Talbot is ready to add more honours to the European 200m bronze he won two years ago. With high-profile Jamaicans such as Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake choosing to skip the individual events in Glasgow, his timing might finally be right. Talbot’s winning time of 20.42secs may sound unspectacular, but the swirling wind, cool temperatures and rain at Birmingham’s Alexander Stadium made this a race rather than a time-trial and Talbot’s strong final 50m was the difference. Gemili was second in 20.61secs after stumbling out of his blocks, with James Ellington third in 20.64secs. Talbot said: ‘I’ve just beaten a world-class field there. It can’t really get much harder than running against a 19-second 200m runner, so if I can beat Adam hopefully I can go on and challenge Christophe Lemaitre and the rest of Europe. 'If one British guy can go sub-20, then I think I can be next. ‘If I win in Zurich (at the European Championships) or at the Commonwealths in Glasgow, all the hard work I’ve put in will actually mean something.’ Ambitious: The eager Talbot says 'if one British guy can go sub-20, then I think I can be next' Gemili, who ran 19.98secs last season and came fifth in the World Championship final, now has two weeks to run inside the ‘A’ qualifying time of 20.55secs required to reach the European Championships. Chijindu Ujah qualified fastest for Saturday’s 100m semi-finals by coasting to a 10.26-sec victory in his heat. Dwain Chambers, bidding for a fifth consecutive British title at the age of 36, won in 10.34secs, while world indoor 60m champion Richard Kilty, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Sean Safo-Antwi all qualified. Gemili has predicted it will take a sub-10-second performance to win the 100m on Saturday. A bold claim, but with the strength in depth of British sprinting, it pays to set your sights high. Ready: Talbot already won European 200m bronze two years ago but wants to go further .","Danny Talbot beat Adam Gemili to win 200m at British Championships .

"By . Luke Garratt . Neil Kinnock's son, Stephen Kinnock, is the latest Labour heir to stand for Parliament after he was selected to as the party's candidate to fight a safe seat. The son of the former Labour leader will stand in 2015 for the seat in Aberavon, which the party has continuously held since the 1920s. Kinnock, 44, has worked for the British Council and World Economic Forum, and is married to Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who recently hit the news because of her selfie with U.S. President Barack Obama and PM David Cameron. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Danish Prime Minister, waves to supporters with her husband Stephen Kinnock from the front door of her home in Copenhagen after the result of Denmark's parliamentary election. Kinnock will now be standing for parliament 1000 miles away from his wife in a move towards Westminster . Labour parents: Glenys Kinnock and Neil Kinnock at the 2011 Labour party conference . Selfie: MsThorning-Schmidt posing with Barack Obama and David Cameron during the funeral of Nelson Mandela . His mother is Lady Glenys Kinnock, a former Labour MEP. Kinnock will be standing for the seat following the departure of the current MP Hywel Francis. Francis announced last November said he would not be seeking a re-election.

Tony Blair's son, Euan Blair, has been active on the political radar as a Labour campaigner, and has been rumoured to be running for a safe Labour seat in Coventry in 2015. This move towards Westminster was signalled after he left a highly paid job at investment bank Morgan Stanley to work for a managerial post with a Coventry-based recruitment agency, which is involved in the Government’s work programme. This move came as a safe Labour seat is almost free, as the MP for Coventry North East, former defence secretary Bob Ainsworth, announced he was leaving in 2015. The constituency was created in 1974, and has been under Labour representation ever since. William Straw, son of Labour grandee Jack, has announced his candidacy for the current Conservative seat of Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire. The seat is directly adjacent to Jack Straw's constituency of Blackburn, the seat he has held since 1979. Another family at the top of the Labour party are Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper, two of the most senior figures in the current shadow cabinet as shadow chancellor and shadow home secretary. The pair made history as the first married couple to serve in the British Cabinet at the same time, during Labour's last term in office. Labour Leader Ed Miliband and his brother, former Labour party leader hopefull David Miliband, ran against each other for the leadership of the party . The Miliband family meanwhile are linked fraternally, and made waves in the party when Labour leader Ed Miliband and his brother David were at odds fighting for leadership of the party.

"By . Louise Boyle . Three young children have been left without their mother after she was dragged by the driver of an SUV and run over in the street where the family lives. Kristina Purdin Dunn, 28, died in hospital on Monday after a horrific incident which was watched by her eight-year-old daughter Morgan. Mrs Dunn also leaves two sons - Jonathan, ten, and five-year-old Brandon. Her devastated husband Mike Dunn, 30, said the driver sped off after an argument about a $130 bill outside their home in Middletown, Ohio. In front of her family: Kristina Purdin Dunn, 28 (pictured with her five-year-old Brandon) was dragged to her death by the driver of an SUV in Ohio . Inconsolable: Mike Dunn tries to comfort his sobbing daughter, eight, who witnessed her mother's death from their home on Sunday evening . Mr Dunn was with his wife beside the truck and was arguing with driver Dustin Watkins who wanted  money for a paint job he had not finished, according to WLWT. As female passenger Maria Misquez screamed at Watkins to leave, Mrs Dunn's arm became entangled in a seatbelt, causing her to be pulled along beside the SUV before being run over. Police were called to the street at 9pm on Sunday where they found the mother lying on the ground bleeding from the head and not moving. Mrs Dunn was dragged 40 feet by Watkins, 27, who was behind the wheel of a dark green Chevy Tracker. Police have charged Watkins with  tampering with evidence, fleeing the scene of an accident and possession of drug abuse instruments. Misquez, 31, who owns the vehicle, was charged with complicity to . fleeing the scene of an accident. Distress: Ten-year-old Jonathan weeps over the death of his mother who passed away in hospital after being run over . Both were in custody in the local jail and due to appear in court later today. More charges may be brought when Mrs Dunn's autopsy is complete, according to police. Despair: Mike Dunn lost his wife who had been his childhood sweetheart . Watkins has been on the sex offenders' register since 2004 after an attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a female minor. Mrs Dunn had been airlifted to University Hospital on Sunday evening but later died. Cause of death had not yet been determined by the coroner. Mr Dunn, who works in construction, said he was trying to raise enough money to bury his wife while supporting his three grieving children. He said his children, in particular his daughter who watched her mother die from a window of their house, were traumatized by their mother's death. The couple were high school sweethearts and had been together for 13 years before marrying two years ago. Mr Dunn told the local TV station: 'My wife was killed for $130... I just hope they get what’s coming to them.' Brutal: Dustin Watkins, 27, was charged with fleeing the scene of an accident after allegedly dragging a young mother to her death.

"By . Kathryn Knight . Marvin Swash is mad about sex. ‘He’s got it on the brain,’ confides his mum, Mary. ‘I don’t imagine he thinks about much else.’ Now, hormonal males aren’t always the easiest of charges. Yet Mary seems thrilled about Marvin’s voracious sexual appetite. For a fascination about the birds and bees is something of a prerequisite in his line of work. Marvin is Britain’s top stud dog, and has been crowned so for two years running. An Airedale terrier and show dog with a host of trophies to his name, his puppies cost up to £1,000 each — which is why Airedale females (or more pertinently, their owners) are queuing up to meet him. Marvin’s rough golden-brown fur, long, majestic features and wise brown eyes make him look more like a cuddly teddy than a sex machine, but he’s been breeding for six years — and has more than 100 puppies across the globe to prove it. As Mary Swash puts it: ‘Marvin doesn’t travel. He doesn’t need to.’ The top stud dog in Britain: Marvin's rough golden-brown fur, long, majestic features and wise brown eyes make him look more like a cuddly teddy than a sex machine, but he's been breeding for six years . The bitches’ owners happily shell out . £800-a-time for the privilege. But who can blame them? The puppies are . impossibly cute, with those same soulful eyes and fluffy fur, as Mary . demonstrates, leafing through a photo album. When Marvin isn’t ‘performing’, he spends his time in languid comfort, being groomed, fed and walked at Mary’s three-acre farm in Hampshire. Some walks are conducted on the marvellously named ‘Jog A Dog’ treadmill. ‘We don’t use it very often,’ says Mary. ‘But if it’s tipping it down outside, it’s sometimes easier.’ Mary, a genial 78-year-old, has dedicated much of her life to raising Airedales and is one of Britain’s best-known breeders. She currently presides over ten — including Marvin — housed in pristine kennels behind her family home. Much of the rest of her land is given over to long grassy runs, enclosed by wooden fences, in which the excitable terriers can let off steam. Orphaned by the age of five (her father died in an electrical accident, her mother of ovarian cancer), Mary was raised by a family friend in West London, where she went to sleep every night under a framed picture of a wire-fox terrier. ‘I don’t know why it was there but I just fell in love with it,’ she recalls. So much so that her first job after leaving school was as a kennel maid. Three years later she began working for a professional dog handler, who introduced her to her first Airedale. ‘He was called Ernie and that was it really,’ recalls Mary. ‘I adored him.’ A dog's life: Marvin lives with his owner Mary on her three-acre Hampshire farm . By the early Eighties, Mary was married to husband Alan, now 84 and a former buildings manager. They have a son, John, 51, who is a partner in the kennels. Mary says: ‘I like the Airedales’ looks and temperament. They are enormously loving but independent. If you want a boring dog, don’t get an Airedale. If you don’t, prepare for them to get into your heart. They’re very special.’ Of course, Marvin is the most special of all — he was crowned top stud dog by World Dog Magazine, which is the go-to source for breeders. Even at the relatively advanced age of eight, he continues to win awards. He was named best veteran at this year’s Crufts, where he competed under his competition name ‘Jokyl Captain Scarlet’. However, these awards are hard work. I arrive to find Marvin on the grooming table, submitting to his daily ablutions — a complex affair involving coat-conditioning spray, deodorising spray and an array of clippers, scissors and brushes. ‘He likes all the fuss, although sometimes he gets a little bored,’ Mary confides. She keeps him in place via a collar connected to the ceiling by a chain — necessary, Mary says, for when he tries to wriggle off the table. Marvin is descended from a line of champions going back decades, including the wonderfully named Jokyl Gallipants — Crufts’ top dog in all breeds in 1983. Marvin’s father was an American showdog called Captain Greenfield Fantastic — known as Cappy. ‘He had a lot of charisma,’ says Mary. ‘And Marvin’s got that from him. But Marvin’s also a gentle sort, very patient. He’s not cocky but has a good opinion of himself. ‘He knows he’s special. He likes to be first out and first back in when we let the dogs out. If you leave another dog’s kennel open, he’ll nip in and quickly steal something. He has a kind of swagger while being very loving. It’s a nice combination.’ For all his lineage, Mary acknowledges that you can never know if a dog is stud material until it starts producing litters at around the age of two. ‘The proof is in the pudding,’ she says. Marvin’s litters are not only of good quality but prolific — the average Airedale litter is eight, while his is 12. Competitive world: Marvin has excelled at shows like Crufts (pictured) which attract the very best of canines . However, he won’t hook up with just anyone. Prospective mates must have what Mary terms ‘the right credentials’, which mostly come down to a substantial pedigree, clean bill of health and nice demeanour. Good hips are vital too, as Airedales are prone to dodgy ones. So the bitches are X-rayed and the results sent the British Veterinary Association for analysis. Those who pass muster include dogs who’ve travelled from Holland and Norway. Mary has twice sent Marvin’s sperm through the post, although she’s less keen on this arrangement. ‘It’s quite a lot of fuss and expensive, as you have to have it extracted at the vet and then sort out carriage,’ she explains. ‘Obviously, the other people are paying, and I don’t rule it out if the circumstances demand it.’ It’s not as if the mating ritual itself is romantic: Marvin and his lady friend are placed in his grooming room (‘we move the tables back to give them a bit of space’) and left to get on with it, albeit under Mary’s supervising gaze in case they ‘tie’ — in other words, get stuck and need detangling. Adorable: One of Marvin's £1,000 puppies . Marvin has never refused a bitch, although the ladies sometimes need a little more encouragement. The whole thing takes about 20 minutes, then Marvin trots back into his kennel. Mary says: ‘You could probably go on the internet and find someone offering breeding for £400, but you pay for quality don’t you? I’m an assured breeder — we do it properly — and you know the bloodline.’ Then there’s the immense hard work that goes into a rearing a litter. ‘If you want to do it properly, it’s really tough work just to get them to eight weeks, which is the time you would give them away.’ And there are the shows to gain those all-important certificates, which take up many days a year and cost thousands of pounds. It all sounds rather gruelling, certainly for someone not far off her 80s. But Mary is at her kennels at 7.30am each day until well after 5pm for non-stop round of grooming, trimming, feeding and walking. At 9pm, the dogs have to be let out again for a final run around the paddock. What does her long-suffering husband make of it all? Although he is relatively detached from the day-to-day business of looking after the dogs, he knows his place in the pecking order, confiding that Mary would ‘sooner be rid of me than the dogs’. But Mary accepts the need for compromise: she wants a couple of dogs in the house but Alan’s put his foot down. ‘Given I spend all day in the kennels, he wants to have a bit of me to himself,’ she says. Among her ten-strong crew are four of Marvin’s offspring: Hattie, Bonnie, Star and Boris — all award-winners. Boris is an adorable seven-month-old bundle of energy, named after Boris Johnson because of the blonde tufts he sported on his face at birth. Under his competition name of Jokyl The Party Line, he garlanded best puppy at the Southern Counties Championship this year. Mary has high hopes for him as heir to his father’s stud-dog title. But that’s not to say there isn’t life in the old dog yet. Marvin’s show career may be winding down, but Mary believes he has a couple more years left as a stud — Airedales can still be fertile at 11. She even had his sperm tested earlier this year. ‘It was very good and very strong,’ she boasts. ‘Good food, good exercise and lots of TLC, that’s the secret’, she says, ruffling an appreciative Marvin’s head.","Marvin Swash is an Airedale terrier show dog with a host of trophies .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Britain must make room for almost 10million more people over the next 25 years, according to official estimates yesterday. The increase, mainly a result of immigration and high migrant birthrates, will push numbers in the country to 73.3million by 2037. It means England, already the most crowded country in Europe, needs to accommodate the equivalent of a city bigger than London in the next two and a half decades. Packed: England needs to accommodate the equivalent of a city bigger than London in the next 25 years as the population of Britain is set to soar by 10 million . Border control: The population is set to hit 73.3 million in 2037 with migration and particularly immigration from Eastern Europe cited as the main cause . The controversial milestone of 70million – which one minister in the last Labour government promised would never happen – is likely to be reached in 2027, according to the Office for National Statistics projections. There will be 4.3million extra people over just ten years between 2012 and 2022. The projections show that despite a reduction in the scale of immigration, there has been no easing up of the rate at which the population is increasing. The population is set to hit . 73.3million in 2037 – 9.6 million higher than the 63.7 million . estimated in the middle of last year. Migration . and particularly immigration from Eastern Europe is cited as the main . cause. By comparison, the population rose by 6.8 million in the past 25 . years. Even . though ‘net migration’ – the amount by which migration pushes the . population up every year – is falling as a result of tighter government . restrictions, the population estimates have not come down as a result. Baby boom: On average over the next 25 years, every woman will have 1.88 children, the projections said, compared to the 1.84 figure in the 2010 estimates . This is because the ONS discovered in the 2011 national census that it . had under-counted numbers in the country by almost 500,000. The . great majority of the missed people were migrants from Poland and . Eastern Europe who arrived after 2004, and whose arrival had never been . officially noticed. Other factors pushing the estimates up are rising life expectancy and rising fertility rates. On . average over the next 25 years, every woman will have 1.88 children, . the projections said, compared to the 1.84 figure in the 2010 estimates. The key reason for increasing fertility is immigration, because immigrants have higher birthrates than the existing population. The . ONS estimates say that 43 per cent of the future population increase . will be a direct result of numbers of people coming in to the country, . but when migrant birthrates are counted in, immigration will contribute . 60 per cent of population increase. Growing . numbers will mean heavy demands on public services, especially housing, . at a time when prices are already unaffordable for many young people. Control: Home Secretary Theresa May has succeeded in reducing net migration, and Immigration Minister Mark Harper, right. says it is still important to control immigration because of its effect on public services and jobs . Pressure: Growing numbers will mean heavy demands on public services, especially housing, at a time when prices are already unaffordable for many young people . Packed: The growing population will also affect transport, including trains, education, water and power supplies . They . will also affect transport, education, water and power supplies, and . will pile on pressure for building over the green spaces in the most . overcrowded parts of the country. Sir . Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch UK pressure group said: ‘These . latest projections confirm that we are still on course for a continued . and substantial increase in population. 'By the end of the next . Parliament the population will have increased by 3 million. This . underlines the absolute need to have a net migration target and stick to . it.’ Home Secretary . Theresa May has succeeded in reducing net migration – the number of . people migrating into the country minus the number who leave – to . 176,000 last year, compared to 225,000 at its peak. However immigrant . numbers rose because of a new wave of people arriving from . high-unemployment countries in southern Europe. Ministers . are powerless to curb immigration from the EU, and are concerned over . what will happen when restrictions on the working rights of citizens of . Romania and Bulgaria are lifted in the New Year. Immigration . minister Mark Harper said: ‘Immigration has brought benefits to the UK . and we welcome people who want to come here to contribute to our economy . and society. 'However, it is important to control immigration because of . its effect on social cohesion, our public services, and on jobs and . wages. ‘We have already overhauled the immigration rules, tightening the routes where abuse was rife. Our reforms are working.’ Labour . MP Frank Field and Tory Nicholas Soames, of the cross-party Group on . Balanced Migration, said: ‘These latest projections confirm the rapid . growth in our population resulting mainly from the large-scale . immigration of recent years. ‘They underline the need to bring net migration sharply down.’","Population will rise from 63.7million in 2012 to 73.3million by 2037 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Will Payne In Detroit, Michigan . In custody: Monique Dillard-Bothuell has been arrested on gun charges, but may face more accusations related to the disappearance of Charlie Bothuell V . The stepmother of the 12-year-old Detroit boy missing for 11 days until being found in the basement of his father's home knew he was down there, police have revealed. Monique Dillard-Bothuell barricaded young Charlie Bothuell V behind boxes and told him 'not to come out, no matter what he hears,' the boy told police, according to court documents filed after she was arrested Thursday. Prosecutors also revealed the boy's body is covered in scars from prior abuse, including one sustained from father Charlie Bothuell IV 'driving a PVC pipe into his chest' as punishment for a transgression, authorities said. Investigators found a bloody PVC pipe in the home, and 'Mr. Bothuell disclosed physically disciplining Charlie V with [it],' police said. Blood found on the boy's clothes has not immediately been explained, but the reportedly abusive father's lawyer claimed to police it was from eczema. 'He scratched it like crazy,' said attorney Mark Magidson. The boy, who was found stashed behind 'boxes and totes,' also claimed his stepmother would not bring him food, according to the Detroit Free-Press, which reviewed the court petition. 'Charlie reports sneaking upstairs to get food when everyone left the home,' the filing said. A separate petition filed in juvenile court further detailed the boy's treatment in the house of horrors.

Hiding out: This is the first picture of the storage closet in the basement of the condominium townhouse where it is believed Charlie Bothuell V hid out during the eleven days he was missing . Found: Charlie Bothuell V was found hiding in his father's basement after he'd been missing for 11 days . Charlie's grandmother told the FBI 'he . was very skinny, and almost looked like a cancer patient. He had marks . all over his arms and chest' the last time she saw him.' These latest developments led . authorities to remove the couple's two younger children from their care . and place them into protective custody. Since . his discovery, Charlie’s stepmom has been arrested on gun charges, her . two younger children have been taken into care and Charles IV has not . been able to see his son as police have taken him to live with his . mother. There have been suggestions that . abuse charges may be brought by prosecutors and allegations that his . father and stepmom may have somehow been involved in his disappearance. His father has angrily denied the claims, calling them, ‘absurd’. But . neighbors in the upmarket condo building close to downtown Detroit have . said they believe Charlie simply ran away and used the tunnel to come . and go as he pleased.

That would explain why FBI agents with search dogs could not . find the boy during their exhaustive searches. There . is also a communal storage space – seen in our pictures – where . neighbors believe he could have easily hidden. There is even an . accessible bathroom in the tunnel. Dad under fire: Charles Bothuell IV leaves the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice on Friday after a court hearing for his wife, Monique Dillard-Bothuell . Speaking . to MailOnline, the neighbor, who did not want to be named, said: . ‘As far as I am concerned this kid ran away, then he was found and . that’s it. ‘He ran away two . years ago, that has been in the news, so it doesn’t take a genius to . work out that the most obvious explanation here is that he ran away . again. ‘I have heard he . was seen by some of the local kids playing basketball on at least one . occasion. The door at the end of the tunnel was open all last week . because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster. That means he . could have come and gone as he pleased. ‘In . my opinion he was going out in the day, messing around, eating and then . coming back to stay in the corridor or in his basement at night. There . is even a bathroom down there for him to use. A place to hide: Charlie probably called this storage closet home for over a week and he had access to bathroom facilities - and the outside . ’He . could have lasted down there for as long as he wanted. I don’t know his . parents that well, but they seemed like nice people to me.’ Despite . the neighbor’s assertions, there is still a significant amount of . suspicion surrounding Charlie’s parents, with many suggesting he would . not have been able to stay hidden without an adult’s involvement. Stepmom . Monique Dillard-Bothuell was arrested on Thursday after apparently . violating parole relating to a previous arrest on a gun charge. Authorities . had obtained a warrant for Monique Bothuell's arrest on Monday, but . held out until Thursday to take her into custody later claiming the . search for Charlie took priority. Relief: Charlie was able to use a toilet located in the tunnel . The . 37-year-old had pleaded guilty to purchasing a pistol without a permit . earlier this year and had been put on a two-year probation period. She was in court today on the gun charge and released on a $5,000 personal bond and ordered to wear a monitoring device. Arrest: Monique Dillard-Bothuell is arraigned for a probation violation of weapons charges at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in Detroit on Friday, two days after her stepson was found in her basement . Back with mom: Charlie is now staying with his birth mother . Sources . have suggested that Charles IV, a registered nurse, is a strict disciplinarian, who made Charlie follow strict education and . workout schedules. NBC news . reported that Charlie was made to complete 4,000 strides on an . elliptical trainer without break, possibly on a daily basis. The day of his disappearance he . took a break from his routine and his stepmother reported him to his dad, NBC reported. Charlie was reportedly afraid of his father’s reaction and decided to . run away. Police sources told WJBK that Charles IV allegedly beat his son with a PVC pipe. Blood was reportedly found in the boy's room. Following his . disappearance on June 14th, Charles IV and Charlie’s biological mother . Africa Shippings who lives around two miles away both made emotional . television pleas for their boy’s safe return. Apparently Charlie would . split his time between his father’s and his mother’s homes. Stunned: Charlie Bothuell IV was shocked into silence on Wednesday when HLN's Nancy Grace told him his 12-year-old son had been found alive in his basement, 11 days after he vanished . Charles . IV was on live television on HLN with Nancy Grace on Wednesday when he . learned that his son had been found in the home's basement. 'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said. As . the shocked father struggled to comprehend the news - grabbing his . chest and looking stunned - Grace demanded to know whether or not he had . checked his basement. 'I . checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The . police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down . there several times. We've all been checking.' He . said that authorities had even brought in dogs to check the basement, but the boy had not been found. Detroit . Police Chief James Craig said when police found the boy, he appeared to . be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did not announce . himself. Craig said that he . believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed the barrier . himself. He was also behind a large plastic drum and bedding was found . nearby. Overwhelmed: Bothuell clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found . 'There's no way he . could have erected this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' Craig told WJBK. 'He certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to . actually talk  to and embrace Charlie. 'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.' Craig . told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a . polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother . declined to do so. Mr Bothuell's test came back inconclusive, WDIV reported. He also told authorities that Charlie had ran away from home two years ago, but police found him after three hours . Charlie Bothuell, who was last seen when he took a break from working out and went to the bathroom, was discovered as authorities searched the home.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Newly released police reports detailing the double murder-suicide that left a Utah mother and her two girls dead in January revealed that the woman was distraught about her broken engagement and was acting erratically in the days before the tragedy. On January 14, Kyler Ramsdell-Oliva, 32, of Syracuse, shot dead her two daughters, 7-year-old Isabella and 13-year-old Kenadee, before turning the gun on herself inside their home. Although the documents obtained by Desert News shed light on the circumstances surrounding the family drama, they failed to provide a clear motive for Ramsdell-Oliva's actions. Family shooting: Police believe Kyler Ann Ramsdell-Oliva (left) fatally shot her daughters Isabella (middle) and Kenadee (right) before killing herself in a murder-suicide Tuesday evening just one day after her ex-boyfriend moved out of their house . Suburban suicide: The shooting happened around 7pm at this address in Syracuse, Utah . Ramsdell-Oliva and her fiance, . Michael Johnson, had a turbulent relationship and spent the day before . the murder-suicide arguing over the upbringing of his two sons from a . previous marriage. The . father felt that his wife-to-be was being unreasonable with his children, . and that she was ruining his relationship with them, according to the . police report. At one point during the fight, police were called to the scene, and Mr Johnson eventually decided to move out of the house. He . left the premises just after 4pm on January 13, but continued . exchanging text messages with Ramsdell-Oliva for several hours. The woman eventually stopped responding and also blocked her now ex-fiancé from her Facebook page. The . woman's sister would later tell police that she communicated with . Ramsdell-Oliva via text messages until about 6pm that night. That was . the last time she heard from her. Michael . Johnson turned up at their Syracuse home at around 9.30am accompanied . by his family, who volunteered to help him move his belongings to . Layton. The man and his . relatives spent hours inside the house packing his possessions, unaware . that Ramsdell-Oliva and her two daughters’ bodies were lying inside her . locked bedroom. Mr Johnson . late told officers that he knocked on the door several times asking . Ramsdell-Oliva to move her car, but no response came. Too young: Ramsdell-Oliva's 13-year-old daughter Kenadee (pictured) was one of the victims. Police say all three women suffered from gunshot wounds . Happier times: Ramsdell-Oliva posted this picture of her daughter Kenadee driving a go-kart on her Facebook . As . the fiancé was about to hit the road in a rented U-Haul truck, he . recalled having a feeling that something was not right in the house. So Johnson called his brother and his ex-fiancee's sister, and asked them to stop by the house and check up on the family. When . Justin Johnson opened the bedroom door after picking the lock, he . discovered Ramsdell-Oliva's body on the floor and her two daughters dead . from gunshot wounds on the bed. The . woman's sister placed a frantic 911 call, telling the dispatcher . that Ramsdell-Oliva and her two girls were not breathing, the Standard Examiner reported earlier this month. Unable . to control her emotions, the sister passed the phone to Mr Johnson, who . explained to the operator that there was a bullet casing on the floor, . and that it appeared that Isabella and Kenadee were shot in the head. It was later determined that the girls were shot in the chest. Violent end: Kenadee and Isabella were found dead from gunshot wounds to the chest in a bedroom . Alarm bells: According to Ramsdell-Oliva's fiance, the woman once told him that if she ever decided to kill herself, she would get a gun and take her two daughters with her as well . ‘They have been dead for a while,’ he said. ‘They're blue, they're cold.’ By . the time police officers responded to the scene of the crime, a . distressed and emotional Michael Johnson was standing outside the house . and yelling: 'She had no right to do that to them!' According . to the newly released reports, Ramsdell-Oliva left a suicide note . addressed to her sister, in which she explained why she had killed her . daughters, but that information was not made public. Michael Johnson said that his ex-fiancée had been suicidal, and during one . episode she had allegedly told him that if she decided to end her life, . she would get a gun and take her daughters with her. The . father of two explained that each time Ramsdell-Oliva contemplated . killing herself, he was able to get her the professional help and . medications she needed. Unstable: According to the mother's boyfriend, just days before the shootings, Ramsdell-Oliva (left) had an episode in the car where she started screaming and pulling her hair . An emotional Michael Johnson, Ramsdell-Oliva's ex-fiance, was heard screaming that she had no right to kill her girls . A few days . before the murder-suicide, Johnson recalled that the 32-year-old mother . of two had a 'temper tantrum' in the car while the two were arguing over . Johnson’s sons. Mr Johnson described how Ramsdell-Oliva started screaming, pulling her hair and even threw her wedding ring out the window. Fearing . for Ramsdell-Oliva's emotional state, Johnson drove the hysterical . woman to a hospital, but they never went inside and instead headed home after . having a talk in the car.","Police found 32-year-old Kyler Ramsdell-Oliva and her two daughters dead from gunshot wounds in their Syracuse, Utah home in January .

"By . Bianca London . With Valentine's Day just around the corner, men are picking their brains over the perfect way to say 'I love you'. But forget wilting flower bouquets, cringey chocolates and kitschy teddy bears, because most women have only one gift on their hit list this year. Nearly 80 per cent of women want Botox as their present this February - with 78 per cent saying they'd be 'impressed' if their partner treated them to it, according to research. Stuck for gift inspiration this year, men? Women want botox for Valentine's Day - and 78 per cent would be 'impressed' if you gave them a voucher for it . When researchers asked women how they'd . feel if their partner bought them botox, 78 per cent said they'd be . impressed, 15 per cent said they would be mildly pleased yet concerned, . and the . remaining seven per cent said they would be slightly offended or not happy. The study also looked at which cosmetic treatments women would like to receive for Valentine's Day - with dermal filler, botox and tooth whitening topping the list. On the opposite end of the spectrum, women would hate to receive - men, are you paying attention? - laser hair removal, skin tightening and leg vein removal this year. Much-coveted: Dermal filler and botox treatment tops the list of ideal Valentine's Day gifts this year, and men are even seeking advice on how to gift it . Men have even been scouring the net for . advice, with one cosmetic surgery and treatment review website seeing a . rise in enquiries from loved-up men seeking advice on whether they . should respond to their partners' anti-ageing concerns. New research reveals the number one question from men was: 'Which aesthetic treatments can I give as a Valentine’s Day gift without offending her?'. Speaking about the results, a spokesperson for Good Surgeon Guide, who carried out the study, said: 'While our general opinion is that gifting cosmetic surgery or aesthetic treatments is not good idea, it cannot erase the fact that people still feel compelled to give and receive them. 'We recommend that men who choose to give cosmetic treatments for Valentine's must understand how the gift may make their partner feel, especially if it's a surprise. 'If at all possible, it's best to speak with their partner about the treatment and make sure it is something they want.' Dermal filler    Botox    Teeth Whitening    Skin Peel .

"By . Graham Smith . Britain and its allies were accused by Russia today of using blackmail in a bid to secure a new UN resolution that would authorise the use of force in Syria. The extraordinary allegation by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov came as Syrian troops and rebels clashed repeatedly inside the tightly controlled capital Damascus in what activists called some of the worst fighting since the country's crisis began 16 months ago. In a major boost for the new emboldened rebels, Major-General Adnan Sillu, the former head of Syria's chemical weapons programme, was reported to have defected and taken up a post as head of the joint military leadership of the Free Syrian Army. The defection would be a boost too for western intelligence as Sillu could have crucial details of the nuclear and chemical weapons programme of Iran, a key Syrian ally. Scroll down for video . Increasing violence: Syrian troops clashed with rebels in Damascus for a second day today. An opposition flag is seen here in the al-Tadamun area of the city . Uprising: Anti-government protesters take some time out to pray between clashes in al-Tadamun . Freedom fighters: Two members of the Free Syrian Army take aim from defensive positions in a house in the El Moalimin neighbourhood in Homs . Russia warned today it would block . moves to extend a UN monitoring mission in Syria due to expire on Friday . if Western powers did not stop resorting to 'blackmail' by threatening . sanctions against Damascus. Mr Lavrov staked out a tough position . before talks in Moscow with UN envoy Kofi Annan, dismissing . international pressure on Russia and China to stop propping up Syrian . President Bashar al-Assad. His comments are likely to dash the . hopes of Western diplomats that Russia is trying to find a face-saving . way to drop its support for Assad and accept that he should have no role . in a transition. The Western-backed British draft . threatens non-military sanctions against Assad's government if it . doesn't withdraw troops and heavy weapons from population centres within . ten days. 'To our great regret, we are seeing . elements of blackmail,' Mr Lavrov said, 'This is a counter-productive . and a dangerous approach.' He said any deal must follow the . principles outlined at talks between Annan and veto-holding members of . the Security Council in Geneva on June 30, which Russia takes to mean it . must not specifically exclude Assad. 'If our partners decide to block our . resolution no matter what, then the U.N. mission will not have a mandate . and will have to leave Syria. That would be a pity,' said Mr Lavrov, . whose country is one of Syria's main arms suppliers. Investigation: UN observers inspect a bombarded school in the village of Treimsa, where more than 150 people were killed last week . Determined: Free Syrian Army soldiers chant slogans in Idlib province in the north of the country . Innocent victim: A man carries a wounded child in Houla in the Homs province over the weekend . Diplomats say the intensity of the . fighting around Damascus and in four other cities underlines the urgent . need for a diplomatic breakthrough and the continued presence of UN . monitors. Fighting in and around Damascus . briefly closed the highway linking the capital with Damascus . International Airport to the city's south - an unprecedented . development, said Mustafa Osso, an activist based in Syria. 'It seems there is a new strategy to . bring the fighting into the center of the capital,' Osso said, adding: . 'The capital used to be safe. This will trouble the regime.' An amateur video posted online showed . the embattled suburb of Kfar Souseh as the sound of intense gunfire . could be head in the distance. The presidential palace, on a mountain . overlooking the capital, could be seen in the background. The . authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed. There have been sporadic clashes in Damascus in recent months, although Assad's forces remain firmly in control of the capital. Many of the Damascus suburbs, . however, have risen up against the regime, prompting a ferocious . response from the military in an attempt to clear out rebel fighters . from the towns that ring the capital.

The resident added that . shooting and bombing can be heard and that security forces deployed . along with the army all areas in the city. On Sunday, United Nations observers . gathered new details on what happened in a village where dozens were . reported killed in a regime assault. After a second visit to Tremseh on . Sunday, the team said Syrian troops went door-to-door in the small . farming community, checking residents' IDs and then killing some and . hauling others away. According to the U.N., the attack appeared to target army defectors and activists. 'Pools of blood and brain matter were observed in a number of homes,' a UN statement said. Meanwhile, the UN humanitarian . office's operations director John Ging said the Syrian president's . regime has refused entrance visas to aid workers from Britain, Canada, . France and the United States. He said 'tremendous political . obstruction' by Assad's government has hindered the United Nations' and . other international organizations' aid efforts.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A rare blue-plumed parrot believed to be one of the very last of its kind to have been born in the wild and the inspiration behind a hit movie has died in Brazil. The Spix's macaw named Presley was believed to have been about 40 years old when he died Wednesday outside São Paulo. He is believed to have been the inspiration behind the 2011 animated movie Rio and its sequel Rio 2, which was released in 2014, about a Spix's macaw called Blu. Dying breed: Presley the Spix's macaw has died after a tumultuous life that saw him living in Europe and North America before being returned to his native Brazil . A blow for conservation: It was hoped that Presley would be able to add diversity to the tiny gene pool of the Spix's macaw, but he never produced any offspring . Presley's species is critically endangered, and the native Brazilian birds are thought by experts to be extinct in the wild. His death is a blow to conservation efforts, because Presley represented an opportunity in inject some diversity into the remaining gene pool, which is thought to consist of fewer than 100 birds worldwide in captive breeding programs. According to National Geographic, the species is vulnerable to genetic defects caused by inbreeding. But Presley never had any offspring after deforestation, animal trafficking and introduced species left Spix's macaws decimated and he himself spent many years away from his native forests. Presley was smuggled out of his birthplace in the São Francisco Valley in northern Bahia in the 1970s and was traded among several private bird collectors in Europe before he wound up in the U.S. An avian veterinarian was amazed when more than a decade ago she received a call to examine an ailing blue macaw named Presley in Colorado and recognized it as a Spix’s. The lone macaw was depressed after losing its companion of many years, an Amazon parrot, living in a small cage, unwell and unable to fly. After six months of rehabilitation he was returned to Brazil, where he lived in the São Paulo Zoo before being moved to the Lymington Foundation, a refuge and breeding facility for rare parrots in the forest outside the city. Blue bird: Presley was the inspiration for Blu, the main character from the animated film Rio . Rare: The Spix's macaw is a medium-sized parrot that weighs about 300 grams. Their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but it's believed Presley was about 40 . 'He was very affectionate – just a very congenial bird, very chirpy, very talkative. He loved visitors,' Bill Wittkoff, Lymington's executive director told National Geographic. 'He's got an aviary that we'd wheel in and out, for the cold in wintertime and because of very, very hot sun. We'd go by his aviary often and he'd always gives us a chirp, a hello.' Bill and his wife Linda Wittkoff, who is director of the facility, tried breeding Presley with another Spix's macaw, but they produced sterile eggs. They still had hopes for Presley's ability to breed by artificial insemination, but before they could try it Presley began to sicken. Chirpy: Presley was affectionate and talkative, say his carers Bill and Linda Wittkoff . It was discovered over the past year that he had an irregular heartbeat and when he went off his food last week, the Wittkoffs took him to a vet. They believed he'd recover, but he never rallied and at 7am Wednesday morning he died. 'To us, Presley is a symbol of the best and worst in mankind,' the Wittkoffs wrote in a letter announcing his death. 'The love, care, concern and effort to help and preserve [on one side], with the greed, selfishness, and lack of concern for the animal world on the other side.'","The second-to-last Spix's macaw to have been born in the wild has died .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A vendor accidentally shot a woman in the leg while demonstrating a gun and holster at a central Pennsylvania gun show, police said. The Columbia County district attorney's office will determine whether the vendor, Geoffrey Hawk, will face criminal charges stemming from the shooting on Saturday at the Bloomsburg Fairgrounds, Officer Brad Sharrow said.

In Chicago, as many as 1 million people were expected to pack the streets of the city's North Side for the first gay pride parade since Illinois legalized gay marriage last month. Charlie Gurion, who with David Wilk in February became the first couple in Cook County to get a same-sex marriage license, said there was a different feel to the parade this year. 'I think there is definitely like an even more sense of pride now knowing that in Illinois you can legally get married now,' Gurion said, as he posed for photograph after photograph with Wilk at the parade. 'I think it is a huge thing and everybody's over the moon that they can do it now.' From the East Coast to the Midwest and the Pacific, seven more states legalized same-sex marriage, boosting the total to 19, plus Washington, D.C. The Obama administration moved vigorously to extend federal benefits to married gay couples. And in 17 consecutive court decisions, federal and state judges have upheld the right of gays to marry. Not a single ruling has gone the other way. Parades were planned Sunday across the U.S., including in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Seattle and Houston. Humbler celebrations were being held in smaller towns and cities such as Augusta, Georgia, and Floyd, Virginia, while festivals were held Saturday in France, Spain, Mexico and Peru. Among the marchers Sunday in New York were cousins Yaseena Oatis, 20, and Shayna Melendez, 22, from Plainfield, New Jersey.

Solo went on to tell her nephew that he would never be a pro athlete because he was 'too fat and crazy'. The nephew went into another room where Solo continued to berate him, calling him a 'fat p****' when he called his mom. 'I then told her to get her c*** face out of my house' the boy told police.

According to a police report obtained by The Seattle Times, a male caller told 911 the 32-year-old was 'hitting people' at a family gathering. 'Officer arrived and immediately heard the sounds of the disturbance inside the residence,' the report noted. 'They entered and contacted several persons; one being Hope A Stevens (Solo) who appeared intoxicated and upset.' Authorities said Solo's 17-year-old nephew and her sister had visible injuries.

United States goalkeeper Hope Solo, right, makes a save on a shot by France during the second half of a women's friendly soccer match on Saturday, June 14, 2014, in Tampa, Florida. In her career, she was won two Olympic gold medals playing for the US women's national team . Solo's sister has not been identified, but according to the soccer star's memoir she has a half-sister named Terry. Pictured above at a U.S. women's soccer match against Australia on October 20, 2013 . Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray said there was 'a big party going on at her house'. 'It was an out-of-control situation' Lt. Murray told The Times. Solo was booked into jail for investigation of two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault. The sister was not identified by police, but in her memoir, Solo writes that she has a half sister named Terry. Solo's late father, Jeffrey Solo, had two children, Terry and David, before divorcing his wife.He then remarried and had Hope and her brother, Marcus. Solo has won two Olympic gold medals for the US women's national team. She also plays with the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League. 'We are aware of the situation with Hope and are now gathering information,' the Reign posted on the team's Twitter feed. In 2012, she married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens. This isn't the first altercation Solo has had with police. Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on November 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day . He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving her, but he was not charged. Maybrown represented Stevens in that case. Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy. 'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said then. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.' In her last appearance for the US, Solo recorded her 71st career shutout, a 1-0 victory over France on June 14 in Tampa, Florida. She sat out the team's game against France on Thursday night in Connecticut.","The U.S. women's national soccer team goalie sat on the bench as her team Seattle Reign FC played Sky Blue FC on Saturday .

"By . Jill Reilly . Arrested: Elmi Mouhamaud Muhidin 24, was arrested while hiding on island of Lampedusa . The women who travelled on a migrant boat that sank off the coast of Italy have claimed they were covered in petrol and raped in front of their tortured husbands before boarding the doomed craft. The revelation came in a criminal complaint against suspected Somali trafficker Elmi Mouhamud Muhidin, 34, who was arrested on the island of Lampedusa where he was living in an overcrowded migrant centre and pretending to be one of the refugees. Together with some Libyan militiamen, . the man is accused of taking part in dozens of rapes while the migrants . were being held in a refugee detention centre in Sabha in the Libyan . desert. 'All the women in that centre were raped,' Maurizio Scalia, the prosecutor in charge of the investigation, told reporters. The . La Repubblica daily quoted one of the criminal complaints against the . Somali - the heart-rending story of one female survivor, a 17-year-old . girl, as told to the police. She said she was in a group of 130 people from Eritrea including 20 women walking through the desert from Sudan into Libya when they were seized by kidnappers and taken to a house in Sabha. They asked for ransom of $3,300 (£2,000) to release their victims. Two Italian policemen hold pictures of Palestinian Attour Abdalmenem, left, and Somali Mouhamud Elmi Muhidin during a press conference in Palermo, Sicily, today . Mouhamud Elmi Muhidin arrived on one of his own boats on October 25 and an alleged co-conspirator, a Palestinian, landed on November 3, the police said . 'They forced us to watch our men being tortured with various methods including batons, electric shocks to the feet. Whoever rebelled was tied up.' 'The . women who could not pay were assaulted,' she was quoted as saying. Once . the payment was made, they were then passed on for the voyage to . Europe. 'They threw me . on the ground, held me down and poured fuel on my head. Then three of . them raped me without protection. After a quarter of an hour I was . beaten and taken back to the house,' she said. Grim: Italian soldiers carrying the body of a victim from the October 3 shipwreck in the Lampedusa harbour . Trafficking ring: Investigators said some of the survivors of the October 3 tragedy had spotted Elmi Mouhamud Muhidin at the centre and identified him as a member of a trafficking ring . Investigators said some of the survivors of the October 3 tragedy had spotted Elmi Mouhamud Muhidin at the centre and identified him as a member of a trafficking ring that smuggles migrants from Libya to Italy. The Somali arrived on one of his own boats on October 25 and an alleged co-conspirator, a Palestinian, landed on November 3, the police said. The Palestinian has also been arrested. Another man, the boat's 35-year-old Tunisian captain Khaled Bensalam, was detained immediately after the tragedy on charges of manslaughter. Some of the 155 survivors - most of them Eritreans - attacked the Somali and the Palestinian when they saw them and the police said they could have been lynched. The Somali was flown from the remote Italian island to Sicily on Thursday and could be seen in photo and video images distributed by the police. He faces 30 years in prison under the charges. Italian authorities have vowed to crack down on the people trafficking rings that have been behind the influx of more than 35,000 asylum-seekers so far this year to the country's coasts. The police suspect that smugglers across north Africa - particularly in an increasingly lawless Libya - are working together with criminal contacts in Italy to arrange the landings.","Revelation came in a criminal complaint against Elmi Mouhamud Muhidin .

"By . Associated Press . Former Auburn Tigers tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen, a fan favorite who played on the 2010 national championship team, has died in a one-car crash in Georgia, state police said. Authorities said Lutzenkirchen, 23, was ejected from a 2006 Chevrolet Tahoe when it overturned several times near LaGrange early Sunday morning. He was a passenger in the vehicle. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn called Lutzenkirchen 'a great player and competitor' and 'a great teammate and friend off the field.' Philip Lutzenkirchen a former player for the Auburn Tigers died in a car crash early on Sunday morning . 'This is a sad day for the entire Auburn family,' Malzahn said on Sunday in a statement. 'I find peace knowing that even though Philip was taken from us too soon, that he lived his life to the fullest, leaving a lifetime of great memories for his family and friends to cherish forever.' Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs said Lutzenkirchen's death was 'a devastating tragedy for his family, the Auburn family and his countless friends.' 'He had a strong faith, a big heart and a burning desire to help others,' Jacobs said. 'Philip was a bright light this world desperately needed, and his death leaves a void that can't possibly be filled.' Driver Joseph Ian Davis, 22, was partially ejected from the vehicle and was also killed, investigators said. Authorities said blood was drawn from Davis to determine whether alcohol was a factor in the crash. Authorities said the former football player was ejected from a 2006 Chevrolet Tahoe when it overturned several times . Troopers said 22-year-old Elizabeth Craig of Eatonton, Georgia and 20-year-old Christian Case of Dadeville, Alabama were injured. Lutzenkirchen set school records for a tight end with 14 career touchdown catches and seven during the 2011 season. He scored the winning touchdown against Alabama to preserve the national title run in 2010, performing an end zone dance later nicknamed 'The Lutzie.' His Auburn career ended early when he opted to undergo hip surgery late in his senior season in 2012. Lutzenkirchen signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Rams but was waived in August 2013. He was a volunteer assistant coach at Saint James School in Montgomery, Alabama and worked at a wealth management company. 'Philip Lutzenkirchen was what every parent aspires their son to be,' former Auburn coach Gene Chizik said in a statement released through the school.' Philip Lutzenkirchen who was once #43 of the Auburn Tigers was killed on Sunday in a car crash . He was compassionate, determined, honorable and full of love, integrity and respect. In 27 years of coaching, I have come across what I would consider to be a few `rare' young men. Phillip was certainly one of those `rare' ones. He truly lived his life for other people and always found time to give to others."" Other Auburn players and coaches posted tributes to Lutzenkirchen on Twitter. 'The Auburn Family is broken today with the loss of a great Auburn man and friend (Philip) Lutzenkirchen,' offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee wrote. 'Crushed and without words.' Lutzenkirchen's Auburn teammate Kodi Burns posted: 'Lutz was a brother to me and my other brothers. I loved him. And I will miss him. One of the greatest men I will ever know. RIP love you man.'

"By . Associated Press . A man and a girl were hit by a train and killed Sunday while fishing from a railroad bridge, and a boy who was with them survived by dropping roughly 30 feet to the ground below, officials said. The Norfolk Southern train was traveling near Chilhowie in rural southwestern Virginia about 2 p.m. when its crew saw the group and put on the emergency brakes, spokesman Robin Chapman said. The man and the girl tried to stand off to the side on the bridge, but were still hit by the train.

The boy dropped between the rails, which were about 25 to 30 feet high, but it wasn't clear whether he went into water or on the ground, Chapman said. He was initially reported missing, but showed up at a relative's house several hours later. He was taken to a hospital, but didn't have any signs of injuries, Chapman said. The Smyth County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that the man was 52 years old, the girl was 7 and the boy was 8.

"By . Toni Jones . Vanity Fair and Waitrose columnist Pippa Middleton is generally a fixture at summer's society events but today the brunette skipped the second day of racing at Royal Ascot to run errands on the King's Road in Chelsea. Wearing a fitted, knee-length dress 29-year-old Pippa pulled up in a smart convertible car as she visited shops in the well-heeled area of south-west London. The writer finished her summery look with navy suede Jemima Vine pumps and on-trend square-edged sunglasses. Pippa skipped the second day of racing at Royal Ascot today to run errands on the King's Road in Chelsea .

"By . Beezy Marsh . A new cosmetic treatment aimed at boosting the sex lives of women over 40 by giving them a designer vagina without the need for surgery is to be launched in the UK. A revolutionary filler promises to 'plump up' a woman's most intimate areas  - which can suffer loss of tone and elasticity in the same way as her face due to falling levels of oestrogen during and after the menopause. Experts say DesirialR, given as an injection in a similar way to facial fillers, is targeted at women who have lost confidence in their body or who may have renewed interest in sex after a divorce, particularly if they have a younger partner and want to boost their sex appeal. Unlike other 'designer vagina' procedures, the new filler, currently in the final stages of clinical trials in France, would not require surgery . So-called 'cougars' - women who date much younger men - are on the rise in the UK, with latest research showing one in 12 married women have enjoyed a relationship with someone 15 years their junior, with the artist and film director Sam Taylor-Wood, 46, leading the way with her husband, actor Aaron Johnson, 23. TV star Denise Welch , 55, is another poster girl for cougars, with her toyboy Lincoln Towney, 40, who has inspired her to get in the best shape ever. The trend for Brazilian waxing, laser hair removal and vajazzles has also increased a woman's awareness of changes taking place and the possibility of improving appearance in all areas of her body. The product, which is nearing the final stages of clinical trials in France, is due to be unveiled tomorrow at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo at London's Olympia. It is expected to be available in the UK in the New Year and cosmetic specialist and GP Dr Kathyrn Taylor Barnes will be offering it at her clinics in Sheen, Godalming, Frimley Green and Richmond-Upon-Thames, in South West London. Dr Taylor Barnes said: 'A woman's vagina is a lot like the lips on the face, in that it is prone to withering and dehydration with age, particularly during and after the menopause which happens around the average age of 51, when there is a loss of oestrogen. They can go rather crinkly, lose volume and look unsightly. Hormone dips in women over 40 can cause dehydration of the genital walls . 'In some cases this loss of tone can lead to discomfort when doing physical activities too. In the past, doctors have suggested genital rejuvenation surgery to deal with this. 'DesirialR will allow ladies who might be divorced and embarking on a relationship with a younger man to boost that area, without surgery. 'He's going to be very interested in her anatomy and she is going to feel more confident. 'If you can rejuvenate that area, then their sex lives might reignite.' She added: 'When I have mentioned it to patients, their first reaction is ""Oh my goodnesss!"", but as we are already using Botox and fillers on our faces, I think boosting this area will become more acceptable as time goes on and women see what can be achieved. Women who are looking after their bodies are already very aware of areas they are not happy with.' During a woman's twenties and thirties, the vaginal walls are bathed in hormones, making them strong and robust. But as we enter our forties hormone levels -- namely oestrogen -- gradually start to decline. This causes the walls, which are comprised of mucous membranes, to become less resilient. DesirialR, produced by the French company Vivacy,  combines Hyaluronic Acid with mannitol, a natural antioxidant that is found in fruit and vegetables. Hyaluronic Acid  - which is already used in many facial fillers  - behaves like a sponge and can improve water retention capabilities in the vulva-vaginal area. The addition of mannitol, an antioxidant, protects against the breakdown of the gel from free radical damage and preserves the hydrating effect and longevity of the treatment. This helps rehydrate and 'puff up' the area to maintain elasticity, firmness, and the proper functioning of female genital tissue. It also helps reduce any swelling that may occur from the injections. DesirialR is available in two formulations: -DesirialR,  for peri-menopausal women or in reproductive age suffering from dehydration of the vulva with or without irritation DesirialR PLUS - for peri-menopausal, menopausal, and women in reproductive age with signs of moderate to severe withering. Dr Taylor Barnes said that a local anaesthetic gel would first need to be applied before the injection, which would need to be carried out by a trained medical professional and because of the site of the injection, antibiotics would be given to the client as a precaution. The process should take no more than 20 minutes to complete and the effects could last between six and 12 months, or possibly up to 15 months for the DesirialR PLUS formulation, as the gel is thicker.","New treatment aims to give women over 40 new vagina with no surgery .

"By . Hugo Duncan . With its white stucco-fronted facade and neatly-trimmed rows of box trees, it is certainly an address that’s easy on the eye. But the properties on Egerton Crescent, SW3, are most definitely not easy on the pocket. In fact the terrace in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London has just been named the most expensive street in Britain. Billionaires' row: Despite house values falling across the UK, values in London's most expensive area are at record highs. A report last showed that Egerton Crescent is the most expensive street in the UK with the average property costing over £8million . Distinguished company: Move to Egerton Crescent in Kensington and you'll count oil, shipping, fashion and banking execs among your new neighbours . The average price of a house there is more than £8million - with one four-bedroom family home recently selling for a massive £12million. That’s more than 74 times the price of the average home in the UK, which currently sells for just £160,879. A typical house on Egerton Crescent would cost £8,136,000 to buy, according to a report by Lloyds TSB. Apart from the cachet of living among the super-rich, residents can enjoy being just a stone’s throw away from the Victoria and Albert Museum and the shops of Knightsbridge. The most expensive home cost £12million. The tiny garden doesn't seem so bad when you think that Hyde Park is not too far away . Sightseeing: Tourists sometimes drop by Egerton Crescent simply to see the opulence on display . Value: In 1998, a house in Egerton Crescent could be bought for £430,000 . Period: No garish strip lights here, just charming olde worlde street lamps . Decent-sized gardens are a luxury Egerton Crescent home-owners can’t enjoy though. Fortunately, if they want to sample the great outdoors, there is a communal garden and Hyde Park is not far away. The prices on the road have rocketed over the past decade – one five-bedroom house sold for just £430,000 in 1998, before making £5,130,000 in 2006 and £10,500,000 in 2011. According to the Lloyds TSB report, the most expensive streets outside the capital are in Surrey, Hertfordshire and Kent where average prices top £3million. Exclusive: The private garden in front of Egerton Crescent in Kensington which has become the most sought after area in London . Family time outdoors: Although the kids won't be allowed to kick a ball around - it's prohibited . The North West is home to the most expensive streets outside southern England – with areas south of Manchester, favoured by Premiership footballers, among the most sought-after. The report, coming at a time of hardship for millions of families, underlines the extent of the extraordinary wealth gap in Britain. Nitesh Patel, an economist at Lloyds TSB, said: ‘Kensington and Chelsea has some of the most expensive streets in England and Wales. The Royal Borough has been a highly fashionable area to live in for many decades. A home in Parkside in Wimbledon, London (left) will set you back at least £5.1million and one in Woodlands Road West in Virginia Water, Surrey, will burn a £3.2million hole in your pocket . Premiership row: A home in Macclesfield Road in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, costs £1.3million . ‘In recent years, its prime location in central London and classical architecture has attracted affluent celebrities and ultra-wealthy foreign businessmen, helping to drive up property prices.’ The 20 most expensive streets in the country are all in London, according to the report. The nation’s second most valuable address is Parkside in Merton, close to the All England Club in SW19 which hosts the Wimbledon tennis championships. The average home there is worth £5,161,000. Away from London, the most expensive street is Woodlands Road West in Virginia Water, Surrey, where the typical home costs £3,201,000. There are also a number of exclusive addresses in the North, including Park Lane in Trafford, Greater Manchester, where the average house is worth £2,109,000. Eight of the ten most expensive streets in the North West are in areas south of Manchester such as Macclesfield Road in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, where a typical house costs £1,290,000. Egerton Crescent, Chelsea - £8.13million . Parkside, Wimbledon - £5.16million . Campden Hill Square, Kensington - £4.86million . Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill- £4.72million . Landsdowne Road, Kensington - £4.69million . Home Park Road, Merton - £4.68million . Drayton Gardens, Kensington - £4.43million . Eaton Square, Westminster - £4.39million . Lancaster Gate, Hyde Park - £4.37million . Duchess of Bedfords Walk - £4.22million . Despite the depressed prices in the rest of the country, the property market in the smartest areas of London shows no sign of slowing down. Estate agents Knight Frank reckon that ‘prime’ central London property prices have soared 50 per cent since the depths of the recession in March 2009. The main buyers have included the super-rich from Russia, India, France and Italy. The average house price in  Britain peaked at nearly £200,000 in August 2007 before the boom turned to bust. They plunged to £155,000 in 2009 as the financial crisis raged. It may be the most expensive street in Britain, but it’s not home to many Britons. Residents of Egerton Crescent include a former Italian motorbike racer, the general manager of a Syrian bank and a Middle Eastern oil trader. Other neighbours include the former managing director of a Dutch bank, a Scandinavian shipping family and the Italian president of the Valentino fashion house. These are the fortunate few who can afford to live in Britain’s most expensive street – where the average cost of a terrace is £8million. Fancy a spot of shopping?: The world-famous Harrods department store is just around the corner . Situated a short walk away from the . Victoria and Albert Museum on Exhibition Row and Harrods in . Knightsbridge, it is a street of opulence and grandeur, where the . shameless display of wealth is everywhere. One house, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, sold for a cool £12million in April. The moon-shaped terrace is lined with grade II-listed buildings and luxury cars while the tiny front gardens are meticulously maintained. Dating back to the 1840s, the Regency-style buildings house collections of antique furniture and enormous paintings. Oliver Zapata, 47, a Filipino driver for a Swiss businessman who lives in the road, said: ‘A lot of tourists come to the area just to look at this road. Art lovers with a spare £8million will be glad to know the Victoria and Albert Museum is just around the corner in Exhibition Row . ‘The Crescent is really unique because of its shape and the beauty of the buildings. They really are very pretty. ‘The houses are very opulent inside. Everyone who lives down here is filthy rich. A lot of them have antique furniture inside and the back gardens are a good size for this area. 'I guess the people down here like it because it’s a quiet road but it’s still in a central area.’ Egerton Crescent was named after the Honourable Lord Francis Egerton, son of the first Earl of Ellesmere. In the centre of the Crescent, a private residents’ garden sits with a heavily-bolted gate and signs warning the public to  stay away. Each of the five-storey houses are painted immaculately white, with clipped trees on their  balconies and orchids in their window boxes. And in the place of the usual garish orange street lights are charming old-fashioned lanterns lining the street. Many of the five-storey houses are managed by caretakers, with the occupants only staying for part of the year when they are in town on business. Not surprisingly, very few answer their doors, and most homes are protected by an intercom accompanied by one – or several – cameras. And not content with the size of their homes, many are extending them even further – with one basement conversion currently in progress and two conservatories already completed.","The house in Chelsea, London, is more than 74 times the price of the average UK home .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It takes a certain type of person to apply for a one-way ticket to Mars. Not only will they require mental and physical strength, but now, they will also need to have the makings of the next reality-TV star. Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, has announced that it will document the progress of a group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet. Scroll down for video . Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, has announced that it will document the progress of a group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet. This illustration shows what the settlement on Mars would look like . The reality series will follow the selection process of the privately-funded Mars One mission, which aims to launch 20 humans on Mars within the next decade. During the first selection round, more than 200,000 people signed up to be part of the first human colony on the red planet. The Mars One project plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as . soon as October 2016. A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are . used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips . ‘much safer than moon missions’. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. The applicants have now been shortlisted to 705 candidates - 418 men and 287 women - who will will undergo what is described as 'the world's toughest job interview'. Darlow Smithson Productions (DSP), an Endemol company, will film the hopefuls as they are ‘tested to the extreme as part of an elite training programme’. Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and a Big Brother-style audience vote will be used to make the final choice. Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile pioneering mission. The ticket is one-way and Mars One plans to send additional crews every two years to expand the colony. DSP said its production will be seen around the world, with the first series likely to be appearing in early 2015.

The same company is now hoping to produce a reality TV series following Mars One contestants . DSP said its production will be seen around the world, with the first series likely to be appearing in early 2015. The plan is for the cameras to also follow the first human settlers on the planet as they attempt to build a new society from scratch. ‘Our team felt all along that we needed a partner whose strength lies in factual storytelling to an international audience,’ Mars One co-founder Bas Lansdorp said in a statement. ‘DSP will provide that to Mars One, while allowing our selection committee to maintain control of the applicant selection process.’ There will be some spaceflight tests before the first launch of humans toward Mars. For instance, Mars One plans to launch several unmanned missions in the next 10 years to prepare the ground for the arrival of the colonists.

"By . Hugo Gye . At least 11 people were killed and dozens more trapped in rubble after a block of flats collapsed in the Indian city of Chennai yesterday. Five building firm bosses have been arrested over the disaster, which happened when the 11-storey building was still under contruction. It was the second deadly building collapse in India within a single day as the heavy monsoon rains had a devastating effect on shoddily built structures. Warning: graphic images . Disaster: 11 people died when a block of flats which was under construction collapsed . Mission: Dozens of rescuers were deployed at the scene to save workers who were trapped inside . Victim: An injured woman is removed from the rubble of the building and taken to hospital . Rescuers at the scene of the disaster in the Chennai suburb of Porur were today using gas cutters and shovels to hunt for those believed still to be trapped inside. The building came down yesterday at a time when 90 contract workers were in the basement collecting their wages. Four people were found dead in the ruins and seven more were taken to hospital where they later died. As many as 60 people could still be trapped in the rubble, according to police, with some heard crying out for help. Operation: Diggers were used to clear large concrete blocks and allow rescuers to dig deeper . Army: The volunteers donned hard hats and high-visibility jackets to help look for survivors . Tragedy: Workers remove the body of one of those killed in the collapse of the 11-storey complex . Help: One survivor who was able to stand up received the attention of the volunteers . Officials used cranes to shift concrete blocks before dozens of rescuers deployed smallers tools to dig deeper inside. One of the builders, Balaguru, suggested that the building might have collapsed after being struck by lightning. 'Usually, once the construction gets over we install the equipment to prevent the building from a thunder strike. It was nearing completion,' he said. A police officer said that five officials from Prime Sristi, the construction firm building the complex, had been arrested as part of the investigation into the tragedy. Building: The complex was located in the suburb of Porur on the outskirts of Chennai . Bystanders: Workers watch the ongoing efforts to rescue survivors . Aerial view: A worker sifts through the wreckage in an attempt to find those still trapped . Earlier on Saturday, 11 people were killed when a smaller building collapsed in a slum area of the country's capital New Delhi. The spate of building collapses has been blamed on runaway demand for housing and weak regulations, which encourage builders to cut corners and use substandard materials. Last year, India saw its worst building disaster for decades when an eight-story complex in Mumbai collapsed, killing 74 people.","The 11-storey block of flats was being built in a suburb of the Indian city .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Associated Press . Australian diplomats are providing consular support to an Australian man on death row in Vietnam for heroin trafficking. Pham Trung Dung, an Australian of Vietnamese origin, was arrested in May last year when custom officials reportedly found four kilograms of heroin in his luggage as he was boarding a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Australia. The online newspaper VnExpress quoted Dung, 37, as telling the court in the one-day trial on Friday that he was hired by an unidentified man to transport the heroin for $40,000. Pham Trung Dung, 37, was sentenced to death in Vietnam after he was found guilty of heroin possession on Friday . Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Dung was receiving consular support but declined to discuss any diplomatic discussions with the Vietnamese government. She would not comment on whether Australia had made an appeal for clemency. 'I don't want to do anything that would harm the work that is being done by our diplomats,' she said on Saturday. The court heard Dung had been living in Australia with his partner, To Quyen, since 2000 and travelled to Vietnam with her and his two sons in 2013 to visit family. It was in the Asian country that Dung agreed to transport two bags of luggage of heroin given to him by an acquaintance in Vietnam to take to another acquaintance in Australia. Dung said he knew it was illegal but could not pass up the $40,000 payout, VnExpress reported. Court officials were not available for comment on Friday.

Experts at the Ramat Gan Safari Park in Israel believe this is the first time surgery on the ruptured disc of a bear of this size has been successfully attempted . A group of expert doctors from the Hebrew University Veterinary Hospital, headed by Dr Meirav Shamir who specialises in neurology and neurosurgery, were invited to examine Mango. After diagnosing bear with a ruptured disc, the safari's Veterinarian, Dr Yigal Horowitz, sedated him and transferred him to the Safari Hospital - where a team of at least ten people were required to lift him on to the operating table. Following x-rays and several tests, Mango was found to have a rupture between discs two and three - requiring surgery which staff believe had never before been performed on a bear of this size. Mango's back was shaved before the complex ten-hour operation, conducted by Dr Shamir and assisted by Dr Orit Chai, which left his spinal cord exposed for more than five hours. And although Mango is now back on his feet, he faces a long battle to return to full health. A spokesperson said: 'Further x-rays were carried out following surgery which showed that the surgery was successful.'

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . Lewis Hamilton has admitted that he would have been 'lost' had he failed to make the grade in Formula One. The Briton was recently named the world's most marketable athlete, beating sprint sensation Usain Bolt and footballing superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to the title, with an estimated worth of £68million. It is far removed from Hamilton's humble beginnings in a one-bed flat in Stevenage as his father Anthony held down three jobs in order for them to go racing.

Winner: Hamilton became the world's most marketable athlete, beating sprint sensation Usain Bolt . Silverstone: Hamilton (pictured) was lucky enough to make the cut to fulfill his dream but it took sacrifices . 'I don't know,' said Hamilton when asked what he'd be doing if he hadn't fulfilled his dream of becoming a racing driver. 'I actually wrote a song about it. I could have been anywhere. I think about it today, and I am sure I would have been lost.' Hamilton trails Nico Rosberg by 29 points in the race for the championship after finishing second to his Mercedes team-mate in Austria eight days ago. But the former McLaren driver was in a reflective mood as he spoke ahead of this week's British Grand Prix; a race he has failed to win since his remarkable drive in appalling conditions back in 2008. 'Karting was a catalyst for lots of different things,' Hamilton added. 'My dad was working for British Rail and when we started karting he was doing IT. He would pull 24-hour shifts, just to keep us racing. 'My dad said in the first year of racing we spent £20,000. We had just moved out of the one-bedroom flat in Stevenage. Memories: Hamilton with his dad Anthony in 2008, who made a lot of sacrifices for the Brit driver . 'He put in my step mum’s life savings, his life savings and remortgaged the house, just for that year. It was a huge gamble and a huge commitment, and a lot of people do that and don’t get the end result.' With 35 pole positions, 26 race wins, and his championship triumph in 2008, Hamilton can lay claim to being one of Britain's most successful ever drivers. But how would he cope if he fails to claim his second title this year given the advantage that Mercedes have over their rivals? 'That’s not really something I want to think about or put out there,' he said. 'Why would I even consider it? It’s all about positive energy. 'You’ve got to have in your mind I’m going to win. I’m going to do everything that I can. I’m going to get up and I’m going to train and get to that race next week and be P1, P1, P1.

"By . Julian Robinson . North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has been pictured smiling with delight as he witnessed the test launch of new 'cutting edge' precision guided missiles. State media claims its army has tested 'ultra-precision tactical guided missiles' - and Kim seemed satisfied as he watched the launch with top deputies. The image emerged a day after claims . from South Korea that three short-range projectiles had been  fired from . the North towards its waters. Scroll down for video . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un smiles with delight as he observes the test-fire of a newly developed tactical guided missile at a secret location . Officials in the South say they were fired from an eastern port city on Thursday and flew around 190km before harmlessly landing into the waters off its east coast. The North has yet to say when the latest launches took place or how many missiles were fired. And there is no independent confirmation that North Korea has developed such high-tech missiles having frequently bluffed and exaggerated about its military capability in the past. But the impoverished nation devotes much of its scarce resources to its missile and nuclear programs. Outside analysts say North Korea has developed a handful of crude nuclear devices and is working toward building a warhead small enough to mount on a long-range missile, although most experts say that goal may take years to achieve. South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said that North Korea has been trying to upgrade its large-caliber multiple rocket launch systems in recent years and that the range of the weapons has been gradually increased in each test-launch. North Korean media has called the latest missile launches 'significant' because they were made at a time when it is bolstering its national defense blaming U.S. and South Korea for being 'extremely reckless in the moves to isolate and stifle (North Korea) and unleash a war of aggression.' Youngsters play beside South Korea's Hawk missiles on display at Korea War Memorial Museum in Seoul, South Korea. The South has claimed that their neighbours fired three projectiles towards its waters on Thursday . Short-range test firings by North Korea aren't unusual, but a barrage of missile and artillery tests earlier this year boosted tension between the neighbouring countries. A North Korean artillery attack in 2010 killed four South Koreans on a front-line Yellow Sea island. North Korea has in recent months threatened South Korea's president, calling her a prostitute, and the South has vowed to hit back hard if provoked. North Korea's rising anger coincided with annual joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea and a visit to Seoul by President Barack Obama. North Korea also test-fired two medium-range ballistic missiles and exchanged artillery fire with South Korea near a disputed boundary in the Yellow Sea. Both Koreas routinely conduct artillery drills near the maritime boundary, a scene of several bloody skirmishes in recent years. The Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty.","Kim Jong-un pictured smiling as he watches launch of new guided missile .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . After three previous failures, one of which resulted in a sunken boat and another that sprang a leak and left him drifting on a life raft for two weeks, Victor Mooney finally succeeded in crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Mooney, 48, from Queens, New York, completed the challenge of approximately 3,000 miles in 128 days. He arrived to the Dutch Caribbean island of St. Maarten on Friday, and spent Saturday recovering from the ordeal, during which lost 80 pounds. The trip was fueled by his desire to bring attention to the need for HIV testing and to honor a brother who died of AIDS in 1983. Mission Accomplished: Victor Mooney resting in a bed on Friday after arriving at the Dutch Island of St. Maarten, in the Caribbean . 'Not everyone has to row across the Atlantic. You can wear a red ribbon,' said Mooney. 'We all have a responsibility to do something.' On February 19, Mooney left the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa in high spirits. But those faded as big waves and violent currents began to toss his 24-foot  boat around, alarming nearby boaters who radioed him. 'It was a tanker who said, ""Do you know where you're at? Are you OK? Are you in your right mind?""' Mooney recalled. He paused, and the devout Roman Catholic, who had placed crucifixes all over his boat, reminded himself to be still. Mooney posing with his boat. He had failed to complete the journey across the Atlantic Ocean three times since 2006 . The weather began to improve, and Mooney also received help from an oceanographer and meteorologist, among those he chatted with by radio while crossing the ocean, saying he never felt alone. The African-American recalled that his journey took the path of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. ""I asked my ancestors also for help to push me along,"" he said. Mooney settled into a routine, awaking at 4am, then rowing for about an hour at a time and taking 30-minute breaks until 7pm. But the ocean remained rough for most of the journey, often erasing his progress. 'Sometimes you can row 10 miles, and then you wake up and you're 15 miles behind,' Mooney said. 'You get those days, and you're like, ""Oh, man.""' He would devour several portions of freeze-dried food in one sitting and eventually ran out. He resorted to fishing until his tackle line broke, so he began to scoop fish up with nets or rely on flying fish jumping into his boat. Then a shark attacked his boat and punctured it. 'I can remember like it was yesterday,' Mooney said. 'They circle your boat. They go around, they go under, they go around.' Mooney on his boat. He lost 80 pounds in the journey from Africa to the Caribbean . He felt the hit and scrambled to repair the damage while the shark chased fish milling underneath the barnacles attached to his boat. He reminded himself to be still again and prayed, thinking about his wife and other supporters. 'Sometimes just putting on deodorant, smelling that fresh deodorant was encouraging, inspirational,' he said. As he neared St. Maarten, he had a final conversation with a nearby tanker. 'He said, ""Mooney, I have a big ship, do you need a rescue?""' he recalled. 'I said, ""No, I don't need a rescue, I want a burger. Do you have a burger for me?""' Medical officials have not yet allowed Mooney to eat that burger, feeding him instead small portions of oatmeal and light sandwiches as he recovers. 'I haven't weighed 140 pounds since 6th, 7th grade,' he said with a laugh. In St. Maarten, he plans to eat well and replenish his energy with help from doctors and supporters, including a government team from Anguilla - his intended destination - who visited him on Saturday. Mooney holding a map of the area where he'd be swimming, before he began the experience for a fourth time. Mooney had to fend off a shark attack while crossing the Atlantic Ocean . Despite the completion of a monumental crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, Mooney's journey is not complete.

"By . Emma Innes . An elderly cancer patient died of an overdose the day after a GP prescribed morphine over the phone, an inquest heard. Dr Mushkoor Sheikh failed to carry out a home visit to see 80-year-old widow Betty Horsfield. The next day, she was inadvertently given double the recommended dose of the opiate by her daughter, Dawn Ellis. Betty Horsfield, 80, died of a morphine overdose the day after Dr Sheikh allegedly refused to carry out a home visit. Her daughter, Dawn Ellis, called the GP because her mother was in agonising pain due to her cancer . A medical expert said this amounted to ‘gross failure’, as morphine should not be prescribed to anyone for the first time without a face-to-face consultation. Doncaster coroner Nicola Mundy recorded a verdict of misadventure after a two-day inquest and is reporting the doctor to NHS bosses over the death which took place in March, 2010. Mrs Ellis said afterwards she felt at one time as if she was being blamed for her mother’s death. She said: ‘I am just so glad someone listened. I am pleased something is going to come out of it. ‘From now on when you ring a doctor they should come out and do a visit. That should be the proper procedure. ‘When they told me she had died from the morphine I felt I’d be blamed. At the end of the day I was managing her pain relief, but it was an accident.’ Mrs Horsfield, from Doncaster, was suffering from breast cancer and had been in agonising pain for four days when her daughter called the Bentley Health Centre. She asked Dr Sheikh to visit her mother, but he rang her back and said he would instead send a prescription for Oramorph to a chemist. Instead of carrying out a home visit, Dr Sheikh prescribed morphine over the phone. This was administered by Mrs Horsfield's daughter, Dawn Ellis (pictured posed by model) The inquest heard that the chemist failed to include the right size spoon for administering liquid morphine. Mrs Ellis broke down in the witness box as she insisted she had requested a home visit from the GP. She gave her mother the medication in an attempt to ease her pain but she died as a result - the prescription was for 10ml up to four times a day but Mrs Ellis admitted using a dessert spoon to give her as much as 70ml the day before she died. A pathologist said Mrs Horsfield died from morphine toxicity. Dr Sheikh told the inquest he had asked questions of Mrs Ellis and ‘listened to what was reported’ before he decided the only option available was morphine. He swore on oath about the telephone call. He said: ‘She didn’t ask me for a home visit. I was responding to a request for a patient who was in pain.’ But Dr Alan Crouch, an independent medical expert, said Mrs Horsfield had not been seen by a doctor for six months and she had never before been prescribed morphine. He said: ‘The bottom line is that this patient needed to be seen and assessed. I think with a patient like Mrs Horsfield who was elderly and infirm it was mandatory. ‘This amounted to a gross failure. I don’t think to prescribe morphine was appropriate. Without going to properly assess the patient it was a serious deficiency.’","Betty Horsfield, 80, was in agonising pain due to her breast cancer .

"By . Daniel Martin . Prince Charles ‘consorted’ with ministers to push his agenda on climate change, alternative medicine and grammar schools, politicians have admitted. The revelations show for the first time that Charles is not only listened to at the highest levels of government – his views can sometimes influence policy. Former Labour environment minister Michael Meacher said he worked behind the scenes with the Prince of Wales in a bid to persuade Tony Blair to ‘change course’ on green matters and to block genetically-modified crops. Prince Charles 'consorted' with ministers to push his agenda on climate change, alternative medicine and grammar schools, politicians have admitted . Charles prompted Peter Hain, another former Cabinet minister, to promote the provision of complementary medicine on the NHS. And he tried – but failed – to persuade then Education Secretary David Blunkett of the merits of grammar schools. Last night, critics said that as heir to the throne, the prince should not be ‘lobbying’ for his pet projects and should start displaying the sort of neutrality he will need when he takes over as head of state. Pointing out that the Queen never makes her views known on controversial issues, one MP said that Charles as king could spark a ‘constitutional crisis’. Former Labour environment minister Michael Meacher said he worked behind the scenes with the Prince of Wales in a bid to persuade Tony Blair to 'change course' on green matters . The prince is known for his strident opinions on a range of public policy areas. Earlier this year, he caused a diplomatic spat with Russia by comparing president Vladimir  Putin to Hitler. The revelations are particularly important as Charles is taking on a greater constitutional role even though he is not yet king. He presided over the last Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka and has sat beside his mother for the last two years as she delivered the Queen’s Speech. The interviews with politicians were conducted for Radio 4 documentary The Royal Activist. Mr Meacher told the BBC that he and Charles had worked together to persuade Mr Blair to push green energy and  block GM crops. ‘We would consort together quietly in order to try and ensure that we increased our influence within government,’ he said. ‘There were always tensions within government. And I knew that he largely agreed with me and he knew that I largely agreed with him.’ Mr Meacher, who was Environment Secretary from 1997 to 2003, added: ‘I know he spoke to Tony Blair, obviously he would regularly speak to the Prime Minister, and I’m sure he told him his views, so we were together in trying to persuade Tony Blair to change course.’ He said it was possible that there was a constitutional problem in that a member of the Royal Family was advocating a political opinion. ‘Over GM I suppose you could well say that. Maybe he was pushing it a bit. I was delighted, of course.’ Mr Hain said the prince was pleased to find a minister who agreed with him on alternative medicine. ‘We found we shared a common view that complementary medicine should be introduced into the National Health Service, not as an alternative to conventional medicine but as a complement,’ he said. ‘He had been constantly frustrated at his inability to persuade any health ministers anywhere that that was a good idea.’ As Northern Ireland Secretary from 2005 to 2007, Mr Hain had influence over health policy before the devolution process was completed. ‘I was able to introduce a trial for complementary medicine on the NHS, and it had spectacularly good results, that people’s well-being and health was vastly improved,’ he said. Peter Hain said Charles had been constantly frustrated at his . inability to persuade any health ministers that complementary . medicine was a good idea. And John Major said the prince would often write to him . ‘When he learnt about this he was really enthusiastic and tried to persuade the Welsh government to do the same thing and the Government in Whitehall to do the same thing for England but  not successfully.’ Charles also had less success with Mr Blunkett over grammar schools. ‘I would explain that our policy was not to expand grammar schools, and he didn’t like that,’ said the former Education Secretary, who held the post from 1997 to 2001. ‘He was very keen that we should go back to a different era where youngsters had what he would have seen as the opportunity to escape from their background, whereas I wanted to change their background.’ Ministers have long complained about Charles bombarding them with so-called ‘black spider’ handwritten memos, in which he expounded his views on his pet projects. The Attorney General has blocked the release of the letters, saying that to do so would be ‘seriously damaging to his role as future monarch’. Last year the Mail revealed the prince had enjoyed dozens of meetings with cabinet ministers since the election – including two with the present Education Secretary Michael Gove and one with Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey. Charles prompted Peter Hain, another former Cabinet minister, to promote the provision of complementary medicine on the NHS . Paul Flynn, a Labour member of the public administration select committee, said: ‘There is a really serious risk of constitutional crisis and a flare-up between crown and state when Charles becomes king. ‘Charles has strong opinions on a lot of things, including eccentric and barmy anti-science views on homeopathy and GM foods. If there is a clash, he may have such strong views as to refuse a bill.‘He is not only the next head of state; he is acting as a powerful and influential lobbyist.’ Anti-monarchy pressure group Republic said the former ministers’ comments proved that Charles had a political agenda which was ‘at odds with a lot of voters’. Chief executive Graham Smith said: ‘Charles is engaging in an orchestrated and concerted effort to influence government behind closed doors and beyond public scrutiny. He wants the power but doesn’t want the public to know what he’s up to. ‘He is wading into some very controversial issues such as grammar schools, GM crops and alternative medicine. The public has a right to know whether his agenda is having an influence on government decisions. And he tried - but failed - to persuade then Education Secretary David Blunkett of the merits of grammar schools . ‘The Government needs to come clean, reveal the extent of royal influence and the nature of Charles’s lobbying of ministers. Without that transparency our democracy is under threat.’ Former prime minister Sir John Major defended Charles, saying: ‘I think it is encouraging that the Prince of Wales is entirely free from his unique perspective to write to ministers or the prime minister in a way that is invariably intended to be helpful.’ Sir John also revealed that he had changed policy as a result of his weekly meetings with the Queen. ‘I can recall occasions where the Queen, in discussion, put a gloss upon something that made one think and reflect upon whether it was being done in the right fashion at the right time,’ he said. Clarence House said that Charles seeks to help people and communities here and abroad in whatever way he can. A spokesman refused to  ‘comment on private conversations’. MICHAEL MEACHER Environment minister,  1997 to 2003: . ‘We would consort together quietly in order to try and ensure that we increased our influence within government… And I knew that he largely agreed with me and he knew that I largely agreed with him. ‘Climate change is obviously the big one, the really, really big one. The other quite big one is GM, genetic modification. ‘Maybe he was pushing it a bit. I was delighted, of course.’ PETER HAIN Northern Ireland  Secretary, 2005 to 2007 . ‘He had been constantly frustrated at his inability to persuade any health ministers anywhere that [complementary medicine] was a good idea, and so he, as he once described it to me, found me unique from this point of view, in being somebody that actually agreed with him on this, and might want to deliver it. I was able to introduce a trial for complementary medicine on the NHS (in Northern Ireland), and it had spectacularly good results, that people’s well-being and health was vastly improved. ‘And when he learnt about this he was really enthusiastic and tried to persuade the Welsh government to do the same thing and the Government in Whitehall to do the same thing for England, but not successfully.’ DAVID BLUNKETT Education Secretary,  1997 to 2001 . ‘I would explain that our policy was not to expand grammar schools, and he didn’t like that. ‘He was very keen that we should go back to a different era where youngsters had what he would have seen as the opportunity to escape from their background, whereas I wanted to change their background.’ SIR JOHN MAJORPrime Minister 1990 to 1997 . ‘I think it is encouraging that the Prince of Wales is entirely free from his unique perspective to write to ministers or the prime minister in a way that is invariably intended to be helpful, and I think to cut that off, or to make sure those letters are much more bland than they otherwise might be, would be a loss.’ Sir John also revealed that he changed policy as a result of discussions with the Queen. He told the programme: ‘I think every prime minister can think that, and can think of occasions where that happened, I’ve no intention of indicating what they are. But the answer is yes of course. It would be very foolish indeed not to be influenced. ‘I can recall occasions where the Queen in discussion put a gloss upon something that made one think and reflect upon whether it was being done in the right fashion at the right time.’","Michael Meacher said he worked with Prince to persuade Tony Blair to ‘change course’ on green .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A group of Irish cyclists who travelled to Liverpool to raise money for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster had their bikes stolen –  outside Anfield. The six intended to take part in a 96km charity ride across the city to mark the 25th anniversary of the tragedy that left 96 football fans dead. But after taking a tour of Liverpool FC’s Anfield stadium, they returned to find their bikes, equipment and clothing worth more than £30,000 had been stolen from their van, which was parked nearby. The cyclists were doing a tour of Anfield Stadium, pictured, in Liverpool when their bikes, worth £30,000, were stolen from a van parked nearby . The team were all members of the charity Cycle 4 Sick Children and were fundraising for families of the 96 Liverpool football fans died at Hillsborough in 1989 killed in Britain’s worst ever sporting disaster. Last night campaigners spoke of their shock and disgust at the theft of the bikes. James Leech of the Justice for the 96 campaign said: ‘This is a truly despicable crime. ‘These six fundraisers were riding in support of a charity and deserve to be welcomed to Liverpool - they were guests in our city for a good cause. Instead they were left stranded without their bikes. It really is sick.’ The van, pictured with its windows smashed, was parked near Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium when the theft took place - as the cyclists were enjoying a tour of the club . On the Hillsborough Family Support Group page on Facebook, fellow campaigners were equally horrified. Paula Oulton said: ‘Not everyone in Liverpool is like the scum that did this, please don’t tar us all with the same brush. I find this disgusting, disgraceful and totally unacceptable behaviour and the robbers should be public ally named, shamed and flogged.’ Maxine Gibbs said: ‘Let’s hope the thief who took them can read so they see this disgusting act. In time one of their kids could be using that charity. What comes around goes around.’ Liam Murphy, who along with his wife Stacey founded of the charity after their daughter was diagnosed with a rare heart condition, said they were all devastated and begged the thieves to return the bikes. He said: ‘When we came out from the stadium we discovered the van window had been smashed and all bikes, passports, equipment and cash had been stolen. I feel sick to the stomach actually. ‘It’s really hard to put in words what this has done to us as we were over here to support the victims of Hillsborough. ‘With it being the 25th anniversary and so many of us being Liverpool fans, it is a subject that is close to our heart but this has just devastated us.’ The 96 kilometre bike ride was due to take place across Merseyside with all the money raised going to the charity. The Irish cyclists, pictured before the theft took place, were in Liverpool to support victims of the Hillsborough tragedy . Mr Murphy said the theft left them without any cash and they were forced to return home yesterday. Police have given descriptions of the stolen bikes to all officers in the area and have pledged to do 'whatever it takes' to help the riders take part in the race. Chief Inspector Chris Hitchell said: ‘This is an absolutely terrible thing to happen to anyone visiting our city but it is made worse by the fact that this group are here to raise money for charity and a cause which is dear to so many Liverpudlians’ hearts. He added: ‘Everything possible will be done to identify the offenders responsible for this despicable theft and I would call on people within the local area to help us get these bikes back quickly. One of the bikes stolen in a haul of equipment and clothing worth £30,000 . ‘All five are very distinctive and I would urge anyone who knows where they are being hidden or offered for sale to do the decent and honourable thing and call the police or Crimestoppers.’ ‘The victims have travelled all the way over from Ireland to raise money for the families of the Hillsborough victims and they are understandably distraught at what has happened. ‘We and the community will do whatever we can to help them so that they can still take part in tomorrow’s ride.’","Irish cyclists were in Liverpool to support victims of Hillsborough tragedy .

"By . Daniel Martin . To all those who remember the days of Cool Britannia and Tony Blair’s hobnobbing with celebrities, it is a party with a very familiar feel. But tonight’s knees-up for the world of entertainment hosted at the Foreign Office by David Cameron is not, insists Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, simply a repeat of Mr Blair’s much-mocked 1997 reception at Downing Street. Mr Javid was adamant last night that it was an important event to thank the creative industries for their ‘staggering’ success in boosting the British economy by £71billion a year. Tonight¿s knees-up for the world of entertainment hosted at the Foreign Office by David Cameron is not, insists Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, simply a repeat of Mr Blair's much-mocked 1997 reception at Downing Street . Around 200 guests from the world of arts and entertainment are expected to attend, including Harrison Ford, Helena Bonham Carter and Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes. Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, who run Working Title Films which made Four Weddings and a Funeral, are attending; as is Lucian Grainge, chairman and chief executive of Universal Music. Josh Berger, president and managing director of Warner Bros UK, Ireland and Spain and a governor of the British Film Institute is also expected to attend. Harry Potter star Emma Watson and Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch have been invited. Rebekah Brooks (then Wade) arrives at the much-mocked 1997 reception at Downing Street, with ex-partner Ross Kemp . Tony . Blair was mocked for hosting a 'Cool Britannia' party in 1997, attended . by celebrities including Oasis lead singer Noel Gallagher . Actors Dame Helen Mirren and Ralph Fiennes, along with television presenters Clare Balding, Fearne Cotton and Cat Deeley, were tipped to attend. A select group of around a dozen will then go on to Downing Street for a dinner. In an article published today on MailOnline, Mr Javid said: ‘It  is not a showbiz party, or an attempt to bask in reflected glory and coolness. 'It’s an opportunity to thank and encourage the sector, underline our support for the industry, and to remind investors that, from Hogwarts to the Tardis, the UK is very much the centre of the creative universe.’ Mr Javid said the Government’s tax breaks were behind the success, as he pledged new policies in the coming weeks to boost the culture industry even further. In the time it takes you to reads this article, one particular sector of the British economy will generate almost £700,000. It’s a sector that directly employs 1.7 million people, exports to almost every country in the world and, even in a time of strong recovery, is growing three times faster than the rest of the economy. Our creative industries – which include film, TV, theatre, music and video games – are worth a staggering £71 billion each year. Whether it’s One Direction, Downton Abbey or Moshi Monsters, the UK punches well above its weight, consistently producing the music people want to hear, the programmes they want to see and the games they want to play. Even for productions that originate elsewhere, the UK has become the go-to destination. The new Star Wars trilogy is set in a galaxy far, far away, yet it is being made at London’s Pinewood Studios. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock may have looked like they were weightless and out of control thousands of feet above the ground, but the Oscar-winning effects that put them there were created in a down-to-earth office in Soho. Downton . Abbey creator Lord Fellowes and superstar singer Katherine Jenkins are . expected to attend tomorrow night's 'Cool Britannia 2' party . And this isn’t just a London phenomenon. As Her Majesty the Queen saw this week, Game of Thrones’ Iron Throne isn’t in the mythical city of King’s Landing – it’s on a soundstage in the middle of Belfast. The show supports literally thousands of jobs across Northern Ireland and pumps around £100 million a year into the local economy. Meanwhile the producer of Breaking Bad is currently on location in south Wales working on the latest series of Da Vinci’s Demons. And the new TV adaptation of the Outlander books has just finished filming at sites across Scotland.  Diana Gabaldon, the American author behind Outlander, set her novel in the Highlands after seeing an old episode of Dr Who – which is, of course, another of Britain’s great creative exports. This success of our creative industries is down to the hard work, dedication and sheer talent of Britain’s creatives. But the environment in which they have recently flourished was created by the Government. Tax relief for the film, TV, animation and video game sectors has directly led to private sector investment worth hundreds of millions of pounds. In the last three years, employment within the creative industries has grown at five times the rate of the wider economy, and we’re investing more than £20 million in skills and training to back those who want to work hard and get on and to ensure there’s enough new talent in the pipeline. As part of our long-term economic plan, we’ll shortly be setting out an ambitious new strategy to double the value of creative industry exports to £31 billion, while also increasing the value of inward investment in creative UK businesses. This Government’s commitment to the creative industries will be the focus on Monday when the Prime Minister hosts a reception for some of the sector’s leading figures. It’s not a showbiz party, or an attempt to bask in reflected glory and coolness.  It’s an opportunity to thank and encourage the sector, underline our support for the industry, and to remind investors around the world that, from Westeros to the Millennium Falcon, via Hogwarts and the Tardis, the UK is very much the centre of the creative universe.","Will not be repeat of Tony Blair’s mocked 1997 Downing Street reception .

"By . Leon Watson . They were the magnificent men in their flying machines, risking their lives for the mother country. And now, the diverse make-up of Britain's heroic air force during the World War One has been uncovered by newly-revealed records. The records, digitised by family history website Findmypast.co.uk, reveal the history of the Royal Air Force in the Great War, from the first aerial troops in 1899, through the war and into World War Two. Findmypast has worked with the National Archives to release nearly 450,000 service records of men of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force, including 342,000 airmen's records never seen online before. Newly-released: This picture dated circa 1916 shows 24 Squadron as newly digitised records shed light on the history of the Royal Air Force . Made up of National Archives officers' service records and airmen's records, they contain information about their peacetime and military career, as well as physical descriptions, religious denominations and family statuses, with details of next of kin often included. The records are forming part of Findmypast's 100 in 100 promise, which aims to deliver 100 record sets in 100 days. Many date from 1912 with the formation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and include men who continued to serve in the RAF until 1939, while the earliest date from 1899 with the Royal Engineers Balloon Service in the Boer War. The RAF was formed on April 1, 1918. The files also show how the First World War brought together different levels of society, as well as people from all over the world. More than 58 nationalities served in the RAF during the war, with men signing up from as far afield as India, Brazil, Japan, and Russia. They include the first Indian to fly into combat, Hardutt Singh Malik, who became the only Indian aviator to survive the war despite ending up with bullet wounds to his legs that required several months' hospital treatment. Air Battalion officers line up for an undated group photo, found in the National Archives officers' service records and airmen's records . The newly-released records also reveal how working-class airmen flew side by side with officers, and were equally celebrated . A photo dated circa 1915 issued by National Archive shows soldiers experimenting with carrying guns on airships . After the war, he joined the Indian Civil Service, serving as the Indian ambassador to France, and after his retirement became India's finest golf player, even with two German bullets still embedded in his leg, according to Findmypast. The newly-released records also reveal how working-class airmen flew side by side with officers, and were equally celebrated. One flying ace Arthur Ernest Newland had humble origins as one of at least nine children from Enfield, north London, but went on to twice receive the Distinguished Flying Medal, ending the war having destroyed 19 enemy aircraft - 17 single-handedly. A portrait of Albert Ball as newly digitised records from Findmypast.co.uk shed light on the history of the Royal Air Force, from the first aerial troops in 1899, through its pivotal moments in the First World War and the men that continued to serve into the Second World War .

The back of an airship shed used by the RAF in the Naval Airship Station, Dunkirk, northern France . RAF officer Edgar Albert Nixon with a machine gun. His records were among the 450,000 digitised by the National Archives . John Cowell, one of 10 children from a poor family in Limerick, also became a celebrated airman during the war. Between May 5 and July 28 1917, Cowell scored 15 victories as a gunner, and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal on June 11 1918, as well as the Military Medal with Bar. Returning as a pilot in 20 Squadron he scored his final victory a year and a day after his 15th but was shot down and killed the next day by balloon buster Friedrich Ritter von Roth of Jasta 16. With their peacetime occupation in the records, they show another side of the drama of the First World War - with 104 actors, nine comedians and even one music hall artiste making up the RAF ranks. Paul Nixon, military expert at Findmypast.co.uk, said: 'It's a real treat to have such an extensive set of records about the everyday airmen of World War One. 'These people, drawn from all walks of life, and from all over the world, played an incredibly important part in shaping our history, particularly in the development of aerial warfare. 'To have many of these hitherto unseen records easily accessible online for the first time mean that now many people can discover the Biggles in their own family.' William Spencer, author and principal military records specialist at The National Archives, said: 'These records reveal the many nationalities of airmen that joined forces to fight in the First World War. 'Now these records are online, people can discover the history of their ancestors, with everything from their physical appearance right through to their conduct and the brave acts they carried out which helped to win the war.'","Records released by National Archives reveal the history of the Royal Air Force in First World War .

"By . Larisa Brown . Council chiefs have issued a 13 point checklist telling children how to play outside, it emerged yesterday. The ‘outdoor play code’ included instructions such as ‘don’t climb over walls’, ‘try not to shout’ and ‘don’t play in one place for a long time’. Children were also warned to keep their play area tidy, that playing on the roads could be illegal and to ask neighbours before going into their gardens to retrieve balls. A council has decided today's children need a 13-point checklist telling them how to play outside . The briefing was posted through the doors of families in North Tyneside, Newcastle, after a resident complained about several incidents of groups of children playing ball games on a number of local roads. A child kicking a ball into a resident’s garden and damaging their plants is also believed to have triggered action from the council. Within days, everyone in the area received a letter from the council to say children’s play would be monitored and residents should read the ‘outdoor play code’. Last night local residents were furious about the letter and branded the move ‘ridiculous’. A father-of-two, who lives on one of the roads affected, said: ‘I was very surprised to get a letter. ‘There was an incident a few weeks ago, a ball had gone into a man’s garden and some of his flowers were squashed. It was all tittle-tattle and then we receive this letter through the door. ‘The play code is quite condescending. The council have not given any evidence of how many complaints have been made and to what extent the damage is, if any. Mother-of-two Sally Farn, 55, said she was furious over the council’s letter. A child kicking a ball into a resident's garden and damaging their plants is  believed to have been part of the reason why the council took action (file picture) Mrs Farn, whose two grandchildren, Abi Lee, nine, and her seven-year-old brother Steven, live with her in one of the roads, said: ‘I think this is absolutely ridiculous. They aren’t allowed to play in the street but there is nothing else for them to do around here. ‘I don’t like my kids to play away from the door. I like to be able to see them so I can keep an eye on them. ‘This is a stupid set of rules. The people who created them obviously don’t have kids or theirs have grown up. ‘They should back off and let the kids play.’ Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah warned at the time that children should not be made to feel like criminals for playing in the outdoors. A spokesperson for North Tyneside Council said: ‘As a council we want all of North Tyneside’s children and young people to enjoy playing safely outdoors, especially in the long summer evenings. We have a great range of leisure activities and some brilliant parks and play sites. ‘But we also have a role to play in making sure neighbours get along together. ‘Over the years, particularly in summer, we get complaints about a tiny minority of young people upsetting some residents. In order to be fair to everyone, we have a ‘Play Code’ which we simply drop off in an area where there have been complaints. ‘This allows everyone to understand what is reasonable.’","Council bosses issue 13 point check list telling children how to play outside .

"By . Tom Hodgkinson . Giant Asda stores are not the most inspiring of locations, especially on a Monday lunchtime. In Manchester, retired couples and stressed-out mums with pushchairs are getting their groceries. The atmosphere is humdrum. But up on the first floor, just next to the George clothing section, something extraordinary is happening. Spitting images? The real Hodgkinson Family, left, and their replicas, right . A construction 12ft high stands at the top of the escalator. It looks like a cross between a photo booth and the futuristic transporter in Star Trek. Alongside it, a gaggle of shoppers, excited Asda executives and nerds with computers gather in anticipation. They’re watching a tattooed man standing in the middle of the contraption holding his two-year-old son. The geeks press buttons and a series of cameras rotate around the man. Twelve seconds later, he steps out. What is happening? Well, this is the world’s first high-speed 3D full body scanner, which takes countless pictures of the person inside, then uses them to produce miniature ceramic figurines supposedly identical to the subject. It sounds like a marvellous idea. After all, who wouldn’t love a model of themselves to brighten up a shelf? (Asda have dubbed them ‘shelfies’ rather than ‘selfies’ for this reason.) It certainly beats the Georgian milkmaids and carthorses that decorated my grandparents’ home when I was a boy. Suddenly, the family portrait seems much more fun. Little statues of ourselves, our pets, our loved ones and friends could replace boring pictures. Admittedly, they are a little pricey at £60 per person, but it seems reasonable to keep my two technology-obsessed sons happy. We travel to the Manchester store to get ourselves immortalised in ceramic in this photobooth for the 21st century. The boys — nine-year-old Henry and Arthur, 14 — take one look at the machine and pronounce it ‘cool!’ My wife Victoria, 50, and I are more reticent. After all, the effigies will be a permanent record of how we look. Because of this, we seem to have both unconsciously smartened up a little: I’m in a suit, perfectly respectable for a dad of 46, while my wife is wearing fashionable heels and a skirt. The boys are in their usual jeans and T-shirts. First to be scanned is Henry. He stands on the podium, and the machine whirs around him like something out of  Austin Powers for 12 seconds. Arthur follows enthusiastically. Next it’s my turn. I step into the booth, suck in my stomach and get my pose right. Am I being horribly vain? Well, in any portrait you want to look good, and I’m aware that in this one it’ll be harder to hide my flaws than in a picture. And this model might be around for all eternity. Finally, Victoria strikes a pose. The cameras move around and, suddenly, it’s all over. The Hodgkinsons’ futuristic family portrait is in the bag — but now we face an agonising week-long wait to see how it turned out. The 3D scanners will be opening in ten Asda stores, the locations of which have not yet been revealed, in August (file picture) So how does it all work? Four scanners, incorporating digital cameras, move over the body and produce 1,000 digital photographs. These help create a 3D image on a computer. The cameras also take the subject’s measurements, like a robotic tailor. The data, including your vital statistics, is sent to Asda’s mini-me production plant in the North, where the models are created out of thin layers of ceramic material using 3D printers. Each figure is built up very gradually from the feet upwards in tiny layers just 0.1mm thick, which can be made in as many as 16 million colours. All this leads to the lifelike quality of the models. A few days later we excitedly unpack our mini-me models — and fall about laughing. It is unnerving to see yourself in miniature. I think mine, 8in tall, makes me look a bit pot-bellied, and a cross between . David Cameron and George Osborne - definitely not the idea. Victoria wishes she’d had her hair done. And so does Arthur, who asks: ‘Why is my hair green?’ He’s got a point. It does, indeed, seem to have a green hue — I think the printer picked the wrong one of those 16 million colours. Henry is so pleased he snatches his up and runs out of the house to show the neighbours. While Henry might be thrilled with his model, they are not perfect. The scale is a bit wonky. Mini Henry and Arthur are both 7in tall, whereas in real life Arthur is taller. And the figures are delicate. Arthur’s hand breaks off and we have to superglue it back on. The best thing is how the frowns, crows feet and worry lines on my face and — I’ll get in trouble for this — Victoria’s, have been ironed out. The adult models definitely look better than the real thing. ‘Apart from my hair, it’s quite flattering,’ smiles Victoria. I love the shelfies and display them in pride of place on a shelf (where else?) in the kitchen. They are like little works of art. Now we can all become a modern masterpiece. Technology firms have begun offering similar 3D mini-mes, but this is the first time they are available on the High Street. The 3D scanners will be opening in ten Asda stores, the locations of which have not yet been revealed, in August. The press office suggests myriad uses for the figurines: athletes could pose with their medals or pregnant women with their bumps. A soldier’s wife could keep one at home when her husband is away. Granny could have models of her grandchildren above the fireplace. A soldier’s wife could keep one at home . when her husband is away. Granny could have models of her grandchildren . above the fireplace . You could get yourself scanned at significant moments in your life, such as graduating from college, getting married or after winning a race. Maybe you could even dot them around the garden, a modern equivalent of the garden gnome. But less honourable uses are also possible. They could get thrown across the room during heated rows. You could send one of your ex-lover to them in the post, smashed into fragments. Big brothers could use the figure of their little brother as target practice with a sling and stones. Spiteful sisters could scrawl rude words on their sibling’s figure. Might they even become sophisticated voodoo dolls? Whether they are used for good or evil, I think shelfies will be a huge success. They combine two human preoccupations: little folk and vanity. The mini-mes are different from photos — especially  modern ones, often kept on computers and phones and never framed — in one  important sense. They are a physical memento you can touch and cherish. In a funny way, this new technology is taking us back in time to an age of real things — actual belongings you can touch and appreciate. And I’m sure these figurines will see some moralists accusing fans of vanity and self-obsession. ‘The cult of the mini-me!’ they will thunder. ‘First the selfie and now the shelfie! Where will it end?’ But there is something comical about the models that stops them feeling too narcissistic. The mini-mes raise a smile whenever I see them now, sitting on the kitchen shelf, frozen in time, small but perfectly formed.","The world's first high speed 3D full body scanner hitting the high streets .

"By . Darren Boyle . Extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammad will not be allowed back into Britain, the Government has insisted amid reports he intends to claim asylum in the UK. The radical Islamic cleric faces the death sentence for running a terror cell in Lebanon and claims he has been tortured, according to reports. Family members have said they are launching an urgent appeal to allow him back into Britain under asylum laws but the Home Office has ruled out a return. Omar Bakri Muhammad, left, is seeking asylum following his arrest on terror charges in Lebanon. He shared a 2002 London platform with Abu Hamza, right, who was found guilty in the US of supporting terrorism . Omar Bakri Muhammed, pictured, began preaching in the UK and fled after the 7/7 terror attacks fearing arrest . Bakri, who holds Syrian and Lebanese citizenship, lived in Britain for 20 years and led radical group Al Muhajiroun until it was disbanded. He faced possible treason charges over his support for the London bombers in 2005 and fled Britain for Lebanon. The British Government barred him from returning. At the time, he described the 7/7 bombers as the 'fantastic four', but left Britain fearing arrest. Speaking to journalists in 2005 from Beirut, Bakri claimed he would never return to Britain as the government refused to accept his support of Osama Bin Laden and the need for jihad. The cleric has been repeatedly linked with al Qaida but has denied the claims. Omar Bakri Mohammed, pictured, claimed back in 2003 that British Muslims were preparing to act as suicide bombers - two years before the 7/7 attacks in 2005 . Earlier this year he went on the run after raids in Tripoli to end sectarian violence after clashes that left dozens dead. Bakri, pictured here in 2005 in Beirut claimed at the time he would never return to Britain as the government cannot accept his support of 'Osama Bin Laden and jihad' A Home Office spokesman said: 'An individual must be physically present in the UK in order to make a claim for asylum. 'Omar Bakri Muhammad was permanently excluded from the UK in 2005 on the grounds that his presence is not conducive to the public good. 'As Omar Bakri Muhammad is excluded from the UK, he will be unable to make a claim for asylum.' Lebanese security officials Bakri is the mastermind behind a terrorist cell based in Tripoli. He has spent more than one month in custody and despite his regular denials of al Qaeda membership he has expressed public support for several of their affiliated groups. Authorities in Lebanon believe Bakri is linked to Al Qaeda and is responsible for a series of attacks both on Army personnel in recent months and inciting sectarian fighting in Tripoli, which left 30 dead and over 160 wounded. Omar Bakri, believed to be 54 now, was previously the London-based spiritual leader of the extremist group Al-Muhajiroun. He lived in London where he was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah. Bakri was under investigation by UK police after he called for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda. On the London bombings it was also reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as 'the fantastic four'. He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they 'did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan'. Bakri, pictured, said Britain would continue to be at risk from jihadists while British troops remained in the middle east. In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’. He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’. The radical Islamic cleric was under house arrest in Tripoli since Lebanese security forces released him from jail in 2010, after striking a deal with the Shia extremist group Hezbollah. Bakri was sentenced to life following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony. If found guilty of the current charges against him in Lebanon though, Bakri will face the death sentence.","Bakri's family fear the hate preacher will be tortured by Lebanese authorities .

"By . Andrew Levy . It sounds like it could have come straight from the script of a  Midsomer Murders episode. For ten years elderly residents of the Georgian market town of Holt have been terrorised by poison pen letters dropping on their doormats. The chilling letters, which are handwritten and filled with profanities, contain threats for them to leave their homes. Mystery: The letters have been sent to residents of Holt, Norfolk, for a decade, threatening elderly and urging them to leave their homes . At least 15 have been posted in the  Norfolk town, with no clue as to who was responsible or why. All that was known was that, based on the handwriting, they appeared to have been written by the same person. One extract, released by police, reads: ‘The longer you leave it, the sooner you will have to vacate the property.’ Now, the net could be closing in after a local newspaper put examples of the offending material on posters in the town and offered a £1,000 reward for information. About 50 people responded and police have questioned a local man. One resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Whoever is behind it, I hope it ends soon. It’s a nasty business and completely out of place in Holt.’ Threats: At least 15 elderly residents have received letters such as this one, all apparently written by the same person . The unsigned letters – written in blue ink and with distinctive, unusually scripted ‘p’s – appear to have started dropping onto doormats about ten years ago. One unfortunate household has received two. According to police, the personal nature of the letters indicates the author knows who they are writing to. Paul Reed, 44, who runs P&S Butchers on the high street, said: ‘My wife’s grandparents have been receiving them. They were telling them to get out of their house and they were quite horrible. ‘They just ignored them at first but as they kept coming we said they should speak to the police. ‘One guy said he’d been receiving these letters since 2004. ‘Quite abusive with f-words and the like. Another man said his wife has been receiving letters using her maiden name, falsely accusing him of having an affair with women at work.’ Theories in the town are rife about what the possible motive could be. ‘Maybe it is someone with a grudge or someone who wants their neighbour out,’ said June Wood, 78. A life-long resident, who would only give his name as Chris, suggested: ‘It’s probably a crackpot property developer trying to drive house prices down.’ Postman Ben Trent, 26, revealed he had been approached by Norfolk Police to make use of his local knowledge but was unable to help. ‘I don’t recognise the writing but handwritten letters are rare these days,’ he added. And Erik Rees, a handwriting expert with the British Institute of Graphologists, provided a profile of the suspect, saying the person is ‘highly introverted with signs of paranoia and has pent up emotions with difficulty in expressing himself’. Sending threatening letters carries a maximum six-month jail term or a £5,000 fine under the Malicious Communications Act. The culprit could also be prosecuted under harassment legislation or be made subject of a restraining order.","Residents in Holt, Norfolk have been receiving letters for ten years .

"By . Mark Duell . Islamophobic hate crimes are more likely to be committed against women than men, a study has claimed. Female victims suffer attacks because they appear ‘more visibly Muslim’ thanks to traditional dress such as the niqab or abaya - and they are also perceived as ‘soft targets’, researchers believe. The study by Teesside University academics found 54 per cent of Islamophobia victims were female, with many of the attacks said to ‘opportunistic’. Islamophobia: Female victims suffer attacks because they appear 'more visibly Muslim' thanks to traditional dress such as the niqab or abaya - and women also are perceived as 'soft targets', researchers believe . Four in every five assailants that could be identified by the researchers were male, with most of them between the ages of 10 and 30, reported Jonathan Brown of The Independent. The researchers also claimed that Muslim women would rather tell them them than police about their experiences, with a ‘fear factor’ developing that is leaving some of them afraid to go outside. The report comes two weeks after Muslim student Nahid Almanea, 31, was fatally stabbed 16 times as she walked along a secluded pathway to her English class at the University of Essex in Colchester. Detectives have said one of the ‘main lines’ of their inquiry was that the Saudi Arabian student could have been singled out for being a Muslim as a result of her headscarf and long robe. A 52-year-old man who was initially arrested has been released without charge. But last week police arrested a 19-year-old man in connection with the attack. No-one has yet been charged. Attacked: Muslim student Nahid Almanea, 31, was stabbed 16 times as she walked along a secluded pathway to her English class at the University of Essex in Colchester earlier this month. She is pictured on CCTV . Study author Dr Matthew Feldman said: ‘Hate crime tends to be a male-on-male phenomenon. But here we are seeing exactly the opposite: white men under 30 attacking women wearing traditional Muslim dress.’ 'Hate crime tends to be a male-on-male phenomenon. But here we are seeing exactly the opposite: white men under 30 attacking women wearing traditional Muslim dress' Dr Matthew Feldman, study author . He added that while other hate crimes have been on the decrease in recent years, those against Muslims were rising. Researchers analysed anti-Muslim incidents recorded by the Faith Matters group's Tell Mama project. Attacks on Muslims went up nearly fourfold after Drummer Lee Rigby's murder in May 2013 in south-east London, including 23 assaults and 13 attacks involving extreme violence. Fiyaz Mughal, director of Tell Mama, claimed Islamophobic attacks are widely under-reported, with just 24 of the 43 police force areas in England and Wales label crime as religiously aggravated. He told The Independent: ‘We know we are only getting a snapshot of what's happening, but fear and apprehension are clearly evident among Muslim women.’","Female victims suffer attacks because they appear 'more visibly Muslim'

"By . Associated Press . The Libyan militant accused of masterminding the deadly Benghazi attacks that have become a flashpoint in U.S. politics pleaded not guilty to conspiracy Saturday in a federal courtroom in Washington. In a 10-minute hearing held amid tight security, Ahmed Abu Khattala spoke just two words, both in Arabic. He replied 'yes' when asked to swear to tell the truth and 'no' when asked if he was having trouble understanding the proceeding. A grand jury indictment handed up . under seal Thursday says Abu Khattala took part in a conspiracy to . provide material support and resources to terrorists in the 2012 attacks . that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The government said it soon would file more charges against Abu Khattala. During his initial court appearance, . Abu Khattala listened via headphones to a translation of the . proceedings. He wore a two-piece black track suit, had a beard and long . curly hair, both mostly gray, and kept his hands, which were not . handcuffed, behind his back. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

U.S. Marshals Service said it had taken custody of Abu Khattalah, who . now was confined to a detention facility in the capital region, ending a . harried day for the Libyan. U.S. special forces captured Abu Khattala in Libya two weeks ago. Officials had been questioning Abu Khattala aboard a Navy ship that transported him to the United States. Abu Khattala was flown by military helicopter from the ship to a National Park Service landing pad in the city's Anacostia neighborhood, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the transfer publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Keeping guard: U.S. Marshals are seen outside the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse on Saturday . Protection: U.S. Federal Marshals patrol outside the U.S. federal courthouse in Washington on Saturday . A criminal complaint filed last year that was unsealed after his capture charges him with terror-related crimes, including killing a person during an attack on a federal facility, a crime that can be punishable by death. The prosecution in a courthouse in the nation's capital reflects the Obama administration's stated position of trying suspected terrorists in the American criminal justice system even as Republicans call for Abu Khattala and others to be held at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Critics say suspected terrorists don't deserve the legal protections afforded by the American court. The Obama administration considers the civilian justice system fairer and more efficient. The violence on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon quickly became a political flashpoint. Republicans accused the White House, as the 2012 presidential election neared, of intentionally misleading the public about what prompted the attacks. The White House accused Republicans of politicizing a national tragedy. Abu Khattala was a prominent figure in Benghazi's circles of extremists. He was popular among young radicals and lived openly in the eastern Libyan city, spotted at cafes and other public places, even after the Obama administration publicly named him as a suspect. He is accused of being a member of the Ansar al-Shariah group, the powerful Islamic militia that the U.S. believes was behind the attack. He acknowledged in an interview with The Associated Press in January that he was present during the storming of the U.S. mission in Benghazi. But he denied involvement in the attack, saying he was trying to organize a rescue of trapped people.

The compound's main building was set ablaze. Ambassador Chris Stevens suffocated to death inside and another American was shot dead. Later in the evening, gunmen attacked and shelled a safe house, killing two more Americans. At the time, several witnesses said they saw Abu Khattala directing fighters at the site. No evidence has emerged that Abu Khattala was involved in the later attack on the safe house. An anonymous law enforcement official told the New York Times that 'brutal' conditions in Libya slowed down the investigation. 'We were dealing with one of the most non-permissive environments at the time, and our guys were able to put together a case,' the source said. 'We have plenty of evidence to convict this guy,' the source told the Times. 'Now it’s just a matter of getting him to the courthouse.' Abu Khattala is one of just a few cases in which the administration has captured a suspected terrorist overseas and interrogated him for intelligence purposes before bringing him to federal court to face charges. Those cases include Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who was arrested in Jordan in March 2013 and turned over to U.S. agents. A jury in New York City convicted him in March of conspiring to kill Americans.","Ahmed Abu Khattala faces criminal charges in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans from the attack on Sept. 11, 2012 .

"By . Hugo Gye . Margaret Thatcher was not known as a gourmet - but she may have helped Britain become the culinary capital of Europe, according to a leading chef. Michelin-starred restaurateur Michel Roux claims that his home country of France is falling behind the UK thanks to its use of pre-packaged ingredients and microwaved meals. He blames the decline on EU regulations which limit the number of hours chefs can work - and credits Thatcher with stopping Britain going the same way. Warning: Michel Roux says that France's culinary scene is in decline thanks to employment laws . Mr Roux, 73, moved to Britain nearly half a century ago, and along with his brother Albert set up two of the country's best restaurants, Le Gavroche in London and the Waterside Inn in Berkshire. He is therefore well placed to compare the culinary tradition of France with that of the UK - and his firm opinion is that the French are set to lose their world domination. A combination of French working time laws and European regulations mean that most workers in France are restricted to working 35 hours a week, which is a far cry from the exhausting hours traditionally worked by chefs. According to Mr Roux, this means that French restaurants are forced to take shortcuts to get round the problem of shorter working hours. Saviour: Mr Roux says that Margaret Thatcher's refusal to introduce legislation rescued British restaurants . 'When the food comes in the morning, you have to unwrap it, clean it, store it, prepare it properly,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'In those hours, you can't do that. 'So restaurants are buying food which is either pre-cooked, vacuum-packed or frozen. Instead of having three or four chefs in a bistro, they have one who can open a baguette and put food in the microwave.' He added: 'Chefs work long hours, some up to 50 hours in five days. Does it hurt them? Do they feel worse? They are proud of their job and what they're doing. 'In France, they've lost it. How can you be proud of doing your job reheating food out of packets?' Achievement: Mr Roux founded the Waterside Inn, one of the best restaurants in the UK . Britain has repeatedly sought to opt out of EU employment legislation under leaders including Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron. Asked whether he thought Thatcher was responsible for Britain's culinary rise, Mr Roux replied: 'My God, she saved the country!' Although he still visits France every month, he told the Telegraph he now avoids bistros and brasseries because the average standard has fallen so far. Despite Mr Roux's outburst, there are still far more restaurants in France which are considered world-class than there are in Britain. Just four British restaurants - including the Waterside Inn - hold three Michelin stars, compared to 26 in France.","Founder of Le Gavroche and Waterside Inn says his home country is now dependent on pre-packaged ingredients .

"By . Simon Walters . and Brendan Carlin . Working class: John Major would front the campaign . An attempt to play down the Conservative Party’s ‘posh’ image backfired when a campaign to promote working-class Tory MPs found only 14 with sufficiently humble roots. Panicking party chiefs have now launched a desperate search for more Conservative MPs who were not ‘born with silver spoons in their mouths’ – begging them to step forward to rescue the initiative. David Cameron had hoped to launch the campaign, which features former Prime Minister John Major, the son of a circus performer, at the party conference in September. But he has been forced to go back to the drawing board because the 14 ‘working-class Tories’ featured in the new ‘Party of Opportunity’ campaign represent fewer than one in 20 of its 305 MPs. To add to the problems, other MPs have said that some of the ‘I’m a working-class Tory’ claims are ‘laughable’. And the organiser, David Amess, has faced a revolt by fellow MPs who have said that despite their genuinely modest backgrounds, they had been given no opportunity to take part. In an email marked ‘strictly private and confidential’ he told them: ‘A number of colleagues have complained that they are working class and want to know why they were not included. I did my best to identify working-class Tories and I am sorry if you were left out. As a result we are producing a further edition. If you have working-class credentials and want to contribute, let me know.’ Mr Amess’s account of his own working-class roots states: ‘I was born in the East End of London. We had no bathroom, a tin bath used to hang on the wall outside, an outside toilet, and a scrubbing board, not a washing machine. We didn’t have a telephone, we just threw the window open and shouted loudly. So when I became Basildon MP I was completely at home with lots of Eastenders.’ High Peak MP Andrew Bingham wrote: ‘My grandfather was a chef who once made a cake for [Russian Communist leader] Nikita Khrushchev.’ Armed Forces Minister and Essex MP Mark Francois said: ‘Defence brought me into politics. I was fascinated by the Second World War and my bedroom was full of Airfix models and plastic soldiers. ‘I’ve always had contempt for champagne socialists racked by middle-class guilt who profess their love for working-class people but would scarcely dream of inviting them to dinner.’ Rethink: Cameron will have to reconsider after an e-mail by David Amess (right) who organised the campaign . Yorkshire Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke wrote: ‘Seeing people I went to school with who never bothered doing homework or paying any attention fail their exams and spend years living off the State shaped me. ‘I used to be up at 5am to do the papers in WH Smith before college, and got up at 4am to sweep a factory floor while doing my degree.’ Former miner, Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin, and Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Sajid Javid, whose father came to Britain from Pakistan with £1 in his pocket, also feature in the campaign. One Conservative MP told  The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are right to be proud of real working-class Tory heroes like Major, McLoughlin and Sajid. ‘But this campaign has been badly handled. With only 14 MPs, it has played into our opponents’ hands. ‘One or two of the stories sound like the Monty Python sketch where one Yorkshireman boasts about living in a shoe box in the middle of a road and another says he lived in a paper bag in a septic tank.’","PM hoped to launch campaign with John Major at September conference .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Facebook conducted an experiment among nearly 700,000 users to gauge how posts on the site affect people's moods. The social media giant manipulated news feeds of just over 689,000 users to highlight either positive or negative items and then monitored responses over the course of a random week. It found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts, according to the results of a study published this week in PNAS Journal. Massive study: A team of researchers culling data from nearly 700,000 Facebook users found that our moods are affected by posts from friends . ‘This tested whether exposure to emotions led people to change their own posting behaviors, in particular whether exposure to emotional content led people to post content that was consistent with the exposure,’ the study said. Researchers found that negative posts are met with encouragement, but a reduction in happy posts was met with a surprising amount of negativity. ‘When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,’ said the team. Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word, according to the researchers. ‘These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.’ Of the millions of posts analyzed, four-million were found to be positive and 1.8million were determined to be negative. The findings led the team to conclude that ‘in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion.’ This experiment was limited to users who viewed Facebook in English, but it is not known across which geographic boundaries. The social network has more than 1.28billion active users around the world.","Facebook manipulated the data feeds of 689,003 users for one week .

"By . Darren Boyle . A woman who was dubbed the 'Angel of Woolwich' for confronting the killers of soldier Lee Rigby is facing a police investigation over an allegation of racial abuse. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 49 ,was praised by Prime Minister David Cameron for her actions shortly after Fusilier Rigby, 25, was killed near his barracks in Woolwich, southeast London, in May last year. But she is now under investigation following claims a Tesco worker was racially abused at a store in Helston, Cornwall.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the force was investigating an allegation of 'verbal racist abuse' at the Tesco store. A Tesco spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident which took place at our Helston store on Friday. Colleagues at the store are helping the police with their inquiries.' Miss Loyau-Kennett received national acclaim for calmly talking to armed Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale after they murdered Fusilier Rigby in the street. Tesco confirmed they are aware of an incident at the Helston store in Cornwall, pictured, on Friday afternoon . On the first anniversary of the killing, Miss Loyau-Kennett spoke at the scene where she checked Fusilier Rigby's pulse and confronted Adebowale. She said: 'It has been a waste of three lives and, of course, a year on I still think about Lee Rigby's mother losing a son. It's a tragedy. I don't have flashbacks but I have been very emotional lately. 'This street looks like a normal street now but I can still see the body, see the crashed car and see the bloodied hands.' Adebolajo, 29, was given a whole life sentence, and Adebowale, 22, told he must serve a minimum of 45 years at the Old Bailey in February.","Ingrid Loyau-Kennett comforted Lee Rigby as he lay dying on the ground .

"By . Sam Webb . A father was stopped by police after they saw him talking on his mobile phone while driving - and then discovered 20kgs of high-grade heroin in the car. Ian Hayton, of Garston, Liverpool, tried to outrun officers after they spotted him using the phone as he left a pub, ploughing through red lights, roundabouts and endangering pedestrians as he tried to evade his pursuers for five miles. The 43-year-old, whose girlfriend was also in the Skoda Octavia, was eventually blocked by traffic and arrested. Ian Hayton, of Garston, Liverpool, tried to outrun officers after they spotted him using the phone as he left a pub . Officers searched the vehicle and discovered the heroin, valued at £1million, in the boot. They also found a list of names and numbers of what are believed to be potential customers in the February 16 incident. Stephen McNally, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was shouting ""is it just because I was on my mobile phone?"". 'When the vehicle was searched it became apparent why the defendant had driven away from the police.' The judge, Miss Recorder Goddard, initially gave Hayton 10 years in jail, but reduced the sentence because of the impact it would have on his 22-year-old son, who is severely disabled and requires extensive care, reports the Liverpool Echo. Journey's end: Hayton was eventually blocked by traffic after the chase and arrested in Mackets Lane, Liverpool . His barrister, Michael Bagley, said Hayton's high-pressure personal life led to a descent into drink and drugs and had become involved in dealing as a result. He added: 'Those in a leading role do not get their hands dirty. They are not the ones who actually do the moving around of drugs. 'They are the ones who exploit others and induce others into their criminal organisations by dependency, then debt, then applying pressure.' Hayton, who admitted dangerous driving and conspiracy to supply drugs, was also banned from driving. Detective Inspector Mark Baker, from the Matrix Serious Organised Crime team said Hayton was 'consumed by his own greed and the desire to make money'.","Ian Hayton was spotted using his phone at the wheel as he left a pub .

"By . Daniel Martin . The Conservatives could consider all-women shortlists if the next election does not result in more female MPs, one of the party’s rising stars has said. Nicky Morgan, who was recently appointed women’s minister and is tipped for promotion to the Cabinet, said no option is ‘off the table’. But almost as soon as she made the comments on the Mumsnet parenting website, a senior Tory source said the idea was ‘categorically not an option’. Nicky Morgan was recently appointed women's minister made the comments to parenting website Mumsnet . Mrs Morgan’s suggestion will be controversial with many among the Tory grassroots, who have strongly resisted all-women shortlists, saying local associations should be allowed to choose candidates freely. David Cameron’s critics say he has a ‘women problem’ which intensified when he was pictured in the Commons with only men on his front bench. Only three out of 27 members of the Cabinet are women despite a pre-election pledge that a third would be. Only 16 per cent of Conservative MPs are women whereas for Labour – the only major party with all-women shortlists – the tally is 33 per cent. The Liberal Democrats have the worst record. Only 13 per cent of their MPs are female. Last month Nick Clegg suggested he would consider all-women shortlists unless things improved after 2015. But Mrs Morgan’s comments are an indication that the plan is being considered by some senior Tories. It is the first time she has set out her position on the issue since she became women’s minister in April. Asked about all-women shortlists by a Mumsnet user, Mrs Morgan said the party was taking the issue of women’s representation very seriously but too few female candidates were coming forward. ‘I think we need to see where we end up in 2015 and if we are still struggling to get more women MPs then no option is off the table,’ she said. For the 2010 election Mr Cameron introduced an A-list of priority candidates for the most winnable seats which was roughly equally split between men and women, helping the party’s number of female MPs to rise from 17 to 48. That system was dropped after the election and only around a third of candidates selected to stand in 2015 are women. Mr Cameron has been taunted by Labour for having a ‘women problem’ and was once accused of sexism for telling a female Labour frontbencher to ‘calm down, dear’. His government has also been accused of failing to support stay-at-home mums. He is under increasing pressure from some Conservatives to consider all-women shortlists. Earlier this year ex-Cabinet minister Caroline Spelman, a former party chairman, said she wasn’t opposed to the idea.","All-women shortlists, already slammed at 'not an option'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Dog attacks against postal workers have jumped by 8 per cent in the past year to more than 3,300, Royal Mail has revealed. Around nine postmen and women are attacked by dogs every day, sometimes leading to a permanent disabling injury. Ahead of legislation making it possible to prosecute dog owners for attacks on private property, the postal group called the number of incidents ‘unacceptably high’. Biting risk: Around nine postmen and women are attacked by dogs every day, sometimes leading to a permanent disabling injury . Royal Mail chairman Donald Brydon said: ‘We know that most dogs are not inherently dangerous, however, even the most placid animal can be prone to attack if it feels its territory is being threatened. ‘Our first priority as an employer is to ensure the welfare and safety of our people who provide a valuable service to our customers. Bad Fido: New legislation will make it possible for dog owners to be prosecuted . ‘We appeal to owners to keep their pets under control, especially if they know their pets have a territorial nature. 'It can also be simple things that help - for example just making sure the dog is kept inside when the postman calls.’ Dave Joyce, the Communication Workers Union’s health and safety officer, said: ‘It is so important for the safety of all postmen and women that dog owners ensure their animals are secure, particularly if opening the door to sign for a parcel. ‘Owners must be aware that it’s now a criminal offence if their dog attacks the postman or woman on private property. ‘The change in the law now means there will be tougher penalties and prison sentences for irresponsible dog owners. ‘We welcome this as for too long, postal workers who offer a first class service have been subjected to reckless dog ownership leaving them vulnerable at work and unprotected when a dog attack occurred.’ Royal Mail today launched a Dog Awareness Week, including a special postmark on letters, in a bid to raise awareness of the problem.","Royal Mail calls the number of dog attacks on postmen 'unacceptably high'

"By . Mary Greene . On 10 May 1814 - 200 years ago today - two boys made an escape attempt from their boarding school in Brentford. 'Dixon Sr & Price ran away at 4 o'clock this morning,' one of their schoolmates confided to his diary, suitably impressed. 'They put on the best clothes, borrowed some money and dropt from the window... It was not till supper that Morris (the schoolmaster0 was told that they had gone to Eton - There was a great jaw all day about it - They came back at bedtime.' A new exhibition at the V&A will showcase the inner thoughts of teenagers over the past 200 years . The young diarist was 14-year-old Raleigh Trevelyan, whose journal makes painful reading. His miscreant classmates were regularly beaten. 1 June 1813: 'Mitford and Rudge flogged,' he noted for posterity. 18 June: 'Heard from Mama. Had my neck washed.' Raleigh's diary, on loan from Wigan's Edward Hall archive, is the oldest in a new display of childhood and teenage diaries at the V&A Museum of Childhood, and some entries burn with a boyish sense of injustice. 23 September: 'Had a parcel & Mr M made me open it before him and stole some of the things,' he wrote indignantly. 'So while he was reading the paper I tried to take it from him so he threatned [sic] to flog me. I mean to take things of his to make up for what he has stolen from me.' Fortunately there were holidays to look forward to. Arriving home in London from his school in Middlesex in July 1813, young Raleigh found his family, 'All in a bustle packing for Ramsgate.' It was a scratchy homecoming though: 'Did not get to sleep till near 4 in the morning on account of the fleas.' It took more than 25 hours travelling by sailing barge from London to Ramsgate without any wind... but then there were donkey rides, crabbing, the shock of seeing a man drowning and the thrill of seeing a shipwreck towed in. The new exhibition will explore the minds of teenagers across two centuries . Sadly, less than a year later Raleigh is sent home sick from school. 24 May 1814: 'Took some rhubarb, castor oil and a saline draught for a head ake,' he complains, before taking a dose of red medicine two days later. He doesn't sound well; the doctor comes to bleed him with six leeches. The final pages of the diary show traces of blood. Raleigh died not long after. 'It's not clear what he died of, but it's a tragic end to a short life,' says archivist Alex Miller. Most of the diaries come from the Great Diary Project Archive, which started from a collection of more than 1,500 rescued by historian Irving Finkel from house clearances, donations, on eBay or wherever they might turn up. In his day job at the British Museum, he specialises in ancient Mesopotamian script. That explains Finkel's fascination with a 1940s wartime diary partly written in code by an anonymous teenage girl, which surfaced at a car boot sale. 'It's very rare to find a normal diary written in code,' he says. He was determined to crack it. 'Because I work with ancient scripts, I wasn't going to let myself be beaten by a schoolgirl!' It appeared to be a simple substitution code, employing characters from other alphabets, including Greek. 'She must have got them from an encyclopaedia. You can see from the fluency that it was second nature - from which I deduced that she probably used the code with her friends.' He cracked the code with the word banana. 'There are few words in English with that pattern. She used to go dancing with GIs who treated the girls to banana splits.' It seems she used the code to describe her glamorous mother's activities as a prostitute. Other teenage diaries capture that moment on the cusp of being a grown-up. Gill Caldwell illustrated her diary in 1952, when she was 14, portraying herself as a St Trinian's schoolgirl with a hockey stick and a cigarette in a holder. She devoted a whole page to King George VI's funeral, and that night went to see a film of the funeral procession. 'It was terrific, but two and a half hours was quite enough! My behind was quite sore,' she said. Timelessly, schoolgirl diaries record innocent crushes on oblivious boys. In 1937, Joan Hall from Surbiton, who started her diary when she was almost 15, obsessed over every fleeting glimpse of a boy who wore glasses. 8 November: . '""There are few words in English with . that pattern. She used to go dancing with GIs who treated the girls to . banana splits."" It seems she used the code to describe her glamorous . mother's activities as a prostitute' 'Saw Glasses. I do like him, yet I don't know if he likes me.' And the following day, segueing seamlessly from puppy love to domestic science: 'Passing my darling G - I came late with a saddlebag bulging, a music case on my handlebars and a satchel on my back... In cookery we did the Irish stew, which came out like water, plus water, mixed with water... Miss B actually thought that Joyce and I were going to eat it too.' One of the Great Diary Project researchers is Laura Barnicoat, and her own grandmother Veronica Hadwen's diary makes up part of the archive. At 12, Veronica was expelled from boarding school for reading Gone With The Wind. By 1947, as a man-mad 17-year-old living in Cornwall, her diary included sketches of her new wedge sandals and 'sensational' new platform shoes. A diary entry for April that year describes a flirtation with a Desert Rat returned from the war. 'The Desert Rat was affectionate to put it mildly - he says he's 36 and also has decided to remain a lone wolf for good, that is unless I decide to marry him - is this a proposal? Perhaps - anyway he thinks I'm beautiful which is something.' She seems to have had a racy time on a holiday in Dublin the following month. 'Brian, I think, is slightly in love with me, or of course it may just be Irish blarney... As a rule, I don't like being kissed but Fintan's kisses were very pleasant... I left him feeling utterly knocked over. He is of course quite the most unsuitable person I could find...' He certainly was, as he had TB and she had only met him that morning. Even the most mundane diaries are a resource for historians of the future, says Irving Finkel. 'When I was a child, a new diary was a standard Christmas present. They belong to a handwritten world that is vanishing. Blogging is no substitute. Most of us think our own lives are uninteresting to anyone else, but imagine if we had hundreds of diaries from Shakespeare's time today!'

"By . Mark Duell . and Andrew Levy . A wealthy banker is being prosecuted in a test case against Michael Gove’s ban on taking children out of school in term. James Haymore took his three children to the US to attend a memorial service for their great-grandfather. He refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and will appear in court where he faces a £2,500 fine and a jail term. Family: James and Dana Haymore, of Chelmsford, with their children Toby, 11, Brayden, eight, and Ellie, five . But the account manager at JP Morgan, . who moved to Britain from America four years ago, says the decision . breaches the Human Rights Act because it affects his children’s right to . a family life. He is being . advised by Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who is backing Parents Want A Say, a . campaign group that has collected a 200,000-signature petition against . rules imposed by the Education Secretary to allow absences only in . ‘exceptional circumstances’. Mr . Haymore said he was ‘baffled’ by the decision of the head teacher at . Chancellor Park primary school in Chelmsford, Essex, to block the . six-day trip to California for Toby, 11 – but not his siblings Brayden, . eight, and Ellie, five. Changes: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured at a schools awards day last Wednesday) tightened the rules from last September to prevent unnecessary disruption to children's education . Education: Mr Haymore was summonsed after refusing to pay a £120 fine issued by the council after the children missed lessons at Chancellor Park Primary School (pictured) in Chelmsford . The school said Toby, who had been ill and had days off to attend grammar school open days, had a poor attendance record. But . Mr Haymore pointed out that Toby achieved the school’s highest 11-plus . test results and had been offered a place at one of the best grammars in . the region, adding: ‘Our eldest son is academically the star pupil of . his class. ‘One member . of staff was amazed that we were being fined. She said if any of the . students could miss a week without it affecting his education, it was . him. ‘We are good people. I’ve never even been to court before. I just hope challenging the system . will help to change it.’ The rules about children missing school in . term were tightened in September in an attempt to drive up standards. But . parents have complained they are too draconian, stopping children . attending relatives’ weddings and funerals or taking holidays when . prices are cheaper. Clare . McLeary, 30, of Shrewsbury, Salop, said this month she would risk . prison so her nine-year-old son Riley Bryant could attend her wedding . after his school refused to let him go. A . school in Cornwall recently backed down and let a woman take her . grandchild, who was facing surgery, on holiday after the intervention of . Parents Want A Say, which said Britain was ‘awash with furious . families’. Mr Haymore, who . lives in Chelmsford, asked the school for an extension to their . Christmas break so they could attend the memorial service of his wife . Dana’s grandfather, who died last year. He said the family had also recently suffered a crisis and wanted some extra time together. Headmistress . Claire Mills refused to allow Toby to go. But Mr Haymore told The . Sunday Times: ‘We didn’t feel like this was a family holiday. This was . an expat family going home for Christmas for the first time in four . years to attend the last ever memorial service following the death of . Dana’s grandfather. It would provide some relief to our family from the . emotional strain we had been feeling.’ The family discovered they had been fined on their return. An appeal was turned down and they were issued with a summons. They . will challenge the ruling at Colchester Magistrates’ Court next month. Mr Hemming said: ‘There’s a question as to whether Michael Gove’s . judgment about when children should always take holidays is better than a . family’s judgment.’ The . Department for Education said: ‘Children who attend school regularly . are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs . than those who are regularly absent.’","James Haymore claims his human right to a family life has been violated .

Understandably, the then coach of Kuwait thought it prudent to leave town. But what we are seeing here in Brazil, without such interruptions, is a demonstration of international management at its finest. A style of leadership that is all the more admirable because of the almost intolerable pressure Scolari and his players are under. By his own admission, Scolari played a part in creating that pressure by declaring some time ago to the Brazilian people – and he has a habit of addressing ‘the Brazilian people’ – that his team were going to win this tournament. But what else could he realistically say? He knew very well it was the minimum expectation from the moment Brazil were awarded this World Cup by FIFA back in 2007.

It . was not something one could ever imagine Steven Gerrard saying when sat . alongside Roy Hodgson. Louis . van Gaal might disagree but there is no greater orator than Scolari at . this World Cup. He talks about being ‘three steps from heaven’. He . candidly admits to feelings of ‘anxiety’ and ‘loneliness’. And he . doesn’t discuss Brazil’ s chances simply in terms of ambition and . potential.

But . it serves as a form of counselling for his players as well. He knows . this Brazil team does not boast the quality he had at his disposal in . Japan 12 years ago. But if he keeps telling his players they can do it, hell they might just succeed. He is drawing on all his experience. From the 22 jobs in football management, dating back to 1982, before he took charge of Brazil for a second time. Blues brother: Luiz Felipe Scolari was brought in to become Chelsea manager in 2008 . What went wrong? The Brazil boss was sacked after only seven months at Stamford Bridge . The Chelsea episode might have damaged him in our eyes, because he didn’t look comfortable towards the end of his seven-month tenure at Stamford Bridge. He looked shattered by the whole sorry experience, even if he can take comfort in the quality of other managers the trigger-happy Roman Abramovich has dismissed. But for the most part he has been successful and never does he seem more in his element than on the international stage. He likes the sense of grand occasion, the huge press conferences. He enjoys making those presidential addresses to a nation. It was something that worked with the Portuguese, when he was guiding them to a European Championship final and a World Cup semi-final after that, and it goes down a storm here. They admire him for being blessed with unbreakable self-belief. ‘I believe firmly in astrology and since I was a kid the stars told me I was a winner,’ he once said. Happy homecoming! Luis Felipe Scolari and Cafu return after winning the 2002 World Cup . Dual nationality: Luis Felipe Scolari took Portugal to the World Cup semi-finals in 2006 . And such self-confidence makes him fearless in confrontation too. For instance he thinks nothing of tearing into someone even as precious to the Brazilians as Pele. ‘I think Pele knows nothing about soccer,’ he once remarked. ‘He’s done nothing as a coach and his analysis turns out to be always wrong. If you plan on winning a title, you do the opposite of what Pele says.’ In Scolari they appear to admire this as much as they admire the image of Big Phil the aggressor. He was managing Portugal when he thumped Serbian defender Ivica Dragutinovic but they adore him for the fact that as well as never pulling any punches, he throws the odd one too. Indeed, when he said it was time to go back to his ‘aggressive old ways’ on Saturday night, explaining he was too polite when the Chilean bench turned the technical area into a ‘war’, an audience of predominantly Brazilian journalists lapped it up. Let's go to war! Luiz Felipe Scolari has vowed to return to his 'aggressive old ways' There is more to Scolari than grand statements, of course. He stunned his critics during the build-up to the 2002 World Cup by employing a three-man defence. But it meant he could unleash a three-man forward line of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Rivaldo and it worked rather well. This time there are echoes of a midfield change, the introduction of Fernandinho against Chile much like Kleberson’s selection for the quarter-final against England in Shizuoka. Brazil have their stars and they have their leaders. Before the penalties were taken on Saturday Neymar proved himself to be both, the 22-year-old more vocal than anyone in that Brazilian huddle. Sum of parts: Luiz Felipe Scolari has managed to create a team, despite not having the greatest players . VIDEO Samba nation continue to dance . But in that huddle there are players inferior to those under Scolari’s command in 2002. Jo, Fred, Julio Cesar. From these players Scolari has still managed to create a team. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which surely is the very essence of international management and something a succession of England managers have failed to achieve. Beyond being a fine tactician, however, Scolari is Brazil’s father figure. A natural leader, it is how he has managed from the beginning and perhaps explains why he struggled at Chelsea. There he found ‘a group of players running things’ and it was not to his liking. Here he runs the show, as he has done from the moment he walked into that first press conference on the eve of the tournament. ‘I want to say to the people of Brazil, our time has arrived,’ he said. Right now, with a nation gripped by fear and players petrified of failure, with an exciting Columbia team coming next, Scolari is exactly what Brazil needs.","Luis Felipe Scolari is the motivation behind Brazil's World Cup bid .

"By . Brian Barwick . A local survey tells me people like penalty shoot-outs. Make that very local. On Saturday evening, my wife Gerry was on her way out of the house when she passed the lounge door. Briefly in her eye-line the TV, and Brazil v Chile reaching its climax with the first penalty shoot-out of this World Cup. She stopped momentarily to ‘just watch the first penalty’, and was still there nine penalties later. And she wasn’t alone as over 12 million people saw Brazilian poster-boy Neymar score Brazil’s vital fifth penalty and Chilean fall-guy Jara strike a post and send his team-mates back to the hotel for their passports. Gary Lineker summed it up. 'There is conjecture about penalty shoot-outs but for me they are GREAT to watch.' And I’m with him on that. On the spot: Brazilian players celebrate after defeating Chile on penalties to progress to the quarter-finals . Pep talk: Neymar (R) gives Julio Cesar encouragement during Brazil's World Cup penalty shoot-out . Agony! Chile's Gonzalo Jara hits the post with his penalty to hand the advantage to Brazil . Saturday’s penalty shoot-out was described in excellent fashion by the BBC commentary pairing of Guy Mowbray and Martin Keown. It is one of the trickiest pieces of football commentary to get right. It is a time to be economical with your words, know exactly the consequence of every penalty scored or missed, know where you are in the penalty kick sequence, have readily at hand any particular telling piece of information about the incoming penalty-taker, implicitly understand each other’s role and most importantly let the pictures do the talking.  And concentrate. Like mad. Things have got a little easier down the years. The graphics supporting the shoot-outs are clearer for one and the match directors themselves have had more experience of covering them. That doyen of football commentators, the late great Brian Moore reflected once with typical honesty on the ‘hospital pass’ he had sent his co-commentator Kevin Keegan during the famous penalty shoot-out between England and Argentina in World Cup ’98. Spoke too soon! Kevin Keegan wrongly predicted that David Batty would score at the 1998 World Cup . David Batty was next up and had to score to keep England’s hopes alive. Moore knew Keegan had managed him and wanted to know how Batty would handle it. A legitimate question but Batty shaped up to take the penalty more quickly than anticipated. As Batty stepped up to hit the ball, Moore said hurriedly ‘Kevin, you know him - yes or no, will he score.’ ‘Yes’ was still coming out of Keegan’s mouth as Batty missed the vital kick. And England were out. Guy Mowbray, now firmly established as BBC’s senior football commentator, had the right pace of delivery, Keown , the right snap analysis before and after every kick, and the pictures and remarkable atmosphere within the stadium did the rest. Been there, done that! BBC pundit Rio Ferdinand was able to reflect on his experiences from 2006 World Cup . With informed out-of-vision opinions from Lineker and Alan Shearer, both World Cup penalty shoot-out veterans, Rio Ferdinand’s reflections on his own experiences and Alan Hansen freely admitting he wouldn’t have the courage to take one, it was a very solid piece of television sport. On ITV, the pronunciation of Colombian sensation, James Rodriguez, seemed to  create a little fun, Ian Wright, with a flourish, gave it the ‘Ham-Mez’, Clive Tyldesley, the straight-down-the middle James. I expect they’ll both agree on the pronunciation of FRED before ITV screen the Brazil v Colombia on Friday!

"By . Corey Charlton . Simon Foster spent his profits on a lavish lifestyle that included a large house, three Porsches and overseas holidays . Three bosses of a collapsed hot tub firm who 'lived the millionaire's lifestyle' by defrauding customers out of £1.2million have been jailed for a total of eight years. Simon Foster, 49, Stuart Cox, 40,  and Jonathan Husselbee used their company as a 'cash cow' to rake in the money they spent on fast cars and holidays. When their firm Spaserve went bust in 2010, hundreds of customers were left out of pocket to the tune of £2.7million. But when investigators looked into the finances, they realised the trio had taken £1.2million out of company funds for themselves. On Friday the three were jailed at Stafford Crown Court after a jury found them guilty of fraudulent trading after a three month trial. Foster, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, was ordered to serve three-and-a-half years, Cox, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was jailed for two-and-a-half years and Husselbee, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, was jailed for two years. The court heard how the Staffordshire firm took between £6million and £8million worth of orders for around 2,000 hot tubs between April 2007 and October 2010. But only 1,600 of those were ever delivered. Principal shareholder Foster, together with business partner Cox and office manager Husselbee tricked their customers into believing the hot tubs were being made in America and needed to be shipped across. They then altered delivery dates in order to stop people from cancelling their orders, and in some case just never ordered the hot tubs to be made. Those they did deliver were substandard or manufactured in completely different countries to those they claimed. Jailing the trio, Judge Amjad Nawaz said: 'Whilst others were losing out there was an element of self-enrichment because at the time they were still getting their money. 'Mr Foster was living a lavish lifestyle, a large house, three Porsches - one for work, one for his wife and one for social use - and his children had private education and foreign holidays.' Office manager Jonathan Husselbee, left, and business partner Stuart Cox, right, were jailed for the scam . A Spaserve hot tub - the court heard about 400 of the company's hot tubs were sold but never delivered . Earlier Adrian Keeling QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'It was a fraud from the word go. 'This was a deliberate fraud and was sophisticated. It caused a £2.7million loss, which is significant. 'Foster in particular spent the money on a lavish lifestyle which was born out of greed. 'By his own admission he said that 'it's better to have lived a millionaire lifestyle and lost it than to never have lived a millionaire lifestyle at all'. Speaking after the case, Kay Waterman, a horse rider from Southampton who was swindled out of £4,500, said: 'I'm thrilled. This was a simple ponzi scheme led by this man Simon Foster as a puppet master over Cox and Husselbee. 'Well tonight he is in prison while we get to go home with our families.'","Three men jailed for using company as a 'cash cow' to fund lavish lifestyle .

Martha Stewart broke her beloved iPad. Can someone from Apple rush over and fix it? She's waiting. Stewart, the doyen of home products who parlayed her image as America's household guru into a multibillion dollar empire, took to Twitter to vent about her shattered tablet, which she says Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs gave her. She is upset that the company has not sent anyone yet to pick it up for fixing, as per the tweet. ‘I am still waiting for an apple rep to come pick up my IPad.

What to do? does one call Apple to . come and pick it up or do I take it?,’ she tweeted on Wednesday. Her . litany of tweets elicited predictable jokes on Twitter, many of which . made fun of her expectation that someone would come retrieve the tablet. Consumers have to take their iPads to . an Apple store to have it fixed or exchanged, depending on the . warranty. Many third party vendors also repair broken screens.

At one point, she appeared to calm down and dismiss her outburst as a joke. ‘So . is it time to put out the fires and admit I was just pissed off at the . fact my precious ipad shattered and I wanted to make light of it??’ she . said. But Stewart's tweets then appeared to draw the ire of Apple public relations unit.

"By . Jim Mcgill . Ten years after former world rally champ Colin McRae powered his Ferrari to a podium finish at the Le Mans 24-Hours, Scotland’s most famous Olympian, Sir Chris Hoy, has taken his first strides towards racing in the world’s most gruelling endurance race in 2016. The 38-year-old, with six Olympic gold medals and 10 World cycling titles already tucked away, has swapped his lycra for a fire-retardent racesuit. And having pledged to compete at Le Mans in two years, he’s already scorching the Tarmac by racing in this season’s British GT Championship in his Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3. Driver: Sir Chris Hoy is competing in the British GT Championship for Nissan this year . Gearing up: Hoy is preparing to take part in the Le Mans 24-Hours race in two years' time . For Hoy, McRae was something of an inspiration. As a then 19-year-old and having already graduated from BMX racing to sprinting round a velodrome, Hoy - who two years ago made an excellent documentary on the iconic rally figure for BBC - watched the Lanark ace become world champ in 1995. 'Certainly watching Colin in action behind the wheel of a rally car helped create the motorsport bug in me,' Hoy explained during his first, flying visit to the 8.27-mile Le Mans circuit six days ago.'His style was all about action. Colin was so spectacular to watch, flying through the air, landing on one wheel, catching it… how could you not be excited and inspired by that?' And it was while filming a section of the documentary at Oulton Park that the wheels began to turn seriously in relation to his fledgling motorsport career. 'It’s really all down to Roger Green and Radical sportscars,' Hoy continued. 'During filming at Oulton, we had a few other cars around to make it look like it was a public track day, and Roger was there with Radical. 'He’d been following me on-track - I’d been in my Lotus 211 - and he came in and said, ""you’re doing all right round there, ever thought about racing"". And I was like, ""yeh, I’d love to, but I’ve no idea where to start"". Passion: Hoy is a motor-racing fan and he was a big supporter of Nigel Mansell when he was young . GT: Hoy is competing for the Nissan team in this year's British GT Championship . 'As it happened, Roger had a novice Radical series he was starting the following year, a one-make series, and he thought it would be perfect for me.' With a season’s experience under his belt, fate was about to deal Hoy another positive hand. When Nissan - which is supporting the British Olympic Association and sponsoring Team GB in Rio in 2016 - was looking for an ambassador, they turned to Hoy. 'Aside from the motorsport aspect, I was dead keen to get involved with that anyway,' he explained, 'but then, once on-board, I thought that maybe I could potentially wangle some sort of motorsport opportunity at the same time. And it all just worked out. 'I’m very aware I’m in a position of privilege, because there are so many people who would do anything to be in the position I’m in. 'So I’ve never taken it lightly and just turned up, mucked around and had a laugh. I am having fun, don’t get me wrong, but I’m trying to become a better driver and take it seriously. 'And, of course, it’s not just about me. It’s about every single person in the team who has worked tirelessly to make sure the car’s ready. To make sure that everything’s right about the car’s set-up. Rider: Hoy is a former track cyclist who has decided to switch his attentions to motor racing . Decorated: Hoy won six Olympic gold medals, including two at the London 2012 Games . 'When I turned up at for the first round at Oulton Park and saw the scale of the British GT operation - the massive trucks; the big motorhomes; the tyre-warmers; the fleet of engineers; the amount of data - that’s when I realised, ‘hey, this is pretty serious’. 'In a way I thought, ""right, it’s not just me turning up and going into a novice race series, this is proper championship with a lot of money being spent on it"". So I was — and am — determined to do myself justice in being in the car. 'And a. I don’t want to smash the car up and cause damage; and b. I don’t want to pootle around at the back of the grid just larking around. I want to learn from the people around me and show respect to what they do and what they know. 'I’m obviously never going to become a great driver, but I’d like to become a good driver.' Partnered by NIssan Academy graduate Alex Buncombe in the opening three rounds of the British GT Championship, Hoy - who’s in action again this weekend at Snetterton - has already made an impression with his levels of pace and competitiveness. 'I know I’ve a long way to go, but we’re all working hard to achieve the goal of racing at Le Mans in two years,” he admitted. “It’s hard work, but hard work pays off and I’m determined to be on that grid.' Glory: Having dominated cycling for so long, Hoy also managed to claim 10 world titles . Pride: Hoy is a proud Brit, as well as a proud Scot, and he is supporting the Glasgow Commonwealth Games . After Snetterton, Hoy’s attentions will turn to Glasgow 2014 and the Commonwealth Games. I quizzed him on reports that he’d apparently been ‘snubbed’ by the Games’ bosses in charge of the opening and closing ceremonies. Has he been asked? 'Officially I can’t say anything,' he smiled again. 'So read into that what you will. If I was doing something, I couldn’t say anything about it. Let’s put it this way: if I was asked to do anything, it would be a massive honour.' That, I would suggest, is a sizeable hint that Hoy will have a role to play. And after the Games he can get back to focusing on ensuring his dream to race at Le Mans becomes reality.","Hoy is driving a Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3 in the British GT Championship .

"By . Sophie Borland . Chemicals found in make-up, hairspray and food packaging are causing women to hit the menopause early, researchers warn. Those exposed to high doses have been found to go through the change almost two and a half years before other women. And in some cases, these chemicals may be causing women to stop having periods 15 years too soon, say scientists. Bad for your health?: Researchers believe pthalates - chemicals found in cosmetics - may bring on early menopause . There is already is widespread concern over the potential health risks of pthalates, a group of chemicals found in plastics, cosmetics, household products and food packaging. Recent studies have shown they may increase the risk of cancer, diabetes and obesity and there is even evidence they may feminise the brains of young boys. Now American researchers say the chemicals are disrupting women’s reproductive systems,  including their ovaries, and leading to early menopause. Dr Natalia Grindler, from Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, and colleagues looked at the levels of pthalates in the blood or urine of 5,700 women. Long-term impact: Pthalates have previously been linked to increased risks of cancer, diabetes and obesity . Those with the highest amounts were found to have gone through the menopause an average of 2.3 years before the others. The typical age of the menopause is 51, so women exposed to the highest levels were hitting it aged 49. But Dr Grindler told the American Society of Reproductive Medicine’s conference in San Diego, California, that some women may be going through the menopause 15 years early, in their mid-thirties. An early menopause is linked to far higher rates of strokes, heart disease, bone problems and fatal brain haemorrhages. Dr Grindler said: ‘We don’t know yet if some of them are going through it one year earlier or some are going through it 15 years earlier. ‘Early menopause has a lot of impact on your health. We absolutely think these chemicals have the potential to affect ovarian function and human reproduction. ‘There’s a lot that we don’t know at this point, our research is still preliminary, but it’s enough to suggest it is having a detrimental impact in the long term.’ She could not explain why some women were exposed to higher levels of these chemicals. It may be that they wore more make-up, drank bottled water or ate more packaged foods. But British experts urged women not to worry themselves unnecessarily. Professor Richard Sharpe, who specialises in reproductive health at the University of Edinburgh said: ‘My concern is not high at this stage. Phthalate exposure is ubiquitous and thus impossible to avoid altogether. ‘Eating fresh, unpackaged food can reduce phthalate exposure but will not eliminate it.’","A group of chemicals known as pthalates are already thought to raise the risk of cancer, diabetes and obesity .

Luiz Felipe Scolari appeared to criticise the performance of Howard Webb last night, after the English referee controversially disallowed a Brazilian goal by Hulk for handball and refused to give the host nation a penalty in the first half. The pre-match confrontation between Chile and Brazil had been dominated by the choice of Webb, with the Chileans fearing he would feel pressurised to favour the home nation and the Brazilans worried that the feeling they were being protected by FIFA would lead referees to be reluctant to give them decisions. Unhappy: Brazil coach Scolari argues with Webb and the fourth official Felix Brych after the decision .

And Scolari said: 'If you don't want us to be champions, OK. But it must be the same for everyone. 'If it's a penalty, it's a penalty. It's a foul, it's a foul. If it's a goal, it's a goal.

The show creators issued an apology on Wednesday via Twitter, acknowledging their misjudgement and urging viewers to see the mistake as an unintentional one. Scroll down for video . Taking offense: Colbie Smulders was one of the three main characters who was dressed to look Asian in Monday night's episode, prompting backlash . Insensitive: A number of Twitter users thought that they should have hired Asian actors . 'With Monday's episode, we set out to make a silly and unabashedly immature homage to Kung Fu movies, a genre we’ve always loved. But along the way we offended people. We're deeply sorry, and we’re grateful to everyone who spoke up to make us aware of it,' Carter Bays wrote. 'We try to make a show that's universal, that anyone can watch and enjoy. We fell short of that this week, and feel terrible about it. 'To everyone we offended, I hope we can regain your friendship, and end this series on a note of goodwill,' he wrote, referencing the fact that this is the CBS sitcom's final season. Co-creator Craig Thomas said that he agreed with everything Bays wrote and apologized once more. White face: Alyson Hannigan's skin looked even more pale than normal, suggesting that they used geisha-style lightening products to make her fall into the stereotype . Not just the girls: Josh Radnor was given a fu manchu mustache . The backlash from viewers was instant and many started using the hashtag #HowIMetYourRacism. '#Yellowface doesn't get you better ratings, it just makes people want to boycott your network,' one Twitter user wrote. 'Really, #HIMYM?? You couldn't even bring yourself to hire Asian actors for this?' wrote another. In the show, Jason Segel's character seeks advice from three 'slap masters' who are his three friends- played by Colbie Smulders, Josh Radnor and Alyson Hannigan. Imitation: The co-creators said that they meant it as an 'unabashedly immature homage to Kung Fu movies' Smulders appears from behind a fan with a noticeably more yellow skin tone than normal. Her outfit continues with the theme, as she is seen wearing a geisha-style red silk dress with chopsticks in her bun. Radnor is sporting a fake Fu Manchu style moustache and Hannigan's skin is clearly covered with some white makeup to make it look more pale. All three are eating ramen throughout their respective dream sequences. For her part, Hannigan re-tweeted the apology made by Bays while Neil Patrick Harris- who is by far the most prolific Twitter user of the cast- has not made any mention of the episode since it aired.","Three of the main characters- all white- were outfitted in stereotypical Asian dress in Monday night's episode .

The 68-year-old was made the Bishop of the Australian Defence Force  in 2003, during a consecration Mass at Canberra's St Christopher's Cathedral on August 22. Bishop Davis was not an ordained priest when the incident is alleged to have occurred, and he 'emphatically denies' the charge. 'An allegation has been made to the police that in 1969 Bishop Max Davis abused a student at St. Benedict's College in New Norcia,' the Catholic Military Ordinariate of Australia said in a statement on Sunday night. He is reportedly the first Australian bishop and the most senior Australian Church official to be charged with a child sex offence . 'At that time - 45 years ago - the bishop was not ordained. The bishop emphatically denies the allegation and the charge will be defended.' The Townsville-born Bishop was ordained as a priest in 1971 at the age of 26, in Perth.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Good Samaritans: Debbie and Chico Jimenez, he founders of a ministry in Daytona Beach, Florida, have been fined and threatened with jail for serving up meals to the homeless in a public park . A Florida couple who have been feeding the homeless in a Daytona Beach park for the past year were slapped with fines and barred from offering any more meals to the needy. Until last week, Debbie and Chico Jimenez, the founders of Spreading the Word Without Saying a Word Ministry, have hosted communal meals every Wednesday at Manatee Island Park. But on May 7, Daytona Beach Police descended on the site of the gatherings, giving a $300 fine each to Debbie and Chico for breaking a local law that prohibits private individuals from feeding a crowd without a permit. Law enforcement officials also warned the couple that they could face jail time if they continue serving home-cooked meals to more than 100 homeless people at the park. The husband and wife were given 10 days to either pay the fines or go to court, but Mrs Jimenez, 52, a retired auto parts store manager, says she and her husband are preparing for a legal battle. ‘The police don’t like it. But how can we turn our backs on the hungry? We can’t,’ she told NBC News. Scroll down for video . Last supper: The Jimenezes posted on YouTube a video showing their final feeding session at Manatee Island Park last Wednesday . Good works: The retired couple have been feeding more than 100 people every week at the park for the past year . Besides the Jimenezes, police officers fined four volunteers who were on hand last Wednesday to help the couple serve up hotdogs and macaroni salad to dozens of people, including children. Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said Mr and Mrs Jimenez had been warned a week earlier to stop throwing their so-called 'birthday parties' for the homeless at the park after nearby residents complained about vagrants relieving themselves on the ground and stumbling around drunk. ‘We have an ordinance that says when people want to perform acts of kindness or charity that they must coordinate with our local social service agencies,’ the police chief told the station. However, the Jimenezes contend that no one ever told them to stay away from the park. ‘We've been down there a year, and the police have been around and not one of them has ever said one word,’ Chico Jimenez said. ‘This time, the police said we are creating more homeless people by feeding them in the park, that we are enabling them by giving them one meal in a week. Does that make sense to you? It’s so crazy.’ They'd been warned: Daytona Beach police say the husband and wife had been told a week before the crackdown to stop serving up food to a crowd of people, which against the law . Clampdown: An officer who showed up at last week's feeding, labeled by the Jimenez couple as a 'birthday party,' told their volunteers that they need a permit . Mr Jimenez, 60, a retired construction manager, has been documenting their charitable work – and their struggle against local police - in videos and online posts. Last week, he shared on YouTube a clip of their final feeding session last Wednesday, which depicts police officers arriving at the park and confronting him and his volunteers. ‘You’ve got to have permits,’ an officer could be heard saying. The tale of the devoutly Christian couple barred from feeding the hungry has gone viral, drawing intense interest from national media outlets. On his Facebook page, Mr Jimenez wrote Tuesday that he and Debbie have interviews lined up with The Today Show, Fox News' Greta Van Susteren and Aljazeera America. The husband and wife team do not plan to shut down their ministry any time soon. Questionable behavior: Police have been receiving complaints from local resident about homeless people relieving themselves in the park and walking around drunk . In a status update this morning, the 60-year-old Mr Jimenez asked their supporters to let them know if there is a building available for them to resume their feeding sessions. ‘Instead of feeding every Wednesday, God is opening the door to feed every day,’ the man wrote. Besides offering home-cooked meals, the couple have been accepting donations toward clothing,  hotel rooms and bicycles for their vagabond friends. Daytona Beach is one of a dozen cities across the country that have been clamping down on haphazard feedings of homeless people in public parks – a controversial practice which many believe causes more harm than good in the long run. Defiant: Debbie, 52, and Chico, 60, are prepared to go to court and they intent to continue serving home-cooked meals to those in needy in a different venue . Officials in Daytona Beach say that what the Jimenez couple do not take into account is that their ‘birthday parties’ may attract sex offenders, criminals and other undesirable elements to a public park intended for the use of families, kids and dog owners. But the husband and wife told The Daytona Beach News-Journal they believe that the city does not want them to feed the needy because it means fewer of them would seek help from government agencies, which rely on the homeless for funding.","Retirees Debbie and Chico Jimenez have been hosting weekly feeding sessions for homeless in Manatee Island Park in Daytona Beach for a year .

"By . Darren Boyle . Prince Charles has said you need to 'stick to your guns' even if people do not think you are 'sensible' as after 40 years you may be proved right all along. In his first major interview for five years, Charles spoke at length about many of the issues which have caused him controversy in the past such as architecture, the environment and the economy. During the interview, Charles said he had been heavily criticised over some of his views on how to develop a sustainable community. Prince Charles said that after 35 or 40 years some of his ideas are finally 'starting to appeal to people' He told the Financial Times: 'I was accused of going back to, I don't know what, the Middle Ages. Extraordinary when you think about it. All the volume house builders said it couldn't be done. They wouldn't be able to sell their houses next to people on the lowest incomes. But it has worked and I think that approach has helped to add social as well as environmental and funnily enough, commercial value.' The Prince used the example of the Poundbury development on Duchy of Cornwall land outside Rochester. A one bedroom apartment in a central location in the town costs just £135,000 while four-bedroom houses are on sale for £610,000. He said he wanted to demonstrate how a good, well planned development can help improve people's lives. 'The problem in my case is what I was trying to suggest 35 years ago or something 40 years ago, wasn't considered, I suppose, as anyway sensible whatsoever. I don't know. Anyway, it wasn't very easy, but if you stick to your guns, sometimes 35 years later, whatever it is, you suddenly find that some of these things are starting to appeal to people.' The Prince used the example of Poundbury, which was developed on Duchy of Cornwall land near Rochester, pictured, on how good planning can add social, environmental and even financial value . He added: 'All that's been going on for the last 100 years is that people, have just chucked nature out the door, which is coming back to bite us and kick us in the teeth, big time. What I have been trying to remind people for the past 40 years is that you can't operate an entire conventional system, whether it's economics, business or the way we live and surround ourselves, what we eat, without recognising that there are severe negative externalities that are not being accounted for.' The Prince, it has emerged this weekend, tried to influence Tony Blair's government to increase the number of grammar schools. According to  BBC Radio 4 documentary, The Royal Activist, Mr Blunkett said: 'I would explain that our policy was not to expand grammar schools, and he didn't like that. 'He was very keen that we should go back to a different era where youngsters had what he would have seen as the opportunity to escape from their background, whereas I wanted to change their background.' Prince Charles, pictured here in the passenger seat of an Aston Martin, warned that for the past 100 years 'we have just kicked nature out the door' and it would 'kick us in the teeth' Mr Blunkett added: 'I can see constitutionally that there's an argument that the heir to the throne should not get involved in controversy; the honest truth is I didn't mind. 'If you are waiting to be the king of the United Kingdom, and you've waited a very long time, you genuinely have to engage with something or you'd go spare.' Former environment minister Michael Meacher said he and the Prince 'would consort together quietly' to affect policy on climate change and genetically modified crops. 'I knew that he largely agreed with me and he knew that I largely agreed with him,' said Mr Meacher. 'We were together in trying to persuade Tony Blair to change course.' Another former Labour cabinet minister, Peter Hain, said they shared an interest in complementary medicine. 'He had been constantly frustrated at his inability to persuade any health ministers anywhere that that was a good idea, and so he, as he once described it to me, found me unique from this point of view, in being somebody that actually agreed with him on this, and might want to deliver it.' Mr Hain added: 'When I was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in 2005-7, he was delighted when I told him that since I was running the place I could more or less do what I wanted to do. 'I was able to introduce a trial for complementary medicine on the NHS, and it had spectacularly good results, that people's well-being and health was vastly improved. 'And when he learnt about this he was really enthusiastic and tried to persuade the Welsh government to do the same thing and the government in Whitehall to do the same thing for England, but not successfully.' The Prince's policy interventions were supported by former prime minister Sir John Major, who said: 'I think it is encouraging that the Prince of Wales is entirely free from his unique perspective to write to ministers or the prime minister in a way that is invariably intended to be helpful, and I think to cut that off, or to make sure those letters are much more bland than they otherwise might be, would be a loss.' Sir John also revealed that he occasionally changed policy as a result of discussions with the Queen - although he would not be drawn on the specific times this took place. Asked if he remembered being influenced by the Queen, Sir John said: 'I think every prime minister can think that, and can think of occasions where that happened... 'But the answer is yes of course. It would be very foolish indeed not to be influenced.'","Charles said critics accused him of wanting to go back to the 'Middle Ages'

"By . Paul Sims . Updated: . 03:01 EST, 12 October 2011 . At the 20-mile mark of a gruelling, rain-soaked marathon, other runners must have been tempted. But only one succumbed. Rob Sloan flagged down a bus and was driven the six miles to the race’s closing stages. Then he jumped off, hid behind a tree until other competitors came into view and rejoined the race, crossing the finishing line in two hours, 51 minutes and one second to secure third place. He went on to tell a TV crew that he had given the race everything he could. Genuine joy: Rob Sloan shows off his winner's medal in the Kielder 10km the day before illegitimately taking the bronze in the Kielder Marathon thanks to a little help from a bus . Perhaps his thinking was clouded from his earlier exertions, but Mr Sloan failed to spot a very large problem with his plan. Well, three actually. First, the bus he caught was for . spectators following the Kielder Marathon in Northumberland and it was . likely that several of them might just notice a sweat-soaked runner . getting on. Second, the runner who had been in . third place for the whole race smelt a rat when he crossed the finish . line and was told he had come fourth. And third, as race organiser and . Olympic star Steve Cram put it: ‘He was the only runner in the whole of . the race who ran the second half of the race quicker than the first . half.’ Running into trouble: Rob Sloan (pictured in the Blue top, number 1883) appears to be making good progress in the Kielder Marathon, but he later opted to take a bus to the finish line because he was so tired . Inevitably, the truth came out and . now Mr Sloan has been stripped of his medal, disqualified from the race . and told he will have to answer questions from a probe by his . embarrassed running club and UK Athletics. Race officials said Mr Sloan, who was keeping a low profile last night, had admitted cheating. The former Army mechanic, who runs . for Sunderland Harriers, had joined 1,700 other runners at the start for . the   Kielder Marathon at 10am on Sunday. Unable to carry on after 20 . miles, Mr Sloan, who had won the Kielder 10km run the previous day, took . a spectator bus to near the finishing line at Leaplish Waterside Park . and rejoined the race ahead of Steven Cairns, 43. Suspicious: Race organiser Steve Cram was baffled by Mr Sloan's remarkably fast finish to the marathon . Mr Cairns, a policeman from . Edinburgh, instantly suspected foul play. ‘I was in third place right . from the start so I was stunned when I crossed the finishing line and . the commentator said, “Here comes the fourth place runner”. ‘I approached a race marshal and . said, “Fourth? Who was third?” He pointed to this guy Rob Sloan who was . being interviewed by ITV local news. I listened to the interview. He was . saying how good a race he had run and how he couldn’t have given any . more. When the interview was over I asked him if he had finished third . and he said “yes”. ‘I then asked him where he had passed . me and he said he’d done so after the 15-mile mark, which was . impossible because at the point I had opened up a five minute gap. ‘He didn’t say anything. He just . turned away and walked off. I informed race organisers of my suspicions . and they said that a couple of other people had seen this guy get on a . bus, get off a bus and run down towards the finish. He was then seen . hiding behind a tree before rejoining the race.’ He added: ‘At the end of the day, as . funny as it seems, he’s stolen my spot on the podium, my TV interview . and my third place medal.’ Mr Sloan, who is married, initially . called the accusations ‘laughable’. ‘I’m upset and angry that someone . wants to cast these aspersions,’ he said. But Kevin Carr, the chairman of . Sunderland Harriers, said: ‘It’s blatant cheating as far as I’m . concerned and as a club we’re going to come down really hard on him.’","Sunderland Harriers competitor was 'too tired' to run whole way .

"By . Daniel Mills . The former residence of a Polish woman who fled the horrors of the German holocaust and rose to fame by telling her story, is on sale in Sydney' east for $4 million. Located in one of the city's most prestigious suburbs, Woollahra, the home owned by Holocaust survivor and author Sabrina Van der Linden  Wolanksi is sure to have millionaires salivating at the mouth. The multi-million dollar high-end property not only comes with its historical footnote, but an incredibly appealing indoor and outdoor setting. Ms Wolanski, who emigrated to Australia from Europe after World War II, enlisted renowned Australian architect Alexander Tzannes to design a three-bedroom modern masterpiece that is now the envy of every other house on Wallis Street. The Woollahra home was owned by holocaust survivor Sabrina Van der Linden Wolanksi before she died in 2011 . The award-winning Alexander Tzannes had class and style in mind when he designed an uplifting sense of space, light and privacy in a blue-ribbon village setting . Included the three-bedroom home is a commercial grade kitchen, large skylight and mezzanine level upstairs . The north facing home allows for plenty of natural light while outdoors there is an entertainer's garden . Wedged in one of the city's most outstanding suburbs to live, the house sits on more than 270 square metres of land. The award-winning Tzannes had class and style in mind when he designed the an uplifting sense of space, light and privacy in a blue-ribbon village setting. Luxuriously appointed and innovatively crafted, one of the home's hallmark features is its sun soaked northerly rear aspect, and the fact it opens to a gorgeous entertainer's court garden. It is built on three storeys and has a commercial-grade kitchen, large skylight an upstairs mezzanine. The upper level bedrooms, with a bathroom off the main, has limestone finishes and like its owner the house is sure to attract plenty of attention. Sabrina Van Der Linden Wolanski, who died in 2011, is best known for her book Destined to Live: One Woman's War, Life, Loves Remembered, which is an account of her experience of the Holocaust. She was just 12 years old when her home town in Poland was invaded by the Nazis and in her diary she recorded everything that happened, including the humiliations and terrors, the murder of her family and her own survival. She emigrated to Australia where she began her new life after the war, where she lost her father and brother. In 1967 Ms Wolanski gave evidence in a trial of the man who murdered both them. While there, she met the daughter of a former Nazi who was researching her own past. In May 2005, when Germany opened the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin, Wolanski was chosen to speak on behalf of the six million who died. In her speech she noted that although the Holocaust had taken everything she valued, it had also taught her that hatred and discrimination are doomed to fail. The property was once a carpet shop that was converted into a modern masterpiece that sits on 270 square metres .","Woollahra house designed by Australian architect Alexander Tzannes .

"By . Mark Prigg . A sea creature that looked like a stack of tiny ice cream cones has given researchers new insight into the dawn of animal life on Earth. Scottish researchers said they have found fossils of the oldest-known animal-made reef in Namibia. It was built by a small, filter-feeding seabed creature called Cloudina 548 million years ago. A section of reef that was built 550 years ago by tiny animals known as Cloudina. The oldest-known animal-made reef was found in Namibia . Cloudina, one of Earth's earliest-known animals, was the first one with a hard skeleton, in this case an outer shell. Its fossils have been found in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa but it had not been known that it built reefs - a collective activity that helps gain protection from predators and improves food gathering. Cloudina, perhaps related to jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, was up to six inches long (15 cm) with a diameter of about three-tenths of an inch (8 mm). The discovery indicates that important evolutionary developments were unfolding millions of years before the so-called Cambrian explosion when many of the major animal groups first appeared. It also showed that reef building by marine invertebrates, akin to today's coral reefs, began 18 million years earlier than previously known. Cloudina, one of Earth's earliest-known animals, was the first one with a hard skeleton, in this case an outer shell. Its fossils have been found in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa but it had not been known that it built reefs - a collective activity that helps gain protection from predators and improves food gathering. The reefs - now on dry land in southern Namibia - were small, about three to six feet across (1 to 2 meters), and stood alongside larger ones made by microbes. Cloudina, perhaps related to jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, was up to six inches long (15 cm) with a diameter of about three-tenths of an inch (8 mm). 'Cloudina's key innovation was the skeleton – it is the first animal known to have produced any kind of biomineralized skeleton. 'Skeletons have been especially important in the history of animal evolution, providing support, protection and mineral storage,' University of Edinburgh geoscientist Amelia Penny said. 'The skeleton is made up of a series of long, nested conical structures which fit one inside another, a bit like a stack of ice cream cones.' Cloudina, one of Earth's earliest-known animals, was the first one with a hard skeleton, in this case an outer shell. Its fossils have been found in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa but it had not been known that it built reefs - a collective activity that helps gain protection from predators and improves food gathering. Scientists think the animal itself occupied only the top cone of the stack so that - like some modern corals - a small living animal was supported by a larger, unoccupied skeleton that grew over time. It lived during the Ediacaran Period, a remote time in Earth's history that preceded the torrent of animal evolution seen in the Cambrian Period that followed. The oldest animal fossils date from the Ediacaran. 'Traditionally, the Ediacaran period has been viewed as a time when animal ecologies were quite simple,' University of Edinburgh geoscientist Rachel Wood said. 'It's becoming clear that some of the evolutionary innovations of the Cambrian had precursors in the Precambrian. 'The discovery of reef-building animals in the Ediacaran adds to that picture of early animals dealing with a wider, more complex range of ecological pressures than we expect for the Ediacaran.' Reefs gave the creatures access to nutrient-rich water currents amid growing competition for food and living space. They attached to fixed surfaces and to one another with a natural cement of calcium carbonate to make rigid structures and aligned with a current to filter out passing food particles. Life on Earth emerged in the primordial oceans. These Cloudina reefs were the earliest know animal-built structures. The earliest reefs of any kind were built by microbes more than 3 billion years ago.The study was published in the journal Science.","Built by a small seabed creature called Cloudina 548 million years ago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . No one likes to be sick or be near someone who is threatening to throw up. But for a staggering three million Britons, vomit is so terrifying it causes intense panic and even obsessive behaviour, which in extreme cases leads to starvation and agoraphobia. One person who to have suffered with emetophobia until just a few years ago is Louise Fellows, 37 from Maidenhead. Louise started to fear being sick when she was eighty ears old and believes the phobia was triggered by whooping cough. She would sometimes wear a scarf around her face to avoid coming into contact with germs . 'At 8 years old I developed an ever growing fear of sickness, and my parents think it could be linked to a serious bout of whooping cough I suffered,' said the leader of an international Telecoms company. 'Since then emetophobia has been a debilitating presence in my everyday life. I developed obsessive cleaning and sanitation habits as I as terrified of getting anything like Norovirus. Louise explained that if her son was . poorly as a baby she would avoid eating two to three days after coming into in contact with him to make sure she didn't vomit. Her weight plummeted. Louise Fellows would panic about her son getting ill because she feared it would make her vomit. She also developed compulsive habits such as finger crossing to stop herself getting sick . 'I’d wear a scarf over my face in . 'risky' situations, and I also developed mild compulsive habits such as . finger crossing, praying to stop myself getting sick. 'I also spent far too many hours researching Norovirus on internet. 'When my son started school, I would . obsessively aski around the school to see if any viruses were going . around that might put my child at risk and subsequently me at risk. Louise has since made a full recovery from her debilitating phobia thanks to a therapy called Thrive . It was only when Louise started to . look for help that she realised she suffered with emetophobia and that . her condition had a name. Louise tried many different ways to treat her fear but nothing seemed to help. 'My doctor didn’t really understand what was happening to me, so she packed me off with some contacts for therapists and some leaflets about self-help, but these didn’t address . the phobia itself and so I knew it wasn’t going to work.' Louise tried therapy such as over-the-phone Talking Therapies, an NHS programme, following on from diagnosis of depression. 'The doctor summarised that my problem . all stemmed from depression, but I knew that I wasn’t depressed. 'When I voiced my thoughts I was told, . “Well, it must stem from anxiety then, so someone will be on hand in . next week to talk to you about anxiety”. 'I was so frustrated that no . one was listening to me.' Emetophobia, a fear of vomiting or seeing others being sick, is thought to affect three million people in the UK. The . condition is not widely diagnosed, even though it is a fairly common anxiety disorder. It is thought to affect more women than men. Emetophobia varies enormously in how it effects a sufferers - most worry excessively about being sick even though they are less likely than the general population to be ill because of all the steps they take to avoid being infected. Some sufferers may be unable to leave home if there are any tummy bugs going around and they will avoid family and friends who have an illness. They may also fear the feeling of being out of control while they are being sick or fear being sick in public which can trigger avoidance behaviours. This can present problems for mothers who can experience extreme panic if their child is ill and will feel terrified if they are actually sick. For emetophobes the mere sight of someone else being ill is enough to trigger obsessive behaviours. For many sufferers, vomitting makes them feel out of control . Many sufferers will also have a strict diet which is free from anything that might cause a stomach upset and some will avoid medications which list nausea as a side-effect. Many women will also dread the thought of being pregnant because of concerns about coping with ‘morning-sickness’. Treatment usually involves various forms of therapy - sometimes exposure therapy -  as well as antidepressants. Another former sufferer is Anne Marie Bailey, 35, from Newbury, who traces her phobia back to having severe whooping cough as a little girl. 'The first time I realised it was an issue was when I was four or five. 'My older brother threw up in car on way home from a gymnastics display and I was so revolted and terrified by it, that I grabbed the door handle and threw myself out of the back of the car in the middle of a busy road.' Anne Marie Bailey sometimes found her phobia so intense that she didn't think life was worth living . Throughout her childhood she avoided other children to prevent being sick. She also avoided food to the extent where she was misdiagnosed with an eating disorder. 'At 14 I was dramatically underweight, to the point that I was given only two weeks to live. 'Doctors diagnosed me inaccurately with anorexia nervosa, but I never had body issues. 'I could see that I was far too thin, I just didn’t want to eat. Food was an inconvenience and a problem to me but it was hard to convince professionals that this wasn’t related to body image.' Eventually she was put into on a re-feeding programme, where she was force-fed. Anne-Marie went on to have exposure therapy where vomitting was induced by drinking a syrup which made her phobia worse. 'I became a recluse. I couldn’t eat, . sleep or function on any level because of vomit. 'My life sometimes . didn’t feel like it was worth living. 'I successfully avoided vomit . for three decades but it came at a very high price. 'Every minute of the . day was consumed with risk assessment, decisions based only on one . factor – risk of vomit. 'Everything I did had this purpose – the food I . ate, the clothes I wore, how I cleaned my house, where I went, who I . saw.' But both women have managed to overcome their disorder thanks to a new therapy called Thrive, which is similar to  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a type of talking treatment. Doctors was inaccurately diagnosed Anne Marie with anorexia. She said: 'I could see that I was far too thin, I just didn't want to eat. Food was an inconvenience [because of my phobia].' Devised by former hypnotherapist Rob Kelly, the treatment aims to help smokers, people who struggle with their weight, those who live in intense pain as well as sufferers of various phobias. It is a six-part training programme that can be done at home with a book or at seminars or bootcamp. It works by helping a person to better understand how they react to situations as well as change any unhealthy behaviours. Anne Marie has now made a full recovery after undergoing the Thrive therapy programme . ‘The main gist of Thrive is that it is not a type of therapy where something that is 'done to' a person,’ said Rob Kelly. 'It is about empowering people to [make changes] for themselves. 'It’s cheaper than traditional therapy, doesn't require raking up past experiences, and the person doesn't become reliant upon the consultant. The nearest thing would be Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.’ Louise said: 'My Thrive therapist told me Thrive was a cure, not something that might help and that it would definitely work if I did everything she said in the sessions and stuck with it. 'One of fundamental giveaways, she said, is not the removal of negative thoughts but the way to process these negative thoughts into positive ones. 'A few days after my third session my little boy said he felt sick, which usually would have struck fear in me and had me running out of the house and calling a friend to come and look after him, but instead I comforted him and didn’t even think about the danger of him vomiting. 'I didn’t even think about it but I only realised this after the time. I’m not sure how it happened, but without realising it, I had been completely cured.' Anne-Marie added: 'What was different . about Thrive was that I taught myself to do it. The entire point is that . nobody can change you except you. You have to see the change you want to be and fix your internal thinking to fix your external behaviour.'","It is thought that 3 million people suffer with the condition in the UK .

"By . Mark Prigg . The drone delivery dreams of Amazon boss Jess Bezos have come crashing down after regulators ruled that delivery services are too dangerous. The Federal Aviation Administration has said that Amazon and other firms cannot use drones to deliver packages. The ruling is part of an FAA document seeking public comment on its policy on drones, or what the agency calls 'model aircraft.' Scroll down for video . Future: Amazon's Prime Air project is described as 'a new delivery system that will get packages into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles' The Internet shopping giant’s chief executive Jeff Bezos said that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes. Customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber. Firms such as DHL are also working on drone delivery projects. Under a graphic that says what is barred, the FAA mentioned the 'Delivering of packages to people for a fee.' This is clarified in a footnote saying: 'If an individual offers free shipping in association with a purchase or other offer, FAA would construe the shipping to be in furtherance of a business purpose, and thus, the operation would not fall within the statutory requirement of recreation or hobby purpose.' The agency has said that it would revisit the commercial application of small drones later this year, with potential new rules in place perhaps by the end of 2015. Brendan Schulman, the New York lawyer who convinced a federal judge to declare that the FAA is illegally enforcing a commercial ban on drones, told ArsTechnica the new rules were an attack on commercial use of drones. 'It's a purported new legal basis telling people to stop operating model aircraft for business purposes,' he said. Amazon has admitted the project may take some time. 'Putting Prime Air into commercial use will take some number of years as we advance the technology and wait for the necessary FAA rules and regulations,' the firm has previously warned. Amazon is serious about using drones to deliver items to its customers, and is close to developing the technology to make it a reality, the company's CEO has claimed. On their way: Jeff Bezos said testing of '5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles' was currently underway, adding that more drones - perhaps the models that will be put into active service - were in the design phase . In his annual letter to shareholders, which was made public earlier this year, Jeff Bezos gave an update on the Seattle-based company's achievements in 2013 - including a reference to drone development. Bezos said testing of '5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles' was currently underway, adding that more drones - perhaps the models that will be put into active service - were in the design phase. Bezos made reference to a Amazon's 'Prime Air' team carrying out the drone testing during his letter to shareholders. Amazon describes Prime Air as 'a new delivery system that will get packages into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles'. Ongoing: Jeff Bezos said Amazon is continuing to develop and test technology for delivery drones . Earlier in the letter, Bezos said Amazon had made dramatic improvements to its delivery service in 2013 - including offering Sunday delivery in selected U.S. cities, introducing 'last mile' delivery networks in the U.K., and employing bike couriers in countries where deliveries could be slowed down by postal difficulties, such as China and India. He then added: 'And there is more invention to come. 'The Prime Air team is already flight testing our 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles, and we are in the design phase on generations 7 and 8.' This brief reference to Prime Air has been enough to lead to renewed speculation over when customers can expect to have their items delivered by drone. A recent court ruling removed one not-insignificant obstacle in Amazon's quest, by removing the  Federal Aviation Administration's authority to ban small unmanned aircraft being flown over U.S. airspace for commercial purposes. This effectively gave businesses the right to fly small drones for the purposes of professional photography, journalism or farmland surveying. It also, theoretically, allowed Amazon to introduce a drone-based delivery service - until the rules were clarified today. In his letter to shareholders, Bezos remained realistic about the chances of Prime Air testing turning into an fully-fledged delivery service, however. 'Failure comes part and . parcel with invention. It’s not optional', he said. Bezos went on to explain that Amazon would continuing working on drones 'until we get it right' and it becomes 'something that is really working for . customers.' '[At that point] we double-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even . bigger success', Bezos added.","Federal Aviation Administration has ruled that Amazon and other firms cannot use drones to deliver packages.

"By . Bianca London . Do you feel like your partner holds you back in the bedroom? You're not alone. New research reveals 67 per cent of Brits believe they are more ‘sexually adventurous’ than their other half, with a quarter of these stating that they are ‘frustrated’ by the sexual mismatch. The survey, which questioned 2,013 couples in a co-habiting relationship of six months or longer, asked, ‘Do you believe that you are more sexually adventurous than your partner?’ with the term explained as ‘open-minded and willing to try new things’. Feeling frustrated? A new survey has revealed that 67 per cent of Brits believe that they are more 'sexually adventurous' than their partner and they're left feeling frustrated as a result . More than two thirds (67 per cent) of respondents said they were more adventurous in the bedroom than their other half. These respondents were asked to share their exploits, in terms of the things they had tried in the past. The top five most popular antics of sexually ‘adventurous’ Britons were role play (72 per cent), sex outdoors (61 per cent), sex in public places (37 per cent), sex with a stranger (28 per cent), and threesomes (26 per cent). Less than half of the respondents (47 per cent) stated that they had embarked upon these experiences with their current partner. Instead, the most common accomplice was ‘an ex-partner’ (64 per cent), followed by ‘a friend with benefits’ (28 per cent). Feeling adventurous: The most sexually 'adventurous' antic amongst Brits was voted as role play - but most did this with an ex-partner . When asked if they ever felt ‘frustrated’ with their current partner’s sexual preferences, a quarter (23 per cent) confirmed they did. The top three issues amongst frustrated Britons in relationships were voted as ‘my partner is not adventurous enough’ (73 per cent), ‘my partner doesn’t want to have sex as often as I do’ (63 per cent) and ‘my partner wants to have sex too often’ (31 per cent). One in ten respondents (11 per cent) confessed that they were no longer sexually attracted to their partner. Not satisfied? When asked if they ever felt 'frustrated' with their current partner's sexual preferences, a quarter of Brits confirmed that they did . A spokesperson for UKMedix, which commissioned the research, said: 'Who knew that us Brits were so adventurous in the bedroom? 'It even appears that we can get a little demanding with our need for adventure! 'There are bound to be differences between partners in any relationship and sex is a really subjective thing. 'Everyone has different tastes and no two people are the same. If you are really struggling with a mismatched sex drive, then the first and most important thing to do is talk to your other half.'","67% of Brits say they are more open-minded than partner in bedroom .

But an ancient parasite egg discovered in a 6,200-year-old grave hints that humans unwittingly spread disease using the earliest farming technology. The schistosomiasis parasite egg was unearthed with a skeleton in a prehistoric town by the Euphrates River in Syria.

Today, the disease is especially common among children in developing . countries as they are more likely to play in infected water. Methods to prevent the disease include improving access to . clean water and reducing the number of snails. In areas where the disease is . common, entire groups may be treated all at once and yearly with the medication . praziquantel. Schistosomiasis currently affects almost 210 . million people worldwide. Between 12,000 and 200,000 people die from it each . year.

It can spread a disease that causes kidney failure, among other potentially fatal conditions. It is thought the egg could be the first evidence that agricultural irrigation systems in the Middle East helped spread diseases caused by deadly flatworm parasites that live in the blood vessels of the bladder and intestines. Researchers believe the disease was spread by the introduction of crop irrigation across ancient Mesopotamia, the region along the Tigris-Euphrates river system that is now part of modern day Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria and Turkey. The study, published in The Lancet, revealed that the parasite can cause anaemia, kidney failure, and even bladder cancer. The schistosomiasis parasite can cause anaemia, kidney failure, and even bladder cancer. This image shows a schistosome egg recovered from the pelvic sediment of the skeleton . Researchers believe the disease was spread by the introduction of crop irrigation across ancient Mesopotamia, the region along the Tigris-Euphrates river system that is now part of modern day Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria (marked at A) and Turkey . ‘The individual who contracted the parasite might have done so through the use of irrigation systems that were starting to be introduced in Mesopotamia around 7,500 years ago,’ Dr Piers Mitchell, at the University of Cambridge, said. The schistosomiasis parasite egg was unearthed by a skeleton (pictured) in a prehistoric town by the Euphrates River in Syria . ‘The parasite spends part of its life cycle in snails that live in warm fresh water, before leaving the snail to burrow through the skin of people wading or swimming in the water. ‘These irrigation systems distributed water to crops and may have triggered the beginning of the enormous disease burden that schistosomiasis has caused over the past 6,000 years.' The discovery was made by archaeologists from Cambridge, Cyprus and Chicago, and is older than the Schistosomiasis egg discovered in Egyptian mummies from 5,200 years ago. The egg was found in the pelvic area of the body, where the intestines and bladder would have been. Dr Mitchell added: ‘Schistosomiasis has become progressively more common over time so that it causes a huge burden across the world today, with over 200 million people infected. ‘It causes anaemia which significantly decreases physical productivity in infected people, and may also cause bladder cancer. ‘We would expect these consequences in ancient peoples to have had a significant impact upon early civilisations in the region.’","The grave and egg were discovered by the Euphrates River in Syria, where agricultural irrigation systems were used up to 7,500 years ago .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Alex Greig . A self-help author who led an Arizona sweat lodge ceremony that left three people dead and 18 injured is scheduled to be released from prison today.James Arthur Ray will be freed from the state prison in Buckeye, near Phoenix, where he's been held under minimum security after serving 85 per cent of his two-year sentence on negligent homicide convictions.The deaths occurred after dozens of people traveled to a scenic retreat just outside Sedona, Arizona in October 2009 for Ray's five-day 'Spiritual Warrior' event. Free man: James Arthur Ray goes free from prison today after serving less than three years for the deaths of three attendees at his sweat lodge self-help retreat . The sweat lodge was touted as a hot structure in which participants could have powerful emotional breakthroughs. During the five-day retreat the participants endured fasting, mind-altering breathing exercises and sleep-deprivation before the sweat ceremony even began. One witness recalls he told them: 'You will feel as if you're going to die. I guarantee that. 'You will feel like your skin is going to fall off. When you emerge you'll be a new person, like you've looked death in the eyes and overcome it.' Helpless: The sweat lodge set up by James Arthur Ray that killed three people and injured 18 others can be seen on the bottom left of this shot of the Angel Valley Retreat Center, near Sedona, Arizona . Things started going wrong about halfway through the two-hour ceremony. Many participants have said Ray . ignored pleas for help once they were inside and chided them for wanting . to leave, even as people were vomiting, getting burned by hot rocks in . the center and lying unconscious on the ground. When it was over, 38-year-old Kirby Brown of Westtown, New York, and 40-year-old James Shore of Milwaukee were dead and 18 others injured. Liz Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, slipped into a coma and died after more than a week in the hospital. At the trial, prosecutors said Ray ratcheted up the heat to dangerous levels, ignored pleas for help and watched as overcome participants were dragged out of the sweat lodge. Ray likened the lodge to the Taj Mahal or the Vatican and himself to a priest, according to a transcript of audio recording received. Participants paid more than $9,000 each to attend Ray's 'Spiritual Warrior' event with the sweat lodge planned as the highlight. Stephen Ray (no relation to Jame Arthur Ray), ended up in a coma for four days after the sweat lodge and has since lost his sense of taste and smell and suffers migraines and memory loss. He told the court doctors thought they were witnessing the . aftermath of a mass suicide when they treated victims in a deadly sweat . lodge self-help retreat. Overcome: Kirby Brown (left), 38, and James Shore (right, with wife Alyssa), 40, both died after the two-hour sweat lodge ceremony . James Arthur Ray was convicted of negligent homicide but the jury acquitted him of more serious manslaughter charges. He was sentenced to serve concurrent two-year terms for each of the deaths. His appeal alleged that errors by the prosecution tainted the case. Slipped away: Liz Neuman, 49, fell into a coma and died in hospital a week after the two-hour ceremony . Ray acknowledged he was responsible for the deaths, but offered no excuses for his lack of action as the chaos unfolded at the sweat lodge. He and his attorneys maintained that he wasn't aware people were dying or in distress, or he would have stopped the ceremony. The defense centered on the possibility that toxins or poisons contributed to the deaths. None of the victims' families believes that 20 months was a sufficient sentence. Members of Neuman's family meet regularly to talk about her and share memories and also to vent feelings of frustration and anger – a lot of which is aimed at Ray, said her daughter, Andrea Puckett. The birth of Puckett's two children and her brother's wedding are among the events made bittersweet by Neuman's loss, she said. And the family members have said that said they'd rather not see him in the self-help industry. 'Ideally, we don't want [Ray] doing anything in the industry anymore,' Puckett said. 'I don't think he has the right to work with people. If he does move forward with that, I hope people become aware of what he did and he changes the way that he handles his seminars and his teachings.'Brown's mother, Virginia, has quit her full-time job to focus on the nonprofit group the family formed to help others avoid the tragedy they faced called SEEK Safely. The organization aims to act as a watchdog for the largely unregulated industry and educate people seeking help from self-help 'experts'. This week, she was busy reaching out to people in the self-help industry asking them to commit to basic standards to ensure they are truthful, act with integrity and respect the people who choose to follow them – something she said Ray failed to do. Brown wants her daughter's death to be used as a cautionary tale in the industry. She still wears her jewelry and the blue wrist bands they had made to commemorate Kirby Brown's adventurous life in which she wanted to expand her painting business and create a family of her own, Virginia Brown said. Seek Safely launches today, coinciding with James Arthur Ray's release. Denial: Throughout his trial James Arthur Ray and his lawyers claimed Ray was unaware of the predicament of the three people killed and 18 injured during the intensely hot and unregulated sweat lodge ceremony he held in Arizona . One of Shore's best friends, Matt Collins, is on the board of directors for SEEK Safely. He expects that Ray will find a way to continue his teachings but doesn't want to see him profit off tragedy or what he might have learned in prison.'Being in prison is probably a good place to reinvent oneself, hopefully for the better,' he said. 'I don't know whether he's capable of recognizing the damage that the families suffered.' Lost and found: Kirby Brown's mother Virginia Brown is launching Seek Safely today, coinciding with Ray's release from prison . Self-help: James Ray's brother Jon reached out to the Phoenix community to help his brother upon his release from prison on Facebook . Ray's brother Jon Ray and his wife will be at the prison Friday to greet him upon his release. He will be required to stay in Arizona for a few months under community supervision. Jon Ray said the sweat lodge ceremony would have turned out differently had his brother known anyone was in harm's way. While James Ray has no intention of moving back into public seminars, Jon Ray said 'he's definitely wanting to help people like he's always done.'","James Arthur Ray to be released from prison today after serving 85 per cent of a two-year sentence .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today led calls for a 'rethink' of the £90 price tag on the new replica England football shirt. The Prime Minister said fans would 'welcome' the Football Association and kit makers Nike reconsidering the hefty costs which have been condemned as a 'rip-off' by fans. The government has insisted the charges are 'not right' and risk punishing loyal supporters who are 'the bedrock of our national game'. Scroll down to watch the England squad modelling the new kit . Problem: Supporters fear they are being priced out of purchasing England's World Cup strips - with the new Brazil shirt costing £90 . Worth it? The home and away kits go on sale for as much as £90 before the tournament kicks off . Fans are unhappy that the new, costly kit has been launched less than a year after the last new strip went on sale. It was only last May that the previous home kit was released, which has been worn just seven times. The red away kit, released even more recently in June 2013, has had just two airings. The £90 shirt is identical to those worn by Roy Hodgson's side, while an adult 'stadium' England shirt is priced at £60 and shirts for children aged between eight and 15 cost £42, with mini-kits priced at £40. Sports minister Helen Grant took to Twitter to say: 'On £90 England football shirts for fans, it's not right. Loyal supporters are the bedrock of our national game - pricing needs a rethink.' Prime Minister David Cameron called for a rethink on the prices after a backlash from fans . Mr Cameron's officials spokesman said the PM backed Miss Grant and called for Nike to think again. He told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'I'm sure all fans would welcome a rethink.' The spokesman said it was 'clearly not' for the Government to set the price of football shirts. But he added: 'It is a matter for the manufacturers and the FA, but does he agree with Helen Grant that £90 is a great deal of money for a replica shirt? Absolutely. 'Would a rethink by the manufacturer be welcomed by all fans? I'm sure that would be the case.' Labour's shadow sports minister Clive Efford said the price of the shirts was 'disappointing'. Justine Roberts, founder of popular . parenting website Mumsnet, said: 'With the previous kit less than a year . old and the away shirt worn only twice since then, it's not hard to see . why some people might just think the FA are exploiting England fans by . churning out yet another expensively priced version. 'When we asked our users about this this issue, an overwhelming majority thought football merchandise was a rip off. 'Instead . of charging £60-plus for an 8-year-old’s kit, the FA could lead the way . and produce a fairly priced kit so all England fans could afford to buy . it and show support for the national team.' The . latest shirts - to be worn at the World Cup in Brazil this summer - are . going on sale on April 3, less than a year after the previous ones were . released. Mark Perryman, a member of England Supporters Club, said: ‘They certainly don’t help themselves the fact two new shirts were introduced well before the 18 months. ‘They seem to have broken that rule. I thought it was a legal requirement. ‘The FA are in a difficult position, they can’t have a Nike home kit and Umbro away kit. ‘I suppose the FA’s excuse for . releasing the kits so early is that it’s a World Cup year, but I’m sorry . they should’ve thought about that when they signed the contract with . Nike. It’s crazy.’ Added on top: If fans want to get added lettering with their shirt they'll need to pay more money . Not happy! Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton isn't best pleased at the price of the shirt . Tough! Stan Collymore has branded kit maker Nike a 'joke' for the way in which they've handled the release . In the mid-2000s replica England shirts were on sale for £30 almost as soon as they were released. The . prices have since risen steeply, but they are dependent on results on . the field. Following England’s 4-1 defeat to Germany in the 2010 World . Cup the price for the replica shirts worn in that tournament plummeted. Perryman, who has been a member of the ESC for 18 years, added: 'At the end of the day people will vote with their chests. If England are doing well, people will buy it. ‘If they lose to Italy in the World Cup it will drop to a fraction of that £90 price.’ Outrage from punters and those involved in the game poured out across social media websites. Joey Barton said on Twitter: ‘£90 for the new England shirt is taking the mickey out of the fans. When will it stop? ‘I wonder what ‘magic’ technology it has this time that forces the price up but doesn’t actually work. Coming thick and fast: These are the second new kits to have been released in the past year by England . ‘Also [it’s] technology that the supporters don’t need. When will brands start to listen? Fans just want to feel a part of it. Part of the tribe. ‘[It’s] appalling, in my opinion. Football again allows commercialism to eat away at its soul. Something has got to give. ‘Its literally a white sports top with an England badge on. Costs about £2 pound tops to make in some sweatshop in the East.’ Stan Collymore added: ‘Nike have gone down American route. A “Match” shirt and “stadium” shirt, like NBA do. A joke, just make one please, £90 is a rip off.’ The FA are not allowed by UK and EU law to get involved with setting the price of the replica shirts. A spokesman said: 'The FA is a not-for-profit Organisation that puts £100m back into the game every year. 'It is through relationships with partners such as Nike that we are able to maintain that level of investment in football. 'The FA's policy is to avoid any involvement with how its partners or licensees set their prices, so as to avoid any risk of or implications of price fixing.' Nike have pointed out that the £60 replica kit is the one aimed at fans, whereas the £90 shirt is the exact one worn by the players with the full technological additions. The prices are recommended to retailers who are able to set their own value. A spokesman also confirmed that the kit cycle would return in future, saying: 'The previous kit marked the start of the partnership between England and The FA and the timing of the agreement put us in an unusual circumstance with regards to kit cycle. 'A normal kit cycle will resume with the new kits – the home kit will stay the same for two years, and the away for one year.'","Premier wades into row over launch less than a year after last new kit .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Political activists living under oppressive regimes, and journalists reporting from the front line, are among those who fear being kidnapped and tortured. And while little can be done to abolish this threat entirely, a new app has been launched that turns an ordinary smartphone into a discreet panic button. The Panic Button app is designed to give people defending human rights in dire situations urgent help from their own network if they are attacked or kidnapped. The Panic Button app is designed to give people defending human rights in dire situations urgent help from their own network if they are attacked or kidnapped. To use the button, which sends a text message asking for assistance, users can press their phone's panic button five times (illustrated) The Panic Button app is available on Android handsets. It was built by Amnesty International for use by activists and students living under oppressive regimes, as well as journalists and lawyers. The discreet app looks like a calculator. A text message requesting help is sent to three chosen contacts by pressing the 'one' key in the app five times - or by pressing the phone's power button five times. The aim of the Panic Button is to increase protection for activists around the world who face the threat of arrest, attack, kidnap and torture. Launched by Amnesty International, it is designed for Android smartphones and is available to download from Google’s Playstore. The app transforms a smartphone into a secret alarm that can be activated rapidly in the event of an emergency, alerting fellow activists to the danger their colleague faces so that they can get help faster. It is cleverly concealed to look like a calculator app and the panic button can be used by pressing the ‘one’ key five times on the 'calculator's' screen to send a text message to three chosen emergency contacts asking for help. Alternatively, a user in peril can press the smartphone's power button five times in quick succession to summon help. ‘The aim of the Panic Button is to increase protection for activists around the world who face the ever present threat of arrest, attack, kidnap and torture,’ said Tanya O’Carroll, technology and human rights officer for Amnesty International. 'The aim of the Panic Button (pictured) is to increase protection for activists around the world who face the ever present threat of arrest, attack, kidnap and torture,' said Tanya O'Carroll, Technology and Human Rights Officer for Amnesty International . ‘We have long known that the first hours after somebody’s arrest are the crucial window of opportunity for a network to make a difference to their colleague’s release - whether it be flooding the police station with calls, arranging a protest, or mobilising lawyers and organisations like Amnesty International for a campaign of international pressure.’ ‘By introducing technology to the fight for human rights, this app updates the power of writing a letter for the 21st century.’ The app has been released in four languages after three months of private testing by hundreds of users from Amnesty International’s networks across 17 countries. During the testing phase, activists and journalists said that the tool can make a positive difference in mitigating the daily risk of their day-to-day work. Ibrahim Alsafi, a human rights activist in Sudan who has been involved in the testing of the app, said: ‘It is really scary to find out that an activist has been detained for months without anyone knowing anything about them or working to get them released. ‘We hope Panic Button will ensure future cases of unlawful detention in Sudan do not go undetected, allowing us to mobilise to help more people. ‘This is an essential tool for activists, human rights defenders, students and lawyers. ‘Everyone who might face danger in their work needs to have Panic Button on his or her phone.’","App is designed for political activists and students living under oppressive regimes, as well as lawyers and journalists who are risking their lives .

"By . Steph Cockroft . With the cast from The Only Way is Essex often seen enjoying takeaways, you can forgive this chip shop owner for thinking her Towie-themed restaurant would fit into place. Francesca Clark thought nothing of naming her new chippy The Only Way is Fish when she opened for business five months ago in Ongar, Essex. But now Towie bosses have called in the lawyers - because they say the name is in breach of the company's copyright. Not sharking the issue: Chris Nelson, Francesca Clark and Carly Rose from The Only Way is Fish, which is being threatened with legal action by bosses from the production company behind The Only Way is Essex . Francesca Clark deliberately used a logo similar to the one used on the show - but has a disclaimer explaining the shop is not connected to the hit TV series . Lime Pictures, the production company behind the show, has allegedly written a strongly-worded letter to the shop's owners, warning them they could land in trouble for using the phrase 'The Only Way is'. The company, which also produces shows such as Hollyoaks, allegedly told Ms Clark she had just 14 days to change the name and logo of the shop - unless she wanted to face legal action. The show, which says it has copyrighted the four words, has already been behind several new slang words and phrases since it hit screens in 2010. One of the best-known is 'reem', a word coined by former star Joey Essex to mean desirable, cool or good-looking. Full belly: James 'Arg' Argent, one of the Towie cast members, seen enjoying a chicken kebab, chips and hummus . Loving it: Lydia Bright, a former Towie cast member, tucks into chips at a local kebab shop where she was seen with friends, including Towie's Lauren Goodger . Business partner John Edwards said: 'We . are not hurting anyone and we are not misleading anyone into thinking . we have anything to do with the programme. It’s just a gimmick.' Ms Clark said she gave her shop a 'cheesy, blingy and glitzy' decor and used a logo similar to the one used for the show, intentionally. She even displayed a sign explaining to Towie fans that the shop was not affiliated with the show. But the disclaimer doesn't seem quite enough for the company's lawyers, who have allegedly told the business to stop trading under its current branding. In the letter, it said the shop should 'immediately cease and desist from using our logo or otherwise trading under our marks'. It also told the company to 'immediately' remove its Facebook page. The Only Way is Fish Facebook site, on which staff vowed to fight an alleged threat from Lime Pictures, which asked the business to change its name within 14 days . The letter said: 'Confirm to us in writing within 14 days of the date of this letter that you have complied with the above'. But Mr Edwards said the business would fight the legal bigwigs 'to the end'. The shop also posted a message on their Facebook site which read: 'Customer Notice. We have been contacted by the producers of The Only Way is Essex regarding the content of our Trading Name The Only Way Is Fish. 'I would like to remind all our customers . and the general public, that we are no way affiliated or endorsed by . Lime Pictures holding Ltd or ITV Productions.

Chef Chris Nelson said: 'I don’t think . the sign has brought us any extra business and a name change wouldn’t . make much difference but it’s not about that. It’s about the principle.'

"By . Mark Prigg . Google already knows where we go, who we email and what we search for - and now it has set its eyes on your living room. The firm is set to buy Dropcam, which makes a $150 internet connected camera, in a deal believed to be worth $555m. It is believed the search giant hopes to expand its home automation products after recently buying thermostat company Nest. Scroll down for video . The $149 Dropcam: Google is considering buying the firm behind the internet-connected webcam, it has been claimed. Dropcam is a cloud-based Wi-Fi video monitoring service with free live streaming, two-way talk and remote viewing. Using a special app, users can see live feeds, zoom and record footage. It also has a night vision mode, two-way talk back, and digital zoom. The camera has email and smartphone alerts, and the company says it uses bank-level security to encrypt all video. Nest and Dropcam confirmed the acquisition in separate blog posts on Friday. Google is increasingly expanding into new markets, with efforts ranging from high-speed Internet access to advanced research on self-driving cars and robotics. It recently bought Nest, which makes smart thermostat and smoke alarms, this year for $3.2 billion, the Internet firm's second-largest ever acquisition. The deal was touted as a foray into the fast-growing 'smart' home automation market, at a time consumer appliances and Internet services are merging. But it also raised concerns about the privacy implications for Google, which already collects rafts of data about users' online habits. Dropcam, which lets users monitor homes and offices via its camera hardware and software, will adopt Nest's privacy policy after the acquisition, the latter company said in its blog post. That means data will not be shared with any other firm, including Google, without a user's permission, it said. Dropcam's backers include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Accel Partners and Menlo Ventures. Dropcam last year raised raised $30 million in funding for its cameras. The camera has email and smartphone alerts, and the company says it uses bank-level security to encrypt all video. The $149 Dropcam HD includes full 720p streaming, night vision, two-way talk back, and digital zoom, and with the optional cloud recording customers can access stored footage of the past seven or thirty days. 'With a Dropcam Wi-Fi video monitoring camera and optional cloud recording service you can remotely drop in on your house, baby, pets, business, or anything else from a smartphone, tablet, or computer,' the firm says. San Francisco-based Dropcam was founded in 2009 by Greg Duffy and Aamir Virani, and also offers a $199 Dropcam pro with better image quality and a larger field of view. The camera is controlled from a special app which can show live footage as well as zoom in on areas and show a night vision view. The move comes as  Apple is preparing to turn the iPad into a universal 'home remote' that could control everything from TVs to washing machines and lights, it has been claimed. The project is set to be unveiled alongside an entirely new version of Apple's iPhone and iPad software at its Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco next week, according to the FT. An Apple patent published in November last year gave the first hints of the system, showing a system that automatically turned on lights when a user comes home. It is believed the firm is already working with home automation firms to ensure their gadgets work with the app. The firm already sells home automation gadgets in its stores, including including arch rival Google's Nest thermostats, Dropcam wireless cameras, Philips Hue lightbulbs and Belkin WeMo switches. The firm is also expected to unveil a major overhaul of both its iPhone and Mac software at the event. One improvement is believed to be giving the iPad a new split screen mode so users can run two apps at once, it has been claimed. The move will be a major change to the way the iPad handles multiple applications. However, the tablet will not be the first with the feature - and Microsoft even made the iPad's lack of split screen functionality the subject of a recent ad. 'iOS 8 is likely to supercharge the functionality of Apple’s iPad with a new split-screen multitasking feature, according to sources with knowledge of the enhancement in development,' claims the blog 9to5Mac. At tonight's event, Cook is set to unveil the next-generation of mobile software, dubbed iOS 8.  Although many of the changes are likely to incremental, the biggest addition is rumoured to be an application called Healthbook, which is believed to have leaked last month (pictured) and is designed to track and monitor fitness . 'These people say that the feature will allow iPad users to run and interact with two iPad applications at once.' Current users can swap between apps, but can only see one on screen at a time. The new feature is also likely to enable users to drag information - text or pictures, for example, between apps. The blog also claims the feature may also be key to a larger-screened iPad, which Apple is actively developing for a launch either later this year or in 2015. Apple is also expected to unveil a major new app for the iPhone and iPad aimed at collecting health data at the conference - as well as possibly unveiling Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine as its latest employees if the much rumoured acquisition of Beats goes head. Called Healthbook, the new app is expected to be unveiled in June at Apple's annual developer conference. It offers everything from food and sleep tracking to blood sugar level analysis - and can even tell how much water you've drunk. The app is set to work with Apple's iWatch, which is believed to be set to be announced later in the year - although it could be unveiled at the same event next year. Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours .","Search giant to buy maker of $150 home CCTV system .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Caught in a deadly firefight, a combat doctor stumbles towards a wounded soldier soaked in blood. With only a charred metal panel as his operating table, the medic knows he has 90 seconds to stop the bleeding before the soldier dies. With this in mind, a veteran combat surgeon has developed the first inflatable tourniquet that controls circulation and stems blood loss at the waist, caused by bomb blasts and other injuries - and it can be deployed in just 25 seconds. Scroll down for video . The tourniquet, created by Dr Sam Scheinberg and design firm Ziba in Oregon, is the first field dressing that can be used at the waist, which is crucial if a soldier is injured by an IED explosion . It was created by Dr Sam Scheinberg, a combat surgeon from Oregon who served in Vietnam. Based on his experiences, Dr Scheinberg teamed up with Portland design firm Ziba to develop a tourniquet specifically designed to save lives in battle. Tourniquets are medical devices used for the temporary control of circulation, and on the battlefield, are vital to preventing blood loss. But this particular tourniquet is different. It is the first field dressing that can be used at the waist to stabilise the pelvis and stop bleeding. The only field treatment previously available was a rigid armature-and-clamp contraption which was slow, clumsy and lacked the benefit of pelvic stabilisation (right). The new system (left) is far simpler to use . Simple instructions are printed on the device in the event that the medic is also suffering trauma from injury . The ‘Sam Junctional Tourniquet’ is placed at or near the injury site, strapped on and pumped up until the bleeding stops. The nylon surface of the strap hides pneumatic air balls that are inflated to stop bleeding. A shut-off valve is included to prevent medics from over-inflating the device. A buckle provides clear visual and sound cues to make sure the the medic knows when it is properly set. Simple instructions are also printed on the device in the event that the medic is also suffering trauma from injury. ‘Research continues to show that high-on-the-thigh and groin-level injuries sustained in these blasts are the leading preventable cause of death in U.S, combat situations,’ Ziba wrote on its website. ‘The only field treatment previously available was a rigid armature-and-clamp contraption which was slow, clumsy and lacked the benefit of pelvic stabilisation.’ Dr Scheinberg gave Ziba complete design freedom with his only caveat being that it should be ‘brain dead and bomb proof.’ According to Wired, Ziba designers got rid of their sketchpads and instead opted to create a prototype by crawling on the floor of their studio and dodging imaginary mortar shells.

"By . Suzannah Hills . Noah's Ark is often depicted as a pointy-prowed traditional ship. But new research suggests it was very different from popular imagining, and was actually a circular craft made out of reeds. Dr Irving Finkel reveals his ground-breaking discovery into the ancient myth in his new book called In The Ark Before Noah: Decoding The Story Of The Flood. As an expert in deciphering cuneiform script, Dr Finkel managed to piece together information on  the ark from a 3,700-year-old clay tablet. New revelation: According to an ancient Babylonian tablet, Noah's Ark was a 220-ft wide coracle - the equivalent of six London buses - with walls 20-ft high . His translation of the ancient text throws light on the Mesopotamian story, which became the account in Genesis in the Old Testament, of Noah and the ark that saved his menagerie from the flood waters which drowned every other living thing on earth. The text describes god speaking to Atram-Hasis, a Sumerian king who is the Noah figure in earlier versions of the ark story. He says: 'Wall, wall! Reed wall, reed wall! Atram-Hasis, pay heed to my advice, that you may live forever! Destroy your house, build a boat; despise possessions And save life! Draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design; Let its length and breadth be the same.' Dr Irving Finkel, Assistant Keeper of the Department of the Middle East at the British Museum, translated the cuneiform script on the tablet . The ancient Babylonian text describes the ark as a round 220-ft diameter coracle with walls 20-ft high. According to the tablet, the ark had two levels and a roof on the top. The craft was divided into sections to divide the various animals into their own sections. The 60 lines of text, which Dr Finkel describes as a 'detailed construction manual for building an ark', claims the craft was built using ropes and reeds before being smeared with bitumen to make it waterproof. There are dozens of ancient tablets that have been found which describe the flood story but Finkel, Assistant Keeper of Ancient Mesopotamian script, languages and cultures Department at the British Museum, says this one is the first to describe the vessel's shape. 'In all the images ever made people assumed the ark was, in effect, an ocean-going boat, with a pointed stem and stern for riding the waves – so that is how they portrayed it,' said Finkel. 'But the ark didn't have to go anywhere, it just had to float, and the instructions are for a type of craft which they knew very well. It's still sometimes used in Iran and Iraq today, a type of round coracle which they would have known exactly how to use to transport animals across a river or floods.' Channel 4 is now planning a documentary based on the reconstruction of the ark following the guidelines on the tablet which dates from about 1850 BC. The artefact was discovered in the Middle East by Leonard Simmons, who indulged his passion for history while serving in the RAF from 1945 to 1948. The relic was passed to his son Douglas, who took it to Dr Finkel to translate. Noah's Ark is typically portrayed at a traditional ship, such as in this Italian mid-16th century painting .","Dr Irving Finkel has translated cuneiform text on an 3,700-old clay tablet .

"By . Richard Spillett . The world's largest underground trampoline was unveiled today in caverns which are twice the size of St Paul's Cathedral. Bounce Below is part of Zip World, an outdoor pursuits centre in Blaenau Ffestiniog, North Wales. As part of their latest attraction, staff have transformed a slate cavern by installing three giant trampolines. The trampolines are reached by train, with each linked by a 60ft long slide. It is thought to be the first facility of its kind, with the trampolines open to the public from July 3. Huge suspended trampolines are to become a new tourist attraction in Llechwedd Slate Caverns, Gwynedd, Wales when they open later this summer . Visitors will be able to enjoy a light show while they bounce on the huge trampolines, linked by a 60ft slide which spirals down to the underground space . The colourfully-lit caverns are the latest attraction at the regeneration project, which has seen more than £1 million invested in it so far. Sean Taylor, owner of Zip World, said: 'We got the idea when my business partner saw this done in woods in France but this has never been done in a cavern, this really is a world first in Wales. 'It's a one hour activity where customers get dressed up in a cotton overall and given a helmet, they then jump on a train and travel inside the mountain. 'There are three giant trampolines with three metre net walls to stop people climbing out. Each is linked by a slide to go down and a walkway to go up - the biggest slide is 60ft.' Workers preparing the attraction had to work using portable lamps and carried out around 500 tons of rubble from the cavern. Business development manager Laura Jones told The Daily Post: 'The first trampoline is 20ft off the ground, the second is 60ft and the third is 180ft high. They are connected by shoots and you get in via a walk way in to the middle trampoline. 'Each trampoline is about 60ft wide. They've been tested to hold a huge weight.' The huge play-area, expected to be a massive hit with kids, is built into an underground vault which is twice the size of St Paul's Cathedral . Visitors will be given a helmet and a protective overall before they travel down to the site in a specially-built train, organisers have said . The slate seams in north Wales, formed by compacted clay more than 300 million years ago, are some of the highest quality in the world, leading the material to be dubbed 'black gold' by locals. The mining of the slate dates back to Roman times, but the industry took off at the end of the 18th century and into the 19th century, when some mines employed more than 3,000 people. The government abolished slate duty in 1831 leading to rapid expansion and the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates. Slate production in Wales peaked at over half a million tons in 1898, with 17,000 men employed in the industry. The slate was mainly used for housing, but has also been used for flooring, worktops and headstones. Conditions in the mines were said to be very poor, with low wages and poor levels of safety. Workers provided their own medical assistance by setting up their own St John Ambulance station underground. The miners went on strike in 1900 and the three-year dispute partly led to the slate mining industry moving abroad, first to Spain and then to the rest of the world. The First and Second World Wars also saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry and the introduction of other roofing materials in the post-war years killed off many of the larger mines. Some of the slate mines were used to store precious works of art during German bombing raids in the Second World War (pictured right) and the caverns are also said to be fall out shelters for the Royal Family in the event of nuclear war.","New attraction to open this summer gives visitors the chance to bounce on huge trampolines suspended underground .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From visiting famous landmarks from your sofa, to looking for strange sites, Google’s Street View has many uses. Now scientists have used photos of streets in U.S. cities to make maps showing the safety of New York, Chicago, Detroit and Boston - based on how people rated photos on a website. The Place Pulse project works out which areas of a city are seen as rich and safe, family-friendly or dangerous, according to how people react to Street View images. Scientists have used photos of streets in . U.S. cities to make maps showing the safety of New York, Chicago, . Detroit and Boston, based on how people rated photos on the website. Click on the interactive maps above to see streets that are perceived to be safe (marked in green) and less desirable addresses (in red) Scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created the survey to let people choose between two streets, to indicate which they believe to be safer. They then used the information, and collected the safety rankings for 3,000 images from New York and Boston, to generate an algorithm that automatically creates a safety rating for the images. This is based upon features such as colours and shapes. The experts use the algorithm to predict the safety score of any image on Street View, based on the outcome of its Place Pulse survey. The researchers have now released four maps to show the perceived dangerous and safe areas of New York, Detroit, Boston and Chicago. Scientists at MIT created the survey to let people choose between two streets, to indicate which they believe to be safer. From the initial results they made an algorithm create a safety score of a neighbourhood - zero being the lowest to denote a dangerous street and 10 the highest - and predict its safety . Place Pulse 2.0 is a more in-depth survey that is collecting data on 100,000 street views from 56 different cities, including Washington D.C, Sydney and London. As well as choosing roads that look the safest, survey participants can also choose views based on which look livelier, wealthier, most beautiful, boring or depressing. Based on the results so far, London, Paris and New York have been voted the liveliest cities according to the Street View photos. Atlanta is currently ranked the most beautiful of cities and Rio de Janeiro the most depressing - although the World Cup Festivities have not been taken into account. Green areas of the map represent areas, which were given a high perceived safety rating using the algorithm, while red areas show locations that are perceived as dangerous. The map of New York City contains more than 300,000 data points of perceived safety. The scientists developed their algorithm because to make such a detailed map without it would have required more than two million comparisons of images. By using StreetScore they could create the maps using less than 3,000 images – or 24,000 comparisons – in the dataset. The new tool allows experts to look at urban environments in a new way, and in the future, MIT will use it to study improvements and decay in cities. ‘We can use StreetScore to explore the . determinants of urban perception, including both the local features that . affect people's perception of a street view, such as the quality of . buildings...the local context of a neighbourhood…such as its proximity . to a highway…and the historical, economic and demographic forces that . shape a city, such as architectural movements…and social segregation,’ they . explained.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Thousands of people gathered on southern New Hampshire roadsides on Saturday to honor a marine who was killed in Afghanistan earlier this month, as his body was brought back to his hometown for burial. Lance Corporal Brandon Garabrant made headlines last year when he was barred from wearing his uniform for his high school graduation last June. The 19-year-old soldier was killed by a roadside bomb on June 20, along with two other service members. Proud to serve: Lance Corporal Brandon Garabrant, a 19-year-old Marine, was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan on June 20 . Procession: Garabrant's final ride home began at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport on Saturday . Support: Thousands of people lined the roadsides along the procession's path to honor the fallen soldier . The procession carrying the soldiers remains began at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport early in the morning and proceeded to a funeral in Peterborough, his home town. According to the Boston Globe, the caravan of supporters included family, fellow Marines, State Police, at least 100 motorcyclists, and . firefighters from Peterborough, Temple, Mason, and Brookline, said . George Clark, chief of the Temple Volunteer Fire Department, where . Garabrant volunteered. 'It was totally unbelievable, the amount of people that were on the side of the road honoring him,' Clark, a family friend, told the paper. 'When we turned onto 101 in Milford, there was one Marine standing there by himself . . . and it was just like, wow, it really hit you.' Clark said about 100 people were seen gathered near on intersection along, where a fire truck hoisted a large U.S. flag over the roadway where the procession would pass. 'Nobody deserves it, but I think it hits home even harder at that age,' he said. 'Being so young and he just graduated high school last year, and had such an unbelievable life ahead of him and the things he could have accomplished.' Garabrant signed up for the armed forces immediately after finishing high school. He was so proud of making it . into the Marines that he made headlines last year that he tried to wear . his uniform to his high school graduation. Popular: Garabrant's hometown of Peterborough, New Hampshire has rallied behind him before his untimely death . Support: Garabrant's family and friends appreciate the support their receiving from the community . His Peterborough school denied his request, telling the teenager that he would have to wear his cap and gown over the newly acquired uniform. The principal, Brian Pickering, this week praised his former student and said the school community was upset to hear that Garabrant had died. 'We are all shocked and deeply saddened by his passing and we are incredibly grateful for his service to our country,' Pickering told WMUR9. Garabrant's untimely death struck a chord with many in his New Hampshire community. Several had already backed the young man's dedication to the forces after his plea to graduate in his uniform. Hero: As well as serving in the Marines, Garabrant worked as a volunteer firefighter . Protect: U.S. troops secure an area near the Pakistan-Afghan border on Thursday after a different attack on Nato supply trucks. Garabrant had been serving as part of a Nato force in a different part of the country . At the time of the high school celebration last June, he had just completed his training at a South Carolina camp. Several shops around the school showed their support for his request to wear the uniform, and put signs up calling for the school to change its rules. His mother, Jesse Garabrant, said at the time: 'I'm overwhelmed with the support of the community. It's just wonderful.' As well as being a dedicated Marine, Garabrant also worked as a volunteer firefighter in Temple. 'Whenever he came home on leave, the . first thing he did, contacting me, ""Chief, I need a pager so I can help . you out"",' volunteer fire chief George Clark said. 'He absolutely loved what he was doing. He knew the sacrifice and he was still willing to do it,' Clark told WMRU9. Loss: Garabrant, pictured during Marine boot camp early last year, had been enjoying life in the forces . Community backing: Residents in Peterborough had supported Garabrant's request to wear his uniform. They are united again as they mourn his passing . Peterborough police chief Scott Guinard also praised the young Marine, calling him 'a young gentleman'. Garabrant had been assigned to a NATO security force in Afghanistan, and appeared to be enjoying life on deployment.

"By . Stewart Maclean . Updated: . 06:48 EST, 10 January 2012 . More than 165 wild animals including 88 hippopotamuses have died amid an outbreak of anthrax in Zimbabwe. The hippos were found dead alongside 45 buffaloes, 30 elephants and two kudos in the country's northern Mana Pools national park. Zimbabwean Parks and Wildlife Management Authority spokeswoman Caroline Washaya-Moyo told the state-owned Herald newspaper that tests had proved the hippos were killed by anthrax. Infectious: More than 165 wild animals including 88 hippopotamuses have died amid an outbreak of anthrax in Zimbabwe . She added that the cause of death for the other animals had not yet been confirmed but said early signs suggested they had also fallen victim to the infectious disease. Ms Washaya-Moyo said she feared the outbreak could spread to other wildlife in the protected reserve, which lies around the lower Zambezi River. She said: 'Our office has confirmed the anthrax outbreak following the death of the animals in Mana Pools. 'The Authority engaged the vet offices who later collected samples from hippos for lab testing. 'The lab test confirmed that 88 hippopotamus died of anthrax.' Officials are today conducting further tests on the affected animals, which are all believed to have died in the last few weeks. Government veterinary officer Chris Foggin said a team of specialists had visited the area and were burning the carcasses of the dead animals in an attempt to prevent the infection from spreading. He told the Herald: 'A number of animals have died, but we have visited the area and we sealed it off and we are burning the carcasses to prevent any further spread, an action well considered now that the lab reports confirmed anthrax as the culprit.' Mana Pools is one of Zimbabwe's most famous national parks. The World Heritage site is a wetlands conservation area formed around four natural lake pools along the Zambezi. Government veterinary officer Chris Foggin . It is home to the country's largest concentration of hippos as well as other wildlife including lions, buffalo and leopards. Visitors to the area can stay in unfenced luxury accommodation or campsites, allowing them the opportunity to spot game from close up. Anthrax is a highly infectious disease that affects mainly hoofed animals and cattle. It is picked up by mammals which come into contact with bacteria formed into spores, which sometimes lay dormant for decades before becoming active. Although the disease is not generally passed directly from one animal to another, a creature can pick up the spores if it comes into contact with the corpse of another which has been killed by the infection. The condition's highly infectious state has resulted in anthrax being used as a biological weapon against humans, who are also vulnerable to illness or death if infected. The crisis in Zimbabwe is the second reported anthrax outbreak among African game animals in recent years. In July 2010, the government of Uganda confirmed 82 hippos were among at least 90 animals which had been killed by the disease. Officials there said the affected creatures came into contact with anthrax spores after drinking water from an infected river in the country's Queen Elizabeth National Park.","88 hippos, 45 buffaloes, 30 elephants and two kudos found dead in Mana Pools national park .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A Finnish inventor has created the world's first intelligent phone charger that knows when to switch itself off. The Asmo charger aims to save the environment, and prevent fire hazards, by switching itself off immediately once a smartphone is no longer being charged. Created by I.T. engineer Asmo Saloranta, it was developed after his fiancee Johanna Papinaho's childhood home burnt to the ground by a mobile phone charger left plugged in. Scroll down for video . A Finnish inventor has created the world's first intelligent phone charger - that knows when to switch itself off. The Asmo charger (pictured) aims to save the environment and prevent fire hazards by switching itself off immediately once a smartphone is detached . The charger shuts down automatically and isolates itself from the electricity grid once the phone is unplugged. Input voltage: 110-250V . Output voltage: 5V . Stand-by power: 0W . Compatibility: U.S. and EU (not UK yet) Connector: Apple Lightning, Apple 30-pin and Micro-USB . Weight: 0.2lbs (100g) Warranty: 12 months . Saloranta, 33, from Oulu, Finland, said: ‘Mobile phone chargers consume power, even if there is no phone connected to it. ‘I set myself a challenge to invent a charger that is much safer and consumes no standby power. Two years later, I came up with a solution. ‘How it works is the power to the charger is limited and isolated from the grid - it's a pulse of power that comes off the grid rather than a stream. The phone charger simply turns of the flow.' The charger comes with several different connectors, including the Apple 30-pin connector, the new Apple Lighting connector, and Micro-USB. Users can also choose to buy either a U.S. or EU two-prong plug by pledging at least £17 ($29) on Kickstarter. The company is planning to launch a UK version of the device later this year. Asmo is trying to raise £41,000 ($70,000) on Kickstarter with the aim of delivering pre-orders to Kickstarter supporters in October. The ‘Automatic Stop’ technology is currently patent pending and full-scale commercial production of the charger will begin in December. The eco plug is only turned on when it is plugged into a phone. When it is taken out the plug turns off, preventing overheating and possible fires. The Asmo plug can be used with a variety of devices including most Android phones and the latest iPhones . ‘It's one thing to aim to be safer and conserve energy, but it's another for the device to do it for you,' continued Saloranta. ‘It is really taking off now, I am now in talks with mobile phone manufacturers. ‘There . have been so many tragic stories about phone chargers when they have . been left on, I thought it was strange that nobody had done this. ‘Johanna . is definitely my driving force behind the project, her story helped me . come up with the idea, and she is very passionate. ‘Our . mission is to make the world a better place - with Asmo charger one that can . save money and the environment while improving fire safety.’ He . added: ‘In one year, for every mobile charger you own, you pay for . 8,000 watts of wasted energy, [equivalent to] keeping your laptop . running for 260 hours or leaving your lights on for a month. ‘There . are almost seven billion mobile phones in the world. By leaving mobile . phone chargers on, we use the equivalent of two nuclear power plants or . 25,000 wind power mills.’ Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal.

If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live.

"By . Associated Press . Nearly 170 victims of child sex trafficking, many of whom had never been reported missing, were rescued in the last week as part of an annual nationwide crackdown, the FBI said Monday. Besides the 168 children rescued from the sex trade, 281 pimps were arrested during the same period on state and federal charges. 'These are not faraway kids in faraway lands,' FBI Director James Comey said in announcing the annual enforcement push known as Operation Cross Country. Instead, he added, 'These are America's children.' Scroll Down for Video . 'These are America's children': FBI Director James Comey announces the child sex trafficking sting from the bureau's headquarters in Washington, DC on Monday . This is the eighth such week-long operation, which this year unfolded in 106 cities. The FBI says nearly 3,600 children have so far been recovered from the street. 'I hate that we have to do this work — hate it,' Comey said. 'I love the people who've devoted their lives to doing this work. There is no more meaningful work that the FBI participates in than rescuing children.' He said the operations were designed to 'crush these pimps' and show that children are not for sale. They are also intended to rescue children who are being trafficked on street corners, in truck stops and, increasingly, on the Internet, where pimps advertise and arrange sexual encounters. One challenge, officials said, is that many of the children who were recovered were never reported missing in the first place — by parents, guardians and the entire child welfare system designed to protect them. Rescued: In the Monday press conference, Comey said that the bureau had rescued 168 children and arrested 281 pimps. He reported that the pimps sold the children online, at truck stops and on the street . 'No one is reporting them missing. Hence, no one is looking for them,' said John Ryan, CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 'But for operations like this, these children likely would never have been found.' He said better laws were needed to require child welfare service to report children who disappear. Right now, he said, only two states have laws requiring agencies to report children missing from their care. There is no national, uniform standard. 'We cannot find them if no one reports them missing,' Ryan said. Though this operation is the FBI's eighth of its kind, Comey said this year featured the highest number of participating cities. But he said the biggest change was the increasing prevalence of children being sold online rather than on street corners.","The FBI rescued 168 children this week in a nationwide crackdown on sex-trafficking .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in ‘swarms’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years, according to a new roadmap. Unmanned aircraft carrying stronger chemical weapons could also be on the horizon, the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap. While the document sets out plans for unmanned maritime, land and air vehicles, there is a lot of focus on the future capability of controversial drones, which, if the plans come to fruition, could deviate from mission commands set by humans if they spot a better target. The U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) revealed its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, which includes plans for drones that can swarm, deviate from a set mission and carry stronger chemical weapons. A current MQ-9 Reaper drone used in Afghanistan is pictured . Current drones require intensive manpower on the ground to fly, which is expensive and the DoD plans on cutting costs by letting the machines make more decisions themselves, Live Science reported. At the moment drones follow precise commands to complete a predetermined step-by-step mission, but the unmanned aircraft of the future could deviate from tasks, informed by ‘laws’ that govern their behaviour, laid out in algorithms and machine learning, as well as advanced sensors. While drones, or unmanned aircraft, currently use GPS to navigate war zones and remote areas, the satellite signals used by the systems can be jammed easily, so the Defence Advanced Research  Projects Agency (DARPA) is working on jam-proof ‘inertial guidance systems’. Current drones require intensive manpower on the ground, which is expensive and the DoD plans on cutting costs by letting the machines make more decisions themselves. A demonstrator model of Neuron, a pan-European stealth combat drone is pictured . The DoD's roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘swarms’ of drone-bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘mothership’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into, guided by the bots’ on-bard cameras. Thanks to the unmanned mothership, the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles (463km) the roadmap said. The weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more deadly under the plans, as researchers are working on ‘energetic nanoparticles’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion. The technologies combined are intended to help the U.S. military be ‘more effective through greater automation and greater performance,’ the report says. designer Ruben Pater's Drone Survival guide has been likened to 21st century bird watching . A Dutch designer has penned the Drone Survival Guide, which like bird watching charts, shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes. Ruben Pater’s guide, however, details the differing kinds of flying robots used at war, as well as survival tips of how to hide from them. The majority of the drones selected for the chart are from NATO member countries, including the UK, France, Germany, U.S. and Canada. This is because these countries have used drones in wars such as Afghanistan and are also more transparent than some other countries in disclosing information about the robots, such as their wingspan. It uses a skull icon to show that a drone is used for attack and a little eye to denote a surveillance vehicle. The chart, which Mr Pater describes as ‘21st century bird watching’ shows the vast array of flying war machines used today from the giant 130ft wingspan of the Global Hawk drone to the petite Parrot AC quadcopter, which measures just 23 inches. He said: ‘Most drones are used today by military powers for remote-controlled surveillance and attack and their numbers are growing. 'The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicted in 2012 that within 20 years there could be as many as 30.000 drones flying over U.S. soil alone. ‘As robotic birds will become commonplace in the near future, we should be prepared to identify them.

Electric shocks were sent into the abdomen of the male volunteers - including British singer Iain Inglis, 31, who lives and works in China - who gave up when the pain-o-metre hit 100. 'It was too much for me,' he said. 'The pain was terrible!' Some 20 male volunteers went on a local TV show to submit to the pains that women endure during child birth - but most could not reach the maximum 30 seconds . Another man, Lee Hao, said: 'This was incredible. I couldn't stand much of it all. I understand now why my wife screamed for drugs when she was giving birth.' Zhou Nan successfully stuck to the end and hit the 500 mark. 'I am the father of triplets and wanted to understand the great pain my wife experienced when she was giving birth,' he said.

If you think that Internet shopping on a Sunday gets you the best deals, then think again.Tuesday is actually the best day of the week if you want to grab a bargain, according to an exhaustive analysis of on-line shopping.Thursday is the second best day followed by Friday - but Sunday is when you are least likely to make a saving. Researchers analysed 3,000 companies and half a billion transactions to find the best times to buy . The team also found that Brits were the world's best bargain hunters, with on average 5.51 discounts applied to their purchaes . The study also looked at months and found that the pre-Christmas rush in November is when there are most bargains around on the web - and not the January sales. US retailer reporting service SumAll examined 3,000 companies and half a billion transactions as part of its report. It worked out the average discount offered to consumers on each day of the week and over different times of the year. The best day of the week was Tuesday where savings were 4.81 per cent, followed by Thursday on 4.80 per cent. In third place was Friday at 4.65 per cent, then Wednesday at 4.13 per cent and Monday at 4.11 per cent. Only the foolish would shoo on a Saturday where the discounts were typically 3.84 per cent - and Sunday was the worst with 3.37 per cent. The analysis by month is even more surprising as most people think that waiting until the post-Christmas sales would yield the biggest discounts. In fact, November is when you will get the largest savings at 5.99 per cent on average. Shoppers were advised to avoid the January sales, and instead buy in November when there were more offers available . January came in second at 4.95 per cent, followed by May at 4.50 per cent. The worst month to buy on-line was March where you could expect to save just 2.76 per cent. Consumers and experts have been speculating for years about the best time to shop online. Booking . a flight has almost become a science with some claiming that buying six . weeks before you travel guarantees you the best price. However a recent analysis by the US Airlines Reporting Commission found that was not actually the case. Not . only did the six week window fail to stack up, in some cases the best . fares were on sale as long as 24 weeks before departure. The .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Breakthrough: A new test can more reliably diagnose prostate cancer AND tell how big the tumour is - without the need for a rectal examination . Scroll down for video . A cheap, easy and accurate test for prostate cancer could be in surgeries within months. Studies show the new urine test to be twice as reliable as the existing blood test for detecting the disease – the most common cancer among British men. It also tells doctors how serious the cancer is. This means it should not only save lives but also spare men painful, embarrassing and unnecessary tests and treatments. The new test – described as potentially the biggest breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis in 25 years – does not involve a rectal examination. It is likely to cost as little as £10 a patient, and the price tag, combined with its accuracy and simplicity, could even lead to all older men being screened for the disease, as women are for breast cancer. The test’s Surrey University creators have struck a deal with two companies and it is hoped it will be in doctors’ surgeries later this year. Private patients will be the first to benefit but NHS use could follow. Inventor Hardev Pandha, a professor of medical oncology, said: ‘This new test could lead to faster detection that could save hundreds of lives and also offers the potential for huge cost savings.’ Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men, killing nearly 11,000 people a year, and doctors do not have a 100 per cent accurate way of spotting it. The blood test routinely used measures levels of a protein called prostate specific antigen, or PSA, but it is wrong more often than it is right. This means many men are subjected to the pain, worry and embarrassment of unnecessary biopsies. In other cases, fledgling cancers are missed until they have spread elsewhere in the body and are harder to treat. The new test uses a urine sample, dispensing with the need for needles. It searches the urine for a protein called EN2, which is not made by healthy people but is pumped out by tumours. In trials, it detected about 70 per cent of prostate cancers, making it twice as accurate as the PSA test. But the test has a second advantage. Unlike PSA, the amount of EN2 in urine corresponds with the size of the tumour. This . is important because prostate cancer is not always life-threatening. It . often grows slowly and does not always need to be treated straight . away. Many men with tumours . that will do them little harm are subjected to surgery and radiotherapy, . both of which carry a high risk of incontinence and impotence. The new test uses a urine sample, dispensing with the need for needles. It searches the urine for a protein called EN2, which is not made by healthy people but is pumped out by tumours, and is 70 per cent reliable . Professor Pandha, who created the test with Dr Richard Morgan, added: ‘Our trials have shown that levels of EN2 accurately reflect the amount of cancer in the patient’s prostate gland. ‘Small prostate cancers do not require treatment and can be safely monitored; larger volume cancers require prompt treatment. ‘The EN2 test allows for the  urologist to determine which option is best for the patient.’ Tim Sharp, of the Prostate Project, which part-funded the research, said: ‘This is potentially the most exciting development in the diagnosis of prostate cancer for 25 years.’ Prostate Cancer UK said Professor Pandha’s results were encouraging but added that large-scale, long-term trials were needed. Dr Peter FitzGerald, of Randox Laboratories, one of the two companies that will turn the research into a kit for use in doctors’ surgeries, said: ‘With prostate and bladder cancers being among the top ten common causes of cancer death, accurate diagnosis is incredibly important.’ Prostate Cancer UK .","New urine test is twice as reliable as the existing blood test for the disease .

"By . Paul Bentley . and Ian Drury . Dressed in their smartest dress uniform they came to carry the coffin of a comrade who had been killed in battle. But stopping for a cup of tea to calm themselves before the ceremony, the six servicemen found that risking their lives overseas no longer guarantees respect back home. After flying in from Afghanistan for the funeral of Corporal Michael Thacker, the men were refused entry to have a hot drink at a bar in Coventry. They were told anyone wearing military outfits was banned. Anger: The pallbearers at the funeral of corporal Michael Thacker, pictured carrying the coffin of their comrade, were all refused tea because of their uniforms . Moving: The sextet, which included Thacker's own brother, carry their loved-one up the steps of Coventry Cathedral as a mourner looks on . Yesterday, as Corporal Thacker’s widow . revealed her horror at their treatment, the bar was subject to a fierce . protest, with thousands vowing to stage a boycott. And a former commander of British Forces in Afghanistan said the bar’s behaviour was ‘a direct insult’ to the dead soldier. Corporal Thacker, 27, of 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, was shot on June 1 at an observation post in Helmand province. On Monday, he was laid to rest at . Coventry Cathedral, with six of his closest comrades, including his . brother Matthew, acting as pallbearers. Corporal Michael Thacker, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, was shot dead in Afghanistan early this month . After taking part in rehearsals from . 6.30am, the men broke off to go for a cup of tea at Brown’s bar before . the ceremony – but they were told they could not enter because their . uniforms were in breach of the dress code. This was despite the fact they were in . their dress uniforms – or ‘number 2s’ – complete with freshly polished . brass buttons and pressed trousers. It is the smartest uniform after the . ceremonial No.1 dress and sees them wear campaign and operational . honours medals. Last night, 60,000 people had joined a . Facebook group calling for a boycott of Brown’s bar this Saturday, . which is Armed Forces Day. Although owner Ken Brown initially . refused to apologise, he has since said his staff were unaware of the . funeral and the incident would not have happened if they had been. His words follow a protest at the bar in which a brick was thrown through the window and the police called. Corporal Thacker’s widow Catherine, . who twice served in Iraq as an Army medic, posted a message online . saying she was ‘horrified’ at the bar’s behaviour. The couple married . six years ago and have a daughter, Millie, who turns three next week. And last night she told the Mail: . ‘It’s discrimination. You can go to Iraq for six-and-a-half months, . leaving your family behind, without proper food or being able to wash . but you are not accepted in your own town. ‘What they are saying is that you can protect our country, but you can’t have a drink in my bar.’ Happier times: Corporal Michael Thacker, left, with his wife Catherine Thacker, centre left, brother Matthew Thacker, right, who was a pallbearer and his wife Vicky Thacker, centre right .

You just go and that was it.’ Boycott: Katie Jonas, 25, pictured, has founded the Facebook group protesting at the treatment of pallbearers . Care: Hundreds turned out to the funeral two days ago to say their goodbyes to the tragic soldier . Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded . British forces in Afghanistan, said the bar’s policy was ‘a direct . insult’ to Corporal Thacker. ‘He gave up everything he had and . everything he would ever have, including his wife and baby daughter, so . that his countrymen could live in peace and security – not so that brave . soldiers visiting his home town to pay him homage could be . discriminated against in such a heartless way.’ And Tory MP Patrick Mercer said: ‘If . our fighting men and women can’t be treated better than this then it is a . shameful state of affairs.’ In his apology, Mr Brown said: ‘I . wasn’t here and the staff dealt with the situation. Basically, we have a . rule here that no one in uniform gets served here and the staff refused . to serve and that’s as far as it went. ‘I can only apologise again to the . family and anyone else that was upset... it wouldn’t have happened if . we’d been aware of the funeral.’","The men, including the soldier’s .

"By . Associated Press . Renisha McBride's phone contained several selfies of her with a gun, with marijuana and with cash . Jurors in the upcoming trial of a Detroit-area man who shot a young, drunk woman on his porch won't see selfies of the victim with a gun, marijuana and cash, a judge said Monday in another defeat for the defense. Theodore Wafer's attorneys want to show the photos from Renisha McBride's cellphone to demonstrate that she had an aggressive side. But Wayne County Judge Dana Hathaway said there could be a 'million reasons' why the 19-year-old posed that way. 'There is nothing in the photographs that establishes a reputation for violent or aggressive behavior,' Hathaway said. Wafer, 55, of Dearborn Heights is charged with second-degree murder. He says he shot her in self-defense in response to pounding at his door last November. Trial is set for July 21. In court filings and arguments, Wafer's attorneys have clearly signaled their strategy: He lives alone in a neighborhood on the edge of Detroit and was afraid of what he was hearing about 4.30am. Cheryl Carpenter has tried to get the judge to allow the defense to use McBride's text messages, which carry a slang reference to marijuana, and the provocative photos, but the judge won't budge. Separately, Hathaway agreed to approve subpoenas to get access to social media sites that the victim may have used. 'Our defense is blown to pieces if you don't allow me to argue to the jury that she could have been up to no good. ... She could have been running from somebody,' Carpenter said. Lawyers for Theodore Wafer, pictured center on Monday, planned to base part of his defense around allegations that his victim, Renisha McBride had a dark side . Wafer is charged with second-degree murder for the shooting . Carpenter acknowledged that questioning McBride's reputation 'leaves a bad taste' but 'we have to do this.' McBride was shot in the face. More than three hours earlier, she crashed her car about a half-mile away in Detroit but walked away before an ambulance arrived. It's not known what she did between the crash and the shooting. She wasn't armed. Her family believes McBride probably was seeking help at Wafer's house, but the defense says there's no evidence. 'The prosecutor argued she was meek and mild. ... She was violent. She was aggressive. She was pounding,' Carpenter said. McBride's aunt, Bernita Spinks, left court at one point because she didn't like Carpenter's argument. 'She wasn't a violent person. She wouldn't harm a fly,' Spinks said in an interview outside court.

"By . Mark Prigg . Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6. They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back. However, a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen. Scroll down for video . An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. New rumours back the claims, promising a far thinner screen technology. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). Nikkei says the leaked pictures all show flaws - such as buttons that do not fit properly, of misaligned screens. They claim this is because the units are unfinished - and that the final version will have polished glass in place of the bars seen in pictures, and possibly even a curved screen. According to an unnamed source who has seen the real thing, the mockups are no better than a 'rough estimate' of what the final phone will look like. It also claims the final design could see a curved glass design. Another report from The China Times says Apple will use a new type of display in the iPhone 6, allowing it to be far thinner than the current iPhone 5c - although it claims manufacturers are struggling to make the super-thin panels. Apple suppliers are believed to be about to begin mass production of two new iPhones set to be launched in September. It has been rumoured the 4.5 inch version of the handset would launch first, followed a month later by a 5.5inch version. However, now it believed both could be unveiled at the same time. Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone . 'Apple is ramping up on two bigger devices, said Bloomberg, saying its sources asked not to be identified because the plans are private. 'One model will have a 4.7-inch display, compared to the 4-inch screen of the current iPhone 5s, that may be available to ship to retailers around September, said two of the people. 'A 5.5-inch version is also being prepared for manufacturing and may be available at the same time, the people said.' Hundreds of thousands of new employees have been drafted in by suppliers to meet the expected huge demand. According to a new report from RBC Caputal Markets, 'Overall, our survey suggests that consumer demand foran iPhone 6 is solid.' The firm surveyed 4,000+ consumers, and found many would be swayed towards the iPhone by a bigger screen. '35% of the users who don’t expect to purchase an iPhone would do so should Apple offer a larger form factor,' it said. However, it did find consumer's number one request was better battery life - followed by a bigger screen. It also found people would pay a premium for the big screen. '26% of the consumers are willing to pay a $100 premium for a 5.5"" screen size,' the report claimed. According to RBC Capital Markets, . a quarter of potential iPhone 6 buyers would be willing to pay $100 more for their iPhone to have a 5.5-inch screen over the other rumored size of 4.7 inches. Hon Hai Precision Industry will recruit over 100,000 people in mainland China to produce the newest iPhone from Apple, Taiwan's Economic Daily News reported on Monday, in what the report called the firm's largest single hiring spree in China. Fellow Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron Corp will also expand its workforce in one mainland factory by 30 percent, in response to expected high demand for the new iPhone. The handsets have been plagued by leaks. While numerous images of the 4.7-inch version have been leaked over the past few weeks, until recently details of the 5.5 inch model have remained a mystery. Now, prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). While the photos themselves aren’t groundbreaking, they suggest Apple is already producing components for the larger-sized phones, according to 9 to 5 Mac who first reported the leak, after Dickson tweeted the images. An image last week, also leaked by Dickson, revealed the two new models side-by-side. These latest photos are the first images of the 5.5-inch version's display part. Foxconn, which manufacturers around 70 per cent of the phone, recently hired 100,000 additional workers in mainland China to help produce the iPhone 6. Both these moves suggest Apple is gearing up for the launch of new iOS devices around the usual September timeframe. Separate reports have suggested the 5.5-inch model will be released several weeks before the 4.7-inch model, and will be produced in limited numbers. Based on previous leaks, the new set of iPhones will launch in a thinner aluminium body and will include a sapphire crystal display covering for improved strength. Users of Apple's next handset may also be able to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code found in the iOS 8 operating system. Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung. Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures. Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible. Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services . Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset . Both iPhones are also thought to include a higher-resolution display with a pixel ratio of 1704 x 960. They may also include an A8 system-on-a-chip for improved efficiency, performance boosts, and better battery life. Apple also has the iWatch in the pipeline for release this year, which will include more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data. Apple has been under pressure to release new products, as investors question whether the company that popularized the smartphone and the tablet computer is still able to innovate following the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October, it has been claimed. Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen . This concept iWatch (pictured) incorporates Healthbook fitness features that leaked in March, but experts claim Apple could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically designed to track health. Both could rival Microsoft's planned device .","Leaked images all look similar - but are a 'rough approximation'

"By . Jack Doyle . Supposedly penniless asylum seekers living in taxpayer-funded accommodation have been caught with expensive electronic goods such as iPads and wide screen TVs. Auditors carrying out spot checks found 'signs of wealth' at around one in ten properties, a report reveals today. A spokesman for the National Audit Office said this included iPads, wide screen televisons, and mobile phones. (File picture) The National Audit Office has found supposedly penniless asylum seekers living in taxpayer-funded accommodation have been caught with expensive electronic goods . The Home Office spends around £150million a year housing some 23,000 asylum seekers while it decides whether their claims are genuine. It also houses asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected but who it is unable to remove from the country. Asylum seekers are banned from working while their claims are processed and cannot claim normal out-of-work benefits. Instead they are given somewhere to live in certain designated areas and a weekly subsistence allowance. To qualify, they must be considered 'destitute'. An NAO report published today found many clearly enjoying a living standard well above the breadline. The NAO said it carried out ten visits in three areas - Yorkshire, London and the North West. In each area at least one visit revealed 'indications of prosperity'. If repeated across the country it would mean around 2,000 asylum seekers were wrongly being given State handouts. The report said they found 'signs of wealth' which suggested that the 'occupant may have a higher level of income'. The report said: 'During the fieldwork for our investigation, we visited a sample of properties used to house asylum seekers. Among the expensive electrical items found in asylum seekers' houses include iPads . 'In some of these, it was clear that the occupants may have a level of income above that expected of someone receiving the minimum level of support...' 'There is a risk that individuals or families may be occupying properties to which they are not entitled, thus taking resources away from those more in need. Housing officials who discover signs of wealth should report it to the authorities within 24 hours, the report said. But the Home Office was unable to say how many such reports it had received. The report also revealed Government officials are negotiating with councils to find new parts of the country to put asylum applicants and failed asylum seekers. Councils said they were concerned too many asylum seekers were being housed in areas with large migrant populations, potentially undermining 'community cohesion'. The current limit is one asylum seeker for every 200 people. The Home Office told auditors it 'wishes to negotiate options to consider the need for, and potential to, widen participating areas in some regions.' The housing is provided by three private companies, G4S, Serco and Clearel who took over the contracts in 2012. But the report found failures by G4S and Serco to provide appropriate housing had already cost taxpayers up to £4million. Both firms are failing to supply enough homes for asylum-seekers quickly enough. Home Office officials are now in talks with the two companies to recover the money, the report says. The Government is now attempting to recover the money. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Our providers are required to refer any signs of wealth and support is removed where we have evidence of a personal income. 'Where possible, we will also seek to recover overpayments and pursue a prosecution. 'The Home Office has a duty to provide accommodation and subsistence support only to those who are destitute.' Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said the council had 'long held concerns' about the availability and quality of housing for asylum seekers. 'Asylum seekers are often people who have fled horrifying experiences in their own countries and have lost everything. Failure to provide adequate accommodation is always unacceptable.'","Auditors carrying out spot checks found expensive electrical goods .

"By . Associated Press . Held: Sgt. Omar Velez is accused of killing a Panamanian woman with whom he had a romantic relationship . A U.S. soldier has been detained on suspicion of killing a Panamanian woman. Sgt. Omar Velez was being held at Fort Bragg in North Carolina on Monday in connection with the murder of a young woman whose body was found in central Panama on June 23.  Velez had not yet been charged, but will likely be brought before a U.S. military court, U.S. Southern Command spokesman Kimberly Hanson said. Velez was in Panama conducting training as part of a unit associated with the sale of military equipment when the killing occurred. Local media report that Velez had been romantically involved with the woman and was discovered near her body with a shovel after an apparent crime of passion. The body was found on a farm near a river embankment, close to where a firearms training session was being held, according to Panamanian officials. Some Panamanians are outraged that the soldier's diplomatic immunity protects him from local prosecution. At least one Panamanian organization is calling for a local trial. Relations between Panama and the United States have historically snared over issues of sovereignty, and the incident threatens to stir old resentments. A current of anti-American feeling still runs through the country more than a decade after the U.S. turned over control of the Panama Canal, said Paul Sutter, who teaches history at the University of Colorado at Boulder. A century of U.S. jurisdiction over the canal and its surrounding area struck many in the country as a vestige of colonial days, and the Americans' imperious behavior made the situation worse, Sutter said. The tensions led to riots in the 1960s. The U.S. Army has expressed its 'deepest regret' over the woman's death, and pledged to fully investigate the killing. Killer?

"By . Lucy Crossley . Emperor penguins could face extinction if temperatures continue to rise as melting sea ice will have a ripple effect on the birds' food chain, new research has warned. At nearly four feet tall, Antarctica's largest sea bird has gained worldwide affection thanks to films like March Of The Penguins and Happy Feet, but if temperatures were to rise their numbers could fall by a third by the end of the century. Researchers behind the first comprehensive study into the future of the species say their findings suggest that emperor penguins should be protected by the Endangered Species Act. Endangered? Researchers have warned that emperor penguins could face extinction due to melting sea ice . The study was published in the journal Nature Climate . Change and is based on computer models simulating melting sea ice if . temperatures in the region rise. Too little affects food availability as it reduces the amount of marine prey available to the penguins, whereas too much forces adults to travel further to forage for food to bring back to their chicks. Disappearing ice affects the fish, squid and krill the penguins eat, which in turn feed on zooplankton and phytoplankton that grow on the ice. If the ice goes, so will the plankton - causing a ripple effect through the food web that could starve the various species penguins rely on for food. Icon: The film March Of The Penguins (pictured) depicts the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march - single file to their traditional sea ice breeding ground . Cartoon hero: Emperor penguins were also featured in the cartoon film Happy Feet, in which the main character of Mumbles was voiced by Elijah Wood . The emperor penguin is the largest species of penguin, reaching heights of around 4ft tall, and weighing between 49 and 99lbs. They are recognisable due to their distinctive black back and head, white breast and yellow patches on their necks. The flightless birds inhabit the Antarctic, huddling together to keep warm in the icy climate, where temperatures reach as low as -90C. Emperor penguins breed and raise their young almost exclusively on sea ice, with the females laying eggs before heading off to hunt for food, leaving the males to incubate the egg. After the chick is born, parents take turns foraging at sea and caring for the newborn within the colony. The birds' diet consists primarily of fish, but they will also eat crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. To facilitate hunting the penguins can remain underwater for up to 18 minutes, diving to a depth of 1,755 ft. Emperor penguins in the wild typically live for around 20 years, although some have lived for as long as 50 years. Along with nine other species of penguin, . it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US . Endangered Species Act. Dr Stephanie Jenouvrier, of Woods Hole . Oceanographic Institution, Massachusetts, and colleagues analysed . population trends for the 45 known emperor penguin colonies, taking . account of the various sea ice conditions forecast. The study showed although year to year . growth rates are mostly positive until 2040, all colonies will begin to . experience falls by 2080, and predicted that two thirds of colonies will . shrink to less than half of their present size by 2100. The study is based on climate change scientists' predictions, although these are disputed by some critics of theories of man-made climate change. 'Dynamics differ among colonies, but by 2100 all populations are projected to be declining,' said Dr Jenouvrier. 'At least two thirds are projected to have declined by more than 50 per cent from their current size. The global population is projected to have declined by at least 19 per cent. 'Because criteria to classify species by their extinction risk are based on the global population dynamics, global analyses are critical for conservation.' Just one emperor penguin population has been intensively studied, the colony in Terre Adelie in East Antarctica, at the northern part of the species range which has been followed for five decades. Dr Jenouvrier said: 'A detailed analysis of the effects of climate change on this colony projected a pronounced decline by the end of this century. 'However, 45 colonies are known from direct and satellite observations. Most of these colonies have never been, and probably never will be visited by humans.' Unlike other sea birds, Emperor penguins breed and raise their young almost exclusively on sea ice. If the ice breaks up and disappears early into the breeding season, massive breeding failure will occur. There is already a huge death rate at the breeding stages because only half of chicks live to the end of the breeding season and then only half the survivors live to see another year. The Dion Islet penguin colony, close to the West Antarctic peninsula, had a thriving population of 250 breeding pairs in the 70s, but that number was reduced just 20 in 1999 and by 2009, it was wiped out entirely. Dr Jenouvrier added: 'We propose the Emperor penguin is fully deserving of Endangered status due to climate change, and can act as an iconic example of a new global conservation paradigm for species threatened by future climate change.'

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . General Motors' safety crisis worsened on Monday when the automaker added 8.2 million vehicles to its ballooning list of cars recalled over faulty ignition switches. The latest recalls involve mainly older midsize cars and bring GM's total this year to 29 million, surpassing the 22 million recalled by all automakers last year. GM said the recalls are for 'unintended ignition key rotation' and cover seven vehicles, including the Chevrolet Malibu from 1997 to 2005, the Pontiac Grand Prix from 2004 to 2008, and the 2003-2014 Cadillac CTS. Another recall: This 200 Chevrolet Malibu is one of the millions announced recalled today . The company is aware of three deaths, eight injuries and seven crashes involving the vehicles, although it has no conclusive evidence that faulty switches caused the accidents. CEO Mary Barra said the recalls stem from an extensive safety review within the company. 'If any other issues come to our attention, we will act appropriately and without hesitation,' she said in a statement. The announcement of more recalls extends a crisis for GM that began in February with small-car ignition switch problems. GM recalled 2.6 million older small cars worldwide because the switches can unexpectedly slip from 'run' to 'accessory,' shutting off the engines. That disables power steering and power brakes and can cause people to lose control of their cars. It also stops the air bags from inflating in a crash. GM has been forced to admit that it knew of the problem more than 10 years, yet it failed to recall the cars until this year. GM's conduct in the small-car recall already is under investigation by the Justice Department and both houses of Congress. Earlier this year, the company paid a $35 million fine to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for delays in reporting the small-car ignition switch problems. GM has seen better days: This 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix was recalled today as it was announced GM will offer no less than $1million to the families of those killed by faulty ignition switches . The added ignition switch recalls raise questions about the safety of the switches in cars made by all manufacturers. On June 18, NHTSA opened two investigations of Chrysler minivans and SUVs as part of a widening inquiry into air bag and ignition switch problems across the U.S. auto industry. NHTSA began asking automakers and parts suppliers for information on the interrelated issues after GM's small-car recall. NHTSA asked automakers and parts makers for information on switches and how long air bags will inflate after the keys are moved out of the ""run"" position to 'accessory' or 'off.' In many cases, the answer is less than a second. That led to the Chrysler inquiries, NHTSA said in a statement. 'The agency examined all major manufacturers' air bag deployment strategies as they relate to switch position,' the agency said in a statement. 'NHTSA will continue to refine its knowledge of these systems.' GM's recalls on Monday bring this year's total so far to more than 40 million for the U.S. industry, far surpassing the old full-year record of 30.8 million from 2004. The recalls come just hours after the company's compensation consultant, Kenneth Feinberg, announced plans to pay victims of crashes caused by the defective small-car switches. Attorneys and lawmakers say about 100 people have died and hundreds were injured in crashes, although Feinberg said he didn't have a total. Feinberg said the company has placed no limit on how much he can spend in total to compensate victims. Even Cadillaccs: This CTS is another of the many cars recalled Monday by GM . GM spokesman Alan Adler said that in the Cadillacs, the ignition can slip due to jarring from the road, a bump on the key from the driver's knee or from the weight of a heavy key chain. In the older model midsize Chevrolets, Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles, only jarring or heavy keys — and not a bump from the driver's knee — can knock the ignition out of position. In all the cases, the ignition switches out of the ""run"" position and into the ""accessory"" or ""off"" position. Adler said that, unlike GM's previous recall of 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars, the ignition switch is made to GM's specifications. But the keys can slip too easily. The company will place inserts on the keys to fix the issues. Adler said GM began investigating all of its ignition switches 60 days ago after the Cobalt recall revealed problems. This recall came out of that investigation. GM is urging people to remove everything from their key rings until the recalled cars can be repaired. Of the three people who died in crashes involving the newly recalled vehicles, it's unclear whether those deaths were ignition-related, Adler said. In each of the cases the air bags didn't deploy, but there are many reasons air bags don't deploy, including the angle the car is hit and whether or not the occupants were belted, he said. Adler said victims in the newly recalled vehicles won't be included in the compensation fund that has been set up for the small-car case. The Detroit company said it plans to take a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter for recall-related expenses. Added to a $1.3 billion charge in the first quarter, that brings total recall expenses for the year to $2.5 billion. GM also announced four other recalls Monday covering more than 200,000 additional vehicles. Most are to fix an electrical short in the driver's door that could disable the power locks and windows and even cause overheating. Of the 29 million vehicles recalled this year, 17.1 million have been over ignition switches . GM's stock fell 27 cents, or less than one percent, to $36.36 in late afternoon trading.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Gulliver's Travels is a classic novel which has inspired legions of schoolchildren and adults with its imaginative wit and satirical undertones. Less inspiring, however, is the abandoned Japanese theme park based on the 18th century book which was left to rot after closing down in 2001. The eerie centrepiece of the park is a 147ft statue of Gulliver himself being tied to the ground by the miniature Lilliputians, who he encounters during his first adventure. Gulliver's Kingdom theme park opened near Mount Fiji (pictured in the background) in 1997 and features a huge 146ft-long statue of Gulliver . The statue shows the moment when Gulliver is tied to the ground by Lilliputians in the first of his adventures . In the first of his four travels, Gulliver is kept as a pet by the Lilliputians - a tiny version of a European Royal family - and is eventually used as a weapon of war to help crush their rivals . Because the Lilliputians are tiny - about a 12th the size of a human - their rivalries and squabbles are made to seem petty, a deliberate attack by Swift on the ruling classes of his day . Photographer Martin Lyle, 44, visited the park to capture these images. He said: 'The giant Gulliver was unreal. Entering the grounds I didn't see him right away, then as I delved deeper into the park he suddenly loomed out of the landscape. 'It was such a momentous thing to stand in the presence of. It was the most amazing and surreal object I have ever seen. It felt so weird to lie in the palm of a giant man, while surrounded by the stunning scenery.' Gulliver's Kingdom theme park was built . next to Mount Fuji near Aokigahara - Japan's famous 'suicide forest' - . and close to the former headquarters of Aum Shinrikyo, the religious . cult responsible for 13 deaths in the Tokyo sarin nerve gas attack of . 1995. The park closed in 2001 after failing to attract enough visitors and has been left to rot ever since . The park is located close to Japan's suicide hotspot, so it is perhaps not surprising that people didn't come . Another nearby landmark is the former headquarters of a religious cult which launched the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo underground which killed 13 people in 1995 . On top of the less-than-desirable location, the park's only ride were a bobsleigh run and a mini-railway . Gulliver's Kingdom opened its doors in 1997, but four years later it was forced to close due to a lack of customers. Some speculate the park attracted so few visitors because of the it's proximity to such grim locations. Aokigahara is the second most popular suicide spot in the world after the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, USA. More than 500 people are known to have taken their lives in the forest since 1950. The nearby village of Kamikuishki was home to the terrorist organisation Aum Shinrikyo, which still has more than 1,000 adherents worldwide. It was used as a base for the production of nerve gas in the Tokyo subway attack. Photographer Martin Lyle, 44, visited the park to capture these images, describing it as 'unreal' In the books Gulliver also visits the Brobdingnags, giants who live in a socialist-style utopia . Gulliver briefly visits Japan in the novel, where he is asked to walk on an engraving of Jesus, but declines . In his final adventure, Gulliver is taken to the land of the Houyhnhnms, where horses rule over human-like creatures called Yahoos . Mr Lyle, of Atlanta, Georgia, USA said: 'I can see why the park did not last very long. I would not want to go to a fun theme park next to those sinister places. 'Which ever way you look at it, the park had a strange concept. Why would you base a theme park on an 18th Century English novel? 'They only had a small amount of attractions there - a bobsled run and a simple railway. I'm sure it wasn't very much fun.' Gulliver's Travels, Johnathan Swift's satirical classic, was first published in 1726 . In 1726, when Johnathan Swift first published Gulliver's Travels, novels were in their infancy, and authors usually needed to travel the kingdom getting lords and ladies to sign up for copies of the finished product, and paying in advance, before they started writing - rather like crowd-sourcing today. This meant that there was Royal oversight on almost everything published, and writers had to be very careful about offending those in power. So instead of attacking Royalty directly in his book, Swift resorted to satire to critique the ruling classes of the day. So the book uses far flung and fictional lands - including Japan - and their strange customs to attack British society. In the first book Gulliver travels to the land of the Lilliputians, miniature people who adopt Gulliver as a pet and use him as a war weapon against their rivals. Lilliputian society mirrored the European courts of the day, and trivialised their in-fighting and wars by literally making them tiny. In the end Gulliver falls foul of the Lilliputian Royals after the palace catches fire and without thinking Gulliver urinates on it to douse the flames, drenching the Queen in the process and earning himself a one-way ticket home. Next Gulliver travels to the kingdom of the Brobdingnags, giants who live in a utopian socialist-style society in which everything is shared between everyone. Gulliver discusses the state of modern Europe with the Brobdingnag King, who is upset by the use of cannons and guns, and cannot understand human's need to be cruel to one another. Gulliver tries to defend the practices, but cannot find any logical reason for them. The third and fourth books contain the strangest of Gulliver's adventures, first to a land of floating islands filled with academics who subdue those beneath them by hurling rocks and threatening to drop the island on their heads. Gulliver then visits Balnibarb on the way to Luggnagg, a land populated by immortal men who get increasingly old but never actually die, and Glubbdubdrib, the home of a magician who helps Gulliver discuss history with the ghosts of old political figures. Japan, where the theme park is based, is then the next stop on Gulliver's travels, before he is taken to the land of the Houyhnhnms, a kingdom where horses are the masters and human-like creatures called Yahoos are the subordinates. The book ends as Gulliver eventually travels home to his wife, by this point convinced that humans are unclean and barbarous, and refuses to live in the house. Instead he locks himself away, spending several hours a day speaking to his horses.","Gulliver's Kingdom theme park near Mount Fuji opened in 1997 but closed four years later .

"By . James White . Updated: . 05:37 EST, 27 January 2012 . An 85-year-old woman was lucky to escape with her life after taking a wrong turn and driving 50 yards along a busy railway line. The pensioner is thought to have been driving her 20-year-old grandson to the station when she became confused at a level crossing. Instead of driving her silver Renault Clio straight over the lines on the A337 through Brockenhurst, New Forest, Hants, she turned onto the tracks. Stationary vehicle: The view of the car from Brockenhurst Station, after its 85-year-old driver took a wrong turn at the level crossing and drove along tracks . On the wrong track: Police and railway workers examine the silver Renault after its elderly driver turned right at the level crossing in Brockenhurst, Hants., by mistake . It is thought she then panicked and drove along the commuter line towards Brockenhurst train station before finally stopping. British Transport Police as well as Hampshire Police were scrambled to the scene at 9.35am yesterday morning. Officers climbed onto the tracks to lift the distraught woman and her passenger to safety. Both were uninjured. The busy rail route, a main line between Bournemouth, Dorset, and London Waterloo, had to be closed for nearly two hours while the car was lifted off the tracks by a crane. Onlookers said the pair were lucky to escape with their lives. Alex Capozza, from Bournemouth, Dorset, saw the car on the London-bound tracks as he turned up for work at the nearby Il Palio Restaurant. Mr Capozza, 30, said: 'They are very lucky they were not hurt - the route is very busy at that time of the morning. 'There are trains every 30 minutes and the express train from Bournemouth to London which doesn't stop. 'Thankfully the signal box is quite close to where the woman stopped so they must have quickly raised the alarm. Big problem: Workers appear bemused by the problem of how to shift the stranded vehicle with one appearing to take a mobile phone picture . 'I saw the elderly lady in the car - she looked shaken. There was a police officer with her, trying to calm her down. 'Eventually they managed to carry her out. There were about 15 police there in total - standing between the crossing and the station. 'When I saw it, I just couldn't believe there was a car on the tracks. 'I've no idea how it happened, how she could have driven down the railway line so far without stopping. 'Surely you would realise you'd gone through the crossing the wrong way - it's pretty obvious.' Mr Capozza continued: 'I've never heard of anything like this happening here before. It was a bit amusing. 'Thankfully neither of them were hurt. I think the lady was taken away in a taxi - I don't think she'll be getting back in a car again. The car couldn't simply be reversed off the tracks - it had to be lifted off with a crane.' Helping hand: A crane is called in to move the Renault . A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'BTP and Hampshire Police officers attended the line, around 80 yards from Brockenhurst rail station, after a report a car had driven onto the line from the level crossing. 'The incident was reported to police at 9.35am. 'Paramedics from the South Central Ambulance Service also attended. An 85-year-old woman driver and 20-year-old man in the car at the time have been treated for shock, but no other injuries have been reported.

"By . Becky Evans . Katy French, one of Ireland's best known models, died after fitting at her friend's house in 2007 . The family of the late Irish model Katy French said justice has not been served after two people charged following her death were spared jail today. Former couple Kieron Ducie and Ann Corcoran were handed given suspended sentences for arranging a drug deal the weekend the socialite collapsed at her home. The model's parents, John and Janet, . and sister Jill said the court case proved she had not been on an . alcohol and cocaine binge but left questions unanswered. 'For five years we have been silent,' said Mr French outside Trim Circuit Court. 'For five years we watched Katy being slandered, torn apart, being used as the flagship for drug taking. 'She wasn't on a binge drink. That came out in the court and I think now is the time to let her rest.' Ms French, 24, died in hospital on . December 6 2007, four days after she had a fit at the former couple's . house in Lambertstown Manor, Kilmessan, Co Meath. The Swiss born model suffered brain damage days after celebrating her birthday. Tests revealed half a glass of wine . and 0.8mg of cocaine in her system - four per cent of what can be considered a . lethal dose - along with traces of antibiotics for a kidney infection, . cough medicine and contraceptives, according to her family. The court heard there was a 90 minute gap between the time Ducie and Corcoran said they found the model and arriving at a nearby hospital. They said they discovered her on a bedroom floor, fitting, with her head back and arms and legs outstretched. When they arrived at hospital, staff were told . she had been drinking but not seen taking drugs. Ducie, 43, who lives with . his new partner and two children and Corcoran, 32, who lives with her . parents in Dublin, later pleaded guilty to procuring . another man - Russell Memery - to possess cocaine which was sold to the . socialite at a garage forecourt. Kieron Ducie and Ann Corcoran, both pictured leaving Trim District Court, were given suspended sentences for arranging a drug deal the weekend socialite Katy French collapsed . A second charge, that the pair . intentionally or recklessly engaged in conduct which created a . substantial risk of death or serious harm to Ms French, was recently . dropped. Ducie was given a two-and-a-half suspended sentence and Corcoran received a two-year suspended sentence. The French family said they are saddened and angry the second charge was dropped. 'I do not feel like justice has been done,' said her sister Jill. She added outside court: 'She was a part of every single one of us. So we have all . been living without a part of ourselves and without her.' The court was told Ducie texted Ms French at 10pm on Saturday, December 1, asking if she was going out. She replied an hour later saying she wanted to visit Corcoran and asked if he could arrange to get her some cocaine. Superintendent Michael Devine, of Navan Garda Station, said Ducie contacted Memery and then Corcoran, who arranged for Memery to meet Ms French at a Statoil service station at Clonee where she bought 200 euro worth of cocaine shortly after midnight. In garda interviews the pair said Ducie . had been out socialising until 6am while Ms French sat up drinking . Champagne and vodka and chatting with Corcoran until 8am, when they all . went to bed. Katy French's family - sister Jill, left, mother Janet, centre, and father John - said justice had not been served after Ducie and Corcoran were given suspended jail sentences . According to the former couple, they heard a bang at about 8.30am from the downstairs room where Ms French was found having a fit. But the court heard emergency services were not called until 10.05am and Ms French arrived at Navan hospital in the back of Ducie's jeep at 10.12am. Mobile phone evidence revealed Ducie called Memery before 10am and several times that morning while medics worked to save the model's life. In May 2010, Memery was given a two and a half year suspended sentence after admitting to conspiring with others to possess cocaine for sale or supply on the weekend Ms French took ill. Judge Michael O'Shea said it would be inhuman of him not to comment on the tragic case adding: 'Her family will carry this cross for the rest of their life.' Corcoran, a secretary in an accountancy firm, is engaged and put her wedding plans on hold until after the case which 'has been hanging over her', her lawyer Patrick Marrinan, senior counsel, said. He claimed taking cocaine 'would not have been unknown' for the model, with one ex-boyfriend referring to her as a 'two-day on, one-day off' cocaine abuser in the book of evidence. Corcoran had no previous convictions while lorry driver Ducie has minor road traffic and public order offences and a conviction for assaulting his partner Elaine Buggle when she was pregnant. Born in Switzerland, Ms French and her family moved to Ireland when she was a child and settled in Enniskerry, County Wicklow.","Kieron Ducie and Ann Corcoran were given suspended sentences after pleading guilty to arranging a drug deal on the weekend she died .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Britain should openly threaten Spain with legal action over its treatment of Gibraltar and set out a ‘more robust’ response to incursions into British waters, MPs said as they warned ministers it was time to ‘get off the fence’ in the diplomatic spat. An influential Commons committee said the Foreign Office had been too timid in responding to what it said was Madrid’s deliberate and politically-motivated use of border delays as a means of ‘coercion’, ‘cavalier’ raids by vessels and ramped up rhetoric. A cautious policy of trying to de-escalate tensions with a key ally was understandable but had so far had ‘little discernible effect’ beyond frustrating residents of the British overseas territory over the lack of firm action, the cross-party foreign affairs committee said. Scroll down for video . 'Too soft': A Commons committee said the Foreign Office had been too timid in responding to 'Madrid¿s deliberate use of Gibraltar border delays as a means of coercion' And with Gibraltarians now feeling ‘under siege’, the Government should set out what ‘naval and police options’ it plans to take to repulse incursions and tell Spain that it has six months to ease the situation or be taken to the European Court for breach of its EU treaty obligations. The Rock has been a long-running cause of friction, with Spain maintaining a long-standing challenge to Britain’s sovereignty over the territory which it has held since 1713. Tensions flared again last summer when Madrid imposed strict border controls in retaliation for the creation of what Gibraltar says is a concrete ‘reef’ but Spain insists was a deliberate move to block its fishing fleet. There have been severe delays at the crossing between Spain and Gibraltar and more than 600 cases of Spanish government vessels unlawfully entering British territorial waters around Gibraltar since the start of 2013. ‘The behaviour of Spain toward Gibraltar is unacceptable,’ the MPs said. ‘A Nato and EU ally is, as a matter of policy, deliberately impacting the economy of a British Overseas Territory. ‘It is time for the Government to get off the fence and take a tougher line. Tough lines: The group of MPs in the committee said the behaviour of Spain toward Gibraltar is 'unacceptable' ‘We have no doubt that delays imposed by Spain at the border with Gibraltar are politically motivated, and that the border is being used as a means of coercion. ‘The Government is right to look to the European Commission to address this matter, but it should state publicly that it will take legal action against Spain in the European Court if there is little improvement in the next six months.’ Article 259 of the Lisbon Treaty allows an EU member state to pursue through the European Court of Justice another which it believes has ‘failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties’. Ministers should also set out which ‘naval and police options it has identified and... intends to pursue’ to defend the waters off The Rock. Harsh words: Sir Richard Ottaway said Spain is 'deliberately impacting the economy of a British Overseas Territory' The Spanish ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Office four times since the current government in Madrid took office in December 2011 to hear protests about incursions and Brussels has sent inspectors to the crossing. But the MPs said diplomatic protests were only being made weeks after the event ‘robbing them of all force’ and giving the impression officials were simply ‘going through the motions’. The ambassador should be hauled in more frequently, all incidents responded to in no more than seven days and Commission officials despatched to the crossing again at the shortest possible notice to both sides, the report recommended. Pressure should also be exerted on Spain - which is guilty of hypocrisy at best over its own claims on overseas territories - by threatening to drop UK support for its ambitions such as gaining a place on the United Nations Security Council, the committee said. The Government was also criticised for doing little to tackle an ‘unacceptable’ ban on cross-border military movements even by Nato allies, saying it was ‘not appropriate for the UK to simply work around it’. There was ‘merit’ in the idea of Gibraltar seeking to remove border controls with Spain by joining the EU’s Schengen no-borders area, they said, though there could be ‘considerable legal and economic implications’ as in Brussels terms it is part of the UK, which is not a member. Committee chair Sir Richard Ottaway said: ‘The behaviour of Spain toward Gibraltar is unacceptable. ‘We have a situation where a Nato and EU ally is deliberately impacting the economy of a British Overseas Territory. ‘But with the FCO taking far too long to register diplomatic protests, we are giving entirely the wrong impression to Spain about how seriously the UK takes these issues.’ The report was published as Europe Minister David Lidington made a visit to Gibraltar but the MPs said that in the light of what the Gibraltarians had gone through over the past year there should be ‘a high-level visit’ within the next few months.","MPs warn Foreign Office it's time to 'get of the fence' about Gibraltar .

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . Rolf Harris faces being stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Queen and will lose his BAFTA fellowship following his convictions for indecent assault. In an astonishing fall from grace for the man who painted the Queen’s portrait and sang in her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Buckingham Palace is now likely to revoke his MBE, OBE, CBE and Officer of the Order of Australia. A Government source told MailOnline Harris's case is to be considered by the independent honours forfeiture committee. Scroll down for video . Fall from grace: Rolf Harris, who painted the Queen's 80th birthday portrait, faces being stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Monarch . 'Honours are usually taken away if sentences are above three months, so would look almost certain in this case,' the source added. The Cabinet Office said it could not comment on individual cases, but precedent confirms honours are forfeited in circumstances where the person is jailed for more than three months or considered to have brought the system into disrepute. A recommendation is typically made by Whitehall’s honours and appointments secretariat to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a serious criminal offence. Former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne’s . ex-wife Vicky Pryce was stripped of the Companion of the Order of the . Bath she was awarded in 2009 when she was a senior civil servant in the . Government. At risk? Harris, who sang at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace in 2012 (left), could lose the CBE he was awarded in 2006 (right) Performer: Harris chats with the Queen and Kylie Minogue following the Jubilee concert in June 2012 . The Queen removed the honour after Pryce was jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points in 2003 for her then husband. Boxer ‘Prince’ Naseem Hamed lost his MBE after being jailed over a high speed car crash in his £300,000 McLaren Mercedes in 2005. Jockey Lester Piggott, meanwhile was convicted in 1987 of tax fraud which led to him spending one year and one day in prison, and was stripped of the OBE. Recipients of honours can also lose them . if they are censured or struck off by a professional or regulatory body . for something relevant to their honour, or if they are judged to have . brought the system into disrepute. Artist: Harris poses alongside his 2006 painting of the Queen . The Daily Mail revealed plans to humiliate banker Fred ‘the Shred’ Goodwin, who oversaw the near-collapse of RBS, by cancelling his knighthood, on that basis. Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006. In 2005, the Queen sat for Harris while he painted her portrait, commissioned by the BBC to mark her 80th birthday. Then in 2012 Harris was one of the star performers at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations. As well as his honours, Harris can expect to lose the BAFTA Fellowship he received two years ago. ‘The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) has made the decision to annul the BAFTA Fellowship bestowed upon Rolf Harris in 2012 following his conviction,’ a spokesman confirmed.","Harris could lose MBE, OBE, CBE and Officer of the Order of Australia .

"By . Gerard Gilbert . Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God never did, the 17th-century writer William Butler said in praise of strawberries — although strawberries in the 1600s were a good deal smaller than today’s giant fruits. God could have made a better berry, but plant-breeders actually did. However, the British public is in broad agreement with Butler’s sentiment, and now — the middle of Wimbledon — coincides with the frenzied mass consumption of what has virtually become the Championships’ emblem: Fragaria ananassa (the ‘pineapple strawberry’), the modern, commercial hybrid of the nation’s favourite soft fruit. There has been mass frenzied consumption of strawberries. Incredibly, supermarket strawberries outsell even staples such as milk and bread . Incredibly, supermarket strawberries outsell even staples such as milk and bread. ‘Last week, they were the top-selling product at Waitrose,’ says Nicki Baggott, the supermarket’s chief buyer. Marks & Spencer has just sold 20 million strawberries in seven days (enough to cover 3,200 Wimbledon centre courts), while Sainsbury’s shifted a similar quantity. ‘To give you an indication of how important they are to Sainsbury’s, for the next four or five months they’ll be our top-selling line in the whole business,’ says the supermarket’s Simon Hinks. ‘It’s the longest period of time any product remains No.1 in our whole business, which is why we spend so much time and effort to get it right.’ And much of that time and effort is spent in a small corner of north Kent that just about manages to cling on to its bucolic past, despite the fact its hop gardens and orchards have long ago been grubbed up and new housing estates nibble at its fringe. The globally renowned East Malling Research (EMR) is just down the road from my father-in-law, who has no idea of what  goes on in this jumble of science labs, residential blocks, barns  and greenhouses. Time to find out. And what a surprising place it proves to be. This centre of cutting-edge horticultural research was founded in 1913 by an association of 600 fruit growers (and these days a charitable trust). It lends its name to a host of fruit varieties, from blackcurrants (‘Malling Jet’), gooseberries (‘Malling Invicta’), raspberries (‘Malling Jewel’) and apples and pears. Fragaria ananassa (the 'pineapple strawberry'), the modern, commercial hybrid of the nation's favourite soft fruit . Its most famous strawberries are ‘Cupid’, ‘Pandora’, ‘Vibrant’, and a new one from last year (EMR’s 100th birthday): ‘Malling Centenary’, the first ever fruit hybrid to be shortlisted for Plant of the Year at Chelsea Flower Show. ‘Here, try one — I bought these this morning from Sainsbury’s,’ says Adam Whitehouse, who along with Abi Johnson has run Malling’s strawberry breeding programme since it began in 1983. It’s a very tasty strawberry. For comparison, Whitehouse has bought a punnet of ‘Elsanta’, the Dutch-bred industry standard popular with farmers for its high yields and ease of growth — but a pantomime villain among strawberry cognoscenti. The ‘Malling Centenary’ looks plumper and more uniform than the ‘Elsanta’, but Whitehouse declares himself unimpressed by this particular sample of his creation. ‘Not as sweet as we’re used to, a bit watery for me.’ Sainsbury’s worked with EMR to develop ‘Malling Centenary’, and Whitehouse and Johnson show me into a huge hothouse where the breeding takes place: thousands of subtly different strawberry plants growing in suspended guttering, their roots expanding in coir (a by-product of the coconut industry) to avoid soil-borne pathogens. ‘We raise 13,000 plants each year and from those we’ll only select 1   per cent to go forward for further trial,’ Whitehouse informs me. ‘We get cheese flavour coming through sometimes, we’ve had black pepper, banana, pineapple, stilton. You have to decide whether there’s a market for them.’ The whittling down to just a single superstar berry takes up to eight years, until the chosen one is presented to the supermarkets to test on consumers. The perky-looking ‘Malling Centenary’ has more breeding than most Derby winners but Johnson says, sadly: ‘Shoppers don’t often look at variety names. ‘We’re trying to promote names because often people go to a supermarket and say, “Oh I had a great punnet of strawberries last week and this week they’re not so good.” But they’re a different variety.’ The breeders’ original remit in the Eighties was to extend the British strawberry season from six weeks. Thanks to selective breeding and the greater use of hothouses and ‘plasticulture’, it can now stretch from March to December. ‘It cuts down on imports,’ says Whitehouse. However, it also means that swathes of countryside are covered in polythene — turning parts of Kent into a sort of giant supermarket plastic fruit tray. ‘Raping the landscape,’ is how Monty Don once described it. The required planning permission means the tunnels stay in one place — and the lack of rotation encourages soil-borne diseases. The frenzied mass consumption of the berries coincides with Wimbledon . Dr Richard Harrison, a molecular biologist at EMR, is looking at breeding soil-pathogen resistance into plants. ‘This is an arms race,’ he says, showing me a £80,000 genome sequencer. ‘It’s all about identifying natural resistance.’ A criticism often levelled at the modern supermarket strawberry — the ubiquitous ‘Elsanta’ in particular — is that they’re tasteless compared to the varieties of yesteryear, although as celebrity greengrocer Charlie Hicks says, it is not entirely the berry’s fault. ‘If it’s grown properly, it can be very tasty,’ he claims. ‘The problem is that, because of the enormous pressure from supermarkets on growers to produce higher yields at lower prices, it means pumping the produce full of water.’ But Dr Mark Else, who heads EMR’s ‘resource efficiency for crop production’ research, has discovered that plants produce better fruit, and with a longer shelf-life and increased health-giving properties (ounce for ounce, strawberries contain more vitamin C than oranges) when they receive up to 80 per cent less water. The fruit are not always the bringer of prosperity for supermarkets, as Tesco discovered in 2012 when it was fined £300,000 for a misleading price-promotion on its ‘half-price’ strawberries. Generally, however, it’s all about finding new ways of marketing this hugely popular product. For example, Marks & Spencer has just started selling baby berries — ones that might otherwise slip through the net by being too small — as ‘Strawbabies’ (genius!). Back at EMR, I ask Adam Whitehouse if he ever buys the fruit to eat at home. ‘No, never!’ he says. ‘But when you go round to people’s houses, they think it’s really funny to serve strawberries.’","Marks & Spencer has just sold 20 million strawberries in seven days .

"By . James Slack . Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the government had listened to the concerns of media groups . Ministers last night abandoned plans that could have created a ‘black hole’ in history by forcing newspapers to delete details of criminal convictions from their online archives. In a victory for freedom of expression, Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the government had listened to the concerns of media groups and the Society of Editors that the move could have a ‘chilling effect’. The controversy stemmed from new rules which are designed to stop jurors from hunting for facts about a case outside the courtroom. In future, it will become a specific offence for a member of a jury to conduct online research, punishable with a prison term. But Mr Grieve was also seeking a new power to issue a so-called ‘take-down’ order to UK newspapers. Once a person was charged with a criminal offence, officials would have been able to identity articles relating to any previous convictions they have – and demand their removal from newspaper websites. Editors who ignored a request would have faced imprisonment or an unlimited fine for contempt of court. In theory, the information could be returned to the archive once the trial is complete, but it was feared some papers would not have the resources, permanently wiping facts from the record. The laws would have applied to UK newspapers, but not the likes of the Huffington Post, which receives millions of hits in Britain. Twitter would not have been covered, either. In a statement yesterday, Mr Grieve said the proposal was being removed from legislation currently passing through Parliament. It followed a meeting with the Society of Editors, Newspaper Society and Media Lawyers Association, who have argued the plans would have a “chilling effect” on press freedom. ‘The Government has considered these concerns very carefully’ Attorney General Dominic Grieve . Announcing the changes, Mr Grieve said in a written ministerial statement: “The proposal was intended to provide the media with a measure of protection and reassurance whilst at the same time enabling the integrity of proceedings to be safeguarded. ‘Although intended as a measure designed to assist and protect the media, the clause has been criticised on the grounds that it gives too much power to the attorney general. ‘These representations were made to me, in particular, by the Society of Editors who in addition do not accept that this clause addresses a pressing problem and have suggested that the current powers available are sufficient to protect proceedings. ‘The Government has considered these concerns very carefully.’ Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors said: ‘When we met the Attorney we said it would be wrong in principle for a member of the Government to have power to order media organisations to take down material. ‘We also told him that it would cause huge practical problems if defence lawyers sought blanket orders to taken down material which could be seen by jurors. ‘We are very pleased that the Attorney has listened to our concerns.’","Dominic Grieve said government listened to the concerns of media groups .

The Tories have taken the lead with 33 per cent support – up five points in a week and two clear of Ed Miliband’s party on 31 per cent, according to yesterday’s poll. Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative deputy chairman whose polling organisation conducts the weekly survey, said the Prime Minister’s  outspoken but doomed protest was behind the surge in popularity. David Cameron was all smiles in the Commons this afternoon after Tory MPs read out the results of the Ashcroft poll showing the Tories ahead of Labour . The boost for Mr Cameron came as angry senior Tories branded European allies ‘liars’, ‘turncoats’ and ‘cowards’ for failing to stick to their initial opposition to Mr Juncker, who was installed as European Commission president on Friday. Mr Cameron came closer to suggesting he would recommend a ‘no’ vote in a referendum on EU membership if he fails to claw back powers from Brussels before 2017. ‘I will always do what’s in the national interest,’ the Prime Minister told the Commons. He conceded that renegotiating a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels would be harder with Mr Juncker at the helm, but insisted he still believed it would be achievable. Though Labour also opposed Mr Juncker, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had demonstrated not ‘splendid isolation’ but ‘utter humiliation’ after being out-voted by 26 to 2 on the question of his candidacy. ‘You returned to Britain on Friday having failed. Not some mild, small failure, but an appalling failure of relationship-building, winning support and delivering for Britain,’ he said. The Conservatives have jumped to five points ahead of Labour in the latest Lord Ashcroft poll. 1,006 adults were  interviewed by telephone between 27¿29 June 2014 . Voters appear to have backed David Cameron's bid to block Euro-fanatic Jean-Claude Juncker, pictured, from the EU's top job . But the Prime Minister branded Mr Miliband ‘weak, opportunistic and wrong’. ‘I have to say I won’t take lectures on negotiation from the people who gave away the veto, who gave away the rebate, who backed down on the budget every year, and who even signed us up to euro bailouts,’ Mr Cameron said. He was particularly scathing about Labour’s decision to sign away Britain’s right to block a candidate for European Commission president in the Nice Treaty of 2001, meaning the issue is now settled by a majority vote. ‘I believe the council could have found a candidate who commanded the support of every member state – that has been the practice on every previous occasion and I think it was a mistake to abandon this approach this time,’ he said. ‘I insisted the European Council took a formal vote, something which doesn’t usually happen. ‘Facing the prospect of being outvoted, some might have swallowed their misgivings and gone with  the flow, but I believe it was important to push the principle and our deep misgivings about this issue right to the end.’ Despite the Conservatives being ahead in the voting intention, 32 per cent want a Labour government against 25 per cent favouring a Tory government in 2015 . The Prime Minister branded Mr Miliband 'weak, opportunistic and wrong' Mr Cameron said it was a ‘bad day for Europe’ which risked undermining national parliaments, but welcomed the decision to review the process the next time the position becomes vacant. He won strong support from the Tory backbenches. Former minister Stephen O’Brien said: ‘In a previous Battle of Britain, we saw off many Junkers.’ Sir Bill Cash said the Prime Minister had been ‘completely right’ in his approach to Mr Juncker’s appointment. Tory MP Margot James said Mr Juncker was a ‘marked man’ after the events of recent days. Senior allies of Angela Merkel  yesterday insisted a British exit from the EU would be a ‘disaster’. German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, regarded as Mrs Merkel’s  closest ally, said the UK was ‘indispensable’ to the EU and that everything should be done to ensure the country remained a member state. ‘The EU without the UK is absolutely  not acceptable – unimaginable,’ he told the Financial Times. Dr Michael Fuchs, a leading member of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats, told the BBC: ‘It would be a disaster if Britain is going to step out of the EU in Brussels. I cannot imagine an EU without Britain.’ Tory MPs shouted ‘because they’re liars’ when Mr Miliband asked why German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other EU leaders who were initially resistant to Mr Juncker’s candidacy had changed their minds. Peter Lilley, a Eurosceptic former Cabinet minister who is one of several senior Tories tipped as Britain’s next EU commissioner, praised Mr Cameron for ‘not turning tail while our so-called allies were turning coats’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt attacked the ‘cowardice’ of ‘other leaders who weren’t prepared to stand up in public and say the things they had said in private’. Lord Ashcroft said Mr Cameron’s approach appeared to have resonated with voters. ‘The poll was taken between Friday afternoon and Sunday evening, when political news was dominated by David Cameron’s stance against the appointment of the new European Commission president.’ A separate ComRes poll commissioned by ITV News found that the proportion of Britons who would vote for the UK to stay in the EU has fallen by four percentage points in a week. The figure has dropped to 36 per cent, while 43 per cent would vote for Britain to leave the EU. Few voters believe any of the main party leaders come across as ‘someone like me’, according to a new poll. A ComRes survey found that Ukip leader Nigel Farage was seen as a kindred spirit by only 14 per cent of voters, just ahead of Ed Miliband on 13 per cent, David Cameron on 12 per cent and Nick Clegg on 8 per cent. The Prime Minister is viewed as the most intelligent, statesman-like political leader in Britain, while the Ukip leader is the weirdest and most stupid.","Tories take polls lead with 33 per cent support - up five points in a week .

"By . Jason Groves . The BBC has been accused of anti-Government bias after a documentary on police spending cuts failed to mention big reductions in recorded crime. The BBC Two documentary Police Under Pressure painted a bleak picture of policing in Sheffield, with over-stretched officers struggling to cope with a rising tide of anti-social behaviour. The producers of the programme, which was screened last week, posed the question: ‘With cuts biting ever deeper, is it time to accept that there are certain things the police just can’t afford to do?’ Negative view: The BBC2 documentary Police Under Pressure, which features WPC Christine Fisher, PCSO Deb Parker, painted a bleak picture of policing in Sheffield . But senior Tories pointed out that the hour-long programme made no mention of the fact that crime has fallen since 2010, both nationally and in South Yorkshire, where recorded crime has dropped by 16 per cent. The programme also failed to give any broader explanation of why police budgets have had to be cut as part of the Coalition’s drive to tackle the huge budget deficit left behind by Labour. It was made by the production firm Rare Day, whose founder Peter Dale has close links to the Institute of Public Policy Research, which is playing a key role in generating ideas for Labour’s next manifesto. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It is very disappointing to see the BBC once again producing programmes that are distorted and lacking in any balance. 'We all know the police have had to take their fair share of cuts following Labour’s great recession, but at the same time they have cut crime by 16 per cent and many front line police jobs have been protected by Chief Constables. Critique: There was no mention of the fact that crime has fallen since 2010, both nationally and in South Yorkshire, during the hour-long documentary, Tory MP Rob Wilson said . ‘It looks like the bias may be down . to the fact that the production company has very close links to Labour’s . favourite think tank the IPPR. 'All the same, the BBC should know . better and certainly it is out of keeping with one of its fundamental . founding principles to be impartial.’ Fellow Tory Philip Davies, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said there was no place for such ‘one-sided’ documentaries on the BBC. Critique: Conservative MP Rob Wilson accused the documentary of being 'distorted and lacking in any balance' Mr Davies said: ‘I don’t particularly support cuts to the police budget myself, and I have voted against them. But the BBC has a fundamental duty to be impartial and balanced. It is unacceptable for it to be putting out one-sided, biased programmes. ‘I have no problem with them making a programme about police cuts, but they have to also explain why this Government is having to make these cuts to public spending and they should explain what has happened to crime.’ The documentary chronicled community tensions in east Sheffield following a big influx of Roma immigrants from Slovakia. The presenter said the police were ‘under pressure like never before’, and said that in South Yorkshire ‘the entire neighbourhood policing budget is now under review’. The entire programme is viewed through the prism of real term budget cuts totalling 11.5 per cent, which have resulted in a seven per cent reduction in officer numbers in South Yorkshire. The presenter says parts of Sheffield have been ‘starved’ of police patrols, and warns that a senior commander ‘just doesn’t have the officers’ to cope with the scale of the challenge. The documentary showed some police officers complaining about the impact of cutbacks. But officers were also recorded complaining that the main issue holding them back was a lack of legal powers to deal with behaviour by Roma behaviour that angered other members of the local community, but which fell short of the legal definition of anti-social behaviour. The BBC last night defended the broadcast, which was watched by more than a million people. A spokesman said the second part of the documentary, which was due to be screened last night, did mention the national crime fall.’ The spokesman added: ‘We are confident that these observational films following the work of South Yorkshire Police adhere to our editorial guidelines and we have received only two complaints from an audience of 1.2 million. ‘Peter Dale has an excellent reputation for producing high quality documentaries. He has had very limited contact with the IPPR and has had no involvement with their crime and justice policy work.’","Documentary Policing Under Pressure accused of anti-government bias .

"By . James Rush . A driver lost control of his car and ploughed straight through the side of a house and into a living room, without leaving a single piece of debris on the road. The driver and all three passengers, as well as the homeowner and her daughter, had to be taken to hospital following the incident in the market town of Louth, Lincolnshire.

Six people were left injured after a car crashed straight through the wall of a house and into a living room . Pictures taken at the scene show the vehicle's front end embedded in the side of the £120,000 detached house . Emergency services were called to the house following the incident at 7.25pm on Friday. The seriously injured 43-year-old owner of the property had to be airlifted to hospital with broken bones and internal injuries, where she is expected to remain 'for some weeks'. Her 17-year-old daughter, who was also in the house at the time, was also injured and taken to hospital for treatment. A 24 year-old woman from Louth, who was a passenger in the car, is still at Hull Royal Infirmary being treated for fractures. The driver of the vehicle, a 28 year-old man, also from Louth, has since been discharged from hospital. Two passengers, a 23 year-old man and a 26 year-old woman from Manby, Lincsolnshire, also required hospital treatment before also being discharged. Emergency services were called to the market town of Louth, Linconshire, after a red seat Leon smashed through a wall on Friday evening . A neighbour living near to the property . today said: 'I thought it was an optical illusion at the time - the car . had gone straight through the wall but not a brick looked out of place. 'I am amazed that nobody was killed. It must have been going at some speed to go straight through the wall like that.'

"By . Andrew Levy . Daniel Ubani is confronted by his victim's sons at a medical conference in Lindau, Germany . A foreign doctor who killed a patient while working in Britain was branded ‘grotesque’ yesterday for taking legal action against one of his victim’s sons because he called him an ‘animal’. Daniel Ubani was on his first shift in the UK providing out-of-hours cover when he injected David Gray, 70, with ten times the safe amount of pain killer diamorphine. An inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor English. The Nigerian-born medic was struck off by the General Medical Council but was able to continue working in his adopted country of Germany after the authorities there let him off with a nine-month suspended prison sentence and a small fine. Mr Gray’s furious sons Stuart and Rory, confronted their father’s killer at a medical conference in Lindau, Bavaria, where he was plugging his cosmetic surgery clinic the day after snubbing the GMC hearing. In dramatic scenes, the brothers called him a ‘charlatan’ and a ‘killer’ and demanded he explain his ‘colossal blunder’. Shortly before they were thrown out, Rory muttered to his brother that Ubani was an ‘animal’ – something he believes he was unaware of until it was mentioned in legal documents long after the incident. Ubani, 71, is now suing Rory, who lives in Germany and works for the country’s weather office, for lost earnings. Daniel Ubani on his first shift in the UK, David Gray (left), 70, with ten times the safe amount of pain killer diamorphine; Rory Grey (right) arriving at court in the German town of Kempton to watch the trial of Daniel Ubani who killed his father David . He is claiming €1,148 for the loss of a speaking fee after leaving the conference in 2010 and €2,250 for legal fees – a total of around £2,700. The action also includes a demand that Rory will not describe him as an animal in future after he ignored a lawyers letter insisting he confirmed in writing he would not use the word again. Bizarrely, the case is almost identical to one Ubani brought against the Grays in August 2010. On that occasion his claim for compensation was thrown out and he had to pay the brothers’ legal costs. The German court also ruled they could refer to him as a ‘charlatan and a killer’ but not describe him as an ‘animal’. Ubani later lost an appeal at Munich High Court. Rory, 49, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is grotesque. He has already taken this to court once and lost everything except the bit about calling him an animal. He wasn’t even aware of that until I produced a transcript from a camcorder recording I made at the conference. ‘Four years later his lawyer sent me a letter demanding I promised to pay him a lot of money if I ever called him that again. I am not going to write to him. This is the man who came into my dad’s house and killed him. ‘I don’t understand the case and my lawyer can’t understand it either. It’s an abuse of the legal process. ‘Ubani’s just trying to extract money from the family of his victim. He seems to think he’s invincible since the German authorities took action that stopped him being prosecuted in the UK.’ Stuart Gray, a 54-year-old GP from Worcestershire, added: ‘This guy is obviously morally and ethically corrupt. ‘He killed my father through gross negligence but obviously he is not happy with that and wants to take my brother to court as he claims he missed a meal and payment for a conference. I consider him to be a weasel.’ The case is due to be heard on Monday at Lindau District Court, although Rory Gray’s lawyer has requested an adjournment.David Gray’s death in 2008 prompted a review of out-of-hours services, . particularly a loophole which allowed doctors from the EU with poor English to practise here because of rules on the free movement of labour. Last week new laws were introduced that allow the GMC to withhold a licence if they have concerns about an individual. The regulator wrote to the Grays congratulating them on their efforts to have the law changed. Tanja Schubert, its head of European and international affairs, said: ‘We could not have achieved this without your support.’","On first shift in UK Dr Daniel Ubani over-prescribed diamorphine to David Gray, 70, causing his death .

"By . Sam Webb . A pub has apologised after a barman refused to serve a group of local election campaigners because they supported Ukip. Stonegate Pubs have also offered a free meal to the stunned half dozen at the Rectory in Purley, south London, after a member of staff called them 'disgusting'. Local candidate Georgina Guillem was campaigning with Kathleen Garner and four supporters in the run up to May’s local elections, when they decided to have a drink. The group, five aged over-65 and one man in his 30s, took off their rosettes and packed their stuff away before going inside the high street pub. Spat: A barman at this south London pub refused to serve a group of local election campaigners because they supported Ukip, even calling them 'disgusting' Ms Garner said: 'Georgina walked up to the bar to get some drinks and he just said, ""You are Ukip, you are disgusting"", and refused to serve her. 'I could not believe it and went up to the bar and he said to me again ""you are disgusting"". 'It is the thought police and even if it is legal, it is certainly not an acceptable way to behave. You should certainly not be able to discriminate against people on grounds of their politics. 'The way you think is the way you think and life is going to become very unpleasant if people are going to discriminate against you for that. 'And it is not even how you think - but the way others think you think.' She complained to Stonegate Pubs, which last week offered an apology and a free meal. A Stonegate spokesman said an investigation had taken place and added: 'We would like to make clear the company has no affiliations to any political party.' He added that the member of staff was disciplined. Ms Guillem polled just 552 votes in the local vote and came third.","Georgine Guillem went into the south London pub with campaigners .

"By . Associated Press . North Korea fired two short-range missiles into its eastern waters on Sunday, a South Korean official said, an apparent test fire that comes just days after the country tested what it called new precision-guided missiles. The Defense Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing department rules, said the missiles were fired from Wonsan and are presumed to be short-range ballistic missiles. The official said North Korea fired the missiles without designating no-sail zones, which the South Korean military views as provocative. South Korean media quoted officials as saying the projectiles appeared to be Scud missiles. Scroll down for video . People watch a TV news program showing the missile launch conducted by North Korea, at Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea on Sunday . In this photo from April North Korean leader Kim Jong Un holds up a parliament membership certificate during the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang, North Korea . North Korea regularly test-fires missiles and artillery, both to refine its weapons and to express its anger over various developments in Seoul and Washington. North Korea has in recent days criticized alleged South Korean artillery firing drills near a disputed maritime boundary in the Yellow Sea that has been the scene of several bloody skirmishes between the rival nations in recent years. The missile displays also come days before the leader of North Korea's only major ally, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is set to meet with South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Seoul and Beijing have long pressed North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. North Korea said Friday that leader Kim Jong Un guided test launches of a newly developed precision-guided missiles, in a likely reference to three short-range projectiles South Korean officials say the North fired a day earlier. It's not possible to tell if this assertion about the new missiles is an exaggeration, something North Korea has frequently done in the past when trumpeting its military capability, analysts say. This undated picture released on June 27, 2014 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un inspecting the test firing of a newly developed, high-precision tactical guided missile at undisclosed location . A man watches a TV news program showing file footage of a North Korean rocket carried during a military parade at Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea on Sunday . Its army is one of the world's largest but is believed to be badly supplied and forced to use outdated equipment. Still, the impoverished North devotes much of its scarce resources to missile and nuclear programs that threaten South Korea, Japan and tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the region. Outside analysts say North Korea has developed a handful of crude nuclear devices and is working toward building a warhead small enough to mount on a long-range missile, although most experts say that goal may take years to achieve. After a brief period of warming ties earlier this year, animosity has risen on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has in recent months threatened South Korea's president, calling her a prostitute, and the South has vowed to hit North Korea hard if provoked. Pyongyang conducted a series of missile and artillery tests earlier this year in response to annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises it says it considers preparations for an invasion. North Korea also test-fired two medium-range ballistic missiles and exchanged artillery fire with South Korea near the disputed boundary in the Yellow Sea. On Thursday, North Korea's army accused South Korea of firing shells into the North's waters near the sea boundary. Both Koreas routinely conduct artillery drills near the maritime boundary. A North Korean artillery attack in 2010 killed four South Koreans on a front-line Yellow Sea island. The Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty.

"By . Mark Duell . Death: Georgina Taylor, 22, excitedly raced to get her 13-month-old son Rory to a modelling assignment when she crashed at 85mph on a motorway . A young mother was killed in a car crash as she excitedly raced to get her 13-month-old son to a modelling assignment, an inquest has heard. Georgina Taylor, 22, of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, was so delighted at toddler Rory being picked for a photo shoot at a child model agency, she hit speeds of up to 85mph in her silver BMW Mini Cooper on a motorway. But as she tried to negotiate a bend, Miss Taylor suddenly lost control of the vehicle and went into a 360-degree spiral before ploughing into a tree on an embankment. As her car began to catch fire, passing motorists stopped and pulled Rory clear from the booster seat inside of the wreckage of the vehicle. Miraculously, the boy escaped with a cut and abrasion to his head but his blonde haired mother died in the driver’s seat from multiple injuries, despite efforts to save her. Inquiries revealed Miss Taylor had only passed her driving test just 15 days before the tragedy and the car’s tyres were ‘significantly deflated.’ Her inexperience with driving meant she was unable to properly negotiate a bend on the A627 near Oldham, Greater Manchester, at high speed, the inquest was told. Rory, now 18 months old, lives with his grandparents and is still said to be too young to understand what happened to his mother. An inquest was told Miss Taylor, who was known as ‘George’ by her family and friends, had been a talented dancer at school and a keen horse rider before enrolling on a course at Leeds Trinity University to study maths and psychology. Her mother Sally Taylor told the hearing: ‘When she was at primary school she began to blossom becoming involved in modern tap dance and ballet. She also did gymnastics and swing. Mother and son: Miss Taylor with Rory at Lightwater Valley theme park in Ripon, North Yorkshire. Miraculously, the boy escaped the crash with a cut and abrasion to his head . ‘She passed her 11-plus and went to the local grammar school. She excelled in dance, receiving honours.’ ‘Due to fortuitous events by reason of her brother partaking in horse riding lessons, she began having weekly lessons too. ‘The lessons became a regular event in her life and she soon met knew friends and became preoccupied doing everything at the stables, particularly on Sundays grooming and mucking out. ‘At school she was particularly adept at maths and sports such as netball and hockey and she did really well in her GSCEs, attaining nine passes.’ In November 2012 Rory was born, and by the summer of 2013 Miss Taylor had applied to Leeds Trinity where she had to complete and entrance years because she had not finished her A-levels. Her mother said: ‘I think she was finding it difficult to cope as a young mother and student. Her baby was unwell sometimes with chest infections and hospital appointments. ‘Together with her studies, effectively Georgina had mapped out her future with her son and the heart of it.’ In the two months before her death, Miss Taylor threw a big event for to mark Rory’s first birthday with friends and family attending. Known as 'George': Miss Taylor had been a talented dancer at school and a keen horse rider before enrolling on a course at Leeds Trinity University to study maths and psychology . Her mother added: ‘We were all together at the grandparents for Christmas and Boxing Day and Georgina was the life and soul of the party. ‘The next event was meant to be Rory’s christening but we couldn’t get everybody in the country at the same time.’ The hearing in Heywood, Greater . Manchester, was told Miss Taylor had started driving in 2012 and . obtaining a provisional licence before passing her driving test at the . third attempt on January 10 this year. 'I ran up to the car and could see a baby looking at me from the back seat... I got down on my knees and started shovelling mud with my hands to put the fire out' Shaun Pattinson, witness . Her mother’s partner often accompanied her in the Mini car and said she always drove ‘carefully and competently’ and never took any unnecessary risks whilst driving. They even took the £2,000 Mini on a 200-mile run to Cambridge to see how the car faired on long journeys - and soon after the vehicle was put through an MOT costing £1,200. Tragedy struck on January 25 this year when Georgina had been offered the chance to take her son to a professional photo shoot with a child model agency in Macclesfield, Cheshire. She was said by Mrs Taylor be ‘so excited’ that her son had been picked for the photoshoot and ‘dedicated’ the weekend to the toddler. But on her way to the assignment she began speeding - even though she was not late for the shoot. Crash location: Her inexperience with driving meant she was unable to properly negotiate a bend on the A627 (file picture) near Oldham, Greater Manchester, at high speed . Eyewitness Simon Thompson, a joiner from Rochdale who driving his Volkswagen vehicle on the motorway, said: ‘I was driving at around 70mph and that was when the Mini overtook me and it came passed quite fast. ‘I did not think much of it at first. It was going quite fast and was increasing in speed. As it got to the side of the Mondeo in front of me I saw the back of the Mini swing out and skid out of control. It was awful to see.’ Mondeo driver Paul Herdman, who was on . his way to Manchester Airport from Rochdale, said: ‘I first noticed a . noise - there was a sound of skidding and squeaking. 'It was quite miraculous that no one else sustained a life threatening injury. What occurred will remain with all the family for the rest of your lives' Simon Nelson, senior coroner . ‘I was travelling at 70mph and she must have been doing 15mph more than me. The mini was just 6ft in front of me when it spun across into my land before continuing to do a 360-degree turn toward the hard shoulder. It was surreal.’ Passing motorist and break-down recovery driver Shaun Pattinson said: ‘I ran up to the car and could see a baby looking at me from the back seat. ‘It was not clear if anyone else was in the car at this point as the roof was completely crushed in, not far from the baby’s head. I reached in unfastened the baby straps and lifted him out. ‘I had to be careful because of the broken window. I handed him to someone and went back to the embankment and people were shouting “she is gone, she is gone, leave it”.’ He then realised that the back of the car was smoking and added: ‘I got down on my knees and started shovelling mud with my hands to put the fire out. I was trying to do it as fast as I could. 'So excited': Inquiries revealed Miss Taylor had only passed her driving test just 15 days before the tragedy and the car's tyres were 'significantly deflated' ‘Eventually someone turned up with an extinguisher. My heart was ten to the dozen and it was such a relief to hear emergency services coming.’ PC Paul Standish, a forensic collision investigation officer, who examined the car said: ‘Although the MOT was met, a mixture of tyres, half winter and half budget tyres, and general wear and tear, may have compromised the handling of the car. ‘The tyres were significantly 36 per cent deflated and in the circumstances it is possible that as Georgina managed the left hand corner she under steered. 'Together with her studies, effectively Georgina had mapped out her future with her son and the heart of it' Sally Taylor, Georgina Taylor's mother . ‘A combination of an excess of the speed limit and maintenance of the car and a lack of motorway driving experience may have led to this tragic accident.’ Senior coroner Simon Nelson recorded her death as a road traffic collision and told Mrs Taylor: ‘I mentioned how miraculous, as I think that is the only word for it, that your grandson came out of this completely unscathed. ‘I hope when he is old enough to understand you will tell him about his mother who sadly is no longer here to care for him. As she passed her driving test she would have means to be a free spirit. ‘She was able to travel. I appreciate that weekend was devoted to her son. I do not perceive this is a scenario of someone being late for an appointment and taking risks to make up time. ‘I put her speeding simply down to a lack of experience. I cannot ignore the fact that speed was a significant factor in this incident. It was quite miraculous that no one else sustained a life threatening injury. ‘What occurred will remain with all the family for the rest of your lives. She had an eventful life.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A village has unveiled a new bus shelter - despite having NO bus services there for the past six years. The smart new concrete structure was specially built for the people of Bissoe, Cornwall for free by a generous local construction firm. However anyone who uses it faces a long wait as the last bus stopped in the village in 2008. Grateful residents hope the new shelter will be a sign that their old service could one day be restored. The Cornish village of Bissoe, near Truro, has been given a new bus shelter despite having no bus service . Simon Lucas, the production manager at Cornish Concrete Products, said that his company was just doing its bit for the local community. He said: ‘The old bus shelter was falling down and we thought it was starting to become a bit of a hazard. ‘We approached the council and asked if we could provide a new one for nothing. ‘They agreed but said it would have to be similar to the old one, so we made one the same size but carved the word Bissoe into the front of it. ‘There’s no real focal point to the village when people come here, so we thought this would mark it out. ‘We are aware there are no buses coming here at the moment but we’d like to hope that the new shelter might encourage them to come back. ‘It would certainly help us if they did, as it would help our employees to get to work more easily if there was a bus service.’ Villagers launched a Facebook campaign last year begging bus companies to divert the region’s services so they stop in Bissoe - but their pleas have so far gone unanswered. Local resident Nicholas Richards said: ‘It’s nice that Cornish Concrete Products have done it out of goodwill and it’s nice the way that they have done it. ‘But it seems quite ironic that we have this new shelter but no bus services.’","Local firm generously replaced 'shabby' shelter for Bissoe, Cornwall .

A math teacher has been jailed for at least eight years after having sex with four teenage pupils in her class. Jamila Williams, 36, admitted four counts of criminal sex conduct relating to sexual encounters with two 15-year-olds and two 16-year-old boys. In return for her guilty plea, three more criminal sexual conduct charges against her were dropped. At a hearing in Michigan this week, Williams was told she will serve a minimum term of eight years but that her sentence could be extended to 15 years. Williams taught at the Grand Rapids University Prep Academy, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. She was charged this year after two male students, aged 15 and 16, told police they had a series of inappropriate encounters with the teacher. After the original reports became public, a further two pupils came forward and reported similar stories. Investigators said Williams had sex with the boys in a string of different locations which included one alleged victim's home, a restaurant and in a car. Williams had been a member of staff at the Grand Rapids University Prep Academy for the last four years. She has four children of her own and two stepchildren between the ages of three and 19.

A motorist who caused a rail crash after jumping a level crossing in his BMW has escaped with a fine of just £250. Jonathan Dawson, 46, could have caused a serious disaster after he failed to hear a screaming warning siren and drove straight through a level crossing . in Woodbridge, Suffolk. The train driver, who was travelling at about 15mph, was forced to slam on the brakes but still smashed into Dawson's 4x4, a court heard yesterday. Dawson, who admitted careless driving at Ipswich Crown Court, amazingly escaped unhurt. Judge . David Goodin said last December's crash at the Lime Kiln crossing in . Woodbridge, Suffolk, was caused by Dawson's 'momentary inattention'. Judge . Goodin told him: 'It is a matter of fortune that you are standing here . at all. You could have been killed or people on the train injured or . worse. 'The consequences weren't devastating but were potentially very serious indeed.' Mr Duah said Dawson admitted he knew the crossing well as he used it daily to drive to a house he was building. He had his car radio on and his sun visor down and did not hear the warning siren or see the flashing lights. Michael . Bromley-Martin, QC, defending, said the crossing had been the subject . of a report by the Rail Accident Investigation branch in July. Mr Bromley-Martin said: 'These barrier-less crossings are particularly dangerous. On that everyone agrees.' Crash: Jonathan Dawson said he was 'momentarily distracted' as he drove onto the tracks causing the train driver to slam on the brakes . He said seven collisions had happened there in the past ten years, and was ninth most dangerous in a list of 113 crossings nationwide recommended for upgrading. Mr Bromley-Martin said that did not excuse Dawson's 'momentary loss of judgement' crossing the junction when the lights and siren were operating. Dawson, of Woodbridge, was fined £250, and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. He was also given four penalty points on his licence. Afterwards Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey said: 'I don't know all the details... but it does sound quite lenient.' The Tory MP added: 'I think there does need to be a message that level crossings should be treated with great care.' Lucky escape: Jonathan Dawson ignored flashing lights and warning signs as he tried to jump the level crossing in Woodbridge, Suffolk . A Network Rail spokesman said: 'All too often we see people putting their lives and the lives of others at risk at level crossings, either through deliberately ignoring safety warnings, complacency or sheer ignorance. 'We will continue to work with the police and local authorities to highlight the dangers of crossing misuse and hope that people will learn lessons from other people's mistakes.' A Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents spokesman said: 'The driver was very fortunate to avoid serious injury.' 'Level crossings are dangerous places and hopefully this case will serve as a warning to people that they should be used with great care.'","Jonathan Dawson, 46, said he had the radio on so didn't hear the screaming warning siren ."

His name does not appear on the entry lists for either the John Deere Classic in America or the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen the week before golf’s third Major of the year. And as yet, Woods’ management team has not contacted The European Club to make available their facilities which he has used in the past to hone his links skills before The Open. But Woods is definitely looking forward to going back and playing on the Wirral.

"By . Mike Dawes . Shane Warne has launched another stinging attack on Alastair Cook, whom he believes should either step down as England captain or take a break from cricket. The former record-breaking Australia spinner has been Cook's most outspoken critic in the last 12 months, and has clearly got under the skin of the Essex left-hander, who stated last week that he believes the judgements are becoming personal. But in the wake of England's first ever Test series defeat to Sri Lanka on home soil, just a matter of months after their Ashes humiliation, Warne thinks Cook, whose own form has stagnated in the last year, needs to step aside . VIDEO Scroll to the bottom to see Warne sing an Usher song with his daughter . Poor spell: Warne criticised Cook's captaincy in the second Test at Headingly as the worst he'd ever seen . Despair: England lost the series when James Anderson was out with two balls left on the final day . Writing in his column for the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'There are three ways to go with Alastair 'Cooked' Cook. Everyone sticks their head in the sand and just allows things to keep going as is and hope he finds form with the bat and by a miracle discovers some tactical brains from somewhere. 'Two: he steps down from the captaincy to concentrate on his batting. 'Three: the most radical of all, he has a complete break away from the game. 'Lots of people, including me, think it is time for him to step down as captain. VIDEO Cook refuses to step down . Failed again: Disappointing form with the bat has only led to greater pressure on Cook's captaincy . Decisions: Warne criticised England's bowling on the fourth day at Headingley when Cook stuck with pace . Spin king: Moeen Ali, England's primary spinner, is only a part-time bowler and Cook appeared not to trust him . VIDEO I'm gutted for Jimmy and the lads - Moeen . 'The most disappointing thing for me is that he has not learned or improved after a horrible 5-0 drumming in Australia, in fact he has got worse. 'He is not thinking straight. He is not there. He is confused. He does not know what to do and because he is in a rut with his form it makes life a lot worse. 'You just cannot captain a team in transition in that frame of mind.' England suffered a 100-run defeat to the Sri Lankans at Headingley on Tuesday to lose the two-Test Investec series after the tourists escaped with a draw in the opening match at Lord's. Much of the damage in Leeds was done on day four as Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews was allowed to compile a wonderful 160 to build his side's lead to 350 before their bowlers reduced Cook's men to 57 for five before the close. While England came within two balls of securing a draw on the final day, thanks to Moeen Ali's century and a last-wicket stand with James Anderson, Warne does not think that should hide Cook's shortcomings as captain. Driving force: Angelo Matthews' superb century took the game away from England on day four . Historic: The series victory, inspired by Matthews, was Sri Lanka's first ever on English soil . 'On Monday at Headingley I witnessed the worst day of captaincy I have ever seen at international level in almost 25 years in the game. 'It was horrific, and I am not the only one singing that tune,' said Warne, who is the second highest Test wicket-taker of all time with 708 scalps. 'He just does not get it. Everyone watching could see the game needed a change of pace; bowl the spinner or make the seamers try and actually get Angelo Mathews out. 'You just cannot bowl the same stuff over after over like he did - good captains try things and are proactive, not hopeful.'. Warne also refuted Cook's suggestions that his negative comments were a personal attack as a means to undermine the 29-year-old's authority. VIDEO Defeat is tough to take - Cook . Take a break: Warne has called on Cook to relinquish the captaincy or take some time away from cricket . He said: 'This column is not a personal attack and never has been, Alastair. Mate, you need to improve tactically or England need someone else in the job. 'And I am not the only one saying it. Please speak to (former England captains) Michael Vaughan, Nasser Hussain and other successful captains who were tough, ruthless and got it. 'Also, if I was an Aussie cheerleader, as the ECB thinks I am, I would not be criticising Cook. 'I would be saying keep him in the job because that would be the best thing for Australia during the Ashes next year. 'I have always been open to talking to Alastair, like I always have with any other player from any country, if they wanted a chat over a beer.'","Former Australian skipper calls for England captain to step down .

"By . Associated Press . Rescuers have pulled two survivors from the huge pile of broken concrete left by the collapse of an 11-storey apartment building that killed at least 19 in the south of India. Seasonal monsoon rains were complicating the search, but rescuers said they hoped to find more people alive after rescuing a woman and a man on Monday - two days after the collapse. Three backhoes were working to clear the area, but more than 100 rescuers wearing hard hats on site were trying to avoid upsetting the debris, which was in a huge pile of dust, crumbled concrete, slabs and twisted iron girders that could still settle further. Instead, they were listening for sounds to help guide their search. Scroll down for video . Rescue workers carry a survivor pulled from the wreckage of the collapse apartment building in Chennai . Diggers clear rubble from the wreckage but are moving slowly for fear of shifting the debris dramatically . 'We heard voices coming from the debris' on Sunday, said S.P. Selvan of the National Disaster Response Force. 'Following the voice ... one lady was retrieved alive yesterday evening.' So far, 39 people have been rescued, and police have arrested six construction company officials for alleged criminal negligence and violation of building codes. The building crashed down Saturday night while in the final stages of construction outside Chennai, the south-coast capital of Tamil Nadu state. Nearly 90 contract workers were believed to have been in the basement collecting wages. Building collapses are common in India, where high housing demand and lax regulations have encouraged builders to cut corners, use substandard materials or add unauthorized floors. Five building firm bosses have been arrested over the disaster, which happened when the 11-storey building was still under contruction. It was the second deadly building collapse in India within a single day as the heavy monsoon rains had a devastating effect on shoddily built structures. Disaster: 11 people died when a block of flats which was under construction collapsed . Mission: Dozens of rescuers were deployed at the scene to save workers who were trapped inside . Victim: An injured woman is removed from the rubble of the building and taken to hospital . Rescuers at the scene of the disaster in the Chennai suburb of Porur were today using gas cutters and shovels to hunt for those believed still to be trapped inside. The building came down yesterday at a time when 90 contract workers were in the basement collecting their wages. Four people were found dead in the ruins and seven more were taken to hospital where they later died. As many as 60 people could still be trapped in the rubble, according to police, with some heard crying out for help. Operation: Diggers were used to clear large concrete blocks and allow rescuers to dig deeper . Help: One survivor who was able to stand up received the attention of the volunteers . Officials used cranes to shift concrete blocks before dozens of rescuers deployed smallers tools to dig deeper inside. One of the builders, Balaguru, suggested that the building might have collapsed after being struck by lightning. 'Usually, once the construction gets over we install the equipment to prevent the building from a thunder strike. It was nearing completion,' he said. A police officer said that five officials from Prime Sristi, the construction firm building the complex, had been arrested as part of the investigation into the tragedy. Building: The complex was located in the suburb of Porur on the outskirts of Chennai . Earlier on Saturday, 11 people were killed when a smaller building collapsed in a slum area of the country's capital New Delhi. The spate of building collapses has been blamed on runaway demand for housing and weak regulations, which encourage builders to cut corners and use substandard materials. Last year, India saw its worst building disaster for decades when an eight-story complex in Mumbai collapsed, killing 74 people.","The 11-storey block of flats was being built in a suburb of the Indian city .

"By . Emily Crane . He started life sharing a tent in the Australian outback with his 10 siblings but today Richard Farleigh is one of the best-paid investors in the world. Mr Farleigh, who was able to retire at just 34 years of age, admits to saving 'like a squirrel' when he started out as a banker in his twenties because he was sure his success wouldn't last. The 53-year-old, who started without a cent after being born into a poor family in the country town of Kyabram, 200km northwest of Melbourne, said he just managed to learn how money worked along the way. Richard Farleigh, who is one of the best-paid investors in the world, started life sharing a tent in the Australian outback . Mr Farleigh and his siblings were taken into care when he was three because his father was a violent alcoholic - he was placed into a foster home in Peakhurst, southwest of Sydney, in the 1960s. 'After coming through the foster system… luckily, I won a scholarship to study economics and maths at (the University of NSW), which changed my life. My knowledge of how money works increased along the way,' Mr Farleigh told the UK's Telegraph. When he accepted a job at the leading investment bank at the time, Bankers Trust Australia, Mr Farleigh told of how his boss said 'if he makes a buck for the bank, I'll walk backwards to Bourke'. Mr Farleigh was placed into a foster home in Peakhurst, southwest of Sydney, in the 1960s . Mr Farleigh, pictured here on his father's shoulders, was taken into care with his siblings when he was three because his dad was a violent alcoholic . 'And Bourke is a long way from Sydney. As a child I was shy. Even by the time I became an investment banker in my early 20s I didn't have a positive personality – I wasn't very dynamic. We have a laugh about it now, as I ended up being the highest earner for the bank,' he said. Mr Farleigh retired from the finance world when he was 'probably one of the highest-paid hedge fund managers in the world' – just 20 years after he made his first dollar hustling chess at Sydney's Hyde Park when he was 14. He moved to Monaco to start his retirement but was back in the business world just two years later when he decided to move to London. In London Mr Farleigh stepped up his investments, including ownership of a private members club in the 90s, Home House, which was frequented by the likes of Madonna . It was in London that he stepped up his investments, including ownership of a private members club in the 90s, Home House, which was frequented by the likes of Madonna. He decided to increase his investments when he appeared on the business-related game show, Dragons' Den, in 2006. Mr Farleigh invested in a company called Levi Roots' Reggae Reggae Sauce on the show and sold his stake for ten-times return 12 months later. Mr Farleigh continues to invest and he said his foster parents were still bewildered by his success today. 'I think they were a bit bemused by it because they and my school thought I was backward when I was young,' he said.

"By . Freya Noble . A woman in West Australia has been fined $5000 and banned from having contact with any animal for 10 years after her dog was found close to death due to being severely neglected. In October the RSPCA received a complaint about a skinny Collie cross dog called Milly who was seen in her front yard frothing from the mouth. A City of Kalgoorlie/Boulder Ranger took the dog to a local vet hospital where Milly was found to be suffering from multiple conditions including maggots in her anus, deeply sunken eyes, pale gums, a weak pulse and rapid respiration. Local residents in Kalgoorlie found Milly the Collie cross dog in a terrible state in her front yard frothing from the mouth in October . On Monday the dog's owner Janine Helen Giblin appeared in Kalgoorlie Magistrates court and was ordered to pay $1000 in addition to her fine, after it was revealed she hadn't taken her dog to the vet for over a decade. Milly was originally spotted by local residents in Boulder in Kalgoorlie lying in the sun without shade or water trying to drag herself towards a bucket of water a metre away. The caller who contacted the RSPCA said the dog was also emanating little barks that sounded like cries, and that there was food scattered around the yard but it was covered in flies. On Monday is was ruled at the Kalgoorlie Magistrates Court the dog's owner Janine Helen Giblin would be fined $5000 and banned from any contact with animals for 10 years . Photographs and video were taken of Milly by members of the public before one took the sick puppy to their home and awaited assistance. Milly is said to have had a terrible stench, was unresponsive to noise or movement and would not respond when people tried to give her water through a syringe. The dog was then taken to a local vet and during examination, Milly lifted her head but collapsed. The veterinarian made the decision to euthanase her on humane grounds, saying she was in severe pain and had been neglected over a long period of time. 'There is no excuse for letting a dog just rot away like this,' RSPCA chief inspector Amanda Swift said. When she was discovered, Milly (not pictured) had maggots growing in her and was so ill she had to be euthanised .

"By . Stephen Wright . and Nick Fagge . The former RAF pilot who stumbled  on the French Alps gun massacre described yesterday the carnage that confronted him. Brett Martin, 53, said he initially . thought there had been a terrible car accident but then saw a 'lot of . blood and heads with  bullet holes in them'. He compared what he saw to a scene from the TV crime series CSI: Miami. First on the scene: Brett Martin described finding the murdered Al-Hilli family as 'like something out of a Hollywood movie' Hero: Mr Martin is seen here training in Steyning. He is a keen competitor in the triathlon . Mr Martin was cycling up a remote mountain road near Lake Annecy when he came across the bloodbath in a secluded car park. He was the first witness to arrive at the picturesque spot where British engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, from Claygate, Surrey, his dentist wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, were each shot twice in the head. Speaking publicly about the murders for the first time, Mr Martin revealed how he found the Al-Hillis' daughter Zainab, seven, stumbling around. From a distance it looked as if she was 'larking about like a child would'. But as he approached he realised she was bleeding and moaning. Zainab had been shot in the shoulder and badly beaten around the head. Nearby was the family BMW containing the bodies of her parents and grandmother. Next to it lay the body of Sylvain Mollier, 45, a French cyclist who police believe may have been killed because he was in the 'wrong place at the wrong time' and witnessed the attack. The BMW's wheels were still spinning and its engine was revving. Inside, Mr Martin saw the three bodies. VIDEO: Brett Martin tells how he discovered the scene of the Alps massacre . The French prosecutor leading the murder hunt said yesterday that the motive lies in Britain. Eric Maillaud was speaking in Woking after travelling to Surrey to meet British police officers working on the case. He said it was ‘without any doubt that the reasons and causes have their origins in this country’. The comments add weight to the theory that the family, from Claygate, were killed because of a dispute in Britain. The French-led investigation is focusing on Mr Al-Hilli’s work, his relationship with his relatives and links to his native Iraq. Yesterday officers continued to search the family’s home. Mr Martin, whose full name is William . Brett Martin, told the BBC how when he first arrived he smelled 'burning . rubber and that sort of hot burning engine smell'. He said: 'It seemed . like a good idea to turn the car engine off, so I went around to the . driver's side and I needed to break the window to get in. 'But the window was already “star . crazed” anyway and I noticed some holes and I was starting to think “is . that a bullet hole?” as I was breaking the window. I had my cycle gloves . on so I literally pushed the window, as it was already crazed, and . turned the ignition off. 'Things were a lot calmer then because . the engine wasn't revving, the wheels weren't spinning and I started . taking stock of the people who were inside. It became fairly evident . that the injuries of the people inside didn't match what one would think . people would be like from a car accident in a car park. Secluded: Police and forensic officers check the BMW at the murder scene in a secluded car park near Lake Annecy in the french Alps, left, while a close-up, right, shows the windows shot out . Tragic: Mr Martin was first on the scene to discover the bodies of engineer Saad al-Hilli, (pictured) 50, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother . 'Then I moved around to the other side . and looked into the rear. I have never seen people who have been shot . before for real, apart from Hollywood stuff, but it seemed to me to be . just like a Hollywood scene. 'And if someone had said “cut” and . everyone had just got up and walked away, that would have been it. But . unfortunately it was real life. So it became quite obvious now, taking . stock, that it was a gun crime.' Asked about the condition of the people . inside the car, he said: 'Well if you have seen CSI: Miami it was . pretty much how you would imagine a set from CSI: Miami would be like. There was a lot of blood and heads with bullet holes in them.' Mr Martin is regarded by French police as a potentially vital witness – someone whose identity they had been keen to protect. But yesterday, in an unexpected move, . the aviation consultant and former British Airways training captain . agreed to give a TV interview about the horrific events on Wednesday of . last week. Remarkably, he delivered his chilling testimony in a very . matter of fact way. Continuing his account, he said: 'Now I . was getting a little anxious, because I thought maybe there is some . crazy person in the woods. I pulled out my mobile phone and tried to . call the rescue services and of all the moments in the world to have no . signal on your mobile phone, that was it.' Mr Martin gently put Zainab 'in a . recovery position' and set off on his bike to get help. The girl is now . recovering in hospital in France. Operation: Armed police leave the family home of the al-Hillis in Claygate, Surrey . Police lines: Armed police have taped off the home as their investigation into the killings in the French Alps a week ago continues . Her four-year-old sister Zeena escaped . unhurt by hiding under her mother's body during the attack. She was . discovered in the BMW by police eight hours later.

One in ten water samples from beaches from Los Angeles to New York have failed to meet safety standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A new report has revealed that as well as getting a tan, holiday makers could pick up dysentery and hepatitis from some U.S. beaches. One in ten water samples from beaches from Los Angeles to New York have failed to meet safety standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including a section of beach near Malibu Pier in California (pictured) A total of 17 U.S. beaches have been found to have ‘persistent contamination problems’ with water samples failing to meet public health standards.

Wisconsin: South Shore Beach in Milwaukee County . Around 3,500 samples were taken at beaches around the country in 2013, and those near the Great Lakes were the dirtiest, with high levels of bacteria. A total of 13 per cent of samples failed to meet basic standards. It is thought that the water pollution has largely been caused by sewage and storm water overflowing, which often includes rubbish, oil and chemicals. The EPA estimates that up to three-and-a-half million people become ill from contact with raw sewage from sanitary overflows each year. ‘There can . be hidden dangers lurking in many of our waterways in the form of . bacteria and viruses that can cause a great inventory of illnesses like . dysentery, hepatitis, stomach flu, infections and rashes,’ said Steve . Fleischli, water programme director for the Natural Resources Defence . Council. ‘It's really all of our urban slobber going untreated into local waterways,’ he told CBS.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is the phone you can customise for any use - swapping cameras, speakers and even health sensors as you need them. Google has shown off the first working version of a 'modular' smartphone it hopes could go on sale early next year. Called Project Ara, it was unveiled at Google's I/O developer conference in San Francisco. Scroll down for video . The back of the Ara handset allows modules to be quickly removed and replaced. Speakers, cameras, lights, batteries and fitness sensors can all be put on the phone when needed - then simply removed. Each phone . will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - . made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized . endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of . phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets.

In . theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to . attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules . will be made by other companies. By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them. Paul Eremenko, the head of Project Ara, said that the prototype was 'tethered to a laboratory bench' a few weeks ago, but the team has since removed that tether to test the phone's features. He said one of the key challenges was to design the phone to be attractive to consumers. 'The design must overcome the connotations of boxiness and brick-like that people associate with modularity,' he said. Google is working with New Deal Design on the project. It also announced a $100,000 project to design modules for the handset. When Eremenko brought the prototype on stage during a breakout session of Google I/O at San Francisco's Moscone Center and flashed the Android bootup screen, the audience cheered - although the phone failed to boot fully. The Project Ara 'Grey Phone' will consist of a simple frame, screen, Wi-Fi connection and processor with users able to customise it with various plug-in modules, colours and accessories. Paul Eremenko, Google’s Project Ara head, revealed the date to attendees at the company’s developer conference this week and has outlined further plans for the device. The prototype handset, which Google showed off for the first time this week - although it failed to load fully. Google's much-anticipated modular smartphone could be available in January 2015 for as little as $50 (£30) ‘It's called the Grey Phone because it's meant to be drab grey to get people to customise it,’ Mr Eremenko said. The phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module.

At the developer conference, Google outlined a time frame for development for the modular device, attempting to attract hardware and software developers. The main frame of the Grey Phone will be built to last around five to six years, according to Mr Eremenko, allowing users to upgrade their phones regularly. He added that the basic framework can be used to build any number of devices, beyond a simple smartphone. ‘If it can be other things, we encourage that,’ Mr Eremenko said but added that Google intends Ara to be ‘ultimately a great smartphone first and foremost’. Project Ara was developed as a result of Google’s purchase of Motorola and its Advanced Technology and Projects group. It is based on the Phonebloks designs by Dutch inventor Dave Hakkens. It was initially assigned to Motorola, and had been planned to add to the firm's existing range, but Google sold the phone maker to Lenovo in January.","It will consist of a simple frame, screen, Wi-Fi connection and processor .

Nicki, who has done shoots for Aldi, Quorn and live shopping channels, has modelled products from tights to nail products and luxury jewellery. Nicki said: 'I always have to look after my hands, even when I’m on holiday, I’ll be sunbathing on the beach with my little cotton gloves on. 'It looks ridiculous but if I got even one sun-spot it could affect my career, it’s like a workman looking after his tools. I have a special lotion of almond oil and salt I use to look after my skin - and I go to the gym to ensure my legs are always toned. It's not all glamour! She says she often has to contort her hands and feet into uncomfortable shapes to make them look beautiful and natural and will often ache for days after a shoot . Healthy lifestyle: She doesn't smoke - essential for hand models and avoiding alcohol, caffeine and chocolate is important, she says . 'If I cut my hand or chipped a nail it could cost me a job, I’ve always got to be careful.' Nicki, who does around two body part modelling jobs a week, travels around the country to shoot locations and has even appeared on television around the world. Nicki said: 'Luckily I was blessed with quite strong nails but I do think a good diet helps, although I’ve never eaten meat or fish, I do have a diet rich in nuts and salad. 'I don’t smoke - essential for hand models and avoiding alcohol, caffeine and chocolate is important as you need to keep your hands so still and for hours upon hours usually on set - no shaking, it’s a real skill.

"By . James Rush . The drunk passenger who stripped naked on the airport tarmac and challenged an airline captain to a fight has been identified as former postal worker Robert Scheer. Mr Scheer, 52, was caught on camera as he stripped off at Manchester Airport after arriving on an easyJet flight from Malta. He can be seen challenging the plane's captain to a fight before being slapped across the face by his female companion, believed to be partner Karen Grisdale. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Robert Scheer has been identified as the drunk passenger who took his clothes off at Manchester Airport . He also urinated on the side of the Terminal One building in front of a shocked crowd before being ‘dry Tasered’ - where the weapon is placed in direct contact with the target and activated - and arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. It is believed trouble began mid-flight when the traveller, who appeared drunk, became abusive and started swearing at fellow passengers. A witness who asked not to be named said: 'He'd had an altercation with other passengers and the captain had come down the plane to calm him down.' After coming off the plane, down the steps and on to the tarmac, he stripped to his black underpants and gestured towards the pilot. Mr Scheer challenged the captain to a fight before he was slapped by his female companion . Video shows him then stripping completely naked before getting a slap across the face from a woman. The witness added: 'He must have been drunk because when he came off the plane, he took his top off and shouted ""come on then"" in a Manchester accent and was trying to get the captain to fight him. 'Then he carried on taking all his clothes off. I have no idea why. The woman he was with gave him a slap for it.' The man put his clothes back on before entering Terminal One, where police arrived at 1.40pm. After coming off the plane, down the steps and on to the tarmac, he stripped to his black underpants and gestured towards the pilot before stripping off completely . They tried to control him but resorted to using a 'dry' Taser when he refused to co-operate. He was then arrested and escorted from the airport. He was later ordered to pay a fixed penalty notice after the incident shortly before 1.30pm on Thursday, September 26 . Mr Scheer, who formerly worked in a Royal Mail sorting office, was unavailable for comment when visited at his home. Following the incident a police spokesman said: 'A 52-year-old man was dry tasered and arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in a public place. 'He was issued with a fixed penalty notice.'","Passenger who took clothes off at airport named as Robert Scheer .

"By . Anthony Bond . Their faces are barely able to conceal the stress and pain which they have endured this last six years. Looking tired and tearful, Kate and Gerry McCann attended an evening ceremony in their village to mark the sixth anniversary of daughter Madeleine's disappearance . The heartbroken couple attended the ceremony at the candle which burns continually in the centre of Rothley, Leicestershire. Upsetting: Looking tired and tearful, Kate and Gerry McCann attended prayers and a candle lit service in their village to mark the sixth anniversary of the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine . Villagers marked the occasion with prayers and poems. The low-key ceremony marks six years since Madeleine, then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal's Algarve on May 3 2007, as her parents dined at a tapas restaurant with friends nearby. Earlier this week, her parents said their family, including twins Sean and Amelie, now eight, had found a 'new normality' since Madeleine's disappearance. Mr and Mrs McCann, 44 and 45, said they continued to search for their daughter and remained as hopeful as ever - if not more so - as a case review by the Metropolitan Police was under way. Mystery: Madeleine McCann went missing on May 3, 2007 during a family holiday in Praia da Luz, Portugal . 'In many ways things haven't changed and . you could argue that, with the Met review two years in, we are actually . in a better place because so much more information has been collated . and lots of pieces of the jigsaw have been filled,' Mr McCann said. 'It's just about keeping looking, find out what's happened to Madeleine and hopefully finding those responsible.' His wife said the Met Police seemed 'more determined than ever'. The couple said although they struggled with various occasions, including Madeleine's birthday, they were coping with her absence. 'Probably the last couple of years it's been a new normality,' said Mr McCann. 'We have adapted to our situation. 'The thing for Kate and I was always . about having a proper search and turning over every stone and we feel . like that is being done. 'Of course we miss Madeleine terribly but we still hope that we will find her. 'We are still in the same situation and for us we have got to keep going until we find Madeleine and those responsible.' Mrs . McCann said twins Sean and Amelie, who were just two when their sister . went missing, were coping well and were 'no different to any other . eight-year-old child'. 'They . have grown up knowing that Madeleine is missing, she is their big . sister, we're trying to find her and she should be back home with us. 'As . they get older and they wander on the internet and other things, there . will be more questions, but going by how things have panned out so far I . think we will be alright, I think they'll handle it well.'

The couple admitted they found Madeleine's birthday - May 12 - more difficult than the anniversary of her disappearance. 'We . both find that more difficult really because it's her special day and . we should be there celebrating it and we still do,' Mrs McCann said. 'We still celebrate her anyway, and the same will happen this year, we have a little birthday tea and a cake. 'That's a much harder day for us really.' But they insisted they have not given up hope and will continue the hunt for their daughter. Mr McCann said: 'I think it's still about being vigilant and to remind people that we are looking for a 10-year-old girl, and not a three/four-year-old at the time. 'But if they have any information, they think they have seen someone who could be Madeleine, then the route is to contact the police.' Mrs McCann added: 'I think to encourage everybody, it's six years on, but the way the Met review is going is really positive and with that, new hope. 'The search goes on, in a major way.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Service continue their investigative review into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, liaising closely with the Portuguese authorities.' Heartbreaking: Despite numerous high profile public appeals, Madeleine McCann has still not been found . Six years have passed since Madeleine McCann went missing on May 3, 2007 during a family holiday in Praia da Luz. Since . then, each word of Gerry and Kate McCann has been followed as they . campaigned tirelessly to find Madeleine, and their words over the past . six years provide an insight into their struggle. Mr McCann issued the couple's first public appeal to trace Madeleine on May 5. Visibly . distraught, he released a personal appeal to anyone holding his . daughter captive to release her: 'Please, if you have Madeleine, let her . come home to her mummy, daddy, brother and sister.' Mr and Mrs McCann met the Pope at the Vatican just over three weeks after their daughter disappeared. Mr . McCann spoke after the meeting, stating: 'I do not know how we will . have changed but I think it is fair to say we will never be the same . again.' In their first interview since the disappearance of their daughter, Mr and Mrs McCann insisted they had not acted irresponsibly. Mrs McCann said:'I think we were naive, we are very responsible parents, we love our children very much. 'I don't think any parent could imagine or consider anything like this happening.' In September 2007, Mr and Mrs McCann returned home to Rothley, Leicestershire. In the same month, they were also named by Portuguese police as formal suspects in the case.On . the runway of East Midlands Airport, Mr McCann said: 'Despite there . being so much we wish to say, we are unable to do so, except to say . this: We played no part in the disappearance of our lovely daughter . Madeleine.' In January 2008, Mr McCann spoke of the guilt over his daughter's disappearance in an interview with an American magazine. He . said: 'I wish I hadn't gone to the tapas bar. I wish I'd stayed in the . apartment that night. I wish I'd stayed in the room when I checked on . her five minutes longer.' Appeal: Gerry and Kate McCann walk in Praia da Luz, in Portugal in 2007 in a bid to remind people about their missing daughter . In May 2008, Mrs McCann spoke to the . congregation at a church in Rothley during a service to mark the . one-year anniversary of her daughter's disappearance. She said: 'Keep praying, pray like mad.' In . December 2009, Mrs McCann said she felt closer to her missing daughter . Madeleine after returning to Praia da Luz for the first time since she . was named as a prime suspect by police. She said: 'Although our pain feels much rawer here, it is comforting at the same time since we feel closer to Madeleine.' The couple spoke about the press intrusion into their case at the Leveson inquiry in 2011.Mrs McCann said: 'There was absolutely no respect shown for me as a grieving mother or a human being or to my daughter.' In the couple's . Christmas message on the Find Madeleine website as they prepared for . their sixth Christmas without Madeleine, they wrote: 'We desperately . hope of course that the official investigation to find Madeleine will be . reopened - and soon - as we still believe this is probably our best . chance of finding our little girl.'","Kate and Gerry McCann attended ceremony in Rothley, Leicestershire .

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . If the ‘Alpine Messi’ were anything like as dangerous as the real . thing, one imagines Pep Guardiola would have embraced him more than he . has at Bayern Munich. That, however, might be a rather harsh . assessment of Xherdan Shaqiri when his progress as a winger has so . often been blocked in Bavaria by Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. More . tellingly, perhaps, Shaqiri has made no secret of his reluctance to . remain an understudy much longer. Having enjoyed more football under . Guardiola’s predecessor Jupp Heynckes, the 22-year-old is publicly . angling for a move — possibly to the Premier League and perhaps to . Liverpool. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Xherdan Shaqiri show off his muscular thighs . Incredible: Xherdan Shaqiri's thighs are almost as muscle-bound as cycling legend Chris Hoy's . So tonight represents quite an opportunity for Shaqiri; a chance to appear on the same pitch as Messi and display his skills in what promises to be a fascinating last-16 encounter. It is fascinating because it is by no means a given that Argentina, while obvious favourites, will beat  Switzerland and progress to the quarter-finals, not least because their defence is one that players of Shaqiri’s ability can exploit. While Messi and his colleagues will be just as encouraged by Switzerland’s defensive disaster against France, there is also plenty to leave a coach of Ottmar Hitzfeld’s  considerable expertise thinking their illustrious opponents can be got at. The lack of pace among Argentina’s defenders makes them particularly vulnerable to Shaqiri’s speed. He might be small like Messi — in Switzerland they call him ‘the magic dwarf’ — but those powerful thighs generate the kind of speed that terrifies centre halves and full backs.  As well as the hat-trick he scored in the last group game against Honduras, Shaqiri collected another man-of-the-match award for his display against Ecuador in Switzerland’s opening game. He is an emerging star whose stock might have risen yet again come this evening — especially if he  demonstrates his versatility in starting, as he did against  Honduras, as a No 10. Argentina manager Alejandro Sabella found yesterday that his team’s defensive frailties remain a concern for his country’s media. Power: Midfielders Tranquillo Barnetta (left) and Shaqiri (right) get primed to take on Lionel Messi and Co . Muscle man: Shaqiri's monster calves and hamstring sandwich the ball at training . They witnessed their problems in the group stage — the fragility in . the first game against Bosnia-Herzegovina and the fact that  Sergio . Romero had to be at his very best in goal to stop Iran scoring. Never . mind the two goals they  conceded against a Nigeria team that over-ran . them at times with their pace and power. Sabella accepts there is . cause for concern. He stressed, repeatedly, the need to achieve greater . ‘balance’ and not leave ‘huge spaces between defence and attack because . of the speed of the forwards’. At one stage he likened the . situation to an NBA game, arguing  that the ‘supporters cry defence . whenever a team is attacking’. For his sake one can only hope his team . understand his point better than his audience did. There were . inevitable questions about Messi, and having fought against the idea . that his team depend too heavily on their superstar No 10 he seems to . have now conceded defeat. ‘We depend on him like Brazil depend on . Neymar,’ he said while at the same time agreeing that Messi can be to . this Argentina team what Diego Maradona was to the 1986 side. Nothing to lose: The Swiss won passage through to the knockout phase finishing second in Group E . VIDEO Rodriguez not underestimating Switzerland . It is . probably a  statement worthy of headlines, but it was said with a slight . tone of resignation. He has tried to resist such talk but, really, . what’s the use? After four goals in the group stage and almost . single-handedly securing the nine points that carried them into the last . 16, there is no getting away from it: Messi is crucial to Argentina. Of . less certainty is the way Argentina will approach this game, whether . sticking with the 4-3-3  formation Messi and the players demanded midway . through their opening group game or switching to a more defensive 4-4-2 . to offer the back four a bit more protection. Ezequiel Lavezzi, who . did well when he came on as a replacement for the injured Sergio Aguero, . has the energy and the versatility to perform such a role, although . there was talk yesterday of bringing in Maxi Rodriguez. Sabella was . pressed to reveal his starting line-up. ‘I won’t decide until I am about . to sleep, at midnight tonight,’ he said. ‘Can we call you at midnight?’ a journalist from  Argentina then asked him. ‘If you have my number you . can,’ replied Sabella. ‘But I may not answer.’ He wouldn’t answer the question of whether playing in  Brazil provides Argentina with that extra bit of motivation. Perhaps . because he knows that, for all the brilliance of Messi and players such . as Angel  Di Maria, his team must improve. ‘There is no longer room for . mistakes,’ admitted Sabella. Certainly not with Shaqiri on the field.","The Swiss face Lionel Messi's Argentina on Tuesday in the last 16 .

"By . Suzannah Hills . On trial: Emma Wilson, 25, is accused of repeatedly beating her 11-month-old son before killing him . A mother accused of repeatedly beating her 11-month-old son before killing him today claimed his 23-month-old brother is responsible for the injuries that led to his death. Emma Wilson, 25, allegedly took pictures of her baby son Callum before deliberately hurting him and then taking more pictures of his injuries. Wilson is accused of doing this several times in the weeks leading up to her son's death when she allegedly caused him 'catastrophic' and 'unsurvivable brain injuries'. Callum was rushed to John Radcliffe . Hospital in Oxford in March, 2011, with a detached retina which had caused him to lose his sight and he also had multiple fractures and . bruises all over his tiny body. He died two days later. But Wilson today told the Old Bailey that Callum's older brother is to blame for the injuries - claiming he was jealous of his younger brother. Jurors were shown a series of photos Wilson took of Callum in the weeks leading up to his death in which bruises and scratches can clearly be seen on both his face. But Wilson says Callum's older brother, then aged 23 months, inflicted the injuries because he was 'jealous' he no longer had all her attention. The 25-year-old told the Old Bailey she never hurt her son and claimed: 'It's the best thing in the world being a mum.' Wilson told the court how she didn't realise she was pregnant when she had her first child in April 2009. Shortly afterwards she got pregnant with Callum after a one night stand, but she didn't know she had conceived again until two months before he was born as she continued to have periods and hardly put on any weight. However, she chose to put him in foster care for the first seven months of his life because her then boyfriend didn't want anything to do with him. It was only when the trainee nail technician bumped into Callum and his foster mum in a Mothercare in Slough in May 2010 that she went about getting him back. He was returned to Wilson, then 23, in November 2010 who says at that point her 'life was perfect.' But over the next few months when social workers visited them at her Windsor home, they spotted scratches on Callum. The jury heard she even lied to staff and parents at a play group in Maidenhead claiming Callum was her cousin's son, providing a false surname and address for him. On one occasion, she claimed bruising on Callum's face had been caused by an older sister, who in fact did not exist. But she said the reason she made up lies was because at that time no one knew Callum was hers and she couldn't deal with the embarrassment of people asking questions. At court: Ms Wilson told a jury at the Old Bailey, pictured, that her older son, then aged 23 months, was responsible for the injuries that led to her son Callum's death . 'It was so difficult just to say this is my son, he's been in foster care for seven months of his life,' she said. Within months staff at the playgroup began to notice that Callum changed from a 'happy, smiling baby' to an 'emotionless and listless boy'. But Wilson claims his injuries must have been caused by her other son who would 'throw things at Callum and push him over'. 'He was boisterous and would get generally jealous of Callum', she told the court. She claims she tried to seek advice from her parents, GP and a health visitor on how to deal with the sibling rivalry. 'My other son would be rough with him. He liked to grab Callum's face and would leave him with scratches and bruises,' she told the court. Callum was rushed to hospital with head injuries in March 2011 and died two days later. A post mortem revealed the baby had also suffered fractures to nine ribs, to his right arm and left leg and were caused two weeks before he died. Wilson, of Paddock Close, Windsor, denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Emma Wilson, 25, is accused of repeatedly beating her baby son Callum .

"By . Wills Robinson . Berserk: Paul Stone, 48, was shot with a Taser by police after going on a rampage when neighbours found out he was dumping his own rubbish in their wheelie bins . A man was Tasered by police after going on a rampage when neighbours found out he was secretly dumping rubbish in their bins. Paul Stone, 48, filled other bins around the neighbourhood with the leftovers of his DIY projects because he had no place to put them himself. But his ploy was exposed after neighbours noticed their wheelie bins were overflowing so much bin men were refusing to empty them on health and safety grounds. After discovering Stone was responsible, one woman confronted him at his home in Melrose Street, Manchester. But he reacted by running at the 35-year-old Kathryn Harrison with a kitchen broom handle raised above his head before hitting her four times on the head, neck, back and left arm. When Janet Young, 52, came out of her nearby home to intervene, Stone then 'came at her', hitting her hip and threatening to fetch a hammer. By the time police arrived, Stone was brandishing a cordless drill with a nail sticking out of the end and began waving it at the officers. They were forced to used the 50,000 volt device to overpower him. Manchester Crown Court was told Stone, who lived alone, suffered from bipolar disorder and had an 'isolated life.' It emerged he had also taken another neighbour's wheelie bin and chained it up to his house. He admitted common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray during a hearing last Thursday and was jailed for 12 months. Scene: Stone carried out the three-hour attack Melrose Street in the Newton Heath Area of Manchester . Stone had been living at the rented property for 14 months before the three hour rampage on June 16. Retired builder Geoff Harold, 57, Miss Young's partner of five years, said: 'Stone was an absolute nightmare. He just used to scream and scream and talk to himself because he lived there on his own and we used to hear lots of drilling. 'I had been round to tell him to keep the . noise down but he held a hammer up to me and slammed the door in my . face. He is a nutcase but I was never scared of him. 'Police were trying to catch him out . but he had cameras and microphones installed on the premises so he would . be able to see them coming to the door before they could catch him. 'When . I spoke to the owner of the house, he invited me in and said ""look what . he's done here"" and he'd drilled a massive hole in the wall as though . he was trying to get something through here. 'Upstairs in the bedroom there is a big section of the ceiling missing. 'It's been a lot more quiet since he has been in custody. Janet will be glad to hear he is going to spend longer in prison.' Fatih Ozbaykondu, 32, restaurant supervisor said: 'One day I put the bin out, came back from work and the bin wasn't there. 'So . I walked up the street looking for it and realised my bin was chained . to this man's property with something similar to a bike lock. 'I knocked on the door and nobody answered but the next door neighbour came out and told me he was a bit strange. Threats: Police were forced to used the 50,000 volt device to overpower Stone, who was brandishing a cordless drill . 'I kept knocking because I wanted to ask him how he did it but he didnt answer so I just got some pliers, cut through the chains and took my bin home. I presumed he took the bin by mistake.' A third neighbour said: 'He was forever doing DIY at the house drilling holes into his wall for no apparent reason and being noisy. It seemed he was obsessd with DIY. 'The bins thing was the final straw. It's bad enough having all these wheelie bins anyway never mind having someone else fill them for you so they won't get emptied.' In court Stone claimed the attack had been a 'wake-up call' for him and would force him to deal with his obsessions. But Judge Richard Mansell QC told him: 'What's clearly been going on is that your, perhaps to certain people, slightly unusual behaviour at times has annoyed them. 'They have made it clear to you that they don't like the noise you make or the way you handle your refuse, and your illness affects the way you react. 'On this particular day you obviously boiled over and lost your cool. 'There's no excuse for running out of the house with a broom handle. People are entitled to live in their streets and go about their business feeling safe - you must avoid confrontation with your neighbours.'","Paul Stone, 48, was jailed for 12 months at Manchester Crown Court .

"By . Mark Prigg . Google has revealed a mobile phone with a built in 3D scanner that could revolutionise navigation. Called Project Tango, the phone can build up a live 3D map of its surrounding area. It will initially only be sold to developers, who Google hope will develop everything from satnav apps to games similar to those found on Microsoft's Xbox, which uses the 3D Kinect sensor.. Scroll down for video . Google's prototype phone - a 5inch handset packed with 3D sensors . The handset can automatically build a 3D map of anywhere the user is, allowing for far better indoor navigation . The current prototype is a 5” phone containing customized hardware and software designed to track the full 3D motion of the device, while simultaneously creating a map of the environment. These sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time, combining that data into a single 3D model of the space around you. 'Project Tango strives to give mobile devices a human-like understanding of space and motion through advanced sensor fusion and computer vision, enabling new and enhanced types of user experiences – including 3D scanning, indoor navigation and immersive gaming,' said Johnny Lee, the technical lead on the programme. The handset can take 250,000 3D measurements a second . It was created by Motorola's ATAP division, which last week joined Google. 'The goal of Project Tango is to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion,' it said. The phone has a compass and gyros, just like any other phone, but in addition, has Kinect-like visual sensors that can scan the room around the phone. In its announcement, Google asks: 'What if you could capture the dimensions of your home simply by walking around with your phone before you went furniture shopping? What if directions to a new location didn’t stop at the street address? What if you never again found yourself lost in a new building?' How it works: depth sensing and motion tracking sensors allow the handset to know exactly where it is, and it can create a 'live' 3D map of its surroundings. The team has spent over a year on the project, operating in secret from Motorola's HQ. 'The team has been working with universities, research labs, and industrial partners spanning nine countries around the world for the last year to harvest research from the last decade of work in robotics and computer vision, concentrating that technology into a unique mobile phone. 'Now, we’re ready to put early prototypes into the hands of developers that can imagine the possibilities and help bring those ideas into reality.' A live map created by the handset . The firm believes gaming could be one of the first uses of the system. 'Imagine playing hide-and-seek in your house with your favorite game character, or transforming the hallways into a tree-lined path. Imagine competing against a friend for control over territories in your home with your own miniature army, or hiding secret virtual treasures in physical places around the world?'","Phone will only be sold to app developers .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . A 16-year-old Mexican girl allegedly murdered her 'best friend' in a horrific stabbing attack after she posted naked photos of the pair to her Facebook account. Anel Baez, also 16, was found with 65 stab wounds to her neck on March 19 after she invited Erandy Elizabeth Gutierrez - a girl she referred to as her 'sister' - to her home in an attempt at reconciliation. The two - who both lived in Guamúchil in western Mexico - had fallen out after Anel published revealing photos on her Facebook account, according to Mexican news website Notus. Chilling murder: Erandy Elizabeth Gutierrez (right) accused of murdering best friend Anel Baez . Erandy arrived and asked her unsuspecting friend if she could use the toilet. She instead went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and allegedly stabbed Anel over and over again, leaving her in a pool of blood. She then fled the scene and tried to cover her tracks by grieving with friends of the pair and attended Anel's funeral a few days later. It is there that police eventually arrested her. Earlier in the year Erandy took to Twitter to send chilling threats to her once best friend. 'It may seem that I am very calm, but in my head I have killed you at least three times,' she wrote on an account that has since been deleted. Anel was also told she would be 'lucky to survive until the end of the year'. Her Facebook page - which is yet to be taken down - reveals a tragic look inside the lives of two young pals who would one day become victim and alleged murderer. Total tragedy: Anel Baez referred to her alleged murderer as her 'sister' A photo of the pair posted on October 15 2012 - which has since been liked nearly 3,500 times - shows the two girls smiling for the camera above a heartfelt message written from Anel to the girl who would one day make good on vicious and violent death threats. Translated roughly from Spanish, the message reads: 'I love you...you are my beloved sister...thanks for those moments of madness that provoke me and the laughter that you give me and also the desire to do crazy things with you'. The young One Direction and Twilight fan lived in Guamúchil in the Sinaloa region of western Mexico. Since her brutal murder, Anel's local high school (which was also attended by Erandy) has been hosting lectures and seminars aimed at preventing further similar tragedies, local media reports. News website Cafe Negro says the 'therapy' sessions are being run by rector Juan Eulogio War Liera for a community left 'sad and outraged' by the brutal murder. 'In this community I want to tell you are not alone, we share your pain and anger and can add efforts to overcome the bitter moment,' the website quotes him as saying. 'Unity in the family is a way to preserve peace, values​​, tranquility and have a better world.' It is expected police will lay murder charges in the coming days. Under Mexican law, Erandy faces a maximum of seven years in prison if found guilty.

"By . Matt Blake . Fear: Aliaksandr Barankov fled to Ecuador after unearthing petroleum-smuggling ring involving senior officials of President Alexander Lukashenko's government, including relatives of the leader . A Belarusian dissident granted asylum in Ecuador has begged his South American safe haven not to send him home, claiming he will surely be killed for exposing government corruption. Aliaksandr Barankov fled to Ecuador after unearthing petroleum-smuggling ring involving senior . officials of President Alexander Lukashenko's government, including . relatives of the leader. But the former financial crimes investigator says he is in imminent danger of losing his political refugee status and being sent back to the former Soviet bloc nation whose president has been nicknamed 'Europe's last dictator.' His fate could be decided as early as . Tuesday, less than a week after Ecuador granted political asylum to . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, painting itself a proud haven for the . politically persecuted. The Belarusian's case indicates that hospitality may be limited by geopolitics. Prosecutors . in Belarus accuse the 30-year-old Barankov of fraud and extortion. He . calls the charges bogus, retribution for his having exposed corruption . among some of President Alexander Lukashenko's closest politicians. Barankov . is backed by rights activists at home, where Lukashenko has ruled for . 18 years by fixing elections, quashing free speech, jailing dissidents . and keeping 80 percent of industry in state hands. 'Europe's last dictator': President Alexander Lukashenko has ruled Belarus for 18 years by fixing elections, quashing free speech, jailing dissidents and keeping 80 percent of industry in state hands . 'They . accuse me of fraud and corruption,' Barankov said by phone from prison . Friday. 'It's easy to accuse (someone) of this because the police, . courts and prosecutor's office are employees of the president and his . family.' Barankov arrived in Ecuador in August 2009 after fleeing the charges, which he said were filed after he uncovered the smuggling ring. Belarus has been trying to extradite him ever since. In 2010, when he overstayed his visa, he was imprisoned for 55 days but was freed after authorities granted him refugee status, finding merit in his claim of political persecution. Total power: Under President Rafael Correa, Ecuador has been deepening commercial and political ties with U.S. rivals including Iran, Russia and China. It will be up to him if Barankov will be extradited . Belarus continued to press for his extradition, but Judge Carlos Ramirez of Ecuador's highest court, the National Court of Justice, denied it in October 2011, finding the evidence of Barankov's alleged crimes inadequate. Then, on June 7, after a revised extradition request from Belarus, Barankov was arrested by 15 police officers who hauled him from his home in a middle-class neighborhood of northern Quito. Later that month, Lukashenko visited Ecuador for two days, signing agreements on trade, education, agriculture and the eventual exchange of diplomats with President Rafael Correa. A preliminary defense cooperation agreement was also signed. Under Correa, Ecuador has been deepening commercial and political ties with U.S. rivals including Iran, Russia and China. Help: His plea comes less than a week after Ecuador granted political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (pictured speaking from the Ecuadorian embassy on Sunday) 'Everything changed after Lukashenko came,' Barankov said by phone from Quito's cold, overcrowded century-old Prison No. 1. 'I want Ecuadoreans to open their eyes and see what's happening to me.' An official at the National Court of Justice said that Ramirez could rule as early as Tuesday on the new extradition request and that Barankov could lose despite his refugee status. It would then be up to Correa to decide whether he is extradited. A phone call to the presidential press office Monday seeking comment was not returned. Nor were calls to the Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry seeking clarification for why the government was allowing the extradition to go forward. 'He cannot be condemned to death or to life in prison because there is a signed guarantee from the Belarusian government that assures us of this. The guarantee was delivered during Lukashenko's visit,' said the court official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to make statements to the press. Barankov's Ecuadorean girlfriend, Mabel Andrade, told The Associated Press: 'We were more or less relaxed until President Lukashenko came. Immediately afterward, Ecuadorean authorities didn't want to renew his ID card and they wouldn't give us any explanation.' She said they had appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, arguing a fear of torture or even death. Ecuadorean court records confirm that Barankov was a financial crimes investigator. In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, an Interior Ministry official said Barankov was a former police officer but refused to say what job or responsibilities he had. The official, who refused to be quoted by name, said Barankov was accused of summoning random people to his office, telling them they were being investigated and extorting bribes to close non-existent cases. The Ecuadorean court papers say he allegedly attempted to extort employees of Total Oil, demanding payments of up to $60,000 on at least eight occasions. Yelena Krasovskaya-Kasperovich from the Minsk-based human rights organization Platforma told the AP that Barankov asked for the group's help and that they had spoken to him several times via Skype. She said Barankov 'didn't say a word about the nature of the secrets he's in possession of.' He only said that the information he has is 'explosive' and concerns Belarusian senior officials, she said. 'The persistence with which Belarusian authorities are demanding Barankov's extradition is alarming,' Krasovskaya-Kasperovich said. 'This might be the proof that he does know Lukashenko's secrets.' 'In this case, it's very dangerous for him to be in Belarus,' she said.","Aliaksandr Barankov fled to Ecuador after unearthing petroleum-smuggling ring involving senior politicians .

"By . Rebecca Camber . and Martin Robinson . British detectives hunting for Madeleine McCann today issued two e-fits of a suspect seen carrying a little blonde girl near in Praia da Luz on the night she disappeared. Scotland Yard say a family saw him cradling a child in pyjamas, aged around three, and walking away towards the beach in Praia da Luz, Portugal at around 10pm. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said today he could be the man who took Madeleine on May 3, 2007, and that tracing him was of 'vital importance'. Detectives say the suspect is white, aged 20 to 40 with short brown hair, medium height . and build, and clean-shaven. The images, based on statements from two key witnesses, differ – but each shows him with an intense stare and a hint of a smile. Scroll down for video . Suspect: The two e-fit images of the same man seen in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine disappeared . Scotland Yard detectives released the computer generated images ahead of a BBC1 Crimewatch appeal tonight, which they hope will result in a major breakthrough. The programme features a reconstruction of the events leading up to Madeleine’s disappearance in Praia da Luz on Thursday, May 3, 2007. Madeleine is portrayed gathering tennis balls in echoes of one of the photographs used during the search for her. A short clip released ahead of the broadcast shows Gerry and Kate McCann drawing the curtains to their apartment before joining friends in a tapas restaurant. The reconstruction shows the moment Madeleine was taken from her bed. Prime Minister David Cameron gave his support to the investigation. 'I'm very pleased that Scotland Yard are doing this work,' he said. 'The Government has helped to fund the work that is being done. 'This was a crime that touched the heart of everyone in the country and everyone would like to see it resolved, so I hope Scotland Yard continue with their work and I wish them success.' Likeness: A three-year-old actress reenacts a game of tennis for the reconstruction (left) and a picture of Maddie on the court in 2007 . TV reconstruction: Actors portray Kate and Gerry McCann having dinner with their friends in the resort . Night: Another scene shows Maddie's parents closing the curtains in their room on the night their daughter disappeared . The devastated couple – who found themselves suspects in the initial inquiry by Portuguese police – talk about how her disappearance has left a ‘huge hole’ in their family’s life. In a moving interview with Kirsty Young, Kate McCann says: ‘We’re not the ones that have done something wrong here. It’s the person who’s gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family.’ Gerry McCann says: ‘When it’s a special occasion, when you should be your happiest and Madeleine’s not there, that’s when it really hits home.’ His wife adds: ‘It’s when you have big family occasions really. That’s it isn’t it? Family occasion and you haven’t got your complete family.’ Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, the senior investigating officer, will announce ‘a revelation moment’ in Scotland Yard’s £5million investigation. Officers will also release further e-fits – electronic facial identification technique images – of other potential suspects. They are keen to trace at least two German-speaking men who were seen in the Algarve resort that day. Emotional: An interview with Kate and Gerry McCann will also be shown during the special episode of Crimewatch tonight . Witnesses reported the sightings to Portuguese police, but little importance was placed on them at the time. Now Scotland Yard says tracing the man in the two e-fits is ‘one of the main priorities for the investigation’ after scrutinising the time frame when the abduction could have taken place. They are the first to be issued in relation to the Home Office-funded inquiry into the case. Detectives say their timeline and version of events surrounding Madeleine’s disappearance has ‘significantly changed’, making the two witness sightings far more significant than previously thought. Officers are keeping an open mind as to whether more than one person was responsible for the abduction, which they think may be linked to a series of break-ins at the resort. Disappeared: Madeleine went missing from the Portuguese holiday apartment in 2007 when she was three years old . Mr Redwood said: ‘Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us. We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. ‘This is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well, who we are equally keen to trace. These people were seen on the day of Madeleine’s disappearance and the days leading up to it.’ The focus of the hunt for Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, who would now be ten years old, will move to Germany this week when her parents are expected to travel there to make a TV appeal. On Wednesday the German channel ZDF will feature the BBC Crimewatch reconstruction and release sketches of two German-speaking men in their programme Aktenzeichen XY... Ungelost [File Reference XY... Unsolved]. Publicity for that programme says detectives are now going on the ‘offensive’, with inquiries focusing on Germany. It adds: ‘This is the reason why XY will show sketches of two men who appear to speak German and who have so far been paid little or no importance.’ The e-fits will also be shown on Dutch TV as the two ‘German speakers’ may have been Dutch – the accents sound similar. Tonight’s Crimewatch reconstruction will give the most detailed sequence ever made public of the events that led to Madeleine’s disappearance. Detectives believe her kidnappers may have been lurking in or near the McCanns’ holiday apartment as her father went to check on his children. Earlier inquiries focused on the period after that, but they now believe the 45 minutes before that could hold the key. Mr Redwood said: ‘Our work has significantly changed the accepted version of events and it has allowed us to highlight very specific appeal points. I hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.’ It emerged yesterday that Greater Manchester Police arrested a man who bragged about seeing Madeleine on a Mediterranean island weeks ago. The man claimed the missing girl had been ‘introduced’ to him. Police were informed after a barrister, who had a conversation with the man at a party in a Manchester suburb in August, reported his concerns. The man was arrested last month on suspicion of possession of drugs and conspiracy to distribute indecent images of children. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police refused to comment yesterday, but sources played down the significance of the arrest.","Each image shows the man with an intense stare and a hint of a smile .

And perhaps no other title embodies this more than Nike+ Kinect Training. For it is clear from the moment you’re thrust into the capable hands of one of the game’s PTs, that this is not a game, but a virtual gymnasium. Upon selecting either a male or female instructor, you are first put through a basic fitness test to evaluate what needs to be improved. There are lots of modes, ranging from Challenge Drills, to five-minute sessions. Clever: The Kinect tracks your movements and tells you when your form is starting to fail . Cleverly, the game can identify specific weaknesses - for example, if one side is stronger than the other - and then tailor workouts to suit your needs. Working very much like an exercise class, the instructor first shows you a move, and then you repeat it a specific number of reps. Cleverly, an avatar is shown on the screen to ensure that you can check your form. Exercises won’t start until you are in the correct position, too. If your form dips, the instructor will tell you or hints will appear on the screen. Unfortunately, the latter means taking attention away from doing the actual exercise, which only acts as a constant reminder that you are, in fact, just playing a game. This can also affect your total Fuel Print at the end of each workout, with some likely to find the inevitable and unavoidable loss of points a slight annoyance. At the end, workout data is saved and can be tracked on graph, or sent to central Nike+ servers for a breakdown of Fuel across platforms. Visually, although clearly not a game concerned with cutting-edge graphics, it's nevertheless impressive. Menus are clear and easy to navigate, and environments varied. But the real technological achievement comes through its integration with the Kinect. Although not perfect, the IR tracking performs well most of the time, showcasing just how far games in this genre have come since Wii Fit. Varied: You won't just be stuck in a gym. The game takes you out in the open sometimes to keep things fresh . Although it maps out your room, taking into account large furniture, you may find that space is an issue with some of the more dynamic exercises. Indeed, to get the most from this game you need an open space. If motivation is lacking, there is a Group Training section. This allows you to work out with a friend, or challenge other Nike+ users from around the world. In theory, it works brilliantly, but given that Halo 4 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 are released this month, a large amount of users may look elsewhere for multiplayer options. Overall, a well-balanced, solid game that will get you fitter from the comfort of your living room.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Phone hacking dominated the news during the Leveson Inquiry, but despite the high-profile exposure, voicemails are still at risk. During an investigation by The Register, journalist Simon Rockman was able to use a Skype-style Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) handset to access the inboxes of EE, Three and Orange customers. EE, which owns the Orange and T-Mobile networks, has now fixed the flaw as a result of the investigation, but Three is said to still be at risk. During an investigation by The Register, journalist Simon Rockman was able to use a Skype-style VoIP service to access the inboxes of EE, Three and Orange customers. By linking a mobile number to a VoIP handset, Rockman was able to trick the inbox into thinking it was the number's owner and access the inboxes . Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is sometimes referred to as Voice over Networks or (VoN), Voice over Broadband (VoB) and sometimes Internet Telephony. VoIP lets people make free, or low cost, telephone calls over the web. Popular VoIP services include Viber and Skype. VoIP can be used anywhere in the world and can call landline and mobile numbers. When you call voicemail from a handset registered with the account, the inbox is automatically opened because it assumes the caller is the phone’s owner. But when calls are made from another phone, users are asked for a PIN - or denied access if no PIN has been set up. By linking the mobile number, and therefore a voicemail account, to a VoIP handset, Rockman was able to trick the inbox into thinking it was the number’s owner on three of the major network operators. When calling the external voicemail number on EE, the inbox was accessed immediately. It was the same situation on Three. On Orange, Rockman was able to not only access the voicemails but also change the voicemail greeting. Although . this access was granted intermittently - sometimes access was given . automatically, while at other times it asked for a PIN. EE, which owns the Orange and T-Mobile networks, has now fixed the flaw, but Three is said to still be at risk. Three offers advice on how to set up a voicemail PIN on its support page, and recommends its users select the option that asks for their phone number and PIN every time they access their voicemail . It is worth noting that accessing someone else's voicemail account without their permission is illegal and falls under computer misuse legislation. EE told MailOnline: 'Our engineers have worked hard since then to identify the root fault and work on a fix. 'We can now confirm that we have urgently updated our systems and patched the issues raised in the article.' Three offers advice on how to set up a voicemail PIN on its support page, and recommends its users select the option that asks for their phone number and PIN every time they access their voicemail to get the highest level of security. This would effectively stop people accessing the account in the way The Register demonstrated.","The loophole was discovered by journalist Simon Rockman .

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . Manchester United will step up their pursuit of Southampton full-back Luke Shaw after England’s final World Cup group game against Costa Rica on Tuesday evening. Former United manager David Moyes did much of the ground-work to convince the 18-year-old that his future lies at Old Trafford before he was sacked at the end of April and it is understood that a wage package has been agreed that would make Shaw the highest earning youngster at Old Trafford, with a weekly salary approaching £100,000-a-week. United made their first move with a £27million offer towards the end of May but progress stalled after the two clubs failed to push through the signing before Shaw’s involvement in the World Cup, while Southampton’s change of manager adding to the complications. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luke Shaw showing off with his best free-kicks in England training . Heading north? Luke Shaw looks set to leave Southampton and sign for Manchester United after the World Cup . Left out: Luke Shaw is yet to play for England at the World Cup . Southampton, now managed by Ronald Koeman, are under no financial pressure to sell and they are holding out for a figure closer to the £30million mark, with Shaw’s employers aware that they have the best young left-back in the world on their hands. New manager Louis van Gaal is aware of the need for reinforcements in the United back-line and although Patrice Evra has been retained for one more year, the Dutchman is aware that the 33-year-old cannot be expected to play almost every game as he did last season under Moyes. Current understudy Alex Buttner will be moved on this summer, with Dynamo Moscow in pole position to sign the left-back. It leaves United in urgent need of a new full-back and they have been encouraged that the player has made it clear to Southampton that he would like a move to United to go through and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward will look to secure the England star’s signature once England return from Brazil on Wednesday. High flyer: But Patrice Evra is now 33 and can't play every game for Manchester United . Blow: Thomas Vermaelen receives treatment before Belgium's 1-0 win over Russia on Sunday . United will not, however, be held to ransom and if negotiations were to slow down once more, they may be forced to look at alternatives, with Ajax’s Daley Blind emerging as a £12.5million target following his impressive performances for Van Gaal’s Holland at the World Cup. United, meanwhile, will wait until after the World Cup to make a formal offer in the region of £9million to Arsenal for defender Thomas Vermaelen. The Belgian defender is privately confident that personal terms are in place with the Old Trafford club, with Vermaelen’s contract at Arsenal expiring next summer. The 28-year-old’s close friendship with Robin van Persie is believed to have helped matters, while United see the move as a pragmatic solution to the void of Premier League experience that has been left following the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.","Southampton are holding out for closer to £30million for teenager .

"By . Martha De Lacey . Outspoken journalist Samantha Brick has angered parents around Britain expressing her disgust with the 'uncivilised pushchair posse', and calling for a ban on baby buggies in public places, particularly during rush hour. Brick, 42, appeared on ITV's Daybreak to debate about whether or not prams should be banned from public places, in light of research that shows more cafes, buses and shopping centres are prohibiting buggies from using their facilities. The childless blonde - who first courted controversy by stating that all women hate her because she's beautiful - took on broadcaster and mother-of-two Emma B, declaring that she 'wholeheartedly agrees' with cafe owners who forbid parents with prams from entering their restaurants. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Samantha Brick, right, on Daybreak with Emma B, calling for a ban on buggies in public places, particularly during rush hour . Emma B jumped in to defend pram-pushing . parents, explaining that, sizewise, today's buggies are remarkably . modest compared to the enormous Silver Cross perambulators favoured by . wealthy parents in the early 1900s . The opinionated blonde said: 'I used to live in Kew Gardens and the local cafe was dominated by 'the pushchair posse'. There was an ageing population and a business population and none of us could get through. 'Of course mothers with prams have as much right to be there, but when you get a woman behind a pushchair it does become a weapon of mass destruction. It's like the modern day version of a gladiator with a chariot: she is armed and dangerous. 'The number of times I've had my shins run into or I've been knocked off the pavement... You can say it's a joke and they're only children, but we're a society and we've all got to share the pavement.' Emma B jumped in to defend pram-pushing parents, explaining that, sizewise, today's buggies are remarkably modest compared to the enormous Silver Cross perambulators favoured by wealthy parents in the early 1900s and before. When Brick complained that buggies are everywhere - from cafes and buses to shopping centres and supermarkets - and should at least be banned during rush hour, Emma B interjected that mothers and fathers pushing prams have absolutely no desire to be on the streets during rush hour. She said: 'The vast majority of parents are trying to get from A to B with the least hassle possible.' Samantha said: 'The number of times I've had my shins run into or I've been knocked off the pavement... You can say it's a joke and they're only children, but we're a society and we've all got to share the pavement' Brick also commented that it was 'fair enough' for Emma B to have once been asked to get off a bus when pushing her little girl in a buggy. She added: 'I was shopping with my elderly gran in a wheelchair recently and there was no question of us gettting into the lift before those women with buggies - and some of them are like mini cars: they've got drinks containers, playcentres... it's gone too far.'

'They assume they are Queen of the Pavement and refuse to budge an inch for the rest of society - including the elderly and infirm. 'Until the pushchair posse recognise they don't have a divine right to use their (usually in need of a clean) weapons of mass destruction on four wheels where and when they please - then calls for them to be banned will continue.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Read my lips: Obama told the AMA four years ago that 'no matter how we reform health care ... If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.' Between half and three-quarters of Americans who buy their own health insurance on the open market will lose those plans in the next year as Obamacare is pushed into full implementation, according to a blockbuster report sure to give the White House a new round of health-care headaches. 'No matter how we reform health care,' a newly minted President Barack Obama told a meeting of the American Medical Association in June 2009, 'we will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.' But regulations formulated by his own administration make it . clear that the White House never intended to to give Americans that . level of free choice about their medical insurance options. Washington, D.C. buzzed Friday with reports of what NBC News had surfaced: an under-the-radar notice in the Federal Register, which MailOnline has dated to June 17, 2010, laying out the administration's expectation that most people who buy their own health insurance will soon have no options other than paying exorbitant rates or joining the federal government's insurance exchanges. White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo told NBC that 'nothing . in the Affordable Care Act forces people out of their health plans: The . law allows plans that covered people at the time the law was enacted to . continue to offer that same coverage to the same enrollees.' But millions of individual insurance plans don't comply with Obamacare's minimum standards, which include services like children's vision care, dental coverage and reproductive health options that some consumers don't want. Millions more with policies written before March 2010 will lose the 'grandfather' status President Obama has promised them because of tiny, marginal changes like premium adjustments or revised prescription copay rates.

White House spokesmanJay Carney conceded Monday that 'it's true that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual market that don't meet [Obamacare's] minimum standards and therefore do not qualify' to survive . Smoking gun: The IRS published official notice in 2010 that it expected most Americans with individual health insurance plans would lose them under Obamacare . I told you so: A spokesman for long-time Obamacare foe Sen. Ted Cruz emailed the NBC News report all over Washington on Monday as soon as it hit the Internet . 'Any insurance that you currently have would be grandfathered in so you could keep it,' President Obama claimed during a CNN broadcast in February 2010. 'And so you could decide not to get, in the exchange, the better plan. I could keep my Acme insurance, just a high-deductible catastrophic plan. I would not be required to get the better one.' John Kyl, then a Republican senator from Arizona, countered with words that now seem prescient: 'That's for a very limited period of time.' The White House's website continues to communicate the president's earlier promises. 'If you like your plan you can keep it,' one page reads, 'and you don’t have to change a thing due to the health care law.' Under the Affordable Care Act and the tens of thousands of pages of related regulations, the grandfathering Obama promised only applies to insurance policies that continue, unchanged, from year to year. Requirements in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 often force health insurers to rewrite their policies annually in order to re-state consumers' privacy guarantees, now well-known as 'HIPPA' rights. That simple act of re-issuing a policy that's identical to the previous one would also render it ineligible for 'grandfather' status. 'A reasonable range for the percentage of individual policies that would terminate and therefore relinquish their grandfather status is 40 to 67 percent,' the IRS wrote on July 17, 2010. The White House's website continues to claim: 'If you like your plan you can keep it and you don't have to change a thing due to the health care law' That estimate only covers policies that lose their 'grandfathered' status by changing, and those which Americans voluntarily leave for other reasons. But still more will lose coverage, the IRS wrote, because their chosen levels of insurance will suddenly fail to meet the White House's definition of an adequate policy. 16 million: Health care analyst Bob Laszewski predicts that's the number of Americans who will lose their preferred medical insurance plans in the coming months . The annual total likely 'exceeds the 40 percent to 67percent range,' according to the IRS's statement more than three years ago. Overall, NBC reported Monday that of the 14 million U.S. consumers who buy individual health insurance plans, 50 to 75 per cent will likely receive cancellation notices during the next year. And the administration has been expecting that outcome since 2010. That conclusion came as a result of estimates from four sources deeply involved with the administration's work on the Affordable Care Act, one of whom said as many as 80 per cent of individual insurance customers will be short on choices by this time in 2014. Months of wrangling over the Obamacare law in 2009 included jousting over whether a range of services including mental health and drug abuse treatments, dental provisions and and vision care for children should be mandated for every qualifying insurance policy, even though not all consumers want them. Democrats generally won those battles, resulting in a minimum set of health insurance standards that has placed most individual policies out-of-bounds. In their places are new, more robust plans expected to bring 'sticker shock' to millions. Health policy analyst Bob Laszewski, who consults with America's largest insurers, estimated this month that 'as many as 16 million' such policies will be canceled because they don't comply with the Obamacare law. That represents 80 per cent of his estimate that 19 million such plans, provided by neither governments nor employers, are in existence today. Fox News Channel's Megyn Kelly exploded: Obama 'said ""if you like your plan you can keep it, period."" If he wanted to be honest, he should not have said ""period."" He should have said ""asterisk."" News networks buzzed late on Friday as they discovered what NBC had found: evidence that the Obama administration has known for three years that the president's promise simply couldn't be kept. This example, from July 19, 2010, hit the Internet five weeks after the IRS published it in the Federal Register (above) The White House has begun to concede that many Americans who buy their health insurance directly from companies on the open market will lose their current coverage, but counters that most of them will find better coverage on the exchanges, and at a lower net cost when subsidies for lower-income taxpayers are factored in. Cornered by a reporter on Monday, . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney admitted that 'there are going to . be changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act to create minimum . standards of coverage, minimum services that every insurance plan has to . provide.' 'So it's true,' he said, 'that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual . market that don't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not . qualify for the Affordable Care Act.' The National Center for Public Policy Research has chronicled recent news reports documenting 1.49 million policy cancellation notices that insurers have already sent customers in New Jersey, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Additional reports in  Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, the organization said, came without precise numbers. In California, the Los Angeles Times reports that the recipients of those letters are surprised to learn how much they would have to pay to stay insured without entering a government-run program. 'This is when the actual sticker shock comes into play for people,' Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told the Times. 'There are winners and losers under the Affordable Care Act.' How long are Americans' memories? Obama's 2009 American Medical Association speech, and the dozens that preceded and followed it, laid down a marker on consumer choice that he won't find it easy to escape . HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (L) will face congressional questions Wednesday about the Obamacare rollout and what it means for health insurance consumers. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner (R) will have her turn Tuesday. On Tuesday a key Obamacare administrator will testify in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing about the unrelated technical failures that have plagued Healthcare.gov, the Obamacare system's main website. Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will face tough questions about why the website was launched without adequate testing, and why her agency was tapped to coordinate the work of dozens of software contractors instead of a more experienced outside company. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will have her turn on the hot seat Wednesday, when she faces a hostile panel in a House Commerce and Energy Committee hearing. Sebelius's grilling will likely include broader questions about the Obamacare program. She was asked to appear in Congress last week but declined.","President Obama has promised for 4 years that individual health insurance policies will be 'grandfathered' in so they won't change under Obamacare .

It took the 31-year-old almost half an hour to reach the summit of 124ft-high statue, climbing narrow steps where a single misplaced move would have resulted in serious injury, or worse. Scroll down for video . The ultimate selfie? Travel company boss Lee Thompson was allowed to climb the 124ft-high Christ The Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, taking a selfie as he reached the top . Head for heights: It took the 31-year-old almost half an hour to reach the summit of 124-foot statue, climbing narrow steps where a single misplaced move would have resulted in serious injury, or worse . However, it was all worth it for the Londoner when he poked his head out of the top of the statue to be met by the sight of the sprawling city below. He then managed to take a photograph of himself in one of the greatest ever selfies. Mr Thompson, who co-founded group travel firm www.theflashpack.co.uk, said: 'I think it must be the first selfie from the top of Christ The Redeemer. 'The climb took 25 minutes. They had been repairing it after a lightning storm and we managed to convince the Brazilian tourist board to allow us to climb to the top.

'When I popped my head out of the top it took my breath away. The view really was incredible. It is the most fun selfie I've taken and one of my favourite photos. 'Everyone says it is crazy and it makes them feel sick just looking at it. 'I have had lots of messages from Brazilians who say it is something they have always wanted to do. 'Very few people have ever been able to do it.' Iconic: The Christ The Redeemer statue is one of Brazil's most famous landmarks, and will no doubt be visted by hundreds of football fans as they flock to the country for this month's World Cup . Iconic: Christ The Redeemer . Standing atop the 2,300ft-high  Corcovado mountain, overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the statue of Christ The Redeemer, or Cristo Redentor in Portuguese, is one of the South American country's most iconic landmarks. The statue, depicting Jesus Christ and used as a symbol of Brazilian Christianity, was the largest  Art Deco statue in the world when it was completed in 1931, a record which stood until 2010 when it was beaten by the Christ the King statue in Poland. The statue itself is 98ft tall, and it stands atop a 26ft pedestal. Its arms reach 92 ft wide and the statue, made out of reinforced concrete and soapstone, weighs 635 tonnes. Work began on the statue in 1922, after it was first proposed by Catholic priest Pedro Maria Boss in the mid-1850s, who requested money from Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil to build a large religious monument on Corcovado. However, the regent, ruling on behalf of her father Pedro II, was not keen on the idea and it was dismissed outright in 1889 when Brazil became a republic with laws mandating the separation of church and state. In 1920 a second scheme for a statue on the mountain was put forward by the Catholic Circle of Rio, funded by donations from Brazilian Catholics, and other designs considered included Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa designed the winning statue, which was then sculpted by Polish-French artist Paul Landowski, with the face created by Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931 and cost the equivalent of $250,000, worth around $3,300,000 in today's money. In October 2006, on the statue's 75th anniversary, Archbishop of Rio Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid consecrated a chapel named after the patron saint of Brazil - Nossa Senhora Aparecida, or 'Our Lady of the Apparition' - under the statue. This allows Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings at the site. The monument has been struck by lightning many times, including during an electrical storm in February 2008 where it suffered damage on the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government commenced a restoration project on the statue to replace part of the soapstone layers and repair its lightning rods. However, in January this year it was damaged again in a storm and a finger on the right hand was dislodged. Due to strong winds and erosion, as well as lightning, maintenance work is regularly carried out on the statue, and as the original stone used is increasingly rare replacement stones are darker in colour. The statue is one of the best-known symbols of Brazil and has featured in a number of films, music videos and television shows, including  Michael Jackson's They Don't Care About Us, the  disaster film 2012, in which it crumbles after an earthquake, animated films Rio and Rio 2, and television series Hustle.","Lee Thompson, 31, managed to convince the Brazilian tourist board to let him climb the statue in Rio de Janeiro .

"By . Chris Parsons . His epic and ultimately ill-fated trip to the South Pole is remembered for the demise of Captain Robert Scott in inhospitable Polar conditions. But 100 years on from history's most doomed expedition, the real horror experienced by Dr George Murray Levick has emerged - in the unlikely form of notes he took on the sexual habits of penguins. Amidst his incredible survival against the odds in the South Pole, Dr Levick made groundbreaking notes on the sexual shenanigans of the Adelie penguin, with findings so shocking they remained hidden for decades after. Rare: This picture of Adelie penguins in the South Pole was taken by expedition surgeon Dr Levick during his ill-fated trip to the Polar region a century ago . Documented: Dr Levick's observations of the penguins' deviant behaviour were chronicled in this logbook . Diarist: Dr Murray Levick in his finneskos - or reindeer boots (left) - and wrapped up against the elements (right), during the expedition in which he ended up stranded in the South Pole for eight months . Dr Levick's paper on penguin . behaviour revealed evidence of homosexual acts, sexual abuse of chicks . and even attempts by male penguins to mate with dead females. The . Edwardian explorer was so shocked by the findings in his paper, 'Sexual . Habits of the Adelie Penguin', that he initially recorded them in Greek . to make them inaccessible to the average reader. Dr . Levick observed how male Adelie penguins would gather in 'hooligan . bands of half a dozen or more and hang about the outskirts of the . knolls, whose inhabitants they annoy by their constant acts of . depravity'. To this day, Levick is the only scientist to have studied an entire breeding cycle at Cape Adare after he spent the Antarctic summer of 1911-12 there, according to the Guardian. The . expedition of Captain Robert Scott and his Terra Nova crew to the South . Pole is widely-known as the one of the most ill-fated in exploration . history. Captain Scott . had launched his bid to be the first man to reach the South Pole, but . perished with his companions in 1912 after being beaten to the pole by . the Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen. Dr . Levick, meanwhile, had been part of a crew assembled to support Captain . Scott, only to become trapped themselves off the coast as Scott marched . south into the heart of Antarctica. Incredibly, . Dr Levick and five colleagues kept themselves alive against all the . odds for eight month in an epic survival trip to Cape Evans. The men battled the perilous polar winter and survived in part by eating penguin meat and seal blubber. They . survived despite having been forced to spend an entire Antarctic winter . in an ice cave, unaware Captain Scott and four others had died. Captain Robert Scott and four others perished after reaching the South Pole on January 17, 1912 - only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them to it more than a month earlier. But Levick survived, despite having been forced with five others to spend an entire Antarctic winter in an ice cave with few supplies after the expedition ship, Terra Nova, was blocked by ice on its way to rescue them. Back in Britain, he published a paper called 'Natural History of the Adelie Penguin', but his findings about the species' astonishing sexual behaviour were considered so shocking that they were omitted. This material was used for a short separate study, 'Sexual Habits of the Adelie Penguin', that was privately passed around a few experts. The groundbreaking paper - which came around 50 years ahead of the next study on the subject - had been lost until the recent discovery of a copy by Douglas Russell, curator of birds at the Natural History Museum. Russell has had the paper published in the journal Polar Record along with an analysis of Levick's work, the Guardian said. Russell told The Observer, that the penguins' sexual inexperience is to blame for the antics that so disgusted Levick. 'Adelies gather at their colonies in October to start to breed. They have only a few weeks to do that and young adults simply have no experience of how to behave,' he explained. 'Hence the seeming depravity of their behaviour.' Dr Levick, who served in the Royal Navy . after his return from the South Pole, went on to found the British . Schools Exploring Society in 1932, and died in 1956.","Explorer's polar findings unearthed after decades .

"By . Paul Collins . Maybe this is a sign the US team has matured: While much of America celebrated advancing to the World Cup knockout stages, Michael Bradley thinks the accomplishment has to be viewed with perspective. 'It's something to be proud of, getting out of the group, especially given how difficult it was, but we want more,' the 26-year-old midfielder said. 'There's no feeling of satisfaction at the moment. We want to be here for another few games. We want to continue to push and push and see how far we can take this.' In the knockout stage of consecutive World Cups for the first time, the Americans play Belgium on Tuesday and hope to meet Argentina or Switzerland in the quarter-finals. Bradley said the US is proud to have survived a first-round group that included Germany, Portugal and Ghana. But he also concludes 'it's not anything yet.'

'You get to this point in the tournament and you understand that to keep it going and to take it even further, every guy has to find more,' he said. 'Every guy has to look at himself and physically find more to give, mentally be that much sharper.' Bradley hasn't scored any goals and has had some heavy touches in Brazil. But the son of former US coach Bob Bradley has been the tournament's Energizer Bunny. He covered 23.6 miles during the first round, the most at the World Cup. Asked whether he realised he'd nearly run a marathon in Brazil, Bradley offered a quick 'Ha!' and hustled to a practice field. His box-to-box efforts have made him a fan favourite, although the drop in his performance as he's been pushed higher up the field at the World Cup has led to some criticism. The American Outlaws chanted 'Michael Bradley! Michael Bradley!' after he was reprimanded by the referee for a studs-up tackle on Thomas Mueller in the 45th minute of Thursday's 1-0 loss to Germany. 'I am very, very satisfied with Michael in this tournament so far,' U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. 'I know that he has another gear in him.' After starting his career with the New York-New Jersey MetroStars, Bradley went on to play for Heerenveen, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Aston Villa, Chievo Verona and Roma before returning to Major League Soccer in January. His $6million (£3.52million) salary is the league's highest this year and his $6.5million (£3.82million) in total compensation is second to Seattle's Clint Dempsey, his American teammate.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Two members of Congress got into a shouting match Thursday over whether the error-plagued Obamacare Americans give up their privacy rights when they apply for health insurance through the federal government. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey unleashed a round of verbal Kung-Fu during a House hearing after Reps. Joe Barton of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee accused software contractors of violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPPA, by collecting Americans' personal information from Healthcare.gov. And one company official testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee that 2,000 employees have access to the information Americans give the Obamacare website when they apply for insurance. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'I will not yield to this monkey court or whatever this thing is!' yelled New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone during an exchange about data privacy on the Obamacare website . Texas Rep. Joe Barton insisted that the data-gathering at Healthcare.gov doesn't comply with health privacy laws . But 'HIPPA only applies when there's health information being provided,' Pallone insisted. 'That's not in play here today. No health information is required in the application process. And why is that? Because pre-existing conditions don't matter.' 'So once again here we have my Republican colleagues trying to scare everybody.' 'Will the gentleman yield?' Rep. Barton interrupted. 'No, I will not yield to this monkey court or whatever this thing is!' Pallone yelled. 'This is not a monkey court,' Barton countered. 'Do whatever you want!' Pallone added. 'I am not yielding.' Pallone acknowledged that Obamacare applicants are 'asked about your address, your date of birth,' but insisted that no one is asked to share 'health information.' And according to the Department of Health and Human Services, sharing even those kinds of data can violate HIPPA if it's within the context of a medical insurance transaction. Witnesses in Thursday's hearing included (L-R) Senior VP of CGI Federal Cheryl Campbell, group executive vice president for Optum/QSSI Andrew Slavitt, corporate counsel for Equifax Workforce Solutions Lynn Spellecy, and program director for Serco John Lau . Rep. Marsha Blackburn dug into privacy issues, forcing one corporate official to concede that 2,000 of his employees have access to private consumer data . HIPPA, passed in 1996, forbids doctors, hospitals, health care clearinghouses and health insurers – and their 'business associates' – from disclosing 'individually identifiable health information' related to anyone's medical records. California Rep. Anna Eshoo mocked the companies behind the crash-prone Obamacare website for blaming an unexpected traffic volume for their problems: 'Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas. And ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day' Information covered under the law, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 'includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).' John Lau, a program director at Serco – a company that helps the federal government determine if Obamacare applicants meet eligibility requirements – testified that '2,000 people' in his company have access to their applications, and that the information was retained for 30 days. 'You know,' countered Rep. Blackburn, 'under HIPPA regs, no one's supposed to have access to that database.' Equifax Workforce Solutions attorney Lynn Spellecy, whose company has been contracted to verify the income levels of Obamacare applicants who claim subsidies to pay for their insurance, described the kind of information that is changing hands. 'We are provided only with limited information: Social Security numbers, names and date of birth, which we use to match against our system,' she said. Barton first raised the privacy issue with a visual aid showing part of the Healthcare.gov 'source code,' the computer language that generates the Web page consumers see. 'You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system,' the text reads. 'At any time, and for any lawful Government purpose, the government may monitor, intercept, and search and seize any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system.  Any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system may be disclosed or used for any lawful Government purpose.' Serco program director John Lau (R) testified that 2,000 of his company's employees have access to consumers' information collected by the Obamacare website . Democrats on the panel claimed that since the text was buried in a part of the website's code that consumers can't see, it was meaningless. But Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president of CGI Federal, the main contractor for Healthcare.gov, testified that 'yes,' she was aware it was part of the website, and that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, made the decision to keep it hidden. Senior vice president of CGI Federal Cheryl Campbell came under fire as the chief developer behind Healthcare.gov . 'You were aware,' Barton continued. 'Okay, do you think that's HIPPA compliant? How can that be? You know it's not HIPPA compliant! Admit it – you're under oath!' 'That is CMS's decision to make,' Campbell shot back, 'what is public or not.' Campbell also accused CMS of botching the Obamacare website's pre-launch testing, saying that the government agency was solely responsible for testing Healthcare.gov once all the various contractors delivered their individual pieces of the project . 'CMS did the end-to-end testing,' she said, while acknowledging that the final result has produced unacceptable results. Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo wasn't impressed. 'This is the 21st Century. It's 2013.' Eshoo lectured Campbell. 'There are thousands of websites that handle concurrent volumes far larger than what Healthcare.gov was faced with.' Eshoo represents California's Silicon Valley region. 'You keep speaking about unexpected volumes, Ms. Campbell, and that really sticks in my craw. ... I think that's really kind of a lame excuse. Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas. And ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day.'","Verbal sparring erupted over whether Obamacare website vendors violated medical privacy laws by collecting personal information from applicants .

Mack Randall Wolford, pastor at the Full Gospel Apostolic House of the Lord Jesus in Matoaka, West Virginia, died hours after receiving the deadly bite on Sunday - the day after his 44th birthday. Wolford’s father, who was also a serpent-handling pastor, died in the same way nearly 30 years ago. Scroll down to watch a video of Wolford preaching . Deadly bite: Mack Randall Wolford, pictured at a previous service, was killed hours after receiving the deadly bite on Sunday. Wolford had been bitten three times . before, but never sought medical attention, saying that a bite was a . test of his faith. It was his wish not to be taken to a hospital unless . absolutely necessary. But by the time he was taken to Bluefield Regional Medical Center, it was too late. Wolford was holding a 'homecoming' service outdoors at Panther State Forest about 70 miles away from Matoaka while handing the rattler, which is seen by . his followers as a sign of faith. The gathering was a yearly occurrence for Wolford, who joined relatives to celebrate faith and family before sitting down together for dinner during the Memorial Day weekend. He leaves behind his wife Fran and three stepchildren. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reported that Wolford had set the serpent down during the service when it suddenly jerked forward and bit him on the thigh.

Ms Fowler said: 'It was pretty scary the first time I was at a service, but I've never seen him put anyone in a bad situation.' A young resident of Matoaka, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Telegraph: 'I know [Wolford] was really bad off before he died... it was really bad. He’s worshiped at that church all his life. Fearless: Wolford did his best to make guests at his services feel comfortable, even though he handled venomous snakes . 'His daddy passed away the same way, from a rattler. He knew the risks. All of us around here are that way.' Wolford was only 15 at the time of his father's death, but later took on his mantle. His devastated mother, who was present at the service when he was bitten, was always fearful for her son, but was extremely proud of his work with those who battled alcoholism and addiction, Ms Fowler said. There are dozens of species of rattlesnakes across the U.S., and they are the largest among venomous snakes. They usually only sound their noisy rattles if they feel cornered, threatened or taken by surprise. Rattlesnake bites are usually not fatal, as long as they are treated quickly. If bitten, victims are advised to remain calm, as a quickened heart rate can spread the venom throughout the body faster. Rattlesnakes love to sun themselves, and can be found near logs, boulders, or open areas, and in areas like mountains, prairies, deserts, and beaches, according to the CDC. A nursing supervisor at Bluefield Regional Medical Center told the Charleston Daily Mail that Wolford was admitted to the facility at about 10:30pm on Sunday night. The supervisor told the paper: 'He was a snake handler. It looked like it happened maybe during church, but by the time he got here, it was a bad situation.' Ms Fowler was in the process of a final edit With Signs Following, but is still deciding how to approach Wolford's death in the documentary. Neighbours told the Daily Telegraph that Wolford, like other snake-handling preachers, was fully aware of the danger posed by the reptile. There are dozens of species of rattlesnakes, which are the largest of all venomous snakes in the U.S, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The timber rattlesnake, widely regarded as the most dangerous of the species, are common to deciduous forests as far north as Connecticut and as far south as Texas. It is unlawful to kill a timber rattlesnake, as it is an endangered species. While rattlers are behind the most common snakebite injuries in the United States, they are rarely fatal if treated quickly.

"By . James Gordon . Rental robber: Kayla Michelle Finley, 27, ended up spending the night in jail after police busted her for failing to return a Jennifer Lopez movie she rented nine years ago . She rented the film Monster-In-Law, but this woman might be thinking the law is a monster, in this case. Kayla Michelle Finley, 27, ended up spending a night in jail for failing to return a video rental she took out in 2005. Cops in Pickens Country in South Carolina say Ms Finley was sent a warning letter nine years ago that asked her to return the movie. When she ignored the demand, a warrant was issued for her arrest. Ms Finley was put behind bars for the night after she went to the police station to report a crime. She was charged with petit larceny and failing to return a rented video cassette. It was when officers were taking her personal details, they noticed the outstanding warrant. Adding to the bizarre set of circumstances Ms. Finley faced, the rental shop, Dalton's video, has long since closed down. When Ms. Finley didn't return the movie nine years earlier, the business owner went to a Pickens County magistrate who issued an arrest warrant. T'was 2005: It was nine years ago that Monster-in-Law came out and it was then Ms. Finley forgot to return the video she rented . Never forget: Despite the rental shop having closed long ago, the warrant for Ms Finley's arrest was still outstanding . The tape was taken out on a three-day rental and was supposed to be returned after 72 hours. She was apparently sent several certified letters to turn herself in but ignored them all. Ms Finley denied ever receiving the warnings, and said she would fight the charges delivering a scathing message towards the sheriff's department. 'It’s obvious that Pickens County has nothing better to do,' Finley told Fox News reported. 'I fully intend on fighting this, it’s ridiculous I had this happen to me,' she said. Deputies say that whilst businesses may come and go, outstanding warrants never expire. A judge issued a $2,000 personal recognizance bond Friday morning, and she was released. Romantic comedy Monster-in-Law starred Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda.

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Nick Mcdermott . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy on Sunday when he made a public speech - the first time he had been seen in two months . George Galloway was last night attacked by the leader of his own party over a controversial claim that a rape allegation against WikiLeaks campaigner Julian Assange amounted to no more than bad ‘sexual etiquette’. Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob branded Mr Galloway’s comments as ‘deeply disappointing and wrong’ as the Bradford West MP faced growing criticism of his remarks. In a posting on her website, she said the ‘political issues’ surrounding Mr Assange’s case should not be used to diminish the seriousness of the accusations against him. She said: ‘Let me be clear, as a politician and as a woman. Rape occurs when a woman has not consented to sex. George Galloway’s comments on what constitutes rape are deeply disappointing and wrong. ‘There are many political issues entwined in the case of Julian Assange. These issues cannot be used to diminish in any way the seriousness of any allegations against him.’ The woman at the centre of the allegation, who is a WikiLeaks supporter, told police she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, without her consent and without using a condom. Mr Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had had sex and were ‘already in the sex game’. He later defended his comments, saying he did not believe the accusations against Assange would have led to rape prosecution in Britain. Scroll down for video . The accused sex attacker talks with his legal adviser Balthasar Garcon, right, inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London on Sunday . He said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a set-up. What occurred is not rape as most people understand it.’ Mr Galloway faced a barrage of criticism after rape charities reacted with fury to his comments. The Respect candidate in the upcoming . Manchester Central by-election, Kate Hudson, echoed the criticism from . her leader, writing on Twitter: ‘I am with you Salma.’ Bradford West MP George Galloway said the accusations against Assange  do no amount to rape . Businessman Lord Sugar wrote on the . social networking site: ‘Galloway entitled to speak mind, like all off . us.He has no factual detail of the alleged crime committed by Assange, . so should shut his trap.’ However, some of Assange’s supporters . defended his viewpoint. Financier Ben Goldsmith, 31, whose sister Jemima . Khan has supported Assange, sent out a Twitter message yesterday, . saying: ‘I’m with @georgegalloway on Assange. Trumped up Swedish “rape” charges are a ruse to get him to an American jail. Scary stuff.’ Mr Goldsmith later appeared to have deleted the tweet. Another Assange supporter, former . British diplomat Craig Murray, prompted further anger when he appeared . to name one of the women who has accused Assange, during a live . television debate on Newsnight. Under British law, any alleged victim of . rape or sexual attack is entitled to anonymity. The BBC later removed the Newsnight episode from its iPlayer repeat service. Louise Mensch, the outgoing . Conservative MP for Corby, said on Twitter: ‘You can tell a lot about a . man by his supporters. Assange has Galloway and Craig Murray.’ A lawyer for Assange’s alleged victims . yesterday called his ‘absurd’ attempts to avoid answering rape . accusations an abuse of international asylum rules. Asylum laws existed . to protect the vulnerable from persecution and torture and should not be . used to avoid legitimate criminal investigations, Swedish lawyer Claes . Borgstrom said. Mr Borgstrom, who represents the two . women at the centre of the case in Sweden, said: ‘It’s an abuse of the . asylum instrument, the purpose of which is to protect people from . persecution and torture… it’s not about that here. ‘He doesn’t risk being handed over to . the United States for torture or death penalty. He should be brought to . justice in Sweden. This is completely absurd.’ Assange, 41, denies the accusations . but claims he cannot defend himself against them because of fears he . would be handed over to the US because of his role in the publication of . thousands of leaked diplomatic cables. After his last legal challenge failed, . he skipped bail to claim asylum from Ecuador in June, and has since . been in the country’s embassy in Knightsbridge, West London.","Swedish lawyer Claes Borgstrom labelled situation 'absurd'

"By . Alex Greig . George Zimmerman says he is suffering from post-traumatic stress and is homeless after his trial for the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. He made the claims to journalist Ilia Calderón, who interviewed him for the Spanish language current affairs show Aqui y Ahora which will air on Univision on Sunday at 7pm. During the interview, Zimmerman also claimed that Martin threatened to kill him before he shot and killed the unarmed 17-year-old. 'Sad. Very sad': How George Zimmerman described himself in the recent interview with Ilia Calderón . 'When he saw my handgun and looked at it and told me that he was going to kill me that night, uh, that was enough of a threat after the way he had attacked me. So, I felt his hand going for my weapon,' Zimmerman said, reports the Orlando Sentinal. When asked how he feels now, Zimmerman responded 'Sad. Very sad.' Zimmerman was found not guilty of murder in the controversial case in 2013. Insight: Zimmerman told Calderón that he receives death threats due to bad media coverage, not the fact that he shot Trayvon Martin . He told Calderón that after shooting Martin, his main concern was that he had missed his target. 'I was afraid it had gone through his clothes and that it was going to go... get lost, and, um, you know, go into a house and - because the young man was still talking to me, as I have said. So I thought that it hadn't... affected him, and I got worried, and I said, ""I hope that it hasn't - that the bullet hasn't hit a neighbor,""' Zimmerman said. The much-maligned former insurance salesman who has recently taken to selling his unique art on eBay said he was '100 per cent' sure of his actions that night, and that had he not shot Martin, the teen would have killed him. International notoriety: Zimmerman's case became known around the world . Zimmerman said that he has had death threats since the trial, which he put down to his portrayal in the media and not his shooting of a teenaged boy. Zimmerman told Calderón that he can no longer lead a normal life and must wear a bullet-proof vest when he is out in public. Describing himself as 'totally homeless,' Zimmerman said his family helps him 'a lot.'","George Zimmerman was interviewed for the Spanish-language show Aqui y Ahora .

"By . Mark Duell . Updated: . 02:09 EST, 15 July 2011 . It’s a city already renowned for its traffic jams - but just wait to see what happens this weekend. Los Angeles is bracing itself for gridlock, road rage and other traffic nightmares when a ten-mile stretch of a vital road is closed down and causes what is already being billed as ‘Carmageddon’. Thousands of doctors and nurses will bunk at hospitals, an emergency operation centre will be set up and Southern California residents are being urged to stay home and stock up on food. Pile-up: Traffic on Interstate 405 is seen from the Sherman Oaks Galleria mall car park on Wednesday in Los Angeles, California, ahead of the 53-hour shutdown from Friday evening . Construction site: This photo shows the Mulholland Drive bridge over Interstate 405, which crosses the Santa Monica Mountains connecting the San Fernando Valley and the Westside of Los Angeles . Chaos is expected when a ten-mile stretch of Interstate 405, which links population centres north and south of the Santa Monica Mountains, is shutting down for 53 hours this weekend. Celebrity actors are among those sounding the alarm to residents of the car-dependent area, via Twitter messages urging residents to stay off the road starting at midnight Friday. Tom Hanks tweeted: ‘This weekend, LA! Avoid Carmageddon, Gas-zilla, 405-enstein, Grid-lock-apalooza! STAY HOME. Eat & shop local.’ Ashton Kutcher and Erik Estrada also made warnings. Authorities are hammering the same message to drivers, with freeway electronic signs flashing from last month, warning drivers to ‘EXPECT BIG DELAYS’. Actors: Tom Hanks, left, tweeted, and Ashton Kutcher, right, was recruited by officials to warn motorists . No driving: This map shows the planned closure of Interstate 405 in Los Angeles this weekend . ‘The best thing is to stay home if you can, don't drive if you don't have to,’ said Michael Miles, of the California Department of Transportation. ‘Be prepared, treat it like it's a disaster.’ Moshe Shmuel is expecting 120 guests at his wedding on Saturday. He is worried some people flying in from Israel and South Africa may have trouble getting from the airport to the ceremony in Bel Air. He told his guests to leave extra early so they can show up on time. ‘Lucky for us, the rabbi lives close-by,' he said. 'He doesn't need to take the freeway.' On a typical July weekend, about 500,0000 vehicles use the section of the freeway, known locally as the 405, to get to major destinations such as the airport, beaches and interchanges to other roads. But transport officials say a full shutdown is necessary to replace the 50-year-old Mulholland Bridge as part of a $1billion project to widen an often-bottlenecked segment through the Sepulveda Pass. Even if residents can get through this weekend without any trouble, transport authorities expect another closure next year to replace the other half of the span. Transit officials will offer free rides on the subway and certain bus lines and add more train service. Mapped out: Local detour rotes for the closed freeway are shown ahead of the road closures in Los Angeles . Other ideas: This regional detour map shows how drivers can get around  Los Angeles this weekend . Officials are stressing real public safety concerns exist, with helipads cleared for air ambulances and 200 extra firemen and paramedics on duty - and some of them positioned along the closed freeway. Four big hospitals near the freeway on the city's west side are setting up cots and putting thousands of doctors, nurses and medical personnel in hotels and dormitories so they can get to work on time. The UCLA Health System placed advanced orders for medical supplies and food, with three helicopter firms on standby to transport patients and organs in the event of emergency operations. Rebuilding: Construction workers reinforce the hillside during the Interstate 405 widening project near the Mulholland Bridge which is slated to be demolished during the shutdown of Interstate 405 . Construction workers reinforce the hillside as Los Angeles city officials are advising residents to stay home or stay away from the area over the weekend and fearing massive traffic jams . Closure: Traffic flows relatively freely last Sunday on Interstate 405 beneath the Mulholland Drive bridge in Los Angeles near sunset - but that will change when 10 miles of the vital artery is closed this weekend . Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is urging residents to stay close to home and shop locally if they must go out, asking all local residents to ‘chip in and turn this Carmageddon into a unique opportunity’. One helicopter firm is advertising $150 rides to zip people to downtown and the airport. And JetBlue is providing $4-$5, half-hour ‘Over the 405’ flights between Long Beach Airport and Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, calling it a ‘planepool’ between the San Fernando Valley and beach. But the 600 seats available on the four flights - two each going in either direction - sold out within three hours after the promotion was launched on Wednesday, the airline said.

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Daniel Martin . As Ecuador harbours Julian Assange at its London embassy, Britain is continuing to send the Latin American nation foreign aid handouts. Assange gave an Evita-style speech from the balcony of the embassy on Sunday which was a deliberate taunt to British justice. His self-imposed exile is costing British taxpayers up to £50,000 a day in policing costs as scores of officers lay siege to the building. Taunting British justice: Assange gave his speech from the Ecuadorian Embassy balcony on Sunday as more than 100 police watched on, powerless to arrest him because he did not leave the building . Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday faced demands to stop Britain’s aid programme in Ecuador in protest at its support for the WikiLeaks fugitive. Britain funded more than £3.3million in aid to Ecuador in the ten years up to 2010, and continues to give around £60,000 a year. Yesterday more than 20 uniformed police were stationed outside the embassy in Knightsbridge, despite only a handful of protesters remaining. With shift changes that means at least 60 officers a day are sucked into the stalemate. On Sunday more than 100 were drafted in to police Assange’s balcony speech, but were powerless to arrest him because he did not leave the building. Stop aid to Ecuador: Foreign Secretary William Hague faced demands to stop Britain's aid programme in Ecuador in protest for its support of the Wikileaks founder . Costing taxpayers: Assange's self-imposed exile is costing British taxpayers up to £50,000 a day in policing costs as scores of officers constantly monitor the building . The WikiLeaks founder is wanted in Sweden to face rape and sexual assault charges, and Britain’s Supreme Court has ruled he should be extradited. But the 41-year-old Australian broke his bail conditions to claim asylum inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in June and has remained inside the mansion block for more than two months. Protest: Ecuador's president Rafael Correa has accused Britain of threatening to storm its embassy . Britain has vowed to arrest him if he steps outside but cannot send police into the embassy under the terms of the Vienna Convention. Dozens of officers have surrounded the building for days to ensure he is not smuggled out and the Foreign Secretary has made it clear he will not be allowed safe passage out of the country. The impasse has left Britain in a diplomatic stand-off with Ecuador, which has won support across South America. At a meeting of the Union of South . American Nations yesterday, foreign  ministers issued a statement which . ‘condemned the threat of the use of force between states’ and reiterated . ‘the right of states to concede asylum’. Ecuador’s . president Rafael Correa has accused Britain of threatening to storm its . embassy after the Foreign Office said it could rescind the building’s . diplomatic protection. Between 2000 and 2010 the UK gave more than . £3.3million to Ecuador to pay for ‘climate change awareness, . environmental protection, children and human rights, gender, democracy . and good governance issues’. Douglas . Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘We spend a lot of money on aid . abroad trying to buy friends. But surely we should have learned that the . more you pay people, the more they despise you. Britain’s aid budget has become totally detached from the priorities of taxpayers, whose money it is. Crowded: Hundreds of supporters, journalists and police officers filled the Knightsbridge street to listen to Assange speak . Granted asylum: Ecuador gave Assange asylum because Britain and Sweden refused to guarantee they would not extradite him to the US where he could face life in prison or death over leaked diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks . ‘Pensioners in my constituency will struggle to heat their homes this winter. What officials decide to spend money to raise awareness of climate change in Ecuador, when my constituents cannot keep themselves warm in winter?’ Ecuador said it granted asylum to Assange because neither Britain nor Sweden would guarantee that they would not extradite him to the US. The former computer hacker enraged Washington in 2010 when WikiLeaks published 251,287 leaked diplomatic cables. His supporters fear he has been secretly indicted by a grand jury in America and that he could face life in prison or even the death penalty. However the Obama administration yesterday accused Assange of making ‘wild assertions’ about US persecution to deflect attention from the Swedish sex allegations. In Downing Street, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Under our law, having exhausted all the options of appeal, we are obliged to extradite him to Sweden. It is our intention to carry out that obligation.’ 'Wild assertions': Obama's administration accused the Australian of making 'wild assertions' about US persecution to deflect attention from the sex allegations in Sweden .","Foreign Secretary William Hague faces demands to cut aid to Ecuador .

"By . Joel Christie . When a strange man attempted to force his way into her Minneappolis apartment early in the morning, Faye Lewis called 911. However the call was automatically patched five states away to the New York emergency center- and no one can give her an answer why. The singer and bartender had finished work at her bar job after a busy night and had got home late around 4.30am when the incident occurred last month. 'A few minutes after I got in, there was pounding on my door and someone trying to jiggle my door handle,' she told CBS. 'It was so bizarre ... I dont know how it happened': Faye Lewis has been left without any answers as to why her 911 call for help from Minneapolis went straight through to a call center in New York City . Faye Lewis, a bartender and singer, had returned home late from work when a man started pounding on the door and 'jiggling the handle' of her apartment in Loring Park, Minneapolis . After calling 911 and giving her address, the operator was confused. 'She asked me again what borough do I live in, and I’m like Loring Park,' Lewis told the station. 'I was like I live in Minneapolis and she’s like ''Oh, you dialed 911 in New York''.’ The Minneapolis 911 call center is less than two miles from Lewis' apartment. The NYPD center, in Queens, is over 1,200 miles away. Lewis hung up and tried to call again, but the same thing happened. Fortunately, the New York operator contacted her Minneapolis counterparts with the emergency. Police arrived at the scene in about 30 minutes. However neither Lewis' cell provider, T Mobile, or the city of Minneapolis could provide answers over what went wrong with the call. Faye Lewis is a singer and bartender and says she is lucky her emergency was not more urgent . Luckily for Lewis, the NYPD operator contacted Minneapolis, and police arrived at the apartment block . About 70 percent of 911 calls are now made from cell phones. When someone dials 911, the GPS chip of their phone usually connects them to to the nearest call center. The signal goes via a sattelite. When calling from outside, the signal has a clear path, however when calling from inside a building or home, the signal can be muffled. Operators ask for a location first for this reason. Find Me 911 is a coalition based in Washington D.C. that is pushing the government to upgrade the country's 911 system. Director Jamie Barnett told CBS that the technology for the upgrade is readily available but not being used. 'This is a public safety crisis, really,' Barnett said. The Federal Communications Commission is supposed to implement new rules for indoor cell phone standards by fall.","Faye Lewis had returned home late from her work to her apartment in Loring Park, Minneapolis, about 4.30am .

Dolphins are rightly known as being one of the most acrobatic species of sea creature – but 32 humans recently proved they can give them a run for their money, with a little help from some cutting edge technology. They were performing at the first-ever Flyboard North American Championship in Toronto at the weekend. The Flyboard was only invented three years ago – by Frenchman Franky Zapata – so the fact that there is already a world championship for riders shows just what a splash the devices have made. Scroll down for videos . Power: Thrust for the Flyboard comes from a 'personal water craft' that creates jets of water . Nautical but nice: Competitors at the Flyboard World Championship in Toronto had three and a half minutes to impress judges . VIP: One of the judges was Flyboard inventor Franky Zapata . Riders are able to perform incredible nautical gymnastics by strapping themselves into two boots and powering themselves into the air using jets of water. Thrust comes from a PWC – or personal water craft – with a minimum of 100 horse power. Water is pumped by this engine through a hose that runs into a board the rider stands on and gushes out of the jets beneath it. The pilot, using a throttle, controls the power of the water, allowing him or her to rise up to 35 feet in the air. Video courtesy YouTube . Flyboys: The pilots are able to swoop in and out of the water . Making waves: The sport of Flyboarding is growing fast . Up, up and away: This competitor in Toronto looks down at the water far below . They can plummet below the surface by cutting the power, then shoot out again by snapping it back on. Mr Zapata was one of the judges at Sunday’s competition, in which competitors with names such as the Super Dolphin and the Swagged Out Dolphin, had three and a half minutes to score points using showmanship, amplitude, technique, diversity and energy. West Virginia Flyboard veteran Aaron Gould told The Toronto Star: ‘Being up there flying around is every man’s dream. You feel like a real superhero.’ The winner of Sunday’s competition was Damone Rippy of Texas.","The Flyboard was invented three years ago by Frenchman Franky Zapata .

"By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent In Wellington . 'Inevitable': Sir Don McKinnon said New Zealand had been moving to renounce the Royal Family 'for a long time' Just hours before the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George, a leading New Zealand politician has warned it is ‘inevitable’ the country will become a republic. Former deputy prime minister Sir Don McKinnon, who was also secretary general of the Commonwealth for eight years, said the country had been moving to renounce the Royal Family ‘for a long time’. ‘There are 54 countries in the Commonwealth, only 16 are realms [where the Queen is head of state], and I can tell you now that one Caribbean publicly, and three Caribbean privately, are probably going to give up the relationship with the monarchy when the Queen dies,’ he said. ‘So it is a diminishing group of countries and the important thing is for us to openly and candidly debate the issue.’ Asked when New Zealand might go down the same road, Sir Don added: ‘I don’t know when… [but] I think it is inevitable. I’m quite certain the royal family understands that completely.’ Prince William, wife Kate and their son, Prince George, were today on a flight heading Down Under to begin a landmark three week tour of both New Zealand and Australia, another country where the republican cause is strong. Scroll down for video . Family: Prince William, wife Kate and their son, Prince George, were today on a flight heading Down Under to begin a landmark three week tour of both New Zealand and Australia . The Mail understands that they are travelling First Class, along with George’s new Spanish nanny, Maria Theresa Turrion Burallo, 43, and a fulsome security detail, on a Quantas flight via Dubai. Tickets cost around £6,300 return. The plane is due to land in Sydney early tomorrow morning, allowing the royal party to transfer to a New Zealand Royal Air Force jet which will transport them for the first leg of their tour. The bill for all flights associated with the tour is being met by local taxpayers. While the trip has prompted huge excitement on the other side of the world – with 450 members of the media accredited to cover it - it has not been without the odd hiccup. First there was a diplomatic falling out with the King of the Maoris who angrily rejected a meeting with the couple when he discovered they could only spare him 90 minutes out of their busy schedule. King Tuheitia accused government officials of treating him like a ‘carnival act’. Now a row has erupted over a £260 child car seat fitted in Prince George’s official car, according to the New Zealand Herald. Pricey trip: The Mail understands that the Royal Family are were travelling First Class on a Quantas flight via Dubai (file picture). Tickets cost around £6,300 return . The Max-Cosi Tobi safety seat was installed by Plunket, a charity which provides services and support to parents and young children. The organisation has organised a meet and greet with other babies of a similar age for Prince George at Government House in Wellington on Wednesday. At William and Kate’s specific request, the charity last week installed the child seat facing outwards in the royal limo. In the UK that would be perfectly acceptable as government guidelines state that babies and infants only need to be carried in rear-facing seats until they can sit up unaided – something eight-month-old George is now able to do - and have exceeded the maximum weight for the seat. But in New Zealand, Plunket, which is a hugely influential group, is very vocal about its own guidelines which recommend children remain in rear-facing car seats until the age of two. Rear facing seats significantly reduce the risk of death or injury, protecting the baby’s head, neck and spine. Key event: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their son Prince Georgea at his christening last October . It even proudly issued photographs of its services technician Aethalia O’Connor fitting George’s car seat and saying: ‘If it can’t be installed correctly we need to work out a way we can make it correct. We need to make sure the baby is safe.’ Response to the photograph was immediate with hundreds of parents going online to complain about double standards. Helen Lawrence said on the Plunket Facebook page: ‘They [William and Kate] have made an irresponsible decision about facing their baby forwards in the car. ‘ . Michelle Green added: ‘You went against everything you recommended, undoing all your hard work regarding rear facing until two.’ Last night, however, the society was unapologetic. Chief executive Jenny Prince said Plunket's role was ‘to provide advice and work in partnership with parents’ to make informed decisions that worked best for them. ‘ . Proud parents: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, with their newborn son in July of last year . He added: ‘Plunket's priority is to . ensure car seats are installed by qualified car seat technicians to . ensure they perform correctly. While Plunket recommend that children . stay in rear-facing seats until age two, it is not a legal requirement.’ The latest action-packed tour reflects the ‘outdoorsy and sporty’ people that William and Kate are. There is an eclectic mix of events including a trek around Uluru (Ayers Rock), a fast-boat river ride and meeting some of the All Blacks Rugby World Cup champions. The couple will also participate in a boat race - on opposing teams. They will also meet Sir Peter Jackson, maker of the Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. But the visit also includes more formal events with politicians and military personnel - though there are no black tie occasions. And no royal tour would be complete without the ceremonial planting of a tree. Kate will also visit children's hospices in each country - continuing her charitable interest in palliative care for youngsters. In New Zealand the royals will visit Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch among other places. Australian highlights include Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra - but not Melbourne or Perth. The royal couple will arrive at Wellington Airport in the early hours of tomorrow before receiving a formal welcome from the Governor General of New Zealand Jerry Mateparae at Government House in the capital Wellington. Rebecca Deacon, Kate's private secretary, Mr Head, three press officers, a tour secretary, an orderly and adviser Sir David Manning will be part of the royal party during the tour. The royal entourage will also include a hairdresser and a personal assistant. Plunket . spokesman Zac Prendergast said he had spoken to Miss O'Connor, and . stressed that the seat was installed ‘in line with the parents' preferences’. Although the . three week trip, undertaken on behalf of the Queen, has been more than a . year in the planning, it has very much been designed with baby George . in mind, according to aides. And instead of hawking themselves from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, William and Kate will base their young son in three different ‘hubs’: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra. The arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see George almost every night – bar a stop-over in Queenstown, New Zealand, and another at Ayers Rock in Australia. ‘It’s a long way to go and [would mean] a long time away from their son,’ the couple’s private secretary, Miguel Head, said earlier this month. ‘The tour has been designed with Prince George’s consideration and comfort in mind. ‘Taking a nine month old on a Royal tour is not a first, but it has not happened in this Royal Family’s context for many, many years so there has been much to think about – as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise.’ Royal aides have warned that George’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no-one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11-hour time difference. Sources have told the Mail that the little prince is also teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability. But he is, generally, a happy little boy say friends of the couple, who is adept to taking everything in his stride – including, hopefully, the large crowds waiting for their first glimpse of the future king. William's last official trip to New Zealand and Australia was in March 2011, when he visited Christchurch, shortly after it suffered an earthquake, and the Australian states of Queensland and Victoria, which had been hit by floods. In January 2010 he represented the Queen at the opening of the Supreme Court building in Wellington and also visited Auckland, and during the same trip travelled to Melbourne and Sydney.","Sir Don McKinnon says country is moving to renounce Royal Family .

"By . Hugo Gye . As the internet begins to exert more and more control over our lives, it brings with it an increasingly destructive problem - the rise of online porn. The issue is perhaps most damaging when it affects the lives of teenagers, who can be at risk of ruining their adolescence with an addiction to hardcore material. And some parents are taking drastic steps to reform their porn-addict sons - by sending them off to a desert 'boot camp' to help them overcome their troubling behaviour. Pioneering: Oxbow Academy in Utah aims to tackle teenage boys' 'sexual behavioural issues' Dorms: The teens are made to sleep in military-style bunk beds during their stay at the facility . Oxbow Academy, in Utah, is a rehabilitation facility dedicated to teenage boys who have exhibited 'sexual behavioural issues'. These 'issues' can include a wide variety of problems - some of the boys there have been accused of voyeurism or even assaulting other children. But perhaps the fastest-growing category of offender is the online porn fanatic - leading some to dub the academy 'Porn School', according to the Sunday Mirror. The pioneering facility is in a converted church, with inmates sleeping in bunk beds situated in two large dormitories. Education: Oxbow has a number of high school teachers on its staff, and the boys attending several hours of schooling each day after undergoing therapy . Computer access: But the teens are blocked from all websites except online encyclopaedias . When parents send their sons off to the $9,000-a-month facility, they are committing the teens to a tough regime designed to shake them out of their destructive habits. Around two dozen boys are subjected to therapy, chores - and, of course, a ban on phone and internet use. The teens, aged between 13 and 17, must spend their days in counselling sessions, joined once a week by their parents via Skype - and after a full day of therapy, the boys attend academic classes until 9pm. The weekends are taken up with homework and chores such as laundry, although the troubled residents also get the chance to go horse riding in the wilderness around the town of Wales where Oxbow is located. While there are computers at the school, they are modified so that the only websites accessible from them are online encyclopaedias. Dining room: The residents are subjected to a rural and simple lifestyle in the Utah wilderness . Group therapy: Music is one of the extra-curricular activities intended to help them overcome their problems . The teenagers are encouraged to open up about their past problems - and are even subjected to a lie detector test to ensure they are not concealing anything from the therapists. Stephen Schultz, director of Oxbow Academy, told the Sunday Mirror that the boys - some of whom have been convicted of sex attacks - were like drug addicts going through withdrawal. 'Most porn addicts get agitated when they're deprived of their online sources,' he said. 'But one boy from Chicago actually got the shakes, like a drug abuser. He was in very poor shape when he arrived. He'd been on his computer 10 to 12 hours a day looking at porn. 'He wasn't eating, he was dehydrated, had poor hygiene. He'd done nothing but watch porn.' He is adamant that his school's regime is the best way for teenagers to begin a life without online porn, and encourages them to 'disclose the most shameful stuff' in an effort to move on from their past. Obsession: Addiction to internet porn is a growing threat to young people (picture posed by model) Most boys at Oxbow stay for at least a year, and they frequently graduate high school from the facility, which employs several qualified teachers. Mr Schultz believes that the increasing sexualisation of modern culture means that places like his will become ever more popular among desperate parents. 'Sex is everywhere,' he said. 'When I was growing up if someone said they were bisexual it was shocking. 'Now threesomes and depraved sexual behaviour is all over the internet, and children see those images before they develop into adolescents.'","Oxbow Academy is dedicated to tackling 'sexual behavioural issues'

Taken from Pakistan by an amateur astronomer it reveals the effects of our atmosphere as its light gets refracted - causing its colour to change. The image show Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky (as seen from Earth), photographed as a timelapse from Pakistan . Sirius, also known as the Dog Star or Sirius A, is the brightest star in Earth's night sky. It means 'glowing' in Greek and is outshone only by several planets as well as the International Space Station. Because Sirius is so bright, it was well-known to the ancients. What came as a surprise to astronomers was the discovery of a companion star, Sirius B, in 1862. The companion is so much dimmer than Sirius — 10,000 times, in fact — that it wasn't until 2005 that astronomers were able to estimate its mass. It is highly visible in the Northern Hemisphere winter night sky because it has a high relative luminosity to other stars, and it's relatively close to Earth (8.6 light-years). If the star were placed next to Earth's sun, Sirius would outshine it more than 20 times over. Astronomer Roshaan Bukhari from Pakistan said he took the image to try and capture just how colours stars can appear. 'The twinkling of Sirius had always fascinated me and since I had a telescope, looking at the brilliant star through an eyepiece was even more remarkable,' he told MailOnline. 'The twinkling suddenly appeared to be more intense and I could faintly detect some slight but very rapid changes in colours of the blue/white star. Bukhari used a 70mm telescope to capture the image, holding the camera with one hand and the eyepiece of the telescope in the other hand. 'I placed the camera near the telescope eyepiece and I could see Sirius in my camera viewfinder. It was of course out of focus for the camera's lens. Sirius as we normally see it: Looking south over the Somerset sky, low and fast moving clouds reflect light pollution from street lighting, as the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius (the Dog Star) rises low above St. Michael's Tower on Glastonbury Tor . 'I manually set Sirius in focus for the camera and held the eyepiece with the other hand and started to move the eyepiece in a circular manner,' he explained. 'The camera recorded whatever fell on it's sensors for 2 seconds. and when the shot was done, I checked to see what it had captured and this is the image it produced.' He said he considered the image to be art. 'This image is the first experience I had with how our atmosphere plays around with star light in fascinating ways. 'Ask yourself how different is this from an abstract art painting and you would not find it to be very different at all.'","Image was taken by an amateur astronomer from Pakistan .

The Duke of Cambridge was seen holding a kangaroo bag for his son as he waited to board a flight to New Zealand. The Australian Koala Foundation is one of the stockists of the bag and sold out of its remaining stock of the bag this morning. Scroll down for video . Joey for George: Prince William can be seen holding his young son's kangaroo backpack as they wait to board the flight to New Zealand . Within hours of Prince William being photographed with the bag, demand for the rucksack soared . CEO Deborah Tabart said while the organisation did not give the young prince the backpack, it would be more than happy to offer him a koala bag as a gift. 'We sold the last ones (kangaroo bags) this morning - we've had to take them off the website but we'll ordering more today,' she said. Ms Tabert said the sudden rush of orders for the kangaroo bag, which was selling for $12.50, was a result of the Prince William seen carrying one. With the bag stocked at numerous outlets, Ms Tabart said there was no way of knowing how Prince Willian go it, but she offered him an invitation to become the patron of the organisation on the back of his interest in conservation.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Learning to read Braille - the tactile writing system used by people who are blind and visually impaired - is notoriously difficult. To make this a little easier, researchers have designed vibrating gloves that help people learn to read and write Braille with minimal effort. Vibrating motors at the knuckle of each finger in the gloves buzz to tell a wearer to press a corresponding key, and the system tells them which letter they are typing. Life could get a little easier for visually impaired people as scientists from Georgia Tech have created vibrating gloves (pictured) which have help them learn to read Braille more easily. The process is based on a technique known as passive haptic learning, and means wearers can learn Braille even if they're not paying full attention . And the gloves even teach the wearer when they are not paying attention. ‘The process is based on passive haptic learning (PHL),’ said Thad Starner, a Georgia Tech professor who is also the technical lead on Google’s Project Glass. ‘We’ve learned that people can acquire motor skills through vibrations without devoting active attention to their hands.’ Professor Starner and PhD student Caitlyn Seim put the gloves to the test to examine how well this technique can be used to teach Braille. Each participant wore a pair of gloves with tiny vibrating motors stitched into the knuckles. The motors vibrated in a sequence that corresponded with the typing pattern of a pre-determined phrase in Braille, while audio cues let the users know the Braille letters produced by typing that sequence. Nearly 40 million people worldwide are blind, but because Braille (stock image pictured) lessons are widely neglected in schools, only 10 per cent of those who are blind learn the language . Scientists at Georgia Tech stitched tiny vibrating motors into the knuckles of each finger in the gloves. When one of the motors vibrates, the wearer presses a corresponding key and the system tells them which letter they are typing. The gloves were tested on people who had never learned Braille before. After an initial lesson, participants were distracted for 30 minutes by playing a game and half of the participants' gloves kept buzzing so they kept learning passively. This technique is called passive haptic learning. People wearing the gloves that kept buzzing made 30 per cent less errors than those who did not benefit from the passive haptic training. They could read 70 per cent of a Braille phrase when tested, compared to those whose training stopped during the game, who could only read 22 per cent. After the lesson, the participants tried to type the phrase without the cues or vibrations on a keyboard. The sequences were then repeated during a distraction task, when participants played a game for 30 minutes. Half of the participants felt repeated vibrations and heard the cues, while the others only heard the audio cues. When the game was over, participants tried to type the phrase without wearing the gloves. ‘Those in the control group (without the repeated lesson from the gloves) did about the same on their second attempt as they did in their pre-study baseline test,’ said Professor Starner. ‘But participants who felt the vibrations during the game were a third more accurate. Some were even perfect.’ The . researchers expected to see a wide disparity between the two groups, but . they were surprised the passive learners picked up an additional skill. ‘Remarkably, we found that people could transfer knowledge learned from typing Braille to reading Braille,’ said Seim. Wearers of the buzzing gloves could read 70 per cent of a Braille phrase when tested and others were typing perfectly after four hours of lessons. Pictured are prototypes with PhD student Caitlyn Seim. The technology has previously been used to teach beginners how to play simple piano melodies in just 45 minutes . Passive Haptic Learning (PHL) allows people to learn 'muscle memory' through vibrations without devoting attention to the stimulus. PHL can be used by wearable computers such as gloves with an embedded tactile interface. Two years ago, Georgia Tech scientists used vibrating gloves to teach people how to play the piano while learning everyday tasks - an example of PHL. In the 'mobile music touch' glove set-up, users wore the vibrating gloves to learn a tune. The song being learned was loaded onto a user’s mobile phone and was played as they went about their business. As each note was played, the glove tapped the finger corresponding to the appropriate key on a piano keyboard. In as little as 30 minutes, users of the gloves and the PHL technique learned the 'muscle memory' of the first phrases of the song, even though their attention was devoted to another task. ‘After the typing test, passive learners were able to read and recognise more than 70 percent of the phrase’s letters.’ No-one in the study had previously typed on a Braille keyboard or knew the language. The study also didn’t include screens or visual feedback, so participants never saw what they typed. They had no indication of their accuracy throughout the study. ‘The only learning they received was guided by the haptic interface,’ she said. Seim said that six out of eight participants who have tried to learn the full Braille alphabet during four one-hour lessons since, have achieved perfect typing using the gloves. Participants can also recognise and read more than 90 per cent of all the letters in the alphabet after just four hours. Nearly 40 million people worldwide are blind, but because Braille lessons are widely neglected in schools, only 10 per cent of those who are blind learn the language. The Braille studies will be presented in Seattle this September at the 18th International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC). Scientists at the university have previously used the glove to teach beginners how to play simple piano melodies in just 45 minutes.","Georgia Tech scientist created the gloves fitted with motors in the knuckles .

"By . Associated Press . A Pennsylvania pastor who broke church law by presiding over his son's same-sex wedding ceremony and then became an outspoken activist for gay rights can return to the pulpit after a United Methodist Church appeals panel on Tuesday overturned a decision to defrock him. The nine-person panel ordered the church to restore Frank Schaefer's pastoral credentials, saying the jury that convicted him last year erred when fashioning his punishment. 'I've devoted my life to this church, to serving this church, and to be restored and to be able to call myself a reverend again and to speak with this voice means so much to me,' an exultant Mr Schaefer told The Associated Press, adding he intends to work for gay rights 'with an even stronger voice from within the United Methodist Church.' United Methodist pastor Frank Schaefer, right, hugs the Reverand David Wesley Brown after a news conference on Tuesday at First United Methodist Church of Germantown in Philadelphia.  Schaefer, who presided over his son's same-sex wedding ceremony and vowed to perform other gay marriages if asked, can return to the pulpit after a United Methodist Church appeals panel overturned a decision to defrock him . Mr Schaefer does a dance step after a reporter's question as the Reverend Lorelei Toombs, left, looks on during the news conference . The church suspended Mr Schaefer, 52, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, for officiating his son's 2007 wedding, then defrocked him when he refused to promise to uphold the Methodist law book 'in its entirety', including its ban on clergy performing same-sex marriages. Mr Schaefer appealed, arguing the decision was wrong because it was based on an assumption he would break church law in the future. The pastor smiles at the end of the news conference, feeling vindicated following the decision to overturn the order to defrock him . The appeals panel, which met in Linthicum, Maryland, last week to hear the case, upheld a 30-day suspension that Schaefer has already served and said he should get back pay dating to when the suspension ended in December. Bishop Peggy Johnson of the church's eastern Pennsylvania conference said on Tuesday she will abide by the panel's decision and return him to active service. The ruling can be appealed to the Methodist church's highest court. The pastor who prosecuted Schaefer, the Reverand Christopher Fisher, said he has not made a decision about an appeal. 'I'm still in prayerful consideration about that,' said Fisher, calling Tuesday's decision 'not entirely unexpected.' Mr Schaefer isn't out of jeopardy yet. The ruling can be appealed to the Methodist church's highest court. The pastor who prosecuted Schaefer, the Reverand Christopher Fisher, said he has not made a decision about an appeal . At a news conference in Philadelphia, Mr Schaefer said he expects to take a job with the Methodist church in California, a liberal bastion where there is presumably little chance he would be punished for defying church doctrine on homosexuality. The issue of gay marriage has long roiled the United Methodist Church, the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination. Hundreds of Methodist ministers have publicly rejected church policies that allow gay members but ban 'self-avowed practicing homosexuals' from becoming clergy and forbid ministers from performing same-sex marriages. Traditionalists say clergy have no right to break church law just because they disagree with it. Some conservative pastors are calling for a breakup of the denomination, which has 12 million members worldwide, saying the split over gay marriage is irreconcilable. Mr Schaefer puts on a rainbow stole during the conference to symbolize his continued support for same-sex marriage and willingness to perform gay ceremonies . Mr Schaefer said Tuesday's decision 'signals a major change within the United Methodist Church, for sure.' The appeals panel, however, suggested it was not making a broader statement about the church's position on homosexuality but based its decision solely on the facts of Mr Schaefer's case. The jury's punishment was illegal under church law, the appeals panel concluded, writing in its decision that 'revoking his credentials cannot be squared with the well-established principle that our clergy can only be punished for what they have been convicted of doing in the past, not for what they may or may not do in the future.' The decision also noted that Mr Schaefer's son had asked him to perform the wedding; that the ceremony was small and private, held not in a Methodist church but in a Massachusetts restaurant; and that Schaefer did not publicize the wedding until a member of his congregation learned of it and filed the complaint in April 2013. 'The committee notes that, in another case involving different facts, a majority of its members might well have concluded that a different penalty better serves the cause of achieving a just resolution,' the panel said, adding that some of its members wanted a longer suspension for Mr Schaefer. Mr Schaefer said he expects the decision to stand. 'The church is changing,' he said, 'and that is good news for everybody.' The pastor got into trouble after he presided over his son's same-sex wedding ceremony and vowed to perform other gay marriages if asked .","Frank Schaefer became an outspoken activist for gay rights after officiating at his son's wedding .

"By . Bryan Keogh . Starbucks is entering the soda business, hoping to do to carbonated drinks what it did to coffee: crafting a designer beverage that people will fork over a premium to quaff down on their way to work. The coffee giant said today that it is launching three flavors of Fizzio Handcrafted Sodas to be concocted by baristas in about a minute and a half at its more than 3,000 locations in 16 states across the southern U.S. The strategy is timed to coincide with the rising summer temperatures so the cool drinks make up for any decline in hot coffee sales. They will be available beginning on Wednesday. Starbucks is launching three new handcrafted fizzy drinks tomorrow in an effort to snag a larger slice of the carbonated drinks market . 'We are changing the game in terms of how to get a carbonated drink,' Josh Fine, brand manager for Fizzio, told USA Today. 'Like what Starbucks did to coffee 40 years ago, we think we can do in the carbonation space.' The Fizzio sodas will be carbonated fresh, as opposed to combining syrup with carbonated water like in most commercial machines. Instead, the flavors and spices are combined in a large cheesecloth and steeped in hot water, akin to how tea is made. Buyers can choose from light, standard or extra carbonation. Starbucks went out of its way in a press release to emphasize that no high fructose corn syrup or preservatives or artificial flavors will be used. A 16 fluid ounce cup ('grande' to a barista) will pack 100 calories or less, it said. The sodas start out at about $2.45 for a 'tall', compared with $1.80 for the same size coffee, according to USA Today. The sodas will be made with a machine developed by Starbucks and partner Cornelius that unlike commercial machines doesn't combine carbonated water with syrup . Fizzio lemon ale is a 'refreshing, citrus-forward blend of real lemon juice with hints of apricot and ginger' The three flavors are: . For those counting grams of sugar, a 'tall' lemon ale contains 21 grams, or about five packets worth, according to The Washington Post. A 'grande' contains about seven packets, while the 'trenta' equals 13, or about 52 grams. For Starbucks, it's probably most about snaring a share of the $400 million global carbonated beverage market with a premium product the company hopes appeals to nutrition-conscious Millennials. Homemade soft drinks were called the top beverage trend of 2013 by the National Restaurant Association's annual survey of top chefs. 'Adding new drinking occasions is the key to (Starbucks') growth,' Michael Silverstein, senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group, told USA Today. About a year ago, Starbucks began testing the sodas in Austin and Atlanta, Fine said. The sodas will only be available at select locations in the following states: Hawaii, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada and Utah.","Fizzio Handcrafted Sodas will be made the old-fashioned way, by combining the flavors and spices in a cheesecloth and steeping them in hot water, just like tea .

"By . Peter Allen . and Arthur Martin . and Nick Fagge . The British girl left for dead after the French Alps massacre only saw one ‘bad man’, police said yesterday. Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, returned to the UK yesterday, eight days after she was shot in the shoulder and beaten around the head. Last night a source close to the investigation said: ‘She told us there was only one killer, who she called a bad man.’ Recovery: Zainab Al-Hilli, 7, whose parents and grandmother were murdered in their car is to stay in a secret location near London . This is likely to mean that he reloaded at least once as he carried out the terrible bloodbath. Doctors who treated her in Grenoble said she suffered brain injuries and could lose sight in one eye. However  they have been surprised by the speed of her recovery and allowed her to leave hospital with two relatives and British police officers at 8am yesterday. The news comes as it was revealed . that police are looking for for a black Mitsubishi Pajero with British . number plates in relation to shooting. The car is believed to have been seen in the area around Lake Annecy where the killings took place. 'It's crucial that we find this car,' said a prosecuting source. It was also revealed that the driver of the Mitsubishi ‘had dark complexion and looked nervous’. Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, was considered well enough to travel back to the UK and the party left with . Zainab due to be cared for at a secret location. She . was orphaned in the horrific attack which saw her father Saad Al-Hilli, . 50, killed alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila . Al-Allaf, 74, as they sat in a BMW close to Lake Annecy, eastern France. Zainab was found . staggering around outside the car by Brett Martin, a former RAF man who . cycled towards the bloodbath by chance on September 5th. Police are looking for the driver of a black Mitsubishi Pajero believed to have been seen around the scene of the killings near Lake Annecy . She had been pistol-whipped around the . head, suffering multiple facial injuries that caused two subdural . hematomas and a fractured orbital bone. A subdural hematoma is a traumatic brain injury which can be life threatening, while the orbital bone surrounds the eyes. Doctors at the University Hospital in Grenoble, where Zainab was . originally put in an induced coma to help her recover, today gave her . the ‘green light’ to go home. ‘It . was considered beneficial that Zainab returns to a familiar place,’ said an investigating source. ‘She left for the UK shortly after 8am’. Zainab Al-Hilli was kept in the CHU Hospital in Grenoble before returning to the UK . Zainab’s injuries were not only further evidence of the cruelty shown by the criminal responsible, but suggest that Zaibad will have very little to offer detectives when she eventually gives an official witness statement. ‘She was beaten around the face with great force, and then shot in the shoulder – the trauma was immense,’ said another source. ‘She’s already indicated that she remembers very little about any of it.’ Police know Zainab was outside the BMW car in which her three relatives were killed, and in which her sister Zeena, four, hid. Zeena saw nothing, and will not be an official witness in the enquiry having escaped unscathed, but Zainab’s testimony remains crucial. It was filmed inside her hospital room, but there were no direct questions – everything was left open-ended and general. This was to stimulate the memory of a little girl whose life was shattered. Police said they have learnt ‘some information’ from Zainab, but British police also intend to speak to her. There are still fears, however, that whoever was responsible for the crime may want to harm both surviving girls – hence the on-going need for security around them. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three, also died in the massacre.","Seven-year-old Zainab Al-Hilli spoke to investigators after being considered well enough to travel back to UK .

"By . Eleanor Harding . and Tom Kelly . It is not a sight that will sit easily with Andy Murray. This is the hunky Spaniard he faces in today’s quarter-final –and his rival’s toned physique has not gone unnoticed in the Murray family. For among Fernando Verdasco’s many female admirers is none other than the Scot’s mother Judy, who is widely known to have a soft spot for the pin-up 24 years her junior who will go head-to-head with her son on Centre Court. Fernando Verdasco posed for Cosmopolitan to raise awareness of male cancer for the Everyman appeal - and has attracted an army of female fans . With his perfect tan and muscled physique, there is no doubt Verdasco must feel confident about his body after posing nude for Cosmopolitan to raise awareness of male cancer for the Everyman appeal. He first came to the attention of Mrs Murray, 53, in Monte Carlo two years ago, when she stood behind him and fellow heart-throb Feliciano Lopez in an accreditation queue. It was then that she coined the nickname ‘Deliciano’ for Lopez – a label that has stuck ever since. She later wrote on her blog: ‘I joined the accreditation queue behind a bevy of Spaniards. ‘Yes I do mean to use the word bevy as . it included ‘Deliciano’ Lopez and Fernando Verdasco. Not the worst . queue I’ve ever been in.’ Fernando Verdasco of Spain caught Judy Murray's eye when she stood behind him in a queue two years ago . When Murray played Lopez in the quarter-finals in 2011, she said: ‘I’m just one of a lot of Feliciano female fans. But of course family loyalty comes into it hugely.’ She added that said she was still recovering from the embarrassment of Murray telling Lopez: ‘My mother thinks you’re beautiful.’ But that did not stop her from describing Lopez as ‘kind of Roman god-like’. After posing for nude for Cosmopolitan . in 2008 to raise awareness of male cancer for the Everyman appeal, . Verdasco said the parts of his body he received most compliments about . were his arms. ‘It must be all the tennis I play! I’ve never posed naked before but it was really fun,’ he said . Judy said she was still recovering from the embarrassment of Murray telling Feliciano Lopez: 'My mother thinks you’re beautiful' Whatever Verdasco’s ability to garner the admiration of female fans, the 29-year-old is still expected to be outstripped by Murray when it comes to tennis. World No 2 Murray is ranked 52 places ahead of the Spaniard, and has won eight of the nine matches they have played. And while Murray reached the final last year, the quarter-final is as far as Verdasco has managed in ten Wimbledons. Verdasco said: ‘I have a good . relationship with Andy. He was practising in Spain when he was younger. We always had a good relationship out of the court, and on the court . also. He’s a great player, one of the best players in the last few years . on tour. 'You know it is going to be difficult to beat him, also with the crowd and everything. But you need to have faith.’ Verdasco, . known as ‘Nando’ to his friends, began playing tennis when he was four, . practising with his father on the two hard courts in the backyard of . their family home. This is the second time Murray has faced a pin-up at Wimbledon. Last year he beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who posed naked for the same cancer campaign as Verdasco, in the semi-final. Meanwhile, Murray’s biggest obstacle to Wimbledon glory is already planning to end the championships in party mood. Top seed Novak Djokovic will host royals and Hollywood stars at a fundraiser for his charity foundation at The Roundhouse, North London, on the evening after Sunday’s men’s singles final. The Duchess of York, Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson, Naomi Campbell and Boris Becker are among those due to attend the gala dinner for the Novak Djokovic Foundation, which supports children from disadvantaged communities, especially in the world No 1’s native Serbia.","Among Fernando Verdasco's admirers is the Scot's 53-year-old mother .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A young bookworm is distraught after a tiny outdoor library he erected on his front lawn for a Mother’s Day present had to be removed – because it violated city building codes. Nine-year-old Spencer Collins from Kansas built a ‘Free Little Library’ with the help of his grandfather after his mother mentioned that she thought they were a good idea. The library - a bookcase with a tiled roof supported by wooden struts – carries the message ‘take a book, leave a book’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Distraught: Spencer Collins' little lending library fell foul of Leawood building regulations and had to be removed from the front lawn . They are becoming an increasingly popular way to encourage reading, with neighbors able to take a book in return for donating one of their own. However, Spencer’s library has fallen foul of building laws. Rules in Leawood, where he lives, stipulate that structures are not allowed on the lawns of single-family homes. Relocation: The library has been moved from the front lawn to the Collins' garage . Officials said that unless the structure was attached to the house, the family would face a fine. The library is still up and running – but has been placed in the family’s garage. Spencer Collins told Fox4KC: ‘Reading is one of my favorite things to do. We built it on Mother’s Day as a present for my mom because she really wanted one.’ The Collins family isn't taking the ruling lying down, however. They will appeal to city officials to have the law changed. Mayor Peggy Dunn confirmed to Kansascity.com that the issue of front-yard lending libraries being unlawful will be top of the agenda during a July 7 City Council meeting.","Spencer Collins, from Kansas, told his tiny library was unlawful .

"By . David Mccormack . Residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of Baton Rouge have launched a campaign to split from the rest of Louisiana's state capital and form their own breakaway city. If the campaigners get their way, the new city of St. George would encompass 107,000 residents, around 25 percent of Baton Rouge’s current population. Critics of the St. George proposal argue . that it would create a poor, black, and urban Baton Rouge and a . wealthy, white, and suburban St. George. Redrawing the map: Residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of Baton Rouge have launched a campaign to split from the rest of Louisiana's state capital and form their own breakaway city of St. George . Perkins Rowe is one of two exclusive malls that would fall within the proposed boundaries of St. George and therefore deny Baton Rouge of valuable sales tax dollars . Supporters of the proposal say they have . about half of the 18,000 signatures they need to put incorporating St. George on the next ballot. Significantly the proposed new city would include two major retail centers, Perkins Rowe and the Mall of Louisiana, that currently provide Baton Rouge with 40 percent of its sales tax revenue. The split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district. When state legislature mothballed those proposals in June - claiming they couldn’t approve an independent school district that was unaffiliated with a city - organizers shifted their energies to the creation of St. George, reports Raw Story. After Hurricane Katrina, the city of Baton Rouge accepted over 200,000 displaced New Orleans residents, the majority of whom were black and settled in the northern, urban parts of the city . The split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district by the wealthy, predominantly white residents of southern Baton Rouge . According to recent study on the . demographic impact of Hurricane Katrina, the city of Baton Rouge . accepted over 200,000 displaced New Orleans residents, the majority of . whom were black and settled in the northern, urban parts of the city. Leaders of the St. George secession effort deny that this is the reason behind their plans. They claim the new city will be ‘wide open’ and downplay warnings of fiscal disaster for the rest of the city. ‘Typically, the only comments you hear are those that try to create fear,’ one of the leaders of the movement, Norman Browning said. ‘They never support it with any documentation to make those claims.’ But opponents note that city funds were used to develop the retail areas that would end up sucking in sales taxes from residents of the poorer part of the city. Norman Browning, right, one of the leaders of the St. George movement claims there is no proof that the split will have an adverse effect on Baton Rouge, while councilwoman C. Denise Marcelle says the proposed change will affect everyone . ‘If they pull away from Baton Rouge, it will affect everyone,’ City Councilwoman C. Denise Marcelle told The Morning Advocate. ‘We’ve spent millions of dollars on improvements out there and making traffic better, and now they want to be their own city?’ A study by the Baton Rouge Area Chamber found that the effects of the partition would be economically devastating for the remainder of Baton Rouge, immediately creating a $53 million budget shortfall. The study also raised concerns as to whether the remaining portions of Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s state capital, would be able to support public services despite the loss of tax revenue. As the tables below shows projected figures for St. George would create a town with an average income $30,000 higher than present day Baton Rouge, while the unemployment rate would be halved. According to figures compiled by the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, the new town would have a majority white population, as opposed to Baton Rouge which has a black majority and the number of people receiving food stamps would also be more than halved.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 17-year-old boy who is charged with plotting to murder his family and hundreds of students at his Minnesota high school calmly confessed his disturbing plans to detectives and said he thinks he's 'just really mentally ill and no one's noticed.' Recordings of John LaDue's interviews with Waseca police on the April night he was arrested were released Tuesday, and in them he is heard detailing all the bomb making materials he had collected in the year before he was caught, as he carefully plotted the act which he said was inspired by both Columbine and the Boston bombings. 'My plan was to steal a recycling bin from the school and take on of the pressure cookers I made and put it in the hallway and blow it up during passing period time,' he told the officer slowly. Plans: Recordings of John LaDue's interviews with Waseca police on the April night he was arrested were released Tuesday. He is pictured here at a May court appearance . Then, according to the Star Tribune, he said he'd detonate more explosives when people were fleeing, 'just like the Boston bombings' and finally 'destroy' himself when the SWAT team arrived. When asked what it was that made him want to kill his family and fellow students, he hesitated before questioning his mental state. 'Hmmm. Well first off, I was not bullied at all. I don't think I've ever been bullied in my life. I have good parents. I live in a good town,' he said. 'I think I’m just really mentally ill and no one's noticed and I've been trying to hide it.' He later said he hadn't planned on living past the day he carried out the massacre, adding 'I really want to get out of this place,' and then asked to see a psychiatrist. When the detectives asked if he'd ever seen one before he said he hadn't. 'No one knows what I think,' he said. On Friday, Waseca County prosecutors also charged a man, Michael S. Jacobs, 40, with selling a .45 caliber Llama handgun to the underage LaDue in summer or early fall of 2013. Two juveniles, both 17, were each charged with possessing and making explosive devices with LaDue, setting some of the bombs off at a park. However, the Star Tribune reports that police don't believe the teens knew LaDue's plan to use the devices to kill students. John LaDue was allegedly planning to kill his family before embarking on a massacre at Waseca High School that involved the same home-made bombs used in the Boston Marathon attack . At a June 18 court appearance, LaDue's . father, David LaDue, said he believes his son would never have acted on . his dark thoughts and should therefore not be tried as an adult. 'I . don't see how he would have ever been able to actually do that, no . matter how much he would have liked to entertain that idea... because . it's inhuman,' he said. At a May court appearance, the teen denied the charges against him. He has been charged as a juvenile with . four counts of attempted murder, two counts of first-degree damage to . property and six counts of possession of a bomb. Prosecutors want to charge LaDue as an adult and have until July to make their case. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and shackled at the feet and waist, LaDue stared at his father in the gallery on May 12 when he was led in by police officers. The honors student answered Judge Gerald Wolf's questions in a calm voice, according to the Star Tribune. If charged as an adult, he could face up to 18 years in prison. However if he is charged as a juvenile, LaDue could be free to leave a detention center when he is 21. Hi next court appearance is scheduled for July 8. LaDue was arrested on April 29 . after a concerned citizen saw him enter a southern Minnesota storage unit. LaDue admitted . his intricate plans after being arrested, with police seizing an SKS . assault rifle with 400 rounds of ammunition, a 9mm handgun with ammo and . a gun safe with five more firearms, all in his bedroom at the family . home. LaDue was allegedly making explosives in a storage unit at this facility in Waseca, Minn., but his plans to use the devices were thwarted when a nearby resident, Chelsie Schellhas, noticed him entering the unit on April 29 and called police . Some of the bombs were allegedly found at this playground as snow melted around Hartley Elementary School playground in Waseca, Minn, in March. John LaDue, 17, has been arrested for plotting to kill his family and massacre students . Also in the room were three completed . pressure cooker bombs - the same type of explosive used in the Boston . Marathon attack - while another three - along with chemicals and . materials to make more - found in the storage facility the teen had . secretly rented. LaDue also had 60 pounds of metal ball bearings that would have been placed with the bombs as shrapnel, police said. The 17-year-old allegedly planned . to kill his parents and older sister with a .22-caliber rifle, then go . to the countryside and start a fire to distract police and . firefighters. He then allegedly planned to go . to his school, Waseca Junior/Senior High School, at lunchtime, set off . explosions in the cafeteria, shoot the school liaison officer and kill . 'as many students as he could'. The . plans were outlined in a 180-page diary, which contained one entry . dated July 2013, giving authorities an idea of how long LaDue had been . plotting the would-be massacre. LaDue anticipated he would be killed by a SWAT team, according to charging documents filed in Waseca County District Court. His father David LaDue earlier revealed that he feels responsible for his son's terrifying plan. He said the main troubling change he noticed about his son in recent . months was his obscure questioning of a Bible verse, which he had . interpreted to mean that God was unjust or cruel. 'I . understand everyone wants to know and try to make sense of it, and it's . real easy if we could give it a simple answer like ""he's a maniac"" or ""his parents just bought him [stuff] and ignored him,""' David LaDue told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune. 'It would really be nice if it was that simple ... I wish it was that simple.' Caught: John LaDue was charged with four counts of attempted murder, six counts of explosives possessions and two counts of first-degree property damage . Mr LaDue also admitted his son, a deer hunter, was allowed to keep some guns in a safe in his bedroom closet, partly because he was trusted to watch out for the family when his father worked overnights in the Twin Cities. The teen also was allowed to practice throwing Tomahawk knives at an old pine tree in the front yard. David LaDue also gave his son the OK to walk to a friend's house after the town curfew once, a decision that led to a citation for the boy. 'I tried to indulge him in every way that I thought was harmless,' David LaDue said. 'I feel responsible for everything other than his fantasies or imaginations that I was unaware of.' David LaDue didn't regularly search his son's bedroom because he felt he had no reason. He had friends, a job at a grocery store, and never messed around with fights, drinking or drugs. The 17-year-old is close to his sister, who is just 15 months older, his father said. 'We've never had what I felt was a concrete reason to really be concerned,' David LaDue said. Mr LaDue is not sure how his son obtained the storage unit or bomb materials, but said because of his job, he has his own debit card. Prosecutors say John LaDue used a PayPal account to buy things online. The father said his son was often the first home in the afternoon and would see the mail before anyone else. John LaDue had targeted April 20, the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School school massacre in Littleton, Colorado, as the date he planned to carry out the attack, authorities said. But that fell on Easter Sunday, postponing plans. Authorities believe he was going to act in the next few weeks. Police allegedly found an arsenal of seven guns, along with bombs and other materials, at this house where John LaDue lived with his family in Waseca. Father David LaDue was allowed to keep hunting guns in his room and throw tomahawks at the tree out front . 'I believe there would have always been a reason for him to delay ... until he got caught,' Mr LaDue said. 'I don't know what the proper punishment is for what he's made it look like he was going to do. 'If he actually intended to carry out the things that he says he intended to carry out, I don't see how that's forgivable.' '(But) I can't believe that he actually intended to do it. I really can't. But I don't expect anyone to believe that.' John LaDue's capture has been credited to a watchful young woman who lives in an apartment complex next to the storage unit facility the student frequented. Chelsea Schellhas told The Star Tribune she was doing dishes when she saw the teen was cutting through her backyard. 'He walked through the puddles when there was a perfectly good road he could have walked on,' Schellhas told the paper. 'It just didn’t seem right to me because we see people come and go with their trucks, and they don’t come on foot and cut through people’s back yards.' 'It was like he was blatantly trying not to be seen,' she continued. 'That’s why I thought it was odd.' LaDue took 'some time' before opening the door, appearing to be breaking in, Schellhas explained. Able to see into the locker, she noticed shopping bags and trash that 'didn't look right'. He then closed it behind him, cops said, and Schellhas called 911. Officers responding to the storage locker around 7.30 pm immediately noticed a significant amount of bombs and bomb making materials, police said. The bombs have since been detonated by an expert team.","Recordings of John LaDue's interviews with Waseca police on the April night he was arrested were released Tuesday .

"By . Hugo Gye . Israel today carried out bombing raids on the Gaza Strip in revenge for a rocket attack on a factory by Islamic militants Hamas. The country's foreign minister also suggested it might be necessary to re-occupy the territory in a bid to stop the continuous low-level attacks from Palestinian militias. The latest airstrikes come at a time of high tensions in the region, after three Israeli teenagers were apparently kidnapped by Hamas. Strike: A fireball shown rising from a site in the Gaza Strip after a bombing campaign by Israel . Target: The Israeli military claimed to have bombed a dozen sites linked to militant Islamists . This month alone, there have been 60 rockets fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip and 80 strikes on Gaza by the Israeli military, according to officials from the two territories. Yesterday evening, a paint factory in the border town of Sderot was hit by two rockets fired from Gaza, setting it alight. Israel retaliated early this morning, targeting 12 sites in Gaza believed to be linked to militant activity. Among the targets of the airstrikes were weapons factories and concealed rocket launchers, according to Israeli officials. Dramatic: The sites hit apparently including weapons factories and concealed rocket launchers . Aftermath: A Palestinian militant inspects the damage today after the Israeli airstrikes . Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet today: 'Over the weekend, the Israel Defense Forces attacked multiple targets in response to firing at Israel from the Gaza Strip. 'We are ready to expand this operation, if necessary.' However, hardline foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman suggested that small-scale operations in Gaza might make Hamas stronger and that the only way to pacify the territory would be to occupy it again. 'The alternative is clear,' he said on Army Radio. 'Either with each round we attack terror infrastructure and they shoot, or we go to full occupation.' Revenge: Israel's airstrikes came after a paint factory in the town of Sderot was hit by rockets from Gaza . Destruction: The factory saw much of its supply rendered unusable after the rocket attack . Israel withdrew unilaterally from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but it has since become a haven for Hamas and a flashpoint for violence. Earlier this month, tensions between Israel and the Palestinians increased when three boys were kidnapped from the West Bank settlement where they live. Troops have been combing Palestinian neighbourhoods aggressively in an attempt to find the teenagers.","Israeli military claims to have hit 12 sites connected to Islamic militants .

"By . Associated Press . Pilot mismanagement and confusion caused Asiana Flight 214 to crash in San Francisco last year, federal accident investigators concluded today. The National Transportation Safety Board said at a hearing in Washington D.C today that there was confusion over whether one of the airliner's key controls was maintaining speed. The agency also cited the complexity of the Boeing 777's autothrottle and pilot training by the South Korea-based airline as contributing to the crash, which killed three passengers and injured more than 200. Scroll down for video . The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 seen on the ground after it crashed at the San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco on July 6, 2013 . The plane, with 307 people on board, was too low and too slow during the landing attempt. Its tail struck a seawall and was ripped off. The rest of plane went spinning and sliding down the runway. The crash was the only fatal passenger airline accident in the U.S. in the last five years. Before the vote, Chris Hart, the NTSB's acting chairman, said that increasingly complex automated aircraft controls designed to improve safety are instead creating new opportunities for error. The Asiana flight crew 'over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand,' he said. Among the other issues raised by the investigation are some that long have concerned aviation officials, including hesitancy by some pilots to abort a landing when things go awry or to challenge a captain's actions. The irony of the accident is that it occurred at all. Three experienced pilots were in the cockpit on July 6, 2013. NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart makes opening remarks during a hearing to establish the cause of the Asiana Flight 214 (pictured today) The plane, a Boeing 777, had one of the industry's best safety records. And weather conditions that sunny day were near perfect. But the wide-bodied jetliner with 307 people on board was too low and too slow during the landing. It struck a seawall just short of the runway, ripping off the tail and sending the rest of the plane spinning and skidding down the runway. When the shattered plane came to rest, a fire erupted. The plane, a Boeing 777, had one of the industry's best safety records and weather conditions that sunny day were near perfect . Despite the violence of the crash, only three people were killed - Chinese teens seated in the back who may not have been wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the plane. One of the teenage girls survived the crash but was run over by two rescue vehicles in the chaos afterward. Nearly 200 people were injured. In documents made public by the safety board, Asiana acknowledged the likely cause of the accident was the crew's failure to monitor and maintain the plane's airspeed, and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble. The South Korea-based airline said the pilot and co-pilot reasonably believed the automatic throttle would keep the plane flying fast enough to land safely, when in fact the auto throttle was effectively shut off after the pilot idled it to correct an unexplained climb earlier in the landing. Asiana said the plane should have been designed so that the auto throttle would maintain the proper speed after the pilot put it in 'hold mode.' Boeing had been warned about the problem by U.S. and European aviation regulators. Asiana . urged the safety board to recommend that the aircraft maker be required . to include an audible warning to alert pilots when the throttle changes . to a setting in which it no longer is maintaining speed. 'Asiana . has a point,' said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety . consultant, 'but this is not the first time it has happened. 'Any of these highly automated airplanes have these conditions that require special training and pilot awareness. According to reports the pilots of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 were confused by the plane's technology (crash site from July 2013 pictured) 'This is something that has been known for many years and trained for many years.' Boeing told the board there was nothing wrong with the plane, and the crash was caused by the failure of the pilots to maintain speed and to abort the landing when the approach had become unstable, as required by their company's policies. An unstable approach occurs when a plane's speed or rate of descent is too fast or to slow, or the plane isn't properly aligned for landing. Captain Lee Kang Kuk, 45, a veteran pilot who was new to the 777, was flying the plane. Because an airport navigational aid that helps planes land wasn't working that day, Kuk was flying a visual approach that involves lining up the jet for landing by looking through the windshield and using numerous other cues, rather than relying on a radio-based system called a glide-slope that guides aircraft to the runway. A training captain was sitting next to him in the right seat watching his performance. Kuk told transportation accident investigators that he did not immediately move to abort the landing after it became unstable because he felt only the instructor pilot had that authority. Cockpit culture in which the senior captain is viewed as supreme was identified as a factor in several South Korean airliner crashes in the 1980s and '90s. Afterward, procedures and hierarchies were overhauled in Korea and elsewhere, including the U.S.","Complexity of the Boeing 777's autothrottle and pilot training contributed to crash .

"By . Gavin Mccafferty . Promoter Eddie Hearn is considering putting Ricky Burns into a high-profile domestic fight away from Scotland after attempts to get him back in the world-title mix backfired spectacularly. Burns was floored within 30 seconds of his comeback from losing his WBO lightweight belt before suffering a points loss to Montenegrin Dejan Zlaticanin in an official WBC eliminator. The 31-year-old looked shaken after getting up from the early left-hook counter and Zlaticanin dominated the early stages, putting Burns under pressure with some intense flurries. Floored plan: Ricky Burns is knocked down by Dejan Zlaticanin in Glasgow . On the hook! Ricky Burns is given a count after being knocked down in the first 30 seconds . The Coatbridge fighter steadied himself and looked better in the latter stages but diminutive southpaw Zlaticanin, fighting outside the Balkans for the first time, continued to cause him problems with his left hook and consistently threw the more dangerous punches before winning a split decision. However, his victory looked clear-cut to most inside Glasgow's Braehead Arena and left Burns facing an ongoing struggle to rediscover the form that made him a two-weight world champion. The counter left that the unbeaten Zlaticanin found such joy with had been utilised to good effect by Raymundo Beltran when he broke Burns' jaw in the Scot's last successful, but highly contentious, defence of his title, and in a skilful display by Terence Crawford that ended his long reign as world champion. Hearn said: 'Probably take the first four rounds away, I thought he won the fight quite comfortably, but it's the same mistakes, throwing hooks with your chin in the air and getting caught by a hooker. It was a nightmare start. 'I think we need to take him away from Scotland for his next fight, because every time he fights there is so much pressure and expectation. He is going to have a holiday and see how he feels but I can't see him quitting in a million years because he loves to fight. It's not as if he's an old man, he is physically fit and loves to fight. 'He trains harder than anyone else down the gym, his sparring is better than anyone else, but he is not delivering it in the ring. I don't know what it is. It's not desire, he still has the desire.' Same mistakes! Ricky Burns left his chin exposed to his opponent's hook . Change of venue: The British boxer could now look for a domestic fight outside of Scotland . Hearn will now look to set up an all-British fight to see if Burns can recapture his form, with the likes of Tommy Coyle, Anthony Crolla, Derry Matthews and possibly Kevin Mitchell all potential opponents. 'I don't believe Zlaticanin will go on to win a world title,' he said. 'If you can't beat him, you are not going to go on and win a world title. 'His next fight will have to be a tough domestic fight. You have to win that and then have another fight like Zlaticanin to get in the world title mix. 'This was about winning back the confidence of the people and Ricky Burns but we have taken another step back. 'But Ricky was sitting in the dressing room saying he feels he has let people down and needs to get back into the gym and improve. He was crying his eyes out.' Disappointment: Ricky Burns felt like he let people down after this latest loss . There was plenty to cheer for the home crowd earlier in the bill with Willie Limond winning a Lonsdale at the third time of asking by beating Curtis Woodhouse in a convincing points victory. The 35-year-old Commonwealth champion, whose previous attempts ended in defeat by Alex Arthur and Crolla, twice put the spirited Woodhouse on the deck with upper-cuts and boxed skilfully throughout despite the defending champion's brave comeback bid. Hearn could now fix the Glaswegian up for a shot at Italian Michele di Rocco's European belt.Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons won his grudge match with Wadi Camacho with a 10th-round stoppage following a close affair for the WBC Silver International cruiserweight belt.","Ricky Burns was beaten by Dejan Zlaticanin in Glasgow .

"By . Richard Spillett . Morten Storm joined radical Islamists in the Middle East before becoming a double agent for MI5 . A former Jihadist who became an MI5 double agent has urged young British Muslims not to fight in the Middle East. Morten Storm helped intelligence agencies after a 'crisis of faith' led him to turn his back on radical Islamists. After coming into contact with some of Al Qaeda's most infamous figures, he has now sent out a message to any youngsters tempted to join the terrorists. He told BBC's Newsbeat that he understands radical young men, saying: 'I know they are frustrated with our government and foreign policies. They don't see any justice.' But he added: 'If they do go to Syria it will be a one way ticket and their lives will be totally different. They will be labelled and followed.' Urging young British Muslims to stay at home, he added: 'Your family and children need you more. 'Those who come back are broken with traumas. Others will come back as fully-trained killing machines and are extremely dangerous to have in the UK.' Storm, now 38, converted to Islam after spending time in prison and developing extreme jihadist views in London. He then moved to Yemen in 2001. As he became trusted by fundamentalists, he met shoe bomber Richard Reid and, at one point, was offered the chance to meet Osama Bin Laden. But, in a new book, he reveals he turned his back on fundamentalists after he was prevented from travelling to fight in Somalia in 2006. He was stunned that he had been denied what he considered his fate and looked up 'contradictions in the Koran' on the internet in frustration. Scroll down for video . Storm, pictured at a protest outside the US embassy in London in 2005, has now urged young British Muslims not to do as he did and join radical groups waging war overseas . In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, broadcast last night, he said: 'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world.' He was later recruited by the CIA, MI5 and the Danish intelligence service, PET, as a double agent to inform on operations in Yemen and Somalia and prevent attacks in Europe. His words of warning to would-be terrorists come amid growing fears about the number of British-born young men heading to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside radical groups like Isis (Islamic State in Iraq and Levant). Earlier this month, Cardiff's Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan and Aberdeen's Abdul Rakib Amin appeared in a 'recruitment video' in which they urged their 'brothers' to join them. Around 500 British men are thought to have travelled to Syria to fight alongside extremist militias, with some now spilling over the border to join the groups now terrorising Iraq. It is believed tracking the men when they return to the UK and attempting to foil any terror attacks on British soil are now MI5's top priorities.

"By . John Drayton . His summer got off to a bad start after Roy Hodgson omitted him from the England squad for what has proved to be a disastrous World Cup campaign in Brazil. But as the squad ready themselves for an early flight home after two embarrassing defeats, midfielder Tom Cleverley is reportedly on a high after proposing to stunning girlfriend Georgina Dorsett. According to sources the Manchester United ace wooed Georgina, a former TOWIE star, with a £20,000 engagement ring during a trip to Las Vegas. On a high: Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has reportedly proposed to Georgina Dorsett . ‘Georgina had been waiting for him to ask but he wanted the perfect moment,’ a friend told The Sun. ‘No expense was spared. Tom has taken her for amazing meals with red rose petals scattered on the table and he’s made sure that she’s had the time of her life.’ The 24-year-old was reeling last season after 17,000 England fans signed a petition insisting he be banned from the national squad – a move that was slammed by his then manager, David Moyes. ‘Tom Cleverley is a fantastic young player who's developing all the time,’ said the Scot in March. ‘He is a great trainer. He is first out . and every day he does his best in training. He always gives his best and . that is why he will succeed.’ The contentious petition is said to be another reason behind the playmaker’s proposal. Not selected: Cleverley missed out on being selected for Roy Hodgson's 23-man World Cup squad this summer . The source added: ‘Georgina’s been a big support for him and I think he wanted to show how grateful he was.’ Cleverley has been with Dorsett since 2012 and welcomed the birth of their first child, daughter Nevaeh, last June. He won 13 England caps before falling out of favour with manager Hodgson shortly before the 23-man World Cup squad was announced.

"By . Steve Nolan . Legend has it that it partly provided the inspiration for J R R Tolkien's second book in the much-loved Lord of The Rings trilogy The Two Towers. But an iconic yet dilapidated Birmingham landmark could be given a new lease of life after a charity with a Tolkien fanatic at the helm bought the empty building for £1. Midlands homelessness charity Trident Reach The People snapped up the historic Grade II listed building in the hope of raising £1million to turn it into a centre for young artists and a venue for art exhibitions. Inspiration: Perrott's Folly tower in Edgbaston, left, is said to have inspired Orthanc tower, right, in The Two Towers, the second book of J R R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy . The tower, which is even said to perilously sway in strong winds, is thought to have provided inspiration for the tower of Orthanc, which featured in Tolkien's 1954 follow up to The Fellowship of The RIng. Nearby Edgbaston Waterworks is said to have inspired the other tower. Trident Reach the People now hope that the tower will provide inspiration for a new generation, and are hoping to start transforming it into a valuable resource in a deprived area of Edgbaston within the next 18 months. Trident's Ben Bradley told the MailOnline: 'The reason we got involved is because it is in a area of high social deprivation. 'It's a deprived area, so the project will not only provide volunteering opportunities, but it will also allow us to provide support services for residents. 'It's not just a case of the building being used now and again, it will be in constant use.' Dilapidated: The interior of the 18th century Perrott Folly tower is in a poor state of repair at the moment . Vantage point: The view from the top of Edgbaston's Perrott's Folly tower. The Edgbaston Waterworks which inspired the other tower in The Two Towers is pictured in the distance . The charity originally became associated with the tower when it was looked after by a trust fund. But the trust fund became no longer viable and the charity stepped in to snap up Perrott's Folly for just £1. Winding: The seven storey tower's rooms are linked by a spiral stone staircase which has 139 steps . The charity now hopes to raise the money through donations and a 'sponsor a brick' scheme, as well as by applying for grants. Perrott's Folly, a 96 ft seven storey high brick tower, currently has one floor missing and is in a poor state of repair. Despite its decaying state, the tower is still used, recently hosting a homeless art exhibition, and  a resident artist Lizzy Jordan has already been appointed. But the charity hope that the money will enable it to fulfill its dream of turning the top and bottom floors into exhibition space showing off the best of local heritage and the obvious connection with Tolkien, with the rest of the building playing host to art exhibitions and workshops. The land surrounding the 18th century tower will also be developed, the hope is to turn it into a mix of cinema and gallery space. The tower is said to have provided the inspiration for Tolkien's Orthanc tower which formed part of Isengard one of the three fortresses of Gondor. Isengard, which was built around the tower, was Saruman's base of operations in the War of the Ring. Scores of Lord of the Rings fans already visit the tower each year as part of the Tolkien Trail, an unofficial route established by diehard fans of the fantasy series. Almost as interesting as its link to Tolkien is the history of Perrott's Folly itself. It was built in the centre of a magnificent medieval hunting park by eccentric landowner John Perrott in 1758. Familiar: The Edgbaston Waterworks Tower in Birmingham is said to have inspired the other tower in Tolkien's famous novel . Fortress: The Orthanc tower formed part of Isengard one of the three fortresses of Gondor . Some have suggested that he built the tower to keep watch on his wife when he suspected her of having an affair with a gamekeeper, others say that it was a vantage point from which to look out at his wife's grave after she died. In 1884, glass maker and metereologist Abraham Follett Osler began using the tower for weather observation and it became the Edgbaston Observatory. The University of Birmingham began using the building as an observatory until 1979. In 1984 the Perrott’s Folly Company was formed to renovate the tower and secured grants from English Heritage and Birmingham City Council. The company worked with Birmingham Conservation Trust to carry out emergency repair work in 2005 to stabilise the structure and save it from collapse. Fantasy: Isengard, which was built around the tower, was Saruman's base of operations in the War of the Ring . J R R Tolkien pictured in 1967 . J R R Tolkien's family moved from the Midlands to South Africa before the author was born so that his father Arthur, a bank clerk, could better himself. Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in 1892, but the family moved back to the Midlands in 1896 after his father died. They originally moved to the village of Sarehole which had not yet been swallowed up by Birmingham at the time. It is thought that the village provided much of the inspiration for Hobbiton and the Shire . It is thought that Sarehole Mill provided the inspiration for the mill that features in The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. He later lived in Sterling Road in the Edgbaston area just yards from the Edgbaston Waterworks and Perrott's Folley which are said to have inspired the Two Towers in the second book of his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien is believed to have passed them every day on the journey to school. His time living in the Moseley area as a child is also thought to have been the source of inspiration for some of the settings in both the Hobbit and the Lord of the RIngs. Tolkien eventually moved away from Birmingham when he went to study at Exeter College in Oxford. He studied classics before switching to English Language and Literature, gaining a first class degree. He fought in the Lancashire Fusiliers in the First World War contracting trench fever and spending some time in hospital in Birmingham. The author spent some time working on the New English Dictionary project for a short while but eventually went back into academia, working at Leeds University and then going back to Oxford where he struck up a friendship with Narnia author CS Lewis. He only began writing to amuse his four children but after The Hobbit was published in 1937 his work was in demand and he decided to write more. Tolkien died on September 2 1973.","Perrott's Folly in Birmingham was close to Tolkien's childhood home .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Concern: A natural 'cuddle hormone' could held alleviate the symptoms of anorexia (file photo) A hormone released when kissing could help beat anorexia. Oxytocin reduces sufferers’ unhealthy obsessions with food and weight and makes them less fixated on damaging emotions, researchers found. A spray of the chemical could be used as a treatment in two or three years if larger trials succeed. It is hoped it would help patients understand the need to eat more, raising odds of recovery. There are no drugs to treat the life-threatening disorder, whose sufferers try to be as thin as possible by drastically limiting food and undertaking extreme exercise. In severe cases, counselling is often of little benefit because the brain is so undernourished. British and South Korean scientists tested oxytocin, which is also released during sex, childbirth and  breastfeeding. Anorexics who took the chemical focused less on photos of food and paid less attention than before to images of flabby thighs or stomachs. Dubbed the 'love hormone' or the 'cuddle chemical', oxytocin also changed anorexic patients’ responses to images of angry and disgusted faces, according to one piece of research. The research was published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology after subjects were given oxytocin using a nasal spray. The same 31 participants in a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, testing their reactions to facial expressions such as anger, disgust and happiness, were less likely to linger on 'disgust' faces. Prof Youl-Ri Kim, from Inje University in Seoul, South Korea and lead author on both studies, said: 'Our research shows that oxytocin reduces patients' unconscious tendencies to focus on food, body shape, and negative emotions such as disgust. 'There is currently a lack of effective pharmacological treatments for anorexia. Our research adds important evidence to the increasing literature on oxytocin treatments for mental illnesses, and hints at the advent of a novel, ground-breaking treatment option for patients with anorexia.' Treatment: The hormone was given to 31 patients through a nasal spray (file photo posed by model) Professor Janet Treasure, of King’s College London Institute of Psychiatry and senior author for both studies said: 'Patients with anorexia have a range of social difficulties which often start in their early teenage years, before the onset of the illness. 'These social problems, which can result in isolation, may be important in understanding both the onset and maintenance of anorexia. 'By using oxytocin as a potential treatment for anorexia, we are focusing on some of these underlying problems we see in patients.' She added: 'This is early stage research with a small number of participants, but it’s hugely exciting to see the potential this treatment could have. 'We need much larger trials, on more diverse populations, before we can start to make a difference to how patients are treated.' Anorexia is one of the leading causes of mental-health related deaths both through physical complications and suicide. As well as problems with food, eating and body shape, patients with anorexia often have social difficulties including anxiety and hypersensitivity to negative emotions.","British and Korean scientists gave an oxytocin nasal spray to 31 patients .

An Occupy Wall Street spokesman said . this was 'a pretext to make the protest less sustainable and more . difficult for us', but authorities insisted they had to remove the . equipment for safety reasons. But New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the six generators and fuel were confiscated because they were considered a safety hazard and it was not an effort to remove protesters.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Foreign doctors, nurses and cleaners who can’t speak English are being sent on courses to learn the language – at the expense of the taxpayer. Nearly a third of all hospitals in England – 31 out of 110 NHS Trusts - are sending their foreign staff on English language courses, with some spending around £2,000 per time. A report released earlier this year revealed 11 per cent of NHS or community health services staff were not from the UK - with people employed from more than 200 countries. Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, of which Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, pictured, is a part of, spent £2,050 sending foreign staff on an English language course . West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust sent Bulgarian, Brazilian and Chinese employees - who are working in admin and catering roles - on an English language course at a cost of £2,960, according to The Sun. Gloucestershire Hospitals Foundation Trust also spent £2,050 sending staff for lessons, while Mid Cheshire spent £2,000 sending 18 Spanish nurses on a course, the newspaper reported. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told The Sun: ‘It’s time health chiefs look at why people from the UK are not filling those roles.’ It comes ahead of new language checks for European doctors which are set to be brought in this summer. The General Medical Council (GMC) will be able to force doctors from the European Union to take language tests if there are concerns about their ability to communicate with their patients. Under existing rules, the GMC can only test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the EU. West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust sent Bulgarian, Brazilian and Chinese employees - who are working in admin and catering roles - on an English language course at a cost of £2,960, it has reported . Since 1983 it has been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from member states. In 2008, German doctor Daniel Urbani accidentally killed Cambridge patient David Gray when he confused two drugs and gave him 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine. German doctor Daniel Ubani accidentally killed a patient in 2008 after confusing two different drugs . Under the new rules to be brought in later this year, there will be a new category in which a doctor can be found ‘impaired because he or she does not have the necessary knowledge of English’. There will also be a new power to force doctors to undergo an English language test if a ‘relevant, serious complaint is made about them’. The GMC will also have the power to ‘indefinitely suspend doctors who don’t develop sufficient English language skills to treat patients safely’. Announcing the changes in February, Niall Dickson, Chief Executive of the GMC, said: ‘Doctors who want to practise in the UK must be able to communicate effectively in English to ensure the safety of their patients. ‘These new measures to ensure doctors from other European countries can communicate in English, combined with the higher test score requirements, will help us strengthen protection for patients. They will also bring about a greater degree of fairness between our requirements for European doctors and for those from outside Europe.'","Nearly a third of all hospitals are sending foreign staff on English courses .

"By . Jill Reilly . Murdered: Aarushi Talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in 2008 . An Indian court on Monday found a dentist couple guilty of murdering their 14-year-old daughter and a servant five years ago, in a dramatic finale to a case that transfixed the country and tapped unease on both sides of the rich-poor divide. Aarushi Talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in Noida, an affluent town of new shopping malls and offices near Delhi, in 2008. A day later, the body of the Nepalese family servant, Hemraj, was discovered. Rajesh and Nupur Talwar were convicted in a local court in Ghaziabad, near Noida, and remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on Tuesday - they could face the death penalty. Early in the investigation, police . alleged Rajesh had murdered his daughter and servant in a rage after . finding them in a compromising situation - the kind of crime more often . associated with rural, conservative parts of India where 'honour . killings' are not uncommon. Naresh Yadav, a lawyer present in court, told reporters waiting outside that the couple and members of their family broke down in tears when the verdict was read out. But the case was plagued with blunders from the start. In . the hours after Aarushi, was found dead in her bedroom, . police named Hemraj as the . prime suspect. They even dispatched a team to Nepal to look for him. But . the housekeeper wasn't missing - his body was discovered lying on a . terrace above Aarushi's room. It had been there the whole time. The . Talwars came under suspicion early on, and police said the manner of the . girl's death suggested she was killed with surgical precision, a clear . nod to the Talwars' medical profession. Charged: Rajesh Talwar, left, and his wife Nupur, centre, are driven away by Indian police outside a court after their trial yesterday . 'The way in which Aarushi's . throat was cut points out that it was the work of some professional, who . could be a doctor or a butcher,' a top police official, Brij Lal, told . reporters in 2008. Police have offered several possible motives, including an honour killing. Although authorities questioned other possible suspects, the case stalled. In 2011, the Talwars demanded a fresh investigation. Suspicion: The Talwars came under suspicion early on, and police said the manner of the girl's death suggested she was killed with surgical precision, a clear nod to the Talwars' medical profession . Crime scene photo: In the hours after Aarushi, was found dead in her bedroom, police named Hemraj as the prime suspect . Denials: Both parents were later charged, but the Talwars always denied the murder and blamed sensational media coverage for demonising them and damaging their defence . Both parents were later charged, but the Talwars always denied the murder and blamed sensational media coverage for demonising them and damaging their defence. They also described a Kafkaesque trail of botched police operations, arrests, 'truth serum' tests and contradictory rulings by different investigative bodies. Much has been made in the media of the fact that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India's federal detective agency, relied on circumstantial evidence to pursue the Talwars.R.K. Saini, representing the CBI, defended the prosecution. 'There were so many circumstances that proved that no one could have committed the murder other than the two accused,' he said. Scrutiny: Indian police guard the entrance of a court during the proceedings . Captivating: It is a dramatic finale to a case that transfixed the country and tapped unease on both sides of the rich-poor divide . 'The court has convicted them after going through the chain of circumstantial evidence.' Rebecca John, one of the lawyers representing the Talwars, said they would appeal the ruling in a higher court. 'We are deeply disappointed, hurt and anguished for being convicted for a crime that we have not committed,' the Talwars said in a statement. 'We refuse to feel defeated and will continue to fight for justice.' Horrific crime stories are common in India and many involve caste or class. Support: Friends and supporters gather with placards and lighted candles around a picture of Aarushi Talwar during a rally in New Delhi . But the Aarushi case, in which police named Hemraj as the murder suspect before his body was found, resonated with the rapidly expanding number of well-off families who fret that their wealth makes them vulnerable to violence. Dipankar Gupta, a sociologist at Shiv Nadar University in Uttar Pradesh - the state where Noida is located - said the case highlighted how domestic staff were frequently abused by employers in India. 'But at least now there is some progress and people are talking about it,' he said. Newspapers this month reported the case of a wife of a member of parliament who allegedly tortured a maid to death at her home in Delhi. Security footage last week of a machete attack on a bank employee withdrawing cash from an ATM in Bangalore to pay for her child's birthday party was played repeatedly on news channels. She was partly paralysed and the attacker is at large.","Aarushi Talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in 2008 .
