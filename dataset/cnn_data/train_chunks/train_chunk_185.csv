"(CNN) -- In just over a day, rebels seized the Central African Republic's capital, forced the president out of the country and declared the nation had ""opened a new page in its history."" But no one knows what the next page will say. Michel Djotodia, the leader of the rebel alliance, the Seleka, declared himself the new president, and the rebel group says their takeover opens a path for peace and democracy. Yet questions abound over the future of impoverished, landlocked country -- and what this uprising means for its 5.1 million residents. Where is the Central African Republic? The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation in the center of the continent, slightly smaller than Texas. It is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. A former French colony, it gained independence in August 1960. Its 5.1 million residents include various ethnic groups who speak several languages. Even though French is the official language, Sango is the primary one. What has been its form of government? For the first 30 years, the country was ruled mostly by military governments. Civilian rule was established in 1993 but lasted only 10 years, according to the CIA World Factbook. In March 2003, then-president Ange-Felix Patasse was deposed in a coup led by Gen. Francois Bozize. Bozize is now in Cameroon, from which he is seeking to move to another country, the Cameroon government said in a communique dated Monday. The statement said that despite his presence, the country shall adhere to a policy of non-intervention. How long was Bozize in power? Two years after he took over in a coup, Bozize called elections in 2005 -- which he won. In 2011, he was re-elected, but activists said the polling was marred by fraud. When did the rebellion start? From the beginning, Bozize did not have full control of the nation. Rebel groups operated, particularly in rural areas. In December 2012, several of the rebel groups banded together, calling themselves the Seleka, or ""coalition"" in the Sango language. They accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. Slowly, the rebels began taking over parts of the country. Didn't the two sides strike a new peace deal? Yes, Bozize and the Seleka brokered a peace deal in January, agreeing to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that deal also fell apart. What do the rebels want? Some say the Seleka want a greater opposition presence in the country's government after Bozize's presidential election wins were met with fraud allegations. But others say greed is a factor. Only 3.1% of the land is arable, but the country has an array of natural resources, including diamonds, gold and timber. ""Government officials from Bangui have accused Seleka of harboring 'foreign provocateurs' greedy for the country's vast mineral wealth, and there are suspicions that nationals from Chad, Nigeria, and Sudan also make up Seleka's ranks,"" African studies doctoral candidate Jason Warner wrote in a piece for CNN. How did the rebels take over the capital? For weeks, the Seleka rebel coalition pushed its way from its base in the north toward the capital city of Bangui, seizing towns along the way. Their efforts took a pivotal turn on March 24, when they infiltrated the capital. Witnesses reported hours of fierce gunfire in the city, and a government official said seven civilians were killed. Before he ended up in Cameroon, Bozize had crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo by the end of the day, said Jules Gautier Ngbapo, a government spokesman. And the rebels issued a bold message: . ""The Central African Republic has just opened a new page in its history,"" said a written statement from Justin Kombo Moustapha, secretary general of the Seleka rebels. The statement described Bozize as the country's former president and urged residents to remain calm and prepare themselves to welcome rebel forces. Why were South African soldiers in the country? South Africa sent 200 troops to the country in January to work with the military there to quash the rebellion. During the rebel advance, 13 South African soldiers were killed and 27 wounded, the South African president's office said. One soldier was unaccounted for. What is likely to happen next? That's what world leaders are scrambling to figure out. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the ""unconstitutional seizure of power,"" echoing the African Union's dismay over the rebels' offensive. Ban's office said the United Nations will continue working with the African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States to find a solution. Rebel leader Djotodia declared himself the new president, and the rebel alliance said democratic elections will take place after three years. ""A new page is opening for peace and democracy in the CAR,"" Francois Nelson N'Djadder, a rebel spokesman, wrote. ""Bozize being gone, the Central Africans must gather around the table to talk and find a common path which will ... lead to the organization of democratic elections."" What other challenges does the Central African Republic face? Despite its richness of natural resources, the country is stymied by a landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies, the CIA's World Factbook said. Its per-capita GDP -- the country's economic output divided by the population -- is just $800, putting the country in 222nd place out of 228 countries. And more than one in 25 adults are afflicted with HIV or AIDS. READ MORE: Central African Republic president flees capital amid violence, official says .

"(CNN) -- With two important cases on gay rights and marriage equality slated for oral arguments in the Supreme Court next week, Americans of all stripes are participating in a national debate over this emotionally charged issue -- on the Internet, on television, in our leading newspapers and around countless dinner tables. Despite this interest, only a handful of people will get to see these historic arguments -- those who show up to the courtroom next Tuesday and Wednesday. This is the result of the Supreme Court's longstanding policy prohibiting cameras inside the courtroom. The court's main reason for banning cameras -- as Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy reminded us recently at a congressional hearing -- is there would be an increased risk the justices' questions and comments would be taken out of context and then played (and replayed) on the news or, worse yet, lampooned on ""The Colbert Report."" This would be a completely valid concern if it weren't for the fact that it's happening already. As the justices well know, reporters, columnists, cartoonists and late-night comedians already extract the juiciest sound bites from oral arguments, sometimes taking them out of context and blowing them up into big stories. Indeed, such sound bites often dominate the media's coverage of the Supreme Court. For evidence of this, look no further than Justice Antonin Scalia's remark from the court's oral argument in the case of Shelby County v. Holder. Scalia suggested the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had survived only because of the self-perpetuating power of ""racial entitlements"" -- a comment that generated countless news stories, editorials, op-eds and political cartoons, to say nothing of parodies on satirical shows such as ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Daily Show."" Or, better yet, consider Justice Clarence Thomas' decision in January to tell a joke during oral argument -- breaking his seven-year streak of silence and, in the process, becoming front-page news. Does anyone, other than the closest court-watcher, even remember the name of that case or the issues it presented? Or, take the constant plight of Kennedy, who commentators tend to assume is the decisive vote in each of the court's most important cases. His every question, word, sigh and hiccup becomes a key part of how cases are covered in the media, as everyone scrambles for possible clues for how Kennedy might vote. Needless to say -- and as Kennedy well knows -- such predictions are often inaccurate. Sometimes, the focus on sound bites is entirely appropriate. Scalia's characterization of the Voting Rights Act was offensive, and it deserved to be national news. Furthermore, it's important to report potentially revealing comments from the court's swing justice. But more often than not, the media coverage of the court is already focused on sound bites, which sometimes get taken out of context. Therefore, the Supreme Court might as well open up and let all Americans experience the majesty of its hearings -- an experience that can be captured only by attending an argument in person or by watching an argument unfold live in one's living room or on one's laptop. As lawyers who have been to dozens of Supreme Court hearings, we can confidently say that there's nothing that the federal government does that's more impressive than the high-quality debates that occur on a daily basis before the Supreme Court. The American public would be astonished at the skill of the advocates, the force of the questions and the overall level at which legal issues are debated before our high court. If only they could see these arguments in real time, in their entirety. Since media coverage of the high court already focuses on the trite at the expense of the court's majesty, it makes sense to remove the media filter. Exposing the American public to the fullness of Supreme Court arguments by permitting cameras in the courtroom would be a service rather than hindrance to the judiciary. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Doug Kendall and Tom Donnelly.","The Supreme Court will hear two important cases on gay rights next week .
Doug Kendall, Tom Donnelly: Justices should allow cameras inside the courtroom .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Fueled by seasonal monsoon rains and a nearby tropical storm, widespread flooding in the Philippines worsened Tuesday, killing at least 11 people, the national disaster agency reported. A landslide in the Manila suburb of Quezon City buried two houses, leaving nine people dead and four others injured, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Center. Three of the dead were children, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported. The capital city of Manila got 504 millimeters (about 20 inches) of rain Tuesday, PNA reported, with more on the way. The country's weather service -- the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration -- warned the Manila region's 12 million residents of continued torrential rains and serious flooding through Wednesday. ""It's like a water world,"" Benito Ramos, head of the disaster agency, said of the city, according to PNA. The national railroad called off service, and many roads were under water. Some dams were beginning to overflow, putting more communities at risk, the authorities said. North Koreans in desperate need of food after floods . The flooding has already forced more than 780,000 people across the country from their homes, the disaster agency said. About 242,000 were staying in emergency shelters Tuesday night, according to the agency. Rescue requests continued to come in early Wednesday, including some people who were using Twitter to contact the authorities for help. ""Pregnant woman needs help! Staying on top of a roof,"" one Twitter user posted, followed by an address. ""Please help BORRES FAMILY w/ 2y/o child!!,"" posted another. The weather agency warned residents to expect more landslides and flash flooding, and the authorities urged residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground. As well as the deaths in the landslide in Quezon City, two people died from electrocution and drowning outside the Manila region, the disaster agency said early Wednesday. Those deaths came on top of the 53 people who had already been killed across the Philippines by heavy wind and rain in the past few weeks. In an effort to save lives and make way for rescue and relief efforts, President Benigno Aquino ordered work suspended at government and private offices around the capital region Tuesday. Government offices and schools were also to be closed Wednesday, the president's office said. Deep water in many parts of metropolitan Manila blocked roads, stranded cars and flooded homes. In several areas, the water was waist deep or higher, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority said in its Twitter feed. ""Last night it was raining cats and dogs, or even like elephants banging on your roof top,"" said CNN iReporter Rummel Pinera. ""You cannot sleep when it's raining for several hours like this, it was like a deluge."" Another iReporter, Jumar Rejuso, said the downpour was terrifying. 2 tropical cyclones strike Chinese coast in quick succession . ""We had to force ourselves to leave in order to be spared from the wrath of the raging waters,"" he said. ""It was the first time I have witnessed in my entire life a flood as big as that."" Flooding has struck across the Philippines, with high water reported in 46 communities across the country, the disaster agency reported. The authorities in Marikina City imposed a forced evacuation of areas near the Marikina River, which has risen above critical levels, PNA reported. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said the Ambuklao, Binga and San Roque dams were releasing water, putting several cities at a higher risk of flooding. The agency warned residents living near the dams to be on the lookout for rising waters. U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Harry K. Thomas said Tuesday that the United States would provide $100,000 for disaster relief. The rain and flooding are the result of the normal summer monsoon enhanced by the effects of Tropical Storm Haikui, the Philippines weather service said. The storm made landfall on the east coast of China on Wednesday morning. The Philippines had already been lashed by heavy rain and wind in recent weeks resulting from Tropical Storm Saola, which plowed past it before hitting Taiwan and China at the end of last week. The country is frequently subjected to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rain. In December, Tropical Storm Washi left more than 1,200 people dead after it set off flash floods that swept away entire villages in the southern Philippines. Complete coverage of extreme weather .

"(CNN) -- A movie about literary merit, artistic ambition, authenticity and conscience, set in New York's publishing world, featuring stories within stories and propelled by an unreliable narrator. It may sound like smart, upscale filmmaking, but I'm afraid ""The Words"" turns into a punishing sentence. Resembling nothing so much as one of those hermetic Woody Allen comedies about self-absorbed intelligentsia, only without the comedy, ""The Words"" lays its bookish credentials on thick but rarely feels honest or true. Instead, it rehashes one clichÃ© after another: War-torn lovers part on train platforms, a dusty attachÃ© case picked up in an antique store holds hidden treasure, and late at night, a disappointed author rereads the rejection letters he's kept on file for just such an occasion. We begin with Dennis Quaid's craggy novelist Clay Hammond reading to a packed hall from his latest book, ""The Words."" This is the tale of another acclaimed novelist, Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), and his prizewinning opus, ""The Window Tear,"" which -- wouldn't you know it? -- comes with its own, troubled back story and yet another great writer, this one played by Jeremy Irons under layers of latex and an unbecoming raincoat. Confused? You won't be. The movie insists on explaining itself down to the last comma in copious narration or clunky expository dialogue as it shunts from one literary crisis to the next. One guy can't get published and may be too subtle for his own good. Another loses his manuscript. A third can't get laid. These qualify as high stakes for men who sit in front of a desk all day (believe me, I know!), but they don't necessarily translate into compelling drama. That's why the last time Bradley Cooper played an aspiring writer with more ambition than talent -- remember ""Limitless""? -- he took a mind-enhancing super drug and quickly graduated to more inherently cinematic activities like making millions on Wall Street and dodging bullets. Much fun was had by all, and the movie was a minor but deserving hit. In a flick with an unusually high proportion of unconvincing performances, at least Cooper holds his own: Unwarranted approbation is something he gets. Quaid is stuck with the worst of the writing, Hammond's leaden prose, but his strident delivery sure doesn't help. Irons overdoes the hunched old man theatrics and can't keep his accent in check but still manages to suggest nuances and knowledge well beyond the scope of anybody else on screen. A scene in which he teases out a yarn -- part confession, part accusation -- on a park bench is a little master class in timing and tonal variation, like watching an expert fly-fisherman reel in the catch of the day. As for the women -- Zoe Saldana, Olivia Wilde, Nora Arnezeder -- they're either doe-eyed with admiration or walking out the door, with precious little in between. That seems like a serious miscalculation for a movie that wouldn't mind jerking your tear ducts from time to time, but it's easily trumped by the folly of writing such a turgid screenplay about literary accomplishment. As someone remarked to a bona fide American wordsmith, Ernest Hemingway, ""the sun also sets, you know?""","Bradley Cooper, Dennis Quaid and Jeremy Irons play writers .

"(CNN) -- New York Fashion Week is one of the fashion industry's biggest events of the year, the culmination of months of planning, organizing, schmoozing ... and dieting? When it comes to the biannual fashion shows, which kick off Thursday, models aren't the only ones looking to drop a few pounds before hitting the tents. Some publicists, bloggers and fashion editors have been counting calories for weeks in anticipation of the week-long event, where to some, networking and being seen are just as important as the collections debuting on the runways. Anyone who has tried to get in shape for a wedding or school reunion can relate to the pressure of wanting to look his or her best and reaching to achieve that goal with varying degrees of success. Consumers turn out for Fashion's Night Out . Nutritionists say that limiting caloric intake in a compressed time frame can lead to nutrient deficiencies, causing decreased immune function, dry skin and loss of muscle or bone density, for starters. But in an industry that's all about image, it's a price many are willing to pay. ""Perception is reality in this industry, and unfortunately, you have to look the look to get the clients,"" said public relations specialist Keisha McCotry, who began her Fashion Week diet in July. She plans on attending Fashion Week to recruit designers for her firm, Prominence Marketing Group. Throughout the summer, fashionistas from all corners of the industry have been tweeting with a blend of sarcasm and sincerity about plans to start, defer or defy a #NYFW diet. ""I'm thinking we should start our #NYFW diet tomorrow. What do you think?"" tweeted DKNY PR GIRL, the online persona of fashion publicist extraordinaire Aliza Licht, senior vice president of global communications at Donna Karan International, on August 12. She followed up with ""#PRGirlDiet"" regulations: ""No non-purpose bread (ie bread baskets, pretzels, croutons) or candy/sugar. Basically anything fun. EXCEPT: frozen yogurt is ok."" The tweet prompted conversation over froyo toppings (""just sprinkles. One layer. No middle/ bottom"") and how cutting out bread makes a huge difference (""Soon you'll realize your body hates it""). Tweets about the #NYFW diet continued this week, though some accompanied by images of cupcakes and quesadillas were clearly intended to be tongue-in-cheek. But others made it clear they were still counting calories like it's their job. ""Fashion Week is prime recruiting season, and we all are walking billboards. You have to be on your A-game and look your best,"" McCotry said. ""You want to go to events wearing the designers' clothes, and you can't do that with a flabby belly."" McCotry posted a picture of her #NYFW diet dinner on August 16: a bowl of broccoli. While tales abound of models going on crash diets and Master Cleanses and publicists surviving on coffee, cigarettes and air kisses, for many like McCotry, it's a balancing act of limiting calorie intake while meeting basic nutritional needs. McCotry began her Fashion Week diet on July 4. A typical day starts with a protein shake and lemon water for breakfast, followed by a side salad for lunch. For dinner, she prepares a piece of protein, like unseasoned chicken oven-baked without oil, accompanied by a serving of steamed veggies such as broccoli, squash or asparagus. If she gets hungry, she snacks on fruit slices or downs water and takes a daily multivitamin with extra iron. She hasn't cut out alcohol entirely. But she has switched from dessert white wines, her drink of choice, to reds, setting a limit of one per outing. Looks debuting at Fashion Week . No, it hasn't been easy, she said. But it's part of the job, and she loves what she does. ""It's hard, but I know what the end result will be,"" she said. ""No pain, no gain."" Nutrition specialist Dr. Melina Jampolis said McCotry's regimen isn't as bad as the horror stories of people chain-smoking to stave off hunger or eking out a meager existence on cayenne-pepper-flavored water. But it's still a little low in calories and fat for optimal health, she said, and could lead to a loss of muscle mass, which is difficult to rebuild. The process creates a vicious cycle in which each time a person goes on a diet like McCotry's, she'll have to further lower her caloric intake in order to drop weight. Meanwhile, the loss of nutrients could lead to long-term deficiencies and wreak havoc on the body's ability to metabolize, Jampolis said. ""With low-fat diets, we see a lot of skinny fat, where they get lean, but their body fat goes up because they're losing muscle,"" Jampolis said. Fashion Week desserts . ""I wouldn't call this a crash diet. It's too low in calories, and she's certainly missing out on fat, but if she added protein at lunch and healthy snacks like nuts, seeds and avocados, I think she'd look and feel great."" As Fashion Week kicks off, McCotry said, other priorities are consuming her attention, like piecing together outfits that will help her get into shows she hasn't been invited to. She believes she is one step closer to the runways, thanks to her #NYFW diet. After all, she has dropped from 152 to 141 pounds in just two months. ""This process is very grueling, but being able to be at Fashion Week is every woman's dream,"" she said. ""Every woman should get to experience it once, even if you don't go through what we have to go through.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- At least 175 people have died from flooding this month in southern and eastern China, the country's Ministry of Civil Affairs said Monday. Another 86 people are missing from the flooding that began with rainfall on June 3. The ministry said 13 provinces have been affected, more than 1.6 million people have been evacuated, and the direct economic losses has reached 35.02 billion yuan ($5.4 billion). The flooding has destroyed at least 8,400 houses in Zhejiang province alone, a provincial agency said. More than 4.4 million have been affected by the flooding in Zhejiang as of Monday, according to the Zhejiang Flood Control Office. About 292,000 have been evacuated, according to the agency's website. The direct economic loss in Zhejiang has reached 7.69 billion yuan ($1.18 billion), the agency said. Zhao Fayuan, director of the Zhejiang Flood Control Office, said the areas around the Qiantang and Dongtiao rivers have been the most severely affected. In Zhoushan, about 155 kilometers (95 miles) southeast of Shanghai, massive pools of water submerged homes in a section of the city on Tuesday, leaving only the tops of power poles as clues of the community underneath. Residents fear waters may not recede for another week. At least 171,000 hectares (422,550 acres) of crops have been destroyed by flooding, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing data from local officials. A Zhejiang official said more than 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) of dikes were in danger of overflowing near Lanxi city, according to Xinhua. The southern province of Jiangxi is grappling with the worst flooding on record there. At least 40,000 people have been evacuated from flooding over the weekend. ""The farmlands are severely affected by the flood,"" Qiu Qiyong of the Jiangxi Flood Control and Drought Relief Office said Monday. He said the economic loss over two days reached 0.836 billion yuan ($129 million). Residents in Jiangxi got a bit of a respite Monday, as rainfall stopped and water levels decreased. Some of those evacuated were able to return to their homes. Hubei province -- where the Three Gorges Dam is located -- has suffered significant flooding, according to Xinhua. And the rains caused water levels in dozens of reservoirs in neighboring Hunan province ""to exceed alarming levels,"" the news agency said. The flooding ended the worst drought to hit southern China in 50 years. It came a month after the Chinese government acknowledged that Three Gorges Dam -- the world's largest hydropower plant -- was having ""urgent problems"" and warned of environmental, construction and migration ""disasters."" The dam was originally touted for its ability to control the impact of flooding that threatens the Yangtze River Delta each summer. But more than 1,000 towns and villages were flooded during the digging and construction of the dam's giant concrete barrier. And landslides and pollution have plagued the areas near the dam since it was built.","NEW: Residents fear waters may not recede for another week .

"(CNN)  -- Next month, the Vidalia Onion Committee, a Georgia group that promotes the consumption of sweet onions, will roll out 6-foot cardboard cutouts of the ogre Shrek as a tie-in to the latest film in the series, ""Shrek Forever After."" In turn, the Georgia-based growers group hopes the green guy will turn children on to eating Vidalia onions. ""We do like to market to younger audiences and teach them about our product,"" said Wendy Brannen, the committee's executive director. Although it's not the first time movie advertising has taken to the produce aisle (Disney promoted the DVD release of Peter Pan a few years ago with stickers on fresh tomatoes), it's definitely one of the most prominent displays. It's become almost commonplace to see the latest cartoon character pop up on a cereal box or a Happy Meal, but these characters have been creeping up among fresh fruit and vegetable displays in recent years, which industry officials say is all good if it gets children to eat more produce. In a study published last year by the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, researchers at Ohio State University found that adolescents don't meet guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption, and fruit and juice consumption drops once children turn 6. Popeye and the characters from Disney and Peanuts are among the cartoons that have been featured by produce companies, says Patrick Delaney, communications manager for the United Fresh Produce Association in Washington. And last summer, Sesame Street's Cookie Monster teamed up with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to promote children eating a rainbow of fresh produce. Shrek seemed an obvious choice for the Vidalia campaign, Brannen says, because the ogre compares himself to an onion in the first Shrek film. ""Ogres are like onions,"" Shrek tells Donkey: ""Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers."" Beginning in late April when Vidalia onions are harvested and up through the movie's May 21 premiere, Shrek cutouts will decorate produce aisles in thousands of stores, Brannen says. Along with taking home kid-friendly recipes, shoppers can enter to win a 50-inch television, a Nintendo Wii game system and a Shrek video game. In the meantime, here are our five favorite produce spokescartoons: . Donald Duck .

"(CNN) -- A 30-year-old Uzbekistan national living in Boise, Idaho, was arrested Thursday on federal terrorism charges, the Justice Department said. A grand jury in Boise returned a three-court indictment charging Fazliddin Kurbanov, 30, with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and one count of possessing an unregistered destructive device. A grand jury in Salt Lake City, Utah, returned a separate indictment charging him with one count of distribution of information relating to explosives, destructive devices and weapons of mass destruction. ""One of our highest priorities is disrupting potential acts of terrorism. The coordinated investigation, arrest, and indictments in this case demonstrate the commitment of all involved to do just that,"" U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah David B. Barlow said in a statement announcing the arrest. It was not immediately clear whether Kurbanov had retained counsel. According to the Idaho indictment, he is alleged to have knowingly conspired with others to support to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an American-designated foreign terrorist organization, between August and May. He is accused of having provided support, believing that it was to be used in an ""offense involving the use of a weapon of mass destruction,"" the statement said. In Utah, he is alleged to have taught and demonstrated how to make explosive devices, by showing Internet videos and conducting instructional shopping trips. Kurbanov, who is in the United States legally, is expected to make an initial appearance in court in Boise on Friday.","30-year-old Fazliddin Kurbanov is arrested in Boise, Idaho .

"(CNN) -- Justice Department officials are tight-lipped, but The Associated Press says it knows why federal agents wanted telephone records of its reporters. A May 7, 2012, AP story broke the news that the CIA had thwarted an al Qaeda plot to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner around the anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden by American commandos. The story, which included reporting by five staffers, said the plot was significant in part because the White House had told the public that it had no information about planned attacks around the anniversary. It came two-and-a-half years after a similar attempt by al Qaeda operative Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who concealed a bomb in his underwear and unsuccessfully attempted to detonate it on a flight to Detroit. The 2012 attempt involved a more sophisticated bomb, the AP reported. ""The AP learned about the thwarted plot last week but agreed to White House and CIA requests not to publish it immediately because the sensitive intelligence operation was still under way,"" the news agency report stated. ""Once officials said those concerns were allayed, the AP decided to disclose the plot Monday despite requests from the Obama administration to wait for an official announcement Tuesday."" Sources later told CNN that the operative who was supposed to have carried the bomb had been inserted into al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate by Saudi intelligence, and that the device had been handed over to U.S. analysts. One source said Saudi counterterrorism officials were upset that details of the operation had emerged in the United States because they had a network of agents inside the Yemeni branch who could have been compromised by leaks from Washington. Without confirming the focus of the probe, Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that the disclosure was ""within the top two or three most serious leaks I've ever seen."" ""It put the American people at risk, and that is not hyperbole,"" he said. Holder said he has recused himself from the investigation after being questioned by FBI agents as part of the probe, but he defended the Justice Department's decision to subpoena the AP records. AP President Gary Pruitt has called the subpoenas -- which the news agency learned of last week -- a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" into its reporting. ""Finally, they say this secrecy is important for national security,"" Pruitt wrote to Deputy Attorney General James Cole on Tuesday. ""It is always difficult to respond to that, particularly since they still haven't told us specifically what they are investigating.""","The AP says the leak probe centers on a May 2012 story on a failed bomb plot .

"(CNN) -- In the hi-tech era of electronic voting, election authorities in the Philippines settled a dead heat between two candidates for mayor in a decidedly old-school way -- by flipping a coin. When all the ballots were counted after Monday's election, the two men running for mayor in the town of San Teodoro -- Marvic Feraren and Boyet Py -- both ended up with 3,236 votes each, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported Wednesday. To break the impasse, a decision was taken to use a coin, Reny Pagilagan, the town's acting election officer, told the local broadcaster. The Philippine Commission on Elections permits coin flips as a way of deciding tied votes, according to ABS-CBN. So, the two rivals faced off inside a ring of desks in a bare-walled room, taking it in turns to flick the coin to the ground. At the end of the contest, Feraren, the son of a previous mayor, was declared the winner. The outcome was received without negative reaction in San Teodoro, which is in the province of Oriental Mindoro, ABS-CBN reported.

"(CNN) -- An American lawyer based in Moscow who used to work at the U.S. Embassy there was expelled from Russia two weeks ago, his law firm said on Monday. Thomas Firestone was refused admission to Russia on May 5, according to the law firm Baker & McKenzie. ""We have no reason to believe that our colleague has engaged in wrongdoing of any kind,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Neither our colleague nor we have been informed of the reason for this action."" Until 2012, Firestone was the resident legal adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, specializing in crime and corruption issues in Russia. In September, he became a senior counsel in Baker & McKenzie's Moscow office. Now he is working at the firm's Washington office, the firm said. The U.S. State Department was not notified of the expulsion, a spokesman said Monday, and Russia would not be obliged to inform the United States. ""I don't have any information on this particular individual,"" said spokesman Patrick Ventrell. ""He was a private citizen."" According to the New York Times, one source familiar with the case said Firestone turned down a March request from Russian intelligence operatives to spy for Russia. It is unclear whether that alleged approach is related to his expulsion. But after a trip abroad, when Firestone tried to return to Russia, he was detained for 16 hours at the Moscow airport and was eventually put on a plane to the United States, the newspaper said. A representative at the Russian Embassy in Washington declined to comment, and according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Russia's Foreign Ministry declined to comment as well. A week after Firestone's expulsion, Moscow publicly announced the expulsion of another American, Ryan Fogle, who worked at the U.S. Embassy. Fogle was accused of trying to recruit Russians to spy for the United States, and Russian officials released a video of him being detained while wearing a wig. The video also showed a map, a compass and other paraphernalia that were said to be in his possession at the time. Top officials from Russia and the United States have denied that the espionage claims are affecting relations between the two countries. But at least one former counterintelligence official says the expulsions are designed to send a message. ""These things are stage-managed; they're orchestrated for maximum effect,"" said Joel Brenner, who served as the national counterintelligence executive from 2006 to 2009 and wrote the book ""America the Vulnerable."" ""The Russians are letting us know across the board now that they're not our friends.""","Former legal adviser for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is denied re-entry to Russia .

"(CNN) -- Eric Garcetti won the Los Angeles mayoral race, and will become the city's first elected Jewish mayor. ""Thank you Los Angeles -- the hard work begins but I am honored to lead this city for the next four years,"" Garcetti, 42, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning. ""Let's make this a great city again."" His opponent, Wendy Greuel, was seeking to become the city's first female mayor. She called Garcetti to offer her congratulations Wednesday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, and in the afternoon posted a message on her website thanking volunteers and those who voted for her. ""I may not have been able to break through the glass ceiling last night,"" said Greuel, 51, ""but you sure helped me put a crack in it, and because of your work, the next woman candidate in my shoes will crash right through it."" Greuel, who is controller for the nation's second-largest city, said she is ""determined to continue fighting for all Angelenos, to cut waste and increase efficiency, and above all, to keep our streets and neighborhoods safe."" Garcetti, a city councilman, received 54% of the 337,000 votes cast; Greuel got the other 46%, figures from the city clerk's office show. Garcetti's mother is Jewish, and his father, Gil, the former district attorney whose office lost in the O.J. Simpson murder trial in the 1990s, is of Mexican and Italian descent. ""I always felt myself to be Jewish and Latino very comfortably,"" Garcetti told the Jewish Journal during the campaign. ""Weekends were both filled with bowls of menudo and lots of bagels."" Los Angeles once had an acting mayor for a couple of weeks who was Jewish. An LA Times column notes that Bernard Cohn, an appointee, served briefly in 1878 after the elected mayor died. Antonio Villaraigosa, the city's first Latino mayor in more than 130 years, is stepping down after eight years because of term limits. California had a Jewish governor, Washington Bartlett, in 1887. Garcetti is also the first Los Angeles mayor who can accurately claim that he ""commandeered a snowmobile at the North Pole while on a climate-change fact-finding mission and located Salma Hayek's lost purse in the frozen tundra,"" the Los Angeles Times reports.

"(CNN) -- The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, who worked with NSA leaker Edward Snowden on articles about the agency's secret surveillance programs, slammed U.S. Rep. Peter King after the New York Republican called for the columnist to face criminal charges. ""You can't just go on national television and call for the arrest and prosecution of a journalist and tell outright falsehoods when you're doing it, without consequences,"" Greenwald told CNN's AC360 on Wednesday night. He was referring to an earlier Fox News interview during which King accused Greenwald of threatening to disclose the names of CIA agents and assets around the world. ""No right is absolute, and even the press has certain restrictions,"" King told Fox News on Wednesday. ""I think it should be very targeted, very selective and certainly a very rare exception. But in this case, when you have someone who has disclosed secrets like this, and threatens to release more, then to me â€” yes, there has to be, legal action should be taken against him. This is a very unusual case with life and death implications for Americans."" Greenwald denied the allegations. King's office did not respond to a CNN request for clarification of his comments. ""I was really staggered that a United States congressman, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, actually could go on national television and make up an accusation, literally fabricated out of whole cloth, namely that I have threatened to uncover the names of covert CIA agents, as a way of arguing for my arrest and prosecution inside the United States for the crime of doing journalism,"" Greenwald told CNN's AC360. ""I mean it's bad enough to call for that. It's extraordinarily menacing that he did so based on a complete falsehood -- the idea that I ever threatened that. I did not, nor would I ever.""

"Chicago (CNN) -- A Chicago jury found William Balfour, Jennifer Hudson's former brother-in-law, guilty Friday on three counts of first-degree murder and four other counts related to the 2008 slayings of the entertainer's mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew. He will be sentenced to life without parole; Illinois has no death penalty. Hudson, who was in the courtroom with her sister Julia and fiance, David Otunga, broke down in tears as she heard the verdict. Otunga said, ""Yes,"" and put his arm around her. Hours later, the two Hudson sisters released a statement thanking God, the prosecution team, ""the best police department"" and ""people all over the world"" for their support. ""It is our prayer that the Lord will forgive Mr. Balfour of these heinous acts and bring his heart into repentance someday,"" the sisters said in the statement, which was posted to Jennifer Hudson's website and linked to via Twitter. In addition to murder, Balfour was found guilty of aggravated kidnapping, home invasion, residential burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. A public defender for Balfour said his legal team would file a motion for a new trial on June 8 and then file a notice of appeal. ""I do feel there were very strong issues of law in this case that need to be looked at by an appellate court,"" Amy Thompson told reporters outside the courthouse. ""So we do have some hope."" CNN Legal Analyst Sunny Hostin expressed surprise at the verdict. ""This wasn't a slam-dunk case,"" she said, citing a lack of forensic evidence. The case went to the jury Thursday, after heated closing arguments Wednesday set a tense tone. In the middle of the afternoon on Friday, the jurors sent Judge Charles Burns notes saying they were split and asking to see testimony about cell phone records showing that Balfour's phone was near the site of the killings at the time they took place. The split was then nine to three in favor of conviction, said juror Jacinta Gholston, who works for a Chicago-based chocolate company. ""There were three of us who just needed to see the picture a little clearer,"" she told reporters after the verdict. The records proved key. An hour later, jurors told the judge they had reached a verdict. ""Once we got those holes filled, we were able to come to a unanimous decision,"" Gholston said. Juror Paula Halcomb, a math teacher in the suburbs southwest of Chicago, also cited the cell phone records as persuasive. ""We realized that he could not be in two places at one time,"" she said. Hudson's testimony played no role in the jury's decision. ""She didn't really say anything,"" Halcomb said. Hudson, who was called as the prosecution's first of more than 80 witnesses, broke down in tears several times on the stand as she recalled her family. ""None of us wanted her to marry him,"" Hudson said of her sister's decision to marry Balfour. ""We did not like how he treated her. ""Where he was, I tried not to be,"" she said. ""This wasn't a case about Jennifer Hudson,"" Gholston said of the entertainer, who attended the trial each day. ""For us, her celebrity had nothing to do with it."" Jury foreman Robert Smith, 42, who works for Chicago Public Schools, said the decision was an easy one for him. ""I was pretty much certain from the beginning,"" he said of Balfour's guilt. ""To me, everything connected."" Asked what he would tell Hudson, he said, ""Honest, I don't really have anything to say to her. But I just hope that she can kind of put this behind her and just get on with the rest of her life."" Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said the singer was ""was very emotional about the verdict, as you can well imagine, and so was her sister and the rest of the family -- emotional but relieved."" Defense lawyer Thompson had argued that police had homed in on Balfour rather than conducting a full investigation. ""In their mind, this wasn't a whodunnit,"" she said. No DNA evidence pointed to Balfour, said Thompson, who also questioned police work in the case, describing a set of keys that she said surfaced on an evidence list a month after the slayings. ""Those keys show how desperate the state was. They resorted to this. ... My client is an innocent man,"" she said. But prosecutors argued that physical and circumstantial evidence linked Balfour to the killings and described as ""absurd"" defense claims that police may have planted evidence or been part of a conspiracy to frame Balfour. Prosecutor Jim McKay told jurors that there was a ""tsunami of circumstantial evidence."" ""The circumstantial facts of this case are drowning this guy in guilt,"" he said. Cook County prosecutor Jennifer Bagby said in her closing argument that Balfour had threatened to kill the family of Julia Hudson. ""If you leave me, I'll kill you. I'll kill your family first. You'll be the last to die,"" he had said, according to Bagby. ""He went in that house for one reason, and one reason only, to carry out that threat,"" Bagby told jurors. Balfour was accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and the singer's brother, Jason Hudson, 29, in their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of Hudson's nephew, Julian King, was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle. Prosecutors portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered the three in a rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend. In her closing argument, Bagby said Balfour shot Hudson's mother as she tried to defend herself with a broom. ""He fired that gun at her over and over and over,"" Bagby said. McKay called Balfour ""a true coward."" ""He shoots a 57-year-old grandmother in the back. He shoots a 29-year-old man in his sleep. He shoots a 7-year-old twice in the head,"" McKay told jurors. ""The family, the community, the city, the country demand justice."" In the trial, 83 witnesses testified over 11 days. The crimes took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on ""American Idol,"" won an Oscar for her role in the movie ""Dreamgirls."" In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother. ""My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,"" she said. Her career has continued to blossom and remains varied since her relatives' deaths. Recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight; being cast as Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, in an upcoming movie; releasing a new album; and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the Grammy Awards in February.

"(EW.com) -- The sex is in the heel, indeed! The Harvey Fierstein-Cyndi Lauper musical Kinky Boots (based on the 2005 British film) dominated the Tony nominations, garnering 13 Tony nominations, including a best score nod for Lauper for her first-ever musical. Trailing not far behind were Matilda (12 nods), whose four tweens sharing the title role will be recognized with a special award on Tony night, Pippin (10 nods), and Rodgers + Hammerstein's Cinderella (9 nods). On the play side, the celebrated revival of Clifford Odets' Golden Boy proved strong as its boxer lead character, with 8 nods. Tom Hanks guns for EGOT territory with a best actor in a play nod in his first Broadway role in Lucky Guy (its late author Nora Ephron was also nominated for the journalism bio). But perhaps the biggest surprise was the very strong showing for Christopher Durang's Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike with 6 nods, including one in each acting category (though star Sigourney Weaver's comic turn was overlooked).

"(CNN) -- FBI agents raided the offices of California state Sen. Ron Calderon and the Latino legislative caucus on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear why. ""This afternoon, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation served search warrants in the State Capitol at the office of Sen. Ron Calderon and in the Legislative Office Building at the Latino Legislative Caucus office,"" Tony Beard, chief sergeant at arms for the California Senate, said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- The poet Sylvia Plath, who made a name for herself through prose and poetry that conveyed a sense of depression and suicidal tendencies, famously died by asphyxiating herself in an oven in 1963. There is evidence that depression runs in families, but both genetics and environment influence the condition. The recent reported suicide of her son, marine biologist Nicholas Hughes, brings to light a known psychiatric phenomenon: the heredity of suicidal behavior. A first-degree relative -- a parent, sibling or child -- of a person who has committed suicide is four to six times more likely to attempt or complete a suicide, said Dr. David Brent, psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Studies on twins have shown that suicidal behavior is between 30 and 50 percent due to heritable factors, he said. Suicide victims' biological relatives who were adopted away also show an increased risk of suicide, he said. The rate of suicide in America is 10.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people, according to the latest information from the National Institute of Mental Health. That means, although the likelihood of suicidal behavior increases in families, a completed suicide is still a rare event, Brent said. ""Genetics is not destiny,"" he said. ""The odds are still very much against you having this happening to another relative."" Family history of suicide and family history of mental disorder are two risk factors that the National Institute of Mental Health lists. More than 90 percent of people who die by suicide have depression or another mental disorder, or a substance abuse disorder in combination with another mental problem, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Learn about the link between depression and creativity . Research shows that depression runs in families. A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows biological markers for the inherited condition. The researchers found, in a sample of 131 people, that the biological offspring of depressed people had structural differences in their brain. Some of these people had been followed for more than 25 years.  Learn more about mood disorders » . People at high risk of developing depression had a 28 percent thinning of the right cortex, the brain's outermost surface, the study found. Those with an extra thinning abnormality in the left cortex were most likely to develop depression or anxiety. The data set shows that this brain surface thinning was present before these people developed mental problems, and was found in both children and grandchildren of depressed people, said Dr. Bradley Peterson, psychiatrist at Columbia University Medical Center and co-author of the study. The new study may point toward more individualized medicine -- one day people may be screened for these brain abnormalities that indicate high depression risk, and receive treatment based on that, he said. Researchers believe the cortical thinning causes depression by interfering with the processing of emotional stimuli, he said. A person with these brain abnormalities may benefit from therapy targeted at responding to social stimuli more appropriately, he said. With both depression and suicide, research suggests that causal factors are a combination of genetics and environment, Peterson said. The best way to prevent suicide is to treat the underlying psychiatric disorder, Brent said. Besides Hughes and Plath, famous examples of two or more close relatives committing suicide include Ernest Hemingway's family -- Hemingway's father, brother, sister and granddaughter, in addition to the famous novelist himself, killed themselves. The poet John Berryman jumped off a Minneapolis bridge in 1972; his father had committed suicide when the poet was a child. More recently, the playwright Spalding Gray apparently killed himself in 2004; his mother had taken her own life many years earlier. Do relatives of people who killed themselves imitate suicide? This is possible, but hard to prove or disprove, Brent said. In fact, there is more evidence of copycat suicides among people who did not know the victim well, but merely learned about him or her through the news. If you've actually lost a relative to suicide and go through the bereavement process, you may be more likely to understand the aftermath of suicide, Brent said. Suicide ""can also represent the learned or transmitted way of coping with unbearable stress,"" Peterson said. What exactly gets transmitted in families with suicide? One theory is that it's a difficulty in emotional regulation. ""Not necessarily depression per se, but it's the ability to restrain yourself from acting on suicidal thoughts,"" Brent said. The American Association of Suicidology is one place for online information if you or someone you know is contemplating suicide. For immediate assistance, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).","First-degree relatives are 4 to 6 times more likely to attempt or complete a suicide .

"(CNN) -- Trayvon Martin should be remembered as a happy, smiling teenager, says his soft-spoken older brother. Martin, 17, was an honors student with his own college dreams, according to Jahvaris Fulton. But Martin's life ended on February 26 in Sanford, Florida, during an encounter with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. ""He probably was going to be someone,"" Fulton, in an interview aired Friday night on CNN's ""AC360,"" said of Martin. Fulton humorously recalled Martin's first time riding on a horse. ""His horse had some problems. It wanted to be a bully to everybody else's horse. He (Martin) handled it. He was the first one to learn how to control him."" Martin was shot and killed eight days after that trip. Fulton recalled speaking with his mother, Sybrina Fulton, after learning of Martin's death. Attorney: Zimmerman 'stressed' about charges . ""I just paused because I didn't believe it,"" Fulton told HLN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. ""I didn't understand it, either."" The older brother said he was confused by the circumstances. ""Everything I heard was from Zimmerman's perspective,"" Fulton said. ""It didn't sound like my brother at all. (That) my brother attacked him and did all this stuff. It doesn't sound like him at all. He wasn't confrontational or violent."" Zimmerman was charged Wednesday with second-degree murder in Martin's death. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, has said he killed Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in self-defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on a sidewalk. But Fulton said his reading of the evidence and 911 tapes indicated Martin ""tried to get away from the situation. He wasn't violent. For him to actually jump on someone he doesn't even know, to me that's not him. He's smarter than that."" Defense attorney Mark O'Mara has asked that there be no rush to judgment. ""Nobody, after all, wanted Trayvon Martin to be prejudged as he was walking down that street,"" he said Thursday. ""I ask you not to prejudge George Zimmerman, and please do not prejudge the criminal justice system. It's going to work. We just need to let it work."" Fulton said he wants to see changes in Florida's ""stand your ground"" laws, which allow people to use deadly force if they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. ""Someone shouldn't be able to murder someone and walk away,"" said Fulton.","Trayvon Martin was a happy teenager, older brother says .

"(CNN) -- A family facing foreclosure is anything but a unique story in these troubled economic times. Daniel and Ebony Sampson with their children. ""It's a personal miracle,"" she says of how their home was saved. But this is a happier story of one family whose financial ruin was averted by the actions of a friend, the compassion of strangers, the networking power of the Internet and the holiday spirit of giving. ""This is our Christmas story,"" said Ebony Sampson. ""It's going to be told for generations and generations to come."" Sampson, who lives in Aberdeen, Maryland, with her husband, Daniel, and their two young children, has overcome more hardship than one person should ever have to face. When she was in the 10th grade, she lost her entire family in a horrific car accident. Raised by a grandmother in New York, Ebony eventually used some life-insurance money from her parents' death to buy the home in Aberdeen, near where she grew up. But in June, Daniel got sick. After several tests, his doctors concluded that he was suffering from salmonella after eating a tainted tomato. As a new employee of Bank of America, he had not accrued enough paid time off to keep his job as a credit-card account manager.  Watch how the Sampsons' home was saved » . Suddenly, the sole breadwinner in the Sampson household was out of work. Though the Sampsons received unemployment checks from the government, the money wasn't enough to make ends meet. First came the shut-off notices from the electric company. Then one of their cars broke down. One morning, Daniel woke up and looked out his bedroom window and saw his truck was missing. It had been repossessed. With no job, no car and no income, the Sampsons got another surprise: Ebony Sampson learned she was eight weeks pregnant. The Sampsons returned home from church, where they are practicing ministers, on a Sunday in November to find a stranger knocking on their front door. He wanted to put a bid in on their house. Ebony told him their home was not for sale. The next day, the Sampsons were notified that they were facing foreclosure unless they could come up with $10,000 in the next two weeks to bring their mortgage up to date. ""Once we received that letter, it was like, 'Oh my God, what are we going to do?' "" Daniel Sampson said. ""I don't think anyone in their right mind would receive a foreclosure notice and not be rattled by it."" Somehow, the couple maintained their sense of humor. Ebony Sampson called one of her oldest friends, Jaki Grier, and jokingly asked her if she had $10,000. Jaki told her, ""Sure, just let me open up my invisible purse!"" But then Grier got an idea. A self-described geek, Grier started blogging years ago. Since then, she's contributed to a magazine's Web site and regularly posts thoughts and life happenings on her LiveJournal page. So, she published Ebony and Daniel's story, along with a link where people could make a donation. At the most, Jaki thought she could raise enough money to help the Sampsons pay a security deposit on an apartment after their home was auctioned. But donations started pouring in. Within 24 hours, Grier's blog had raised $1,000, far exceeding her expectations. People started linking to Grier's blog from sites across the Internet and around the country. Attorneys posted legal advice. Others in similar situations offered sympathy. One woman sent a donation with a note that said she had just lost her own home but wanted to help anyway. Another woman wrote that she didn't have a car but would walk to her grocery store with a jar of change and donate it to the cause. Yet another e-mail came from a woman who was unemployed, with no job prospects. She donated a dollar. With every donation, the total raised ticked higher and higher on Grier's blog. ""Everybody wants to give to a charity, but so many times when you give to a charity you don't really see where your money goes,"" Grier said. ""At least with this, you saw the little [donations] ticker go. I think that made people excited."" Four days after Grier's blog post, she had raised $3,400 -- enough to repair the Sampsons' car. That night, Grier went to bed ecstatic. The next morning she checked her PayPal account and was stunned to find the balance had ballooned to $10,900. In the time it took Grier to take the donation link down from her blog, the balance had reached $11,032. In just five days, she had raised enough money to save her friend's home. A Baltimore TV station, WBAL, caught wind of the story and put it on the air. Someone contacted Daniel Sampson and offered him a job interview. ""It's been overwhelming,"" Daniel Sampson said. ""For me, out of all the donations [we] received, it was a little kid [who] came knocking on the door early Saturday morning ... with a five-dollar bill in his hand. He just came up to the door and said, 'Here you go, mister.' Then he just walked away. I was, like, speechless. He couldn't have been more than 8 years old."" Now Daniel and Ebony Sampson will be able to enjoy Christmas much more than they thought they would just a few weeks ago. They say that once their children are grown, they'll tell them the story of how one holiday season they came within days of losing their house. They'll spend this Christmas full of thanks. ""It doesn't seem real to me, and so I just thank everyone out there that cares,"" Ebony Sampson said. ""There really was no hope for us. Then, out of nowhere, just the kindness of strangers, just people that came and, you know, provided for us. Jaki was our beacon of light that led them to us. ""It's a personal blessing. It's a personal miracle. It makes you understand what the season is all about.""

"(CNN) -- Reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger slouched uncharacteristically in his chair Monday, muttering ""I'm not (a) f***ing informant."" But his 700-page FBI file and informant card show otherwise -- that Bulger provided information on murders, drug deals, armed robberies and criminal fugitives, leading to several arrests. Bulger ratted on La Cosa Nostra, rival gangs and seemingly anyone -- except those in his small, immediate circle known as the Winter Hill gang. According to entries in his informant file, Bulger knew he could get away with it and even told his FBI handler he was more likely to be killed by ""gangland warfare"" than because he was informant since ""no one would believe it."" Bulger also defended what he called the ""professionalism"" of the FBI. Bulger is charged with 19 counts of murder after the FBI found him hiding out in a Santa Monica apartment with his girlfriend in 2011. He was on the lam for 16 years after allegedly being tipped off to a 1995 indictment by his rogue handler, former FBI agent John Connolly, who is now behind bars. Why we can't get enough of the gangster life . From day one of Bulger's trial, his lawyers have tried to convince the jury that Bulger was not an informant -- something attorney J.W. Carney described as the worst thing an Irishman from South Boston could possibly be. With the jury out of the courtroom, prosecutor Fred Wyshak mocked the suggestion, saying he would ""not engage in the fiction"" -- pointing to 15 years of detailed FBI reports. ""Whether it's the ego of the defendant or his reputation he wants to preserve that he was not an informant ... it's a ridiculous contention,"" said Wyshak, who successfully prosecuted Connolly's case in 2008. The defense has filed a motion asking to admit into evidence statements made by Wyshak in the 2008 trial claiming that Connolly made false statements in his informant files. The motion has not yet been addressed in court. James Marra of the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General testified about numerous file entries saying Connolly, Bulger and Bulger's criminal partner Steven Flemmi ""frequently met together as a team."" Trial opens window on mob world of cold violence, fierce loyalty . Documents also expose that Bulger met with more than one FBI agent, including now-disgraced former FBI supervisor John Morris. Morris pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from Bulger in exchange for information. He is cooperating with the government in exchange for immunity and is set to testify against Bulger this week. Bulger's defense lawyer Hank Brennan said prosecutors ""can't have it both ways,"" since Connolly is a convicted liar who, he said, fabricated Bulger's 8-inch-thick file and his status as an informant. Judge Denise Casper weighed in, asking, ""Why can't both be true?"" The judge said perhaps the definition of ""informant"" was the issue. Responding to Bulger's claim, Casper said the ""veracity of information may be in dispute, (but not) that he was a registered informant."" Along with the 700-page informant file, prosecutors also showed the jury a 3-by-5 card that they called Bulger's ""informant card"" with his ID number: BS1455 OC. The OC stands for ""organized crime."" When Brennan accused the Department of Justice of having a history of ""inappropriate relationships with crime figures"" even when it came to murder, the judge shut him down.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The company name flashed and swirled around the darkened convention hall as the music began to pump. Before squeezing into Body Magic, a before-and-after volunteer is measured by Monica Bennett. ""Money money money money, money! Money money money money, money!"" A man dressed in designer duds strutted across the stage to the tune of The O'Jays' 1970s hit, now the theme song for ""The Apprentice."" ""If you want to get paid, you've got to get up on your feet,"" he called out. ""They say money doesn't grow on trees. Well, I've got a money tree in my backyard, and Ardyss planted it there!"" With that the faithful rose and hollered, the applause crescendoed, and the smiles - and dreams - spread wide.  See how the sales pitch works » . Few issues pique public interest more than opportunities to make money and achieve beauty. The estimated 3,000 people from around the country who streamed into the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta in early August were a testament to that. They came to rally around Ardyss International, a Las Vegas, Nevada-based direct sales company that makes a fortune off undergarments. Body Magic, the company's flagship girdle-and-corset combo, which retails for $140 plus tax and shipping, can ""bring your butt back to high school fine,"" the man on stage announced. You can wear it and get thin, the claims go, or you can sell it and get rich. The company's other products include the Angel Bra, Panty Reshaper, undergarments for men, nutritional supplements and skin-care items. Think Mary Kay cosmetics. That's the kind of multilevel or network marketing model on which Ardyss is based. Distributors can make money through sales. But they can make even more from profit cuts and bonuses that float to the top if they recruit other distributors, who in turn recruit other distributors, and so on and so on. ""I've only been involved for two months, and I have a check with a comma in it,"" said Robbyn Washington of Snellville, Georgia. While many such companies are legitimate, others smack of pyramid schemes, prompting legal disputes and investigations by consumer protection agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has no complaints about Ardyss International on file. But the Better Business Bureau, with which Ardyss is not accredited, has given the company an F rating, saying 16 complaints over the past 36 months have gone unanswered. An Ardyss executive and spokesman, Mike Potillo, told CNN the company wasn't aware of these complaints and would be in touch with the BBB to clear this up. As is the case with all multilevel marketing ventures, no matter what they're selling, experts say consumers and prospective distributors should proceed with caution. 'Say whatever you want' The Body Magic motto is emblazoned on T-shirts, pins and bumper stickers: ""Drop 3 sizes in 10 minutes."" Proponents say it can create hourglass curves, shaving off inches and weight permanently. ""Every eight seconds a woman looks in the mirror and wants to be smaller,"" said Dorothy Cook, who's often credited for making the business, founded in Mexico, a multilevel marketing hit in the United States. ""Once you wear it and take it off, you lose inches. Every woman must have one."" Sonja King, 38, did not attend the convention but said she's worn her Body Magic about four days a week for the past two months. The Atlanta-area woman said she has seen results but wonders whether it's because she can barely eat when she wears it. ""It's not comfortable,"" she said with a laugh. ""But I had to go to a formal affair recently, and that Body Magic came in handy. I was slammin' in that dress!"" Beyond looking good, distributors raved about improved posture, a claim that left chiropractor Robert Hayden uneasy. The Griffin, Georgia, man, who hadn't examined the garment, said he's seen the atrophied muscles of those who've relied too much on simple lumbar support belts. ""The muscles that hold you erect will have no need to work,"" if worn with regularity, he said. ""They'll go to mush."" More striking, however, were the medical claims distributors made about Ardyss garments and Le' Vive, the company's top-selling nutritional product. They ascribed restored bladder control and diverted surgeries to Body Magic. One distributor lifted her blouse to reveal not only the über-girdle but also her Angel Bra, which she said can protect a woman from breast cancer. Many thanked Body Magic for putting their organs ""back in place."" The stories passed around of those saved by Le' Vive, a drink said to be rich in antioxidants, included tales about warding off diabetes and arthritis. But distributors also said a woman was cured of Bell's palsy. Another, they said, had Lupus, was given six months to live and is now in remission. And then there was the unnamed blind man who distributors claimed began to see. ""Someone said that to you?"" asked an audibly stunned Potillo, the Ardyss executive who oversees the American market. In a written response sent later, Potillo said the company ""makes no health claims, medical claims or any type of claims on any of our products in any way. ... If someone has made a claim on one of our products, we have internal policies and procedures in place to deal with that."" The issue of distributors saying what they shouldn't is one of the biggest challenges in multilevel or network marketing operations, said Peter Mingils, president of the Distributor Rights Association, a Texas-based nonprofit that works on behalf of multilevel marketers. ""Even though you're an independent contractor, it doesn't mean you can say whatever you want,"" he said. It's this enthusiasm, however, that drives the company's success, said Clark Howard, the HLN money expert. ""If people really believe in it themselves, and they go out and convince others, then that is in itself a legitimate multilevel"" marketing business, he said. ""If people are making false promises about a product or service, then that comes out in the wash."" The hope, the dream . Antonio Díaz de León, the Ardyss founder and president, walked into the convention center where he and his family were treated like rock stars, eliciting gasps as cell phone cameras came out. In the past six months the business has grown by 600 percent and 100,000 active distributors, Díaz de León, a native of Mexico, said through a translator. ""We've changed many lives,"" he said. ""Families are getting financial freedom."" In times of recession, interest in these kinds of business opportunities spikes, Howard, the HLN money expert, said. ""It doesn't matter what the product is, what the service is, you always have the same thing: People talking about the hope, the dream and the money,"" he said. Dorothy Cook, draped in jewelry, wouldn't say how much she earns. At last count, though, she claimed she had nearly 80,000 distributors in her downline. Another ""platinum president,"" the highest level that can be achieved in this business where everyone has a title, said thanks to her downline of 15,000 distributors, she is bringing home more than $55,000 a month. One can only only assume Cook, nicknamed ""The Godmother,"" makes more. ""All you have to do is get here, and God will do the rest,"" she told a group at the convention. But Potillo, of Ardyss, which includes about 140,000 active distributors, said it's not that easy and called Cook's earnings ""an extraordinary experience, not the norm."" Tempered with reality . To become a distributor, people are encouraged to buy a starter kit for $299. ""If you have to borrow the money, do what it takes,"" Donna Bingham told a group that gathered recently in an Alpharetta, Georgia, home. ""The only way [the business] doesn't work is if you don't work."" That line of encouragement made law professor Stephen Calkins wary. ""Anytime you're asked to part with hard-earned money in order to ask other people to part with hard-earned money, you should be very nervous,"" said Calkins of Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. He served for several years as the general counsel for the FTC during the Clinton Administration. Calkins suggested any prospective multilevel distributor consult tip sheets to analyze the credibility of a company first. The FTC has a consumer alert, as does the Direct Selling Association. Excitement about these opportunities needs to be tempered with reality, Howard said. While the ""pep rally"" may make people think they're all in line to make $20,000 a month, he said that's not how these businesses play out. ""There will always be a small number of people who hit grand slam homeruns virtually every day. But most everybody else will make little or nothing, and usually many will actually lose,"" he said. ""Don't believe it's paved in gold. There are a lot of speed bumps and a lot of dead ends.""","Company behind Body Magic booms amid claims of big money, smaller waistlines .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In a world of celluloid action stuffed with CGI fights and sci-fi gadgetry, thank heavens for Jason Bourne, the amnesiac assassin who's so lethal that he can turn a hardback book into a weapon. The only foe who's come anywhere close to trouncing the resourceful hero was Desh Bouksani, the Blackbriar super-assassin sent to Morocco to despatch him in 2007's ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" Action actor Joey Ansah says the days of martial arts beefcake with no acting skills are over. He's one of a new breed of multi-talented actors who can act as well as fight. It's a classic fight in a series celebrated for gritty realism and great stunts. Bourne, played by Matt Damon, and Joey Ansah's Desh throw each other around the room with primal ferocity: you wonder how they did it without injuring each other. Ansah (JA) puts it down to being a one of a new breed of stunt actors who can play parts just as well as they can fight. He talks to ""The Screening Room"" (TSR) about the the stunt tricks that allowed the Bourne team to create unprecedented realism and still be around to tell the story. Video: Ansah explains the secrets of a great on-screen fight . (TSR): Your big break came in 2007 when you played Desh in the ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" How did that come about? Did the fact that you were able to do your own stunts help? (JA): By then I had been acting full-time for about four years. I had also auditioned for the casting director of ""Bourne"" in the past. I had obviously done something right since he remembered me. My role included a big fight against Matt Damon. It is the fight of the movie. There were several rounds of auditions. The first round was physical -- to see if you could ride a motorbike and do choreography. Then there was a dramatic audition and another round for the director. They didn't realize the full extent of what I could do until I got the role. The fight wasn't going to look like that if someone else got the role. The flip out of the wrist lock was my idea. I took hits that most people wouldn't take and performed moves that hadn't been done before. It was a great opportunity to showcase something. (TSR): The fight scene in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is incredibly violent and visceral. How did you make it look so real? (JA): That's a good question. You see a lot of fight scenes that are uninspiring, but the ""Bourne"" films are known for their gritty realism. Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is a very everyday type of character, so the fighting has to be very real. I remember telling the fight coordinator that we had to make this the best fight scene in the franchise. We rehearsed and collaborated to get some great stuff. When I met with Matt for the first time I was like, ""We have to get to go all out."" The choreographer, Jeff Amada -- he's done films such as ""The Crow"", ""Fight Club"", ""Blade,"" ""Lethal Weapon"" -- was one of my favourite choreographers, so working with him was great. The choreography itself was brilliant, but it's also how you fill it out with reactions. Actors aren't used to action, so they double-up for painful scenes or they won't be able to film them in such a brutal way. But the good thing about Matt is that he is very rough and ready. The fight took six 13-hour days to film. (TSR): You said that you were willing to get hurt. Can you talk a bit more about that? (JA): My ethos is that it is an art form. If your character is going to take a beating, then you do too. For example, the book scene where Matt picks up a book and rams it into my throat, smashing me into the cabinet -- the book was squishy but the core was solid. We messed around to see if I could hold the book and make it look like he was hitting me. In the end I said, ""Matt, just do it. What is the worst that can happen."" And he was like, ""Are you sure?"" So we go for it and we hit the [cabinet] so hard the doors come off. Everyone was worried. But when we looked at the playback we knew we got it. (TSR): Do you see yourself as part of a new breed of action actors? (JA): During the 80s, films with modest budgets would get cinema distribution and the stars would have predominantly action-orientated backgrounds. But it's changed. Now audiences demand a higher standard of acting. Gone are the Van Dammes, Schwarzeneggers and Stallones ... the muscle-bound action hero. The modern action hero is Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"" or ... good actors like Will Smith, Matt Damon. If you reach Jackie Chan's level you will get something really engrossing to watch. That's a new breed and I want to be in that niche. Do you prefer muscle-bound tough guys like Arnie or modern action heroes like Matt Damon? (TSR): You played a ninja in ""Batman Begins."" Did you have to audition to become a stuntman on the film? (JA): Yes, there was an audition. I was cast as one of the League of Shadows -- the group of ninjas who trained on the mountain camp where Liam Neeson's character trains Bruce Wayne. [The audition] was at Shepperton Studios [in London.] We had to do solo performances to show our skills. Then we did choreographed sword work -- alone and in a team. They make you jump through hoops but it was good because my friends and I got on that film together and we had a good laugh. (TSR): How did you first become a stunt actor? (JA): Well, my story is quite interesting. I started off young, when I was doing a lot of theatre. I caught the martial art bug aged nine and have trained in martial arts, tae kwon do, ninjutsu, capoeira and got into acrobatics. Then I stopped acting for awhile. I thought I could get into showbiz. Maybe with these physical skills I'd have a quick route in. So originally, I thought I'd work as a stuntman. That's what I began working towards and ended up working on ""Batman Begins"" and when I decided I wanted to pursue an acting career and do my own action in my films. (TSR): Was it a big transition to go from the acrobatic and martial arts to the skills you have to use as a stuntman? (JA): Yes. But you can tweak your training to be more stunt-focused. The real difference between martial arts or real combat and screen fighting is that real fights are shorter. But in on-screen fighting you want to extend everything so the audience can see the extension of your techniques. So, a lot of moves are exaggerated. And then there are reactions. In action you have to be able to deliver good technique and give good reactions, because reactions make your opponents' actions look more powerful. (TSR): What does it take to make it as a stuntman? (JA): In Britain, to make it as a stuntman, ideally you want to join the British Stunt Register and the British Actors' Equity Stunt Register. To do that you have to be qualified in six disciplines, such as swimming, horse riding, gymnastics, car racing, martial arts, boxing, fencing. You must also have 60 days of paid work in front of a camera. (TSR): Do you think it is hard to break into the stunt industry? (JA): It is. Over here it's a very closed shop. If anything, they almost go out of their way to scare off new people because there are already a lot of stuntmen or women and not enough work. It's like jumping through hoops to get on the register. So, it will take anywhere from three to five years to become qualified. And it will cost you thousands to do it. (TSR): Do you think that stuntmen are the unsung heroes of Hollywood? (JA): Yes, in a big way. Moments in the greatest action films and even non-action films are created by very skilled stuntmen. What gets to me is the credits -- there's just a block of stuntmen's names. So you don't know who did the stunt. In ""The Dark Knight"" you want to know the name of the stuntman who leapt off a building in Hong Kong and hung onto an airborne helicopter. There is lobbying for the Oscars to have a category for stuntmen.","Action actor Joey Ansah, who plays Desh in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" talks stunts .

"(CNN) -- A young woman whisked away by Syrian security forces to coax the surrender of her activist brother turned up beheaded and dismembered, activists and human rights groups say, yet another high-profile display of cruelty in the conflict-wracked nation. Nineteen-year-old Zainab Alhusni stepped away from her Homs residence last month to buy groceries. Her family never saw her again until security forces returned her mutilated corpse, two opposition activist groups operating inside Syria and Amnesty International told CNN. As reports of the torture sparked outrage across Homs and the rest of the world, amateur video surfaced of dozens of woman protesting the death. ""They killed the rose Zainab,"" their placards said. ""If it is confirmed that Zainab was in custody when she died, this would be one of the most disturbing cases of a death in detention we have seen so far,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. The case also drew the antipathy of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which characterized the incident as ""appalling"" and as one example of the ""targeting and attacking of families and sympathizers of the protesters by security forces."" The ferocious Syrian government crackdown against dissenters began in mid-March when anti-government protests unfolded. The number of people killed over the past six months has reached at least 2,700, according to the U.N. human rights office. Some activist groups put the toll at around 3,000. Zainab's brother Mohammed Alhusni -- a prominent opposition activist praised by colleagues for leading anti-government protests and treating the wounded -- had been evading authorities for weeks when his sister disappeared, said the Homs Quarters Union, an activist group. ""The secret police kidnapped Zainab so they could threaten her brother and pressure him to turn himself in to the authorities. The government often uses this tactic to get to activists,"" a union media coordinator told CNN. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an activist group, said security forces called Zainab's family to trade her ""freedom for her pro-democracy activist brother's surrender,"" LCC said. Mohammed Alhusni was eventually slain on September 10, when security forces fired on demonstrators in Homs. When the family retrieved Mohammed's body from a Homs military hospital, medical officials told relatives about another unclaimed body with the label ""Zainab Alhusni"" that had been kept in a hospital freezer for some time. Days later, Zainab's family received the woman's headless and limbless corpse, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Amnesty International and the Homs Quarters Union said. The Homs Quarters Union provided a video to CNN showing the pale trunk of a female body beside a detached head with long black hair among dismembered limbs. Authorities forced Zainab's mother to sign a document saying both Zainab and Mohammad had been kidnapped and killed by an armed gang, Amnesty International said in an online statement. Syrian authorities could not be reached for comment on the Alhusni case. The Syrian government has maintained that armed gangs with foreign agendas, not the regime, are responsible for the violence that has plagued the Arab country for months. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, the claims, or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside Syria.","""They killed the rose Zainab,"" protesters' placards say .

"(CNN) -- The upstate New York school bus monitor who received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations after a video of her being harassed by students went viral has decided to use some of the proceeds to start her own anti-bullying foundation. Now retired, Karen Klein, 68, has decided to start her own campaign, called the Karen Klein Anti-Bullying Foundation, on the website giveback.org. ""This is for education, for people who have been bullied,"" Klein told CNN affiliate WROC. Klein was working as a middle school bus monitor when four students berated her with a stream of profanity, insults, jeers and physical ridicule. Students suspended for a year . The verbal abuse continued unabated for about 10 minutes while another student filmed the altercation on a cell phone camera. The video posted to YouTube on June 19, where it received more than 8 million views, showed giggling students from the upstate New York community of Greece heaping insults onto her and jabbing her with a book. The grandmother of eight sits quietly, weeping at one point. An outpouring of support for Klein resulted in a crowd-funding campaign on indiegogo.com, with an initial goal of $5,000 to send the weary bus monitor on vacation. Emotional reaction to bus monitor harassment . The campaign officially closed in late July, having raised more than $700,000 in donations from more than 32,000 people around the world. Klein's daughter and administrator for the new anti-bullying foundation, Amanda, told CNN that her mother took home about $650,000 and will be donating $100,000 to her organization. The Klein Anti-Bullying Foundation will provide funding to various organizations and charities for anti-bullying causes. ""This is always something she's wanted to do,"" Amanda said. The foundation officially kicks off in October when Klein and others start a weekly anti-bullying tour. According to Amanda, Miss Teen USA Logan West and Miss Universe Leila Lopes of Angola plan to be involved. ""The goal of the anti-bullying campaign is to help teach kids and teens about being kind, friendly and playing nicely with others,"" Klein says in a video on the foundation's website.

"(CNN) -- Australia's High Court on Wednesday rejected an extradition request from Hungary for a suspected Nazi war criminal, ending a legal battle that began in 2005. Charles Zentai and two fellow Hungarian soldiers allegedly beat a Jewish teenager to death in November 1944 for failing to wear the yellow Star of David. They are thought to have thrown the victim's body into the Danube River in the Hungarian capital, Budapest. In a 5-1 decision, the court ruled that Zentai could not be extradited because ""war crime"" did not exist as a legal offence in Hungary in 1944, according to Australian media reports. In doing so, it upheld a 2010 Australian federal court ruling against an extradition order approved by former home affairs minister Brendan O'Connor in 2009. Hungary issued an international arrest warrant and extradition request for Zentai in 2005.

"(CNN) -- A group of architects gathered in Oxford, England last month with an unusual brief -- to design the ultimate dream home for bats. The winged mammals are valued from an ecological viewpoint for preying on insects, dispersing seeds and pollination. But their numbers have declined dramatically in North America, where a fungal disease called white nose syndrome is estimated to have killed more than 5.5 million. In the United Kingdom, the fungus has yet to appear, but habitat destruction remains a major threat. Policy-makers in the UK have stepped in to protect bat populations, criminalizing any interference with their roosts, even if no bats are currently present. ""If you have bats roosting in your building, you can't disturb them in any way without getting a special license,"" says Kelly Gunnell, Built Environment Officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, a charitable organization in London, England. Those who interfere with a roost risk a fine of $7,800 per bat, and up to six months in prison -- although Gunnell says no one has been sent to prison yet. The new, three-hour course, offered by the Royal Institute of British Architects in conjunction with the Bat Conservation Trust, is intended to educate architects about bats, teaching participants the ideal size, access points, temperature, materials and location for bat roosts. ""They need to design these spaces which are biodiversity-friendly, but they're not ecologists,"" explains Gunnell. ""This gives them a basic introduction to their life cycle, when they breed, and their requirements for roosting."" Bats prefer to roost in natural features like trees and caves, but as development has made those environments scarcer, some species have adapted to urban areas. ""Only about half the bats here regularly use buildings as roosts, although nearly all of them will use them at some stage,"" says Gunnell. ""Unfortunately, with a lot of people doing loft conversions and barn conversions, that's had a huge impact. Bats only have one young a year, and they don't have them every year, so if they were using your roof loft as their maternity roost and you knocked down the building or put in a loft extension, it would wipe out that whole population."" Research ship finds the world's oceans are 'plasticized' Bats present several logistical challenges for designers. English bats are tiny, with the smallest species, the pipistrelle, able to fit into a matchbox. ""They can squeeze into the smallest places,"" says Gunnell. ""Literally, if you can put your finger into a gap, a bat can get in there."" They have varying space requirements. Some species prefer tight spaces like cavities under roof piles, others need more space, like that found in attics. All bats need darkness and warmth. A problem for both builders and bat conservationists is the widespread use in modern buildings of ""breathable roofing membranes"", a type of insulating textile which allows air vapor to escape. Roosting bats can get fatally entangled in the fibers, which degrades the roofing membranes, invalidating their guarantees. Solar panels present another issue. ""It's very preliminary, but there seems to be evidence that when you put solar panels on your roof, it can increase the internal roof void temperature, which can be disturbing to bats,"" says Gunnell. Charles Barclay, who has an architecture practice in South London, has built a bespoke bat barn that was shortlisted for a sustainability award by the British Architect's Journal last year. Wine turbine creates water from thin air . While demolishing a 100-year-old brick farmhouse in Suffolk, England, a maternity roost for brown long-eared bats was found in the attic. This meant Barclay had to provide a new roost, which took six weeks more than $70,000 to complete. His design incorporates a downward-angled port where bats can enter, leading to a 34mm-wide chute with roughened timber walls which they can crawl up to gain access to an attic 10.5m long and 3m high at the apex. Once the barn was finished, the sleeping bats were put into a soft bag by an ecology consultant, and delivered to awaken in their new home. ""He also transferred their droppings, so they could smell a bat-friendly area,"" Barclay says. Although the Suffolk bats appear to have taken up residence, Gunnell says there's never any guarantee that such solutions will work. ""The problem we have is that, even if you take everything into account for the bats, they often just won't use the space you've created,"" says Gunnell. ""Or, if they do, it can take them up to five years."" She continued: ""A few years ago we had a bat house design competition. They got architects involved and built a bat house at the London Wetlands Centre. That's quite a nicely designed bat house, but two years on, it's never been used by bats. Sometimes you can do everything absolutely right, and it still won't be used.""","A new course aims to teach architects how to accommodate bats .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China has blocked the popular video-sharing Web site YouTube but did not offer a reason for the ban. YouTube was blocked in China as of Wednesday. Google, which owns YouTube, said it began noticing a decline in traffic from China about noon Monday. By early Wednesday, site users insider China continued to encounter an error message: ""Network Timeout. The server at youtube.com is taking too long to respond."" ""We do not know the reason for the blockage and we are working as quickly as possible to restore access to our users,"" said Scott Rubin, a spokesman for Google, which owns YouTube. It's not the first time users in China have been unable to access the site. In March 2008, China blocked YouTube during riots in Tibet.  Watch more about the decision » . At the time, protesters burned vehicles and shops, some advocating independence from China, and others demonstrating against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in the area. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140. Many in the country speculated the latest ban may be an attempt to filter access to footage that a Tibetan exile group released. The videos show Tibetans being kicked and beaten, allegedly by Chinese police officers after the riots. ""Though there is much footage of the protests taking place throughout Tibet last year that were splashed across the world, the following is rare footage of police beating of protesters, the suffering and death of a captive, and paramilitary presence in Lhasa (the Tibetan capital), which managed to make its way to the outside world,"" the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India, said of the videos. Xinhua, China's state news agency, accused the supporters of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, of doctoring the video to ""deceive the international community."" China, with 298 million Internet users, has routinely blocked access to Web sites it considers politically unacceptable, including the Voice of America and The New York Times. The Chinese government has also censored television broadcasts, including those by the BBC and CNN, during coverage of issues such as its policy in Tibet and Taiwan. The Chinese government did not directly address whether it has blocked YouTube. ""China is not afraid of the Internet,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang on Tuesday. ""We manage the Internet according to law ... to prevent the spread of harmful information.""

"HANOVER, Germany (CNN) -- Archaeologists have found more than 600 relics from a huge battle between a Roman army and Barbarians in the third century, long after historians believed Rome had given up control of northern Germany. Some of the artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines. ""We have to write our history books new, because what we thought was that the activities of the Romans ended at nine or 10 (years) after Christ,"" said Lutz Stratmann, science minister for the German state of Lower Saxony. ""Now we know that it must be 200 or 250 after that."" For weeks, archeologist Petra Loenne and her team have been searching this area with metal detectors, pulling hundreds of ancient Roman weapons out of the ground. They paint a picture of a highly organized, technologically superior Roman army beset by Germanic tribes in a forest about 80 km (50 miles) south of the modern city of Hanover. The hillside battlefield was discovered by relic-hunters illegally searching for souvenirs of more recent wars near the town of Kalefeld-Oldenrode. One of them brought some of the items he found to Loenne, who works for the local government. The artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines.  Watch how the battlefield discovery could re-write history » . ""We believe the Germans ambushed the Romans here, but the legions quickly fired back with catapults and archers -- and then it came to a massive man-on-man onslaught,"" Loenne said. The items unearthed so far include an axe, still sharp after nearly 1,800 years; horseshoes; shovels; spearheads; and dozens of arrowheads for a Scorpio, a cross between a catapult and a crossbow -- the ancient equivalent of artillery. ""With a very high speed, on a very long distance -- about 300 meters -- you can hit targets precisely,"" said Henning Hassman, of Hanover's archeological institute. Researchers say the evidence suggests the tribesmen lured the Romans into the forest to keep them from making full use of those long-range weapons and draw them into hand-to-hand combat, outside of the formations the imperial troops had mastered. However, they believe the Romans ultimately prevailed. Other relics include coins depicting the late second-century Roman emperor Commodus, depicted in the Oscar-winning Hollywood epic ""Gladiator"" -- a film that opens with a scene of battle against a barbarian horde that scientists say appears to be largely accurate. And Loenne said her team may have only begun to scratch the surface of the forest. ""We hope we might find fortifications and if we are lucky, maybe even battlefield graveyards,"" she said.","Relics found from battle between Romans, Barbarians in third century .

"(CNN) -- Toyota's third-generation Prius, due at dealerships this spring, will have an optional solar panel on its roof. The panel will power a ventilation system that can cool the car without help from the engine, Toyota says. Solar Electric Vehicles in California makes a roof-mounted solar panel for a standard Toyota Prius. But it's a long way from the 2010 Prius to a solar-powered car, experts told CNN. Most agree that there just isn't enough space on a production car to get full power from solar panels. ""Being able to power a car entirely with solar is a pretty far-reaching goal,"" said Tony Markel, a senior engineer at the federal government's National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado. In the new Prius, the solar panel will provide energy for a ventilation fan that will help cool the parked car on sunny, hot days. The driver can start the fan remotely before stepping into the car. Once the car is started, the air conditioning won't need as much energy from a battery to do the rest of the cooling. ""The best thing about using solar is that regardless of what you end up using it for, you're trying to use it to displace gasoline,"" added Markel. The question is, how much gasoline can solar power offset? Markel said his lab has modified a Prius to use electricity from the grid for its main batteries and a solar panel for the auxiliary systems. He believes the car gets an additional 5 miles of electric range from the panel. According to recent articles in Japan's Nikkei newspaper, Toyota has bigger plans for harnessing power from the sun. Nikkei reports that Toyota hopes to develop a vehicle powered entirely by solar panels. The project will take years, the paper reported. When contacted by CNN, however, a Toyota spokeswoman denied the existence of the project. ""At this time there are no plans that we know of to produce a concept or production version of a solar-powered car,"" said Amy K. Taylor, a communications administrator in Toyota's Environmental, Safety & Quality division. Motorists don't have to wait for a 2010 Prius to drive a solar-enhanced car, however. Greg Johanson, president of Solar Electric Vehicles in Westlake Village, California, said his company makes a roof-mounted panel for a standard Prius that enables the car to travel up to 15 additional miles a day. The system costs $3,500, and it takes about a week to make one, Johanson said. Billy Bautista, a project coordinator at the company, said Solar Electric Vehicles gets so many requests for the system that there is a backlog of several months. The company's Web site says motorists can install the panels themselves, although it recommends finding a ""qualified technician."" The system delivers about 165 watts of power per hour to an added battery, which helps powers the electric motor, Johanson said. But others said it would take a lot more power than that to replace an internal combustion engine. Eric Leonhardt, director of the Vehicle Research Institute at Western Washington University, said that even if solar cells worked far better than they do today, they wouldn't generate enough power for driving substantial distances. The best cells operate at about 33 percent efficiency, but the ones used on vehicles are only about 18 percent efficient, he said. Leonhardt said it would be more practical to use solar power to help charge a car's battery and use the more efficient panels mounted on a roof or over a parking area to supply the rest of the electricity needed to drive the engine. ""Solar panels really need a lot of area,"" he said. Leonhardt thinks Toyota's new Prius is a good first step toward using renewable energy. Some cars get hotter than 150 degrees inside when parked in the sun, so reducing the temperature could mean Toyota could use a smaller AC unit, he added. Johanson of Solar Electric Vehicles said he'd like to see Toyota bring the weight of a Prius down from 3,000 pounds to 2,000. He also hopes for a small gasoline engine and a larger electric motor. That will probably come in the future, when Toyota unveils a plug-in engine. In the meantime, Solar Electric Vehicles sells its version of a plug-in Prius, with a solar panel installed, for $25,000, Bautista said. Toyota is the largest automaker to incorporate solar power into a mass-produced car. But its solar panel is not the first for a car company. Audi uses one on its upscale A8 model, and Mazda tried one on its 929 in the 1990s. In addition, a French motor company, Venturi, has produced an electric-solar hybrid. The Eclectic model costs $30,000, looks like a souped-up golf cart and uses roof-mounted solar panels to help power an electric engine. It has a range of about 30 miles and has a top speed of about 30 mph.

"Portsmouth, Virginia (CNN) -- Floating in a life raft with Hurricane Sandy raging around them, the crew of the HMS Bounty remained surprisingly calm and even told jokes after their ship rolled them into the Atlantic, survivors said. Testifying Friday before a Coast Guard hearing, former Bounty third mate Daniel Cleveland and boatswain Laura Groves revealed breathtaking details about the shipwreck last fall that left a deckhand dead and the captain missing. The vessel and its crew of 16 were heading from New London, Connecticut, to St. Petersburg, Florida, when it ran into Sandy's vicious winds and waves 90 miles off North Carolina. The ship began taking on water and eventually it lost power to its pumps and engines. In the 4 a.m. darkness of October 25, Capt. Robin Walbridge gave the order they all knew was coming: abandon ship. Dressed in red survival suits, they stood on deck preparing to take to their lifeboats. Suddenly 50-mph winds and up to 30-foot waves flipped the ship horizontally, tossing the crew overboard. It was chaos. ""Everybody panicked at that point,"" said Groves, fighting back tears as she described the struggle to keep their heads above water. Cleveland said he recalled being ""thrown around, caught on stuff and underneath stuff and being hit by things."" While they were treading water under the Bounty's huge sails, the wind began slamming the sail rigging down ""on all of us repeatedly,"" said Groves. ""We were doing our best to swim away from the boat and the rig."" Cleveland, Groves and a few other crew members found a large piece of wood grating that kept them afloat. ""We were all looking for each other,"" Cleveland said, ""but all you could see was a bunch of red suits and there was a lot of yelling."" In a stroke of luck, the crew clinging to the wood grating found a floating capsule containing an inflatable life raft. With some difficulty they inflated the raft and got inside. They had seen a Coast Guard aircraft circling overhead, giving them confidence a rescue helicopter would arrive soon. ""We were there for a while telling jokes and stuff,"" said Cleveland. ""No one was in a bad mood -- crying or anything."" He said they talked about the terrifying experience they'd just been through and ""what we were going to do when we got home."" ""At some point we sang a few sea shanties,"" recalled Groves. ""We were in relatively good spirits."" Dawn broke, followed by the the sound of a Coast Guard chopper, which dropped a rescue swimmer down to the life raft. ""He said, 'Hi, I'm Dan,'"" Groves remembered. ""'I heard you guys need a ride. Let's get out of here.'"" While the swimmer was helping survivors get out of the life raft, it flipped upside down. ""We all thought we were going to drown again,"" remembered Groves. Instead, they swam out of the raft and held on to the outside until the chopper hoisted them to safety. Related: Watch Bounty survivors being rescued . Meanwhile the Bounty -- a replica of an 18th-century sailing ship that was longer than half a football field and weighed about a million pounds -- was descending to the bottom of the Atlantic. During his testimony, Cleveland was asked about the last time he saw deckhand Claudene Christian, 42. More than three months after the shipwreck, the exact circumstances surrounding her death remain unclear. Before the ship rolled, Cleveland said he remembered holding Christian's hand as he helped her and other crew members prepare to launch the life rafts. Searchers found Christian's body later that evening. Related: Claudene Christian's mutineer connection . The final glimpse Cleveland got of Walbridge, 63, was just before the ship went on its side. Walbridge's body has not been found. His widow said she believes the captain died trying to help Christian escape. Related: Bounty's captain was 'my soul mate' Bounty was much more than a creaky 50-year-old wooden tourist attraction. It was a bona fide Hollywood star, featured in the 1962 film version of ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" which starred Marlon Brando, and more recently in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise that starred Johnny Depp. But it also was a ship where inexperienced sailors could learn seafaring skills that go back hundreds of years. The hearings, which include the National Transportation Safety Board, could lead to federal recommendations aimed at improving safety for other ships like the Bounty. Investigators in this military shipyard region near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay have been asking two basic questions: Was the Bounty fit to sail in rough weather? And did the ship needlessly sail into harm's way? About two months before the disaster, Walbridge, a master sailor with a lifetime of experience at sea, played down the seriousness of sailing through bad weather. ""Have we run into stormy seas? We chase hurricanes,"" Walbridge said in a video interview posted on YouTube. ""You don't want to get in front of it,"" he said. ""You want to stay behind it, but you also get a good ride out of a hurricane."" Asked about that comment by Walbridge, Cleveland testified that the captain didn't mean literally chasing hurricanes. ""It means we are trying to follow them into a navigable, safer"" area of the storm, he said. The idea was ""getting behind it, in a safe place"" to make use of its favorable winds. ""You don't want to be in its path."" Before the ship set sail from New London, the crew was very aware of the approaching hurricane, Cleveland said. Walbridge gathered them for a meeting in which he ""mentioned his experience with hurricanes and he said if anybody wanted to leave there would be no hard feelings, no begrudging."" ""I believed him,"" said Cleveland, who was then asked if the crew were offered paid expenses home. ""In my experience, if you choose to leave, you would have to find your own way home."" ""Nobody decided to leave,"" Cleveland said. Walbridge said he wanted to ""make tracks"" to the south and east as fast as possible, Cleveland said, so the vessel could position itself to get the best winds from Sandy. The captain believed, Cleveland said, that his ship would be safer riding Sandy out at sea, instead of waiting for the storm to hit them in New London. Cleveland said he agreed with that point of view, but there were also good arguments to remain in port. Bounty first mate John Svendsen testified Tuesday that Walbridge wasn't chasing Sandy, but the captain had said ""the ship was safer at sea."" Svendsen testified that as the storm worsened on October 29, he advised Walbridge to abandon ship more than once over a short period. ""He said, 'I think we have more time.'"" When Svendsen made a third request to the captain to abandon ship, he said Walbridge finally gave the order. While the 13 other crew members, including Groves and Cleveland, made it safely to two life rafts, Svendsen spent three hours floating alone in his survival suit before Coast Guard rescuers saw his emergency beacon. The Coast Guard said its goal for the investigation is to determine as much as possible about the cause of the tragedy and whether it was linked to equipment or material failure. Investigators are looking for evidence of ""misconduct, inattention to duty, negligence or willful violation of the law."" Did Walbridge make a fatal error? People who weren't there have no right to pass judgment, the captain's widow, Claudia McCann, said last week from her home in St. Petersburg. Although it's not a criminal hearing, Bounty owner Robert Hansen declined to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment constitutional protections against self-incrimination. Evidence could be forwarded to federal prosecutors. In Thursday's testimony, Todd Kosakowski of Maine's Boothbay Harbor Shipyard said he raised doubts about Bounty's seaworthiness weeks before it sailed into the storm. He said he told Walbridge he was worried about rotting wood in the Bounty's frame. Walbridge, Kosakowski said, decided against fixing the rot. ""I believe that that could have had an impact on the strength of the vessel,"" Kosakowski said. Joe Jakomovicz, a retired manager who worked at the shipyard for four decades, told investigators he disagreed with Kosakowski's analysis. The decay of the Bounty's timbers, he said, wasn't as bad as Kosakowski's assessment. ""He's basing his judgment on probably five or six years of experience,"" Jakomovicz testified. Claudene Christian's father, Rex, and her mother -- who shares her daughter's first name but goes by Dina -- were also at the hearing. For now, they've declined to speak with reporters. Their daughter was relatively new to sailing, and told friends in May how excited she was to join the Bounty. A former beauty queen, Christian also said she was a descendant of Fletcher Christian, the infamous mutineer on the real HMS Bounty 220 years ago. On Friday, her mother sat silently at the side of the hearing room, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and sometimes taking notes. The memory of Claudene Christian took a seat at the proceding almost as real as any of the participants. Several questions focused on the energetic deckhand who had virtually no experience aboard a tall ship, let alone riding out hurricanes. When Cleveland helped her move toward the back of the ship, shortly before it went horizontal, he ""told her to stay low. I told her to go aft and to grab the next person I would hand her to."" She never made it home. During a brief recess, Christian's parents paused at a window near the hearing room in this shipyard town, their arms around each other, looking across the Elizabeth River flowing toward the sea. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Third mate: Crew remained calm after Sandy tossed them into the Atlantic .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British court sentenced a Saudi prince Wednesday to the maximum penalty of life in prison for murdering his servant. Prince Saud Abdulaziz Bin Nasser Al Saud will have to serve a minimum of 20 years, a court official said. For now, it will be in a British jail, since Britain and Saudi Arabia do not have a prisoner transfer agreement. The prince was found guilty Tuesday of both murder and grievous bodily harm in the February killing of Bandar Abdulaziz in a case prosecutors said had a sexual element. Abdulaziz died after a severe beating left him with swelling and bruising of the brain and fractured ribs and neck. He also had bite marks on his face, ears and arm. The prince had not denied killing Abdulaziz, but said he had not intended to do so. He did not take the stand in his own defense. Because the prince did not deny killing Abdulaziz, the jury's job was to determine if he was guilty of murder or manslaughter. To do that, jurors had to determine the prince's state of mind and his intent at the time he killed Abdulaziz. They took just over an hour and a half to reach a verdict. Police said after Tuesday's verdict that the prince had shown no remorse when he was questioned about his servant's death, instead ""concocting a story"" about how he died. ""When that was found to be a pack of lies, he tried to claim diplomatic immunity,"" but did not qualify for it, John McFarlane of London's Metropolitan Police told journalists outside the court Tuesday. Prosecutors said the prince's systematic mistreatment of the victim had a sexual element. The bites suffered by Abdulaziz were not a factor in his death, but had ""an obvious sexual connotation,"" prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw said in his opening statement two weeks ago. The two men were in London earlier this year as Al Saud took in Morocco, the Maldives and other European cities on a long global holiday with Abdulaziz as his companion. Al Saud's lawyer, John Kelsey-Fry, said in his closing argument Monday that Al Saud ""must live with the consequences"" of having killed Abdulaziz, but he never intended to harm him. He also disputed suggestions from the prosecutor and several witnesses that the prince and his aide had a gay relationship.

"Mishazi, China (CNN) -- The 38-year-old man stands on the road outside the burned out poultry processing plant, yelling at passing vehicles and demanding answers. He blocks the path of a local official's car and shouts, ""My wife's just gone like that -- what kind of country is this?"" Wang Shoufeng is very angry, and he's not alone. He says he last saw his wife before she went to work at 4 a.m. Monday to start her 14-hour shift at the poultry factory in this town in the northeastern Chinese province of Jilin. About two hours later, according to authorities, a fire broke out in the plant's slaughterhouse and spread through the building. The lights went off, witnesses say, and smoke quickly filled the rooms and passageways. Workers rushed to escape the rising flames, stumbling into one another and slipping over in the confusion. Their panic deepened when they found many of the exits were locked or blocked. It took firefighters several hours to quell the raging flames, according to state media. At the latest count, authorities said that at least 119 people had died in the blaze and 70 others were injured, making it one of China's deadliest workplace accidents in recent years. It has focused renewed attention on lax safety standards in Chinese industries. An unknown number of people remain trapped inside the slaughterhouse, with rescuers still struggling to get into the building because of its ""complicated interior structure and its narrow exits."" Grief and anger . On Tuesday, Wang and family members of other missing workers gathered at the road outside the plant. They displayed a mixture of grief, anxiety, rage and the need to know what had happened. But authorities kept them back from the chicken factory's charred remains and tried to stop some of them from talking to journalists. Despite the risks, Wang described the tough conditions at the plant where his wife earned 2,000 yuan (about $325) a month. ""They work 14, 15 hours a day with very short bathroom breaks,"" he said. ""They work year round with no time off."" He and others complained that local authorities were putting more energy and resources into stopping grieving and anxious families from protesting and seeking answers than into finding their missing loved ones. Initial investigations suggest the fire may have been started by an explosion resulting from a buildup of ammonia gas, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Witnesses have described hearing a loud bang and seeing the building fill with smoke. It remains unclear why exits were blocked. Some accounts have suggested that when the electricity went off during the fire, that locked some of the doors. Safety concerns . The reports of workers' difficulties exiting the building have revived concerns about work safety in Jilin and elsewhere in China. Xinhua said the fire was the latest in a series of workplace accidents in China in the past month. It cited a blast at an explosives factory in Shandong province on May 20 that killed 33 people and an explosion at a coal mine in Sichuan province that killed 28 workers on May 11. ""Past investigations have shown that poor safety awareness and inadequate supervision caused many of the accidents, despite a repeated emphasis on work safety from the central government,"" the official news agency said in a commentary article. ""The accidents are also the result of companies' desire to pursue profit at the cost of safety, as well as the laziness of officials who fail to fulfill their responsibilities,"" the commentary said. Local officials and the Jilin Baoyuanfeng Poultry Company, which ran the plant, are under pressure. Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders are calling on authorities to find the cause of the fire and hold those responsible accountable. ""Those who are suspected of being responsible for the accident have been taken into police custody for further inquiry,"" Xinhua reported without providing further details. ""Rescue work is still underway,"" Zhao Xian, deputy director of the local emergency office, told Xinhua on Monday. ""The rescuers are trying their utmost to search for any survivors in the fire. We'll do our best to treat the wounded, identify the victims and investigate the cause of the incident."" Such words were little consolation for the anguished, angry relatives. What they wanted were answers.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- After agreeing in principle to hold talks on reopening their joint industrial complex, North and South Korea are haggling over the date and time of the potential meetings. The proposed talks are the clearest sign yet of an improvement in the severely strained relations between the two sides after North Korea set off months of unsettling tensions with a long-range rocket launch in December followed by an underground nuclear test in February. The North broke the impasse between the two sides over the Kaesong Industrial Zone -- a major symbol of cooperation between the two countries where Pyongyang halted activity in April -- by issuing a proposal on Thursday for talks. It said that ""the venue of the talks and the date for their opening can be set to the convenience of the south side."" South Korea reacted quickly and positively to the offer, noting that it had been ""continuously"" seeking talks on Kaesong since the North shut it down. The South's unification minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, suggested the two sides hold ministerial-level talks in Seoul on Wednesday. On Friday morning, the North expressed appreciation for the South's response. It said it thinks that ""working contact"" between the two governments is necessary before ministerial talks, proposing that the lower-level meeting take place in Kaesong on Sunday. It also said it would meet a request from the South to reopen on Friday the Red Cross liaison channel in the border area of Panmunjom, an important line of communication between the two sides that the North cut off as tensions flared earlier this year. South Korean officials didn't immediately respond to the North's latest statement Friday. The shuttered Kaesong complex is one of the main casualties of the recent period of fiery threats and provocative moves by North Korea. In early April, Kim Jong Un's regime began blocking South Koreans from entering the manufacturing complex, which sits on the North's side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. Pyongyang then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone's factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. The last South Koreans in the zone left last month. The North Korean decision to halt operations surprised some observers, since Kaesong was considered an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un's regime. The proposal for talks regarding the complex indicates that ""maybe the cost of closure of Kaesong is greater than they had anticipated,"" said Daniel Pinkston, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group covering Northeast Asia. At the same time, Pinkston said, North Korea's key ally, China, which has expressed displeasure with some of Pyongyang's recent behavior, may not have been ""as generous as the North Koreans have been expecting in terms of aid, assistance, trade and investment."" The North's menacing rhetoric against the United States and South Korea hit a fever pitch in March and April after the U.N. Security Council voted in March to slap tougher sanctions on the regime and amid U.S.-South Korean military drills in the region. The U.N. sanctions were in response to the North's third underground nuclear test, which took place in February. The U.S.-South Korean military exercises have since ended, and Pyongyang has toned down the frequency and intensity of its threats. North Korea's behavior suggests it was willing to ""go to the brink and try to rattle"" new South Korean President Park Geun-hye and other governments, Pinkston said. ""But I don't think that really happened,"" he said. ""South Korea and its allies in the international community demonstrated their resolve and unwillingness to back down in the face of North Korean rhetoric."" The North's statement Thursday also proposed that the potential talks cover other issues besides the Kaesong complex. It mentioned the possibility of resuming cross-border tours at Mount Kumgang, a North Korean resort where a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean soldier in 2008 after allegedly walking into an off-limits area. Pyongyang said the talks could also include ""humanitarian issues"" such as ""the reunion of separated families and their relatives."" The North Korean proposal did not, however, mention anything about the North's controversial nuclear and missile programs, which lie at the heart of the tensions surrounding North Korea. Kim Jong Un's regime chose a symbolic date on which to make its offer of talks. June 6 is Memorial Day in South Korea, when citizens commemorate those killed while fighting to protect the country, including during the Korean War in the early 1950s. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: North Korea proposes ""working contact"" in Kaesong on Sunday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Teratomas of the brain are very rare and comprise less than 1 per cent of all brain tumors. Teratomas have been the subject of intense fascination among scientists because of their sometimes strange qualities -- some have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and, very rarely, more complex organs such as eyeballs. Thoughts about the origin of these tumors have attracted much debate. CNN spoke with Dr. Thomas L. Ellis, senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, in North Carolina, United States, about the tumors sometimes known as ""the monsters"". He explained some quick facts: . • ""Teratoma"" comes from the Greek word ""teraton,"" meaning ""monster"". • Teratomas are seen most commonly in children and young adults. • Teratomas are made up of tissue from all three germ layers -- mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm -- that occur during the formation of an embryo. • Although teratomas can occur during embryonic development, most arise much later in life. • Teratomas occur most often in the midline of the brain, therefore often obstructing and putting pressure on critical areas of the brain. This can lead to loss of basic functions, but this loss can be temporary -- until the tumor is removed or reduced in size. • Teratomas are commonly very solid and rubbery making them resistant to dissection with standard instruments.","Teratomas of the brain are very rare tumors -- less than 1% of all brain tumors .

"(CNN) -- North Korean and South Korean officials held their first government-level talks in years on Sunday, South Korean media reported. The talks were held in the village of Panmunjom, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. They come days ahead of an inter-Korean ministerial meeting planned for Wednesday at the request of the South's unification minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's post-title hangover continued on Sunday after a 1-0 defeat that kept Chelsea in pole position for England's third Champions League place next season. Juan Mata netted the only goal in the 86th minute before the game erupted from its previous lethargy as United defender Rafael da Silva was sent off for kicking out at fellow Brazilian David Luiz. Television replays showed the Chelsea player smiling on the floor afterwards. It was United's first red card this season, and means Rafael will miss the rest of the Premier League campaign with an automatic three-game ban. ""The referee was bought by the fact Luiz rolled about,"" United manager Alex Ferguson said. ""He actually elbowed Rafael twice but you know what happens when a player retaliates: he's always punished more. ""Luiz made it look worse. I don't think the referee saw it, actually, and he was convinced by Luiz's reaction."" The defeat followed United's 1-1 draw with Arsenal last weekend, having previously wrapped up a record-extending 20th title with four matches to play. ""Maybe this will waken the players up,"" said Ferguson, ahead of next weekend's final home match this season against Swansea. ""There was no edge to our game but I think Chelsea were the better team. Training was fine this week and there was a nice edge to it, but today it was missing. It's been a long season for the players and their final really big effort was last week against Arsenal."" Mata scored his 11th league goal this season, and 19th overall, to put Chelsea a point clear of fourth-placed Arsenal and three ahead of Tottenham in fifth. Victory in Wednesday's home clash with Spurs would virtually ensure qualification for Europe's top club competition, given their London rivals' inferior goal difference. ""If we can win we will be there, but Tottenham are a good team and it will be a final for the top four,"" said manager Rafael Benitez, who has guided Chelsea to two wins over United since taking charge in December. ""This game was difficult and important for us. Wednesday will be even more important as we are so close to them. Winning is crucial for us, it's even more important for them, so there will be a great atmosphere at Stamford Bridge."" Benitez is hoping to have Eden Hazard available after the Belgium playmaker missed the trip to Old Trafford due to a calf injury. ""The physios are working with him and he could be fit,"" said the Spaniard, whose team have played 12 games in just 37 days, reaching the final of the Europa League. Everton's chances of playing in Europe's second-tier tournament next season suffered a blow in Sunday's 0-0 draw with Merseyside rivals Liverpool. Manager David Moyes was angry that Sylvain Distin's second-half header was ruled out for a foul by teammate Victor Anichebe on home goalkeeper Pepe Reina. ""It was a goal. The goalkeeper runs into our player so the goal should stand,"" said Moyes after his sixth-placed team dropped five points behind Tottenham, having played one more game. ""If we run into the goalkeeper then give a foul for that, but he ran into us, so it was a goal.""

"(CNN) -- If Lagos were a person, he (or she) would be described as ""mad, bad and dangerous to know."" Locals get about in traffic-heavy Lagos on motorcycles known as okadas. But we all know that these types of people are usually the most exciting kind. They are a lot of fun and you just never know what's going to happen when they're around. By the same token, any visitor to Lagos should prepare for the unexpected -- it can feel like a literal assault on the senses from the moment you step off the plane and feel the intensity of the dense tropical heat. Lagos is big, brash and bold and creaks under the weight of the 17 million people who live there. The former capital of Nigeria, Lagos remains its economic nerve center and teems constantly with the buzz of buying and selling (usually performed at the top of the vendors' voices.) There's only one volume level in Lagos and that's loud. From the constant tooting of horns in the snail-paced traffic, known locally as go slows, to music blaring from homes round-the-clock, the city buzzes constantly with noise. Getting around is not easy and you will be caught in the frequent go slows, where you will be confronted by vendors selling all manner of things, from English football team merchandise to dinner sets to plantain chips to frozen yogurts. Locals often joke they can kit out their entire home in a short car journey. The city is divided into three islands adjacent to each other and the mainland. Most expatriates and employees of multinationals, that proliferate in Lagos, are based on two of the islands; Ikoyi and Victoria Island. The vast majority of wealth in the city is concentrated on these upmarket islands, with their western-style shopping malls and entertainment complexes. The best restaurants, bars, boutiques and galleries can also be found here and it's best to stick to these areas to make the most of your time in Lagos. A stay in Lagos would be incomplete without visiting one of the lively and colorful markets like the Balogun market off Breadfruit St, Lagos Island. It is not for the meek or faint-hearted but you're guaranteed to get a bargain or two if you're prepared for a good haggle. It's great for African prints and carvings but is a maze of a market, so best to hop on the back of popular motorcycles known locally as okadas to help you navigate it. To relax from all that haggling, you can head down to one of the five beaches in the city -- the best of them is Tarkwa Bay -- a small beach at the entrance to the Lagos port. It is easily accessible by boat from Tarzan Jetty at Maroko (around $6 per person) or under Falomo bridge on Victoria Island. At Tarkwa Bay you can browse through some local African arts, cloth or even locally produced honey brought round by the occasional hawker. For a spot of lunch, make like locals and indulge in some ""pepper fish"" or suya -- very spicy chunks of meat, similar to kebabs, cooked over a charcoal grill), washed down with ice cold beer. For authentic Nigerian cuisine that won't give your stomach too much ""wahalla"" (trouble), the Yellow Chili restaurant on Oju Olubun Close, Victoria Island is recommended. Those with an adventurous palate can order the special delicacy of Isi-Ewu - goat's head, while others can tuck into jollof rice and chicken or spicy bean cakes (moi-moi) -- a favorite with most Nigerians. For a spot of culture, a short taxi ride away is one of the city's main attractions, the National Museum on King George V Road, Onikan.  It opened in 1957 and houses bronze sculptures and ivory carvings from Benin dating back 300 years. Is Lagos the most exciting city in Africa? Use the Sound Off box below to have your say. If you are in the market for some art, you can pick up some tasteful, but admittedly, not cheap, Nigerian art at the Bogobiri boutique hotel in West Ikoyi. The hotel owner's brother, Azu, will take you to his studio where you can see the artists at work. Lagos is a see-and-be-seen place and later you can party at one of the most fashionable places in town, Caliente on Goriola Street, off Adeola Odeku Street, a fun cocktail bar with a South American vibe and salsa dancing. Lagosians also let their hair down over a bucket of champagne or two at Bar Ten in Saka Tinubu Street, owned by Nigerian football star Jay Jay Okocha. There's no chance of missing it as his name is engraved with golden letters above the entrance! Be prepared to empty your wallet though, as Lagosians are big spenders. However, if your taste is less opulent, visit one of the numerous beer parlors found on every street corner and which are open 24 hours a day. Lagos is a city that never sleeps. For those staying on the mainland, check if musician Femi Kuti is in town on a Sunday and go to ""The Shrine"", Ikeja - the home of Afrobeat. This is an amazing experience reminiscent of his dad, the legendary musician Fela Kuti. Or you can catch the current king of Afrobeat, Lagbaja at his club Motherlan' on Opebi Road, Ikeja. The clubs don't kick off in earnest until around 10pm and you can party well into the night, just don't forget to make it in time for your flight home!

"(CNN) -- It's a dilemma 1960s TV character Jan Brady knew well: ""How do you stand out when you're the middle sister?"" Indeed, her ranting against sophisticated elder sibling -- ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia"" -- became one of the most memorable catchphrases in the long-running U.S. sitcom The Brady Bunch. But the middle sister needn't be overlooked. In fact, if the Preakness Stakes -- the second horse race in America's prestigious Triple Crown -- is anything to go by, sometimes the quiet ones have the greatest stories to tell. The Kentucky Derby may be the first and most famous of the trifecta -- won by mud-splattered jockey Joel Rosario atop thoroughbred Orb earlier this month. But the Preakness, which is run in Baltimore this Saturday, also offers a fascinating history, unique atmosphere, and special significance in the march towards the third race in the crown, the Belmont Stakes. Here are five fun reasons why the Preakness Stakes is one to watch: . Silver service . The trophy is so valuable, not even the winners are allowed to hold it. The mammoth 13-kilogram, solid silver Woodlawn Vase, created by Tiffany and Co. in 1860, is worth $1 million -- making it the most valuable trophy in American sports. But the immense pressure of safeguarding it for an entire year was too much for the wife of 1953's winning owner Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, who instead convinced her husband to leave it the hands of organizers. The trophy now remains on permanent display at the Baltimore Museum of Art, with winners instead given a $30,000 replica trophy. Blooming ingenious . Sometimes if nature won't bloom, you've just got to paint it yourself. So it goes for the iconic ""Black-Eyed Susan"" blanket, traditionally draped across the shoulders of the winning horse. The blanket takes three days to create, featuring 80 bunches of normal yellow daisies strung together and attached to a rubber base, with the underside covered in thick felt. But because the Black-Eyed Susan -- the official flower for the state of Maryland -- doesn't sprout until June, artists must instead paint the center of the daisies black. You're so 'vane' The paintwork continues atop Pimlico Race Course's Old Clubhouse, where each year the weather vane is daubed in the winner's colors. As soon as the race is over, the 1.5-meter wide weather vane, featuring a miniature horse and jockey, is painted in the winning jockey's silks. The unusual tradition started in 1909 after the building's original arrow-shaped weather vane was struck by lightning and replaced with the ornamental iron rider. Sign painter Michael Willinger took on the job in 1987, saying: ""It is just the thrill of being able to participate in a big local and national event like this. Let's face it, it's the only televised sign-painting job in the country."" Family ties . If ever there was a big daddy of Preakness, Gallant Fox is it. The champion thoroughbred not only won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1930, he went on to sire the winners of more than 90 Preakness Stakes. It was a case of like father like son, when Gallant Fox's offspring, Omaha, also won the Triple Crown in 1935. Gallant Fox won 11 of his 17 races, before retiring at the grand old age of three. The super stud died in 1954, aged 27. Race adjourned . Still looking for proof that Preakness is a race that stops a nation? Look no further than the day it brought Government to a standstill. The U.S. House of Representatives adjourned for the only time in history in 1877, to watch what was known as the ""Great Race."" More than 20,000 people flocked to Pimlico to watch three thoroughbreds -- Parole, Ten Broeck and Tom Ochiltree -- battle it out on the field. Six-year-old gelding Parole triumphed, and local pool halls saloons and baseball clubs were renamed in his honor.","Preakness Stakes, second race in U.S. Triple Crown, starts Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Rising star Mohamed Salah scored a hat-trick as Egypt beat Zimbabwe 4-2 in Harare Sunday to all but book their place in the final stage of African qualifying for the 2014 World Cup Finals. Salah has been impressing for both club and country, helping Basel to the semifinals of the Europa League this season and grabbing 15 goals in his last 21 games for Egypt. The emphatic victory for the 'Pharaohs' has left them with a 100 per cent record from four games. With Congo-Brazzaville and Tunisia drawing in Gabon and Sierra Leone respectively Saturday, Egypt were left as the only one of the 40 second-stage teams to have a perfect record. Guinea thrashed Mozambique 6-1 later Sunday to keep alive their slim hopes of catching Egypt at the top of the Group G standings -- but trail by five points. Zimbabwe had pushed Egypt close in Cairo three months ago, but Salah put Bob Bradley's men ahead for the second time just before halftime in the National Stadium. Mohamed Abou Trika had given the visitors a fifth minute lead before Musona leveled midway through the half. Salah scored his second and Egypt's third with a superb effort on 76 minutes before Knowledge Billiat gave the home side brief hope. Salah's hat-trick goal soon afterwards settled the match and set them on their way to only their third appearance in a World Cup finals. In other action Sunday, Togo's 2-0 home win over Cameron revived their slim hopes in a tight Group I where only two points separate the four sides. Algeria kept a firm group on Group H as a first half double from Islam Slimani set them on the way to a 3-1 win in Benin.

"(CNN) -- Table topping Argentina were held goalless by Colombia in a fiery South American World Cup qualifier which saw both sides end the match with 10 men. The first flashpoint came midway through the first half as Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain clashed with Cristian Zapata and both were dismissed. Referee Marlon Escalante of Venezuela brandished his red cards after Zapata retaliated for an earlier Higuain foul. But the official was also involved in a controversial decision after the break as he ruled out a Sergio Aguero effort for offside to the fury of the home side's coaching staff. An earlier Aguero 'goal' was also chalked off for offside, while the second half introduction of Barcelona ace Lionel Messi, who is still nursing a hamstring injury, could not produce a breakthrough for Argentina. Argentina started the match in the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires in frantic style and David Ospina in the visiting goal made a series of stunning saves. ""Ospina was in excellent form for us,"" Colombia coach Jose Pekerman told the official FIFA website. But Colombia also had their moments and Monaco bound striker Radamel Falcao wasted a great chance to put them ahead. As well as the red cards, Escalante also gave out eight yellows, but with the draw Argentina still stay five points clear of Colombia, who move into second after Ecuador's 1-0 defeat to Peru.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek workers rallied in central Athens on Thursday after unions called a general strike to protest the government's sudden decision to halt activities at the country's state broadcaster. Thousands gathered outside the headquarters of the broadcaster, ERT, whose TV channels and radio services were pulled off the air overnight Tuesday to Wednesday. Government officials are defending the decision as a necessary budget-cutting move as the country struggles with a debt mountain, soaring unemployment and a lengthy recession. There was more bad news Thursday, as new figures showed the unemployment rate rising higher. Overall unemployment reached 27.4% in the first quarter of 2013, according to the Greek Statistics Agency, up from 26% in the last quarter of 2012, and 22.6% a year ago. The strike action has affected all public transportation in the capital and threatened some disruption to flights. The sudden shutdown of ERT has prompted fear among many Greeks that other public sector employers could be next. Inside the ERT building, where some journalists are still broadcasting via the Internet, the mood is grim. ""We are in a state of shock. The news is overwhelming,"" Rena Dimitriou, on the foreign desk, told CNN. ""We feel insulted by our government, by our prime minister. ""We feel angry and we feel that we are being terrorized by our government. ... For me personally I feel lost, but in a case that is not lost. I've been working here for 21 years now and it feels as if my life has reached a dead end. It means a new beginning but I don't know how this will be possible. ""Also I feel embarrassed. Profound dismay. Right now thousands of people don't know what comes next. And all this overnight."" Dimitriou is also concerned about the impact on the Greek diaspora and those living in border areas, ""who have now lost their connection with the motherland"" and must rely on privately owned media for news. 'No prospects' In the newsroom, journalists who would normally have been working on broadcasts are turning their hands to sweeping, cleaning up and, they say, making sure that public property is not destroyed. Zeta Kontaxi, who has worked at ERT for 19 years, said she never expected to see the events of the past two days -- and she fears for the future. ""Being here for 19 years is part of my existence and suddenly this comes to a grinding halt overnight,"" she said. ""We already had a 38% salary cut since 2010, so I have used all of my savings and now I find myself in a situation with no money and no job and no prospects of employment, when unemployment figures in Greece stand at 27%."" The General Confederation of Greek Workers and the Civil Servants Confederation oppose the decision and called for industrial action through the day Thursday. Their support helped swell the number of demonstrators outside the ERT headquarters, estimated at about 10,000 by Athens police. Among the protesters was Giorgos Louvrikos, a 21-year-old law student from Patras who is studying in Athens. ""What the government has done is no better than what Erdogan is doing in Turkey. Suppressing people's voices,"" he said, referring to the crackdown on protests in Istanbul and elsewhere. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described ERT Wednesday as a ""symbol of waste and lack of transparency"" that needed to be changed. But the decision to abruptly shut down the broadcaster, which has been in operation since 1938, has sparked division within the coalition government. Samaras, leader of the center-right New Democracy party, is due to meet with the other two party leaders in the coalition on Monday, when the question will be discussed. No room for 'sacred cows' Government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou cited chronic corruption and mismanagement of funds as reasons the broadcaster was closed down, at least temporarily. ""At a time when the Greek people are enduring sacrifices, there is no room for delay, hesitation or tolerance for sacred cows,"" Kedikoglou said in announcement shown on the broadcaster. ERT has said the decision means 2,656 employees will lose their jobs. To meet its commitments to its creditors -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- the Greek government has to dismiss 2,000 people from the wider public sector by the end of the year and 15,000 by the end of 2014. Kedikoglou said a new television and radio broadcaster would open with a much smaller staff, with existing employees able to apply for new positions. A ""modern television and radio broadcaster will be established that will operate as soon as possible,"" he said. An exact time frame for the new organization has not been announced, but a government spokesman said the new broadcaster should be operational before the end of the summer. The General Secretariat of Information and Communication said the new state broadcaster would be called the Organization of Modern State Television. Journalists dismayed . The European Commission said Wednesday it had not sought the closure of ERT, ""but nor does the Commission question the Greek Government's mandate to manage the public sector."" It added that the commission ""supports the role of public broadcasting as an integral part of European democracy."" Reporters Without Borders expressed dismay over what it said was a ""bizarre"" decision by the government to shut down ERT's activities while carrying out the overhaul of its services. ""Greece has fallen almost 50 places in the past three years in the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index, a record fall in such a short period for a European Union member state,"" a statement said. ""The reasons include violence against reporters covering anti-austerity demonstrations, which goes completely unpunished, and threats against journalists and other news providers by the Golden Dawn party's neo-Nazis. ""Against this backdrop, the closure of ERT's TV stations has dealt a devastating blow to pluralism and freedom of information in Greece."" Greek lawmakers agreed in April to cut thousands of government workers to secure another â‚¬8.8 billion ($11.5 billion) in international bailout funds. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou reported from Athens, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro and Christine Theodorou, and journalist Nathalie Savaricas contributed to this report.","NEW: About 10,000 people join a rally in support of ERT workers, police say .

"(CNN) -- Decked out in voluminous Victorian-style dresses, complete with horn-shaped headgear, the Herero ladies of Namibia have held on tight to a piece of 19th century history. For over a century these women have fiercely protected their dress as a crucial part of their cultural identity. Their style of dressing was influenced by the wives of German missionaries and colonialists who first came to the country in the early 1900s. The long dresses are heavy and reflect the style of the Victorian period with numerous petticoats worn to add fullness to their skirts. They are hand-sewn by the women who add their own personal style and flair. Blogger Mwalimushi Kamati-Chinkoti of My Beautiful Namibia website says wearing the dresses often symbolizes a woman's place in the society. She wrote on her website: ""These outfits are regarded as proper dress for traditional married women. By wearing the long dress, a newly-married woman shows her in-laws that she is willing to take up the responsibilities of a Herero home and will raise her children to respect their heritage and their father's family."" ""The Herero women's long dress has become a symbol of Herero tradition for Herero, tourists, scholars and other Namibians,"" she added. It is a view echoed by Lutz Marten, a linguist at London's School of Oriental and African studies with a specialism in the Herero tribe. He explains that the style of dress has become an important part of the Herero women's identity. iReport: send in your photos from Namibia . ""It reflects a strong sense of history and the memory of national rebuilding after the [Herero-German] 1904 war,"" he said. ""It also provides a sense of cultural identity in general, in the historical context and in the context of modern-day Namibia,"" he added. The colorful dresses are topped off with an elaborate headgear made of a matching fabric. According to Tim Henshall, a British tour operator who has visited the region for nearly two decades and gotten to know some of the women, the headdress is ""built to represent the horns of the cattle, which are so important to the Himba and Herero communities."" ""The Germans in Namibia brought people in to work for them so they took the local communities and gave them work in their houses and on their land,"" said Henshall, who runs Kamili Safaris. ""Instead of the Herero being topless and barely covered, which would offend the modest attitudes of Victorians at the time, they wanted them to be covered up,"" he added. Henshall added that the women showed no sign of being bothered by wearing the outfits, even in Namibia's tropical climate. The Herero and Himba people are a pastoral, cattle-breeding tribe who migrated to Namibia several centuries ago. The traditional Herero live in the north of the country in the Kunene region and the Damaraland area. Around 150 years ago, the two groups split and Herero settled in towns and villages while the Himba continued with a nomadic lifestyle. The Herero women take enormous pride in their outfits and have also developed a sideline in making and selling dolls wearing exact replicas of the dresses to tourists. Quiz: what do you know about Namibia? Marten says that keeping the memory of the Herero-German war alive is very important and that there is an annual festival in August to commemorate this. He adds that the Herero genocide in 1904 killed almost 75% of the population, and the event is a key moment in Herero identity. ""This is in part assimilation to European culture, and also in part appropriation, a coming-to-terms with, and overcoming of history and the colonial experience,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The security guard suspected of killing a 16-year-old American student in Costa Rica has been charged with simple homicide, authorities said Friday. The suspected gunman worked as a guard at the hotel where the boy was staying in La Fortuna, a popular tourist spot famous for the Arenal volcano. The boy and three others left their rooms after curfew Wednesday night and went to another section of the hotel to visit some friends, according to Marisel Rodriguez, spokeswoman for the Judicial Investigation Organization (OIJ), which investigates crime in Costa Rica. Around 4 a.m. on Thursday, the boys attempted to go back to their rooms, cutting across a wooded area of the hotel grounds, she said. The security guard saw them, apparently mistook them for robbers and fired his weapon, said Rodriguez. The 16-year-old was shot in the chest and died. He was identified by the McLouth, Kansas, school district as Justin Johnston. Johnston was on a nine-day trip in Costa Rica with this school's Spanish club when he was killed, the school district said. No other students were injured. Family and friends of the boy gathered for a prayer service at a church across the street from his school. ""It's heartbreaking,"" Zack Willard told CNN Kansas City affiliate KCTV. ""You don't really know what to think right now being told this. He's one of my good friends. He was a very good kid. He always did good. He loved sports. He was just an all-around good kid,"" Willard said. Simple homicide in Costa Rica is the equivalent of manslaughter in the United States. The guard did not have a permit to carry his gun, as required by national law, said Rodriguez. He will be incarcerated until his trial, she said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the Cannes Film Festival gets underway, all eyes will once again be on the contenders for the festival's top prize -- the Palme d'Or. As one of the most prestigious awards in world cinema, the Golden Palm has been the launchpad for success for many films over the decades. Quentin Tarantino and Bruce Willis promote the celebrated ""Pulp Fiction"" at the festival in '94. But it's not only Hollywood films that get recognition -- just two Palme d'Or winners have gone on to win Best Picture at the Oscars, and just one American movie is competing in this year's contest. We've picked five of the most groundbreaking and iconic Palme d'Or winners from around the world since the award's inception in 1955. ""Le monde du silence"" (1956) Director: Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle Starring: Frédéric Dumas, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Albert Falco . Cousteau's ""Silent World"" was the first documentary to walk away with the golden palm, having already won the Best Documentary prize at that year's Oscars. This deep-sea exploration was one of the first films to show the beauty of the ocean depths in full color, and was also the first French film to win the Palme d'Or -- until 1955 the award had been known as the Grand Prix. What happened next: Cousteau repeated his Oscar success with ""World Without Sun"" in 1964. It was not until Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" in 2004 that another documentary would repeat ""Le monde du silence""'s success at Cannes. ""La Dolce Vita"" (1960) Director: Federico Fellini Starring: Marcello Mastroianni, Anita Ekberg, Anouk Aimée . Fellini's Roman epic has become one of the most important Italian films ever made, loaded with religious iconography, aristocratic decadence and media comment -- the film even coined the term paparazzi. Tracking a week in the life of a 1950s journalist, ""La Dolce Vita"" was greeted rapturously by critics in both Europe and America. What happened next: An Oscar followed in 1962, and Fellini became a pioneer of arthouse films, following his interest in Jungian psychology. The film's 50th anniversary will be marked at this year's festival with the airing of a previously unseen behind-the-scenes documentary. ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) Director: Francis Ford Coppola Starring: Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall . This one nearly didn't even make the festival -- director Francis Ford Coppola needed persuading to premiere what was then an unfinished three-hour edit of the infamous Vietnam epic. His decision to go ahead was vindicated by rapturous applause from the audience at the end credits. Despite the film's incomplete state, the jury awarded it the Palme d'Or, shared with Volker Schlondorff's ""The Tin Drum."" What happened next: The film is now widely regarded as an all-time classic, with its iconic helicopter attack scene to the strains of ""Ride of the Valkyries"" passing into folklore as one of cinema's most memorable scenes. Coppola won a Golden Globe for Best Director, and the film picked up two Academy Awards for sound and cinematography. ""The Piano"" (1993) Director: Jane Campion Starring: Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin . Writer and director Jane Campion is to date the only woman, and the only New Zealander, to scoop the Palme d'Or, shared that year with Chinese drama ""Farewell My Concubine."" Her stunning period drama featured Holly Hunter as a mute pianist, who also walked off with the Best Actress award at the festival. What happened next: The film enjoyed extraordinary success and critical acclaim -- Hunter went on to take Best Actress awards at almost every major awards ceremony, including the Oscars and Golden Globes, while Michael Nyman's soundtrack became a bestseller. ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) Director: Quentin Tarantino Starring: John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L Jackson . Quentin Tarantino's eagerly awaited follow-up to ""Reservoir Dogs"" will go down in history as a Cannes classic. The collection of bloody vignettes centering around smalltime LA gangsters stormed the festival -- the whole cast was flown over for the premiere, which received rave reviews across the board, cementing Tarantino's position as one of the world's hippest directors. What happened next: Tarantino picked up the Best Screenplay gong at the Oscars, Baftas and Golden Globes, with the film scoring a host of other awards and nominations. ""Pulp Fiction"" started a life-long love affair with Cannes for Tarantino, who became president of the festival's jury in 2004.","""Le monde du silence"" becomes first ever documentary to win in 1956 .
In 1979, Coppola's unfinished version of ""Apocalypse Now"" takes top prize .
Jane Campion is the only female director to win Palme d'Or, for ""The Piano""
""Pulp Fiction"" starts Tarantino's life-long love affair with Cannes in 1994 ."
"(Rolling Stone) -- A panel of Czech judges ruled Tuesday that concert promoters -- and not Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe -- were largely to blame for the tragic death nearly three years ago of a teenage fan of the metal band, saying the singer's actions did not constitute a crime. The state attorney, who had sought a conviction for manslaughter and asked for the minimum sentence of five years, immediately appealed the decision. Blythe declined to talk to the press after the trial but told the court earlier he was ready to face the music. ""As I've stated previously, I do not wish to avoid my responsibility, and if I thought I were guilty I would plead guilty right now,"" he said. ""I still believe I acted responsibly to protect myself, my band, our equipment, and our audience. I did not strike anyone or run across the stage to push anyone,"" as one witness had claimed. Q&A: Lamb of God's Randy Blythe on Imprisonment and Freedom . Concertgoers testified in February and on Monday that Blythe had violently pushed 19-year-old Daniel Nosek off the stage during the band's concert in Prague on May 24, 2010, using both hands. But there were stark and contradicting differences in key details as to when the young man breached the security barrier and which way he was facing when allegedly pushed, points the defense played up to create reasonable doubt in Bltyhe's favor. What is clear is that later that evening, the Czech teenager -- though sober and not under the influence of any drugs -- fell on his back and hit his head, appeared to be OK but later complained of a headache, and vomited violently. He was rushed to a hospital, where he underwent emergency brain surgery but slipped into a coma and died several weeks later. An expert on biomechanics, called by Blythe's defense, presented the results of a recreation of the fall -- in part using ""fresh cadavers dead for less than 12 hours"" to measure the impact on a human skull -- to the court on Tuesday. The expert said Nosek must have fallen backwards as he would not have had time, involuntarily, to twist around before impact. Had the teenager fallen forward, his hands would have reflexively shot out to protect himself, he said. Lamb of God Singer Randy Blythe's Manslaughter Trial Resumes in Prague . Crucially for Blythe's defense, the expert said that had the teenager been pushed, he would not have fallen beyond the first row of fans, as two witnesses had testified. But state attorney Vladimir Muzik --a bear of a man, whose forearms could not be contained by his crimson-trimmed black robe -- took great issue with the experiment, which he argued failed to recreate actual conditions and discounted the testimony of a key witness. The presiding judge wholeheartedly agreed with the prosecutor while noting most witnesses' recollections were ""foggy"" at best. While video footage had captured images of Blythe subduing an admittedly drunk and out-of-control fan named Milan Poradek -- who had rushed the stage three times -- the fatal moment leading to Nosek's death was not recorded. The presiding judge, Tomas Kubovec, put the lion's share of the blame for the tragedy on lax security and safety precautions at the Prague club, which thereby allowed fans to take to the stage. Kubovec said ""ninety percent of the audience"" must have known stage-diving was prohibited and dangerous. He said the teenager, who was reportedly a Lamb of God fanatic but understood little English, evidently also misunderstood Bltyhe's hand gesture calling for applause ""that would have been absolutely understandable for English speakers"" as an invitation to take to the stage. Nonetheless, the judge said, Nosek must have known that stage-diving was not permitted, as there was a barrier in place and security personnel who had prevented other fans from climbing over it. U.S. State Department Responds to Randy Blythe Petition . As for the over $500,000 the boy's family is seeking in damages, Kubovec said they should try to get the money from the concert promoters and organizers. For his part, the Lamb of God singer made a heartfelt apology to the Noseks, saying, ""I can understand that pain as only the father of a dead child can."" ""This has been a very sad and emotive experience for me, but I've tried to remain as objective as possible because my emotions have no impact on what is for me and for the family of Daniel Nosek the most important thing: the truth,"" said Blythe. ""He was just a boy. I wish he were still here."" Blythe had pledged ""to serve my sentence like a man"" if found guilty by the Czech courts and to work tirelessly to prevent another such tragedy from ever occurring at a Lamb of God show ""or any other show"" -- if found innocent.

"(CNN) -- Because of the severe heat and drought in the Midwest, global food prices are going up. Why? Because the U.S. is the leading producer and exporter of staple grains. We are for food production what Saudi Arabia is for oil production. Our crop shortages have ripple effects throughout the food system and disrupt the global markets, especially in the food-insecure nations. The U.S. hasn't reached 2008's level of high food prices yet because rice and wheat stocks are ample. These are the two most important food grains for human consumption worldwide. Corn and soybean levels are extremely tight, and their prices have skyrocketed since June. However, these two grains are mostly used as livestock feeds. Corn is also diverted to produce ethanol because of our government mandate. Opinion: Extreme heat and droughts -- a recipe for world food woes . Earlier this month, the United Nations urged the U.S. to ease its ethanol mandate. The origin of this policy goes back to 2005 when Congress set requirements of corn to be used for automotive fuel. In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act greatly increased those requirements to improve air quality and become more energy secure. Behind the scenes, however, corn and other agricultural lobbyists were promoting the mandate to create a larger market for corn. Using current numbers, this year's ethanol mandate would theoretically require 44% of this year's corn crop, a third of which is recycled back as distillers grains for livestock feed. We are being told by the ethanol producers, the corn growers and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack that eliminating the ethanol mandate would not significantly reduce global food costs. But how could that be when roughly 14% of the world's corn crop is being converted into ethanol in the U.S.? In addition to corn being used for biofuel, taxpayer-subsidized biodiesel is using up more soybeans each year. While some say that attempting to change the ethanol mandate is politically impossible in an election year that depends so much on the Midwest swing states, there is a loud and growing chorus of voices that are calling for an urgent end to the mandate. Greg Page, CEO of Cargill, one of the world's largest agricultural corporations, recently urged: ""We need to move to more market-driven biofuels policies, not inflexible mandates, subsidies and tariffs."" Just as the USDA's recent estimate of a corn yield at 123 bushels per acre is certain to be reduced further, its estimate of food costs rising only 3% to 4% next year is certain to be raised. The least politically palatable condition in any nation is high food prices. Expect beef, pork, chicken, turkey, eggs, fats and oils, cereals and dairy products to go up the most in the coming months. Americans have already reduced their meat consumption over the past few years partly because of higher prices. It is time for policymakers to admit they made a mistake in setting the corn ethanol mandate level too high in 2007. This year, the mandate is 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol, which would require 4.7 billion bushels of corn. The mandate is set to top out in 2015 at 15 billion gallons. If politics dictates that we must have an ethanol mandate, then at the very least we should consider cutting the level by half, which could be done by using only 5% ethanol, or E5, in gasoline instead of E10, which is a combination of 10% ethanol and 90% unleaded gasoline. The mandate should never be allowed to use more than 20% of the annual U.S. corn crop. This amount would be enough to help stimulate corn demand for this overproduced commodity. As a bonus, more sustainable farming practices could return to the Midwest following this frenzy of growing corn on corn, fencerow to fencerow, to cash in on the high prices. What would make the most sense would be to scrap the national ethanol mandate altogether and let each state decide. Currently, ethanol use is not mandated in top corn producing states such as Iowa and Nebraska. These states choose to sell gasoline that doesn't even contain ethanol. This would suggest that they would rather export the product than use it themselves. Since they tout their ethanol product so highly, and it is available to them locally, they should consider increasing their own use of the product. Meanwhile, consumers in low corn producing states such as Colorado and California are required to buy ethanol in every gallon of gasoline because ethanol use is mandated in those states. The argument for the ethanol mandate is being challenged because of today's greater use of natural gas and the development of other fuel sources. It's time for the mandate to reflect the realities of 2012. It often takes a crisis to get government to take action and correct a policy that was wrong to begin with. This growing season, we have had extreme heat and drought in the most productive farming region in the world. Let's use this unfortunate plight to get our ethanol policy right, before it causes food prices to go up more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kay McDonald.","Kay McDonald: Expect the price of meat, eggs and dairy products to go up .
McDonald: America's policy of diverting corn to ethanol production is causing high prices .
She says if we must have an ethanol mandate, then we should cut the level by half .

"(CNN) -- With ""Superbad,"" producer Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up,"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") has created another cockeyed hit. In ""Superbad,"" Michael Cera (left) and Jonah Hill (right) go in search of a teen's holy grail: booze and sex. The hilarious film offers a younger skew on what must be labeled the Apatow house brand of touchy-feely sex comedy -- in other words, more extreme profanity and juvenile gross-out gags. But all that doesn't make ""Superbad"" bad. Far from it -- this is the funniest picture since ""Borat,"" and more emotionally nuanced than you would expect. Not that you would expect much in that line, I imagine. Penned by ""Knocked Up"" star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were still in high school, ""Superbad"" has what screenwriting gurus call a ""quest"" narrative: through a combination of chance and opportunism, Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera, from ""Arrested Development"") are entrusted with securing the alcohol for an end-of-term party. ""You know how when girls sleep with guys, they always say it was an accident?"" reasons Seth, optimistically. ""We could be that accident!""  Watch Cera and Hill offer tales from the film » . His plan hinges on their even nerdier pal Fogell (unheralded comedy superhero Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Fogell has a fake ID lined up. Trouble is, when this document materializes, it carries only the single name ""McLovin,"" officially a 25-year-old organ donor from the Aloha State. Undeterred, brave ""McLovin"" ventures into a liquor store, only to get caught up in an attempted robbery. In the movie's quirkiest detour he spends most of the evening cruising in a patrol car with two unexpectedly paternal, party-hearty cops (Rogen and Bill Hader). Meanwhile, Seth and Evan gamely try to parlay a traffic accident into hard booze. Anyone even remotely schooled in teen comedy will recognize that ""Superbad"" is an old, old story, albeit one that seems unreasonably determined to lower the taste bar. Each generation throws up a coming-of-age comedy to call its own, whether it's ""American Graffiti"" or ""American Pie,"" and there are equal parts of both here. Fogell could be the son (or the grandson) of Charles Martin Smith's Terry the Toad from the Lucas film. (There's also a blast of the Bar-Kays' ""Soul Finger"" on the predominantly funk soundtrack.) Mostly, though, we're reminded that Seth Rogen's association with Judd Apatow goes all the way back to the cult NBC series ""Freaks and Geeks"" when he was 16. ""Superbad"" could be an R-rated episode from that show. Although it takes place over 24 hours or so, the film's period is a bit hazy. These geeks don't talk about sports. They don't talk about music or movies (hardly) ... or politics (as if!). They certainly don't talk about whatever it is they're learning in high school (in Seth's case, apparently, not much). Sometimes they talk about girls. But that's just an important but not vital adjunct to the real Topic A: the penis. The male sex organ and its potential applications are contemplated endlessly, inside and out, with Seth and Evan turning ideas over in their minds with the same mixture of curiosity, creativity and awe scientists dedicate to quantum physics and basketball fans reserve for the career of Steve Nash. Of course such overheated bravado is utterly transparent. Seventeen-year-old virgins, they are distressingly ignorant when it comes to the opposite sex and terrified of the mystery that lurks there. Directing his first feature since the indie gem ""The Daytrippers,"" Greg Mottola takes care to ground the improbable plot in a realistic, low-rent neighborhood and authentic characterizations. If the guileless Mintz-Plasse steals the show, Cera and Hill play off each other beautifully. The intentionally and hilariously anti-climactic ending crystallizes the movie's fairly subtle emotional subtext. Soon it will be time to put aside childish things, and for Seth and Evan, this includes each other. ""Superbad"" is rated R and runs 114 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.

"(CNN) -- A number of establishment Republicans are privately blasting former Rep. J.C. Watts and his comments about considering a run for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee. They call him arrogant for even suggesting he could do the job, and some have said the talk is more about his ego than a vision for the party. In fact, he has been likened to former RNC Chairman Michael Steele. Both are conservative, but clearly that comparison is based on their skin color and not anything else. The Republican Party establishment should tread carefully here, because even if members choose not to vote for Watts -- if he decides to even seek the job -- it is his skin color and perspective that is central to the GOP having any sort of presidential future. We might as well not play footsie: The Republican Party is a group largely composed of and targeting white Americans. Yes, there are minority Republicans. But considering how President Obama was able to destroy Mitt Romney at the ballot box last month with a racial coalition that rolled up massive support among blacks, Hispanics and Asians, the GOP has a problem. The day has passed when the GOP can win the presidency by focusing on white Americans. Folks, this is simple math. With the nation moving toward becoming a majority-minority country, the Republican Party cannot afford to continue to ignore, alienate and, frankly, tick off minority voters. What J.C. Watts is trying to do is to get party leaders to understand that as a former college football legend at the University of Oklahoma, he knows when a failed game plan needs to be thrown out. In football, if you lose, you often get rid of the coach and find someone who can recruit better players to put you on the path to winning. Opinion: GOP, break Grover Norquist's grip on you . Does that mean the GOP should throw out RNC chairman Reince Priebus? Not necessarily. But it is abundantly clear that the modern-day GOP had better find a new game plan or it is going to be on the outside of the Oval Office for quite some time. J.C. Watts is no stranger to this discussion. When he served in the leadership of the House Republican Conference as a member of Congress from Oklahoma, he often tried to quietly address these issues within the party, and his comments often fell on deaf ears. Now Watts can look to his Republican buddies and say, ""Didn't I tell you? Now are y'all ready to pay attention?"" But as long as guys like Mitt Romney surrogate John Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor and chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush, continue to assert that people voted for President Obama because of handouts, the GOP will resemble that old, drunk uncle you hate to invite over for family dinners because he manages to make everyone look foolish. The Republican Party's problem isn't that its members have to better explain its policies to minorities. No. It's that they all need to shut up and listen. Yes, listen. Because every time top GOP officials open their mouths, all they seem to do is insult the very people they need to vote for them. This is about relationships. It is about having a dialogue. It's about listening to what Americans desire and seeing where there is agreement, whether it's education, the environment, entrepreneurship, sentencing reform, immigration or a host of other issues. Too often, the GOP is afraid to talk to minorities, especially black folks, and that results in turning them off in a huge way. And just saying, ""Look! We have elected some minorities to office"" ain't gonna cut it. How did having a Hispanic governor in New Mexico and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio help Mitt Romney in the last election? J.C. Watts understands that being able to commuincate with black, Hispanic and Asian business owners about issues other than taxes is going to make a difference. Sorry, GOP, just touting smaller government and fewer taxes won't cut it. The discussion must be broad and touch upon the issues that affect these voters every day. And the only way a Priebus can even understand how to talk to and work with black folks is having a relationship with the likes of J.C. Watts, Colin Powell, Texas Education Commissioner Michael Williams, Florida Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott, former Citigroup and Time Warner chairman Richard Parsons and so many others and say, ""Please, take the time to educate me on the issues and concerns resonating among black folks, and how our agenda can appeal to them."" Then you sit back, shut up and take notes. Opinion: The GOP is tone-deaf on fiscal cliff . The same needs to happen with other constituencies that the Democratic Party has dominated. This is the only effective way the GOP will come to grips with the enormous problems it has in these communities. The party first must know why there is so much resistance, and then go about methodically addressing the issues. And that will mean having an extraordinary outreach program that must be funded and staffed. The fact is, the massive outreach effort that is needed may not pay off for the GOP in 2016. But laying the groundwork today could mean seeing the fruits of that labor then and beyond. But I can guarantee the GOP one thing: If it ignores minority constituents and dismisses them, it will get destroyed at the ballot box. The only way for fruits to grow is if the seed is planted, cultivated and tended to. The GOP has been unwilling to get its hands dirty and do the hard work when it comes to minority voters. Keep it up and it will starve to death. I guarantee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Former Rep. J.C. Watts might run for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee .
Some establishment Republicans are blasting him, says Roland Martin .
But if the GOP wants any kind of future, it should listen to Watts very closely, Martin says .

"(CNN) -- Somebody took Jessica Heeringa from a Michigan gas station Friday night. Police seem certain of that but say they're ""grasping at straws"" for other evidence that might help them find the 25-year-old cashier. Norton Shores, Michigan, Police Chief Daniel Shaw said that by Tuesday morning authorities had gotten 150 tips in the Heeringa case, but nothing conclusive. ""A lot of interesting tips that we can follow up on. Whether or not they're solid, it's hard to say because we have so little to work on with physical evidence. We're just grasping at straws. ... We're grasping for straws with whatever we can find at the scene,"" Shaw told CNN affiliate WOOD. Shaw said a DNA sample was found at the gas station, but he could not tie it to Heeringa's disappearance, WOOD reported. That sample is being tested. Heeringa was scheduled to close the Exxon station where she was working alone at 11:30 p.m. Friday. But at 11:15, police got a 911 call that the station was unmanned. ""It's very suspicious why there's nobody here,"" the 911 caller says in a tape police released Monday. Based on the way the station was left, police say they believe somebody abducted Heeringa. ""Her purse and other belongings were undisturbed. In addition, the store's cash drawer was found out and no money was missing,"" police said in a statement. Police are looking for the driver of a silver minivan who was seen in the store's parking area late Friday, they said. A press release describes him as a white male, between 30 and 40, with wavy hair parted in the middle. The van could have been a Chrysler Town and Country, police said. The Exxon station did not have security cameras, but late Monday police released video they think shows the van driving by a nearby business. The video is blurry, the van is only seen for a few seconds, and neither a driver nor license plate can be seen. ""I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you could blow it up and I could see the driver inside. But that doesn't exist for me,"" Shaw told WOOD. But it is something. ""It does give us some hope that we've got some accurate information out there to work with,"" he told the station. Heeringa's family and friends in the community of 22,500 near Lake Michigan were posting missing posters around the area, and a Facebook page was set up for people to offer clues or support. ""We are searching! Hang tight! The whole Country wants you home!"" said a Facebook post from Monday morning. Heeringa is described as 5-foot-1, 110 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses. Heeringa's mother, Shelly Heeringa, told CNN affiliate WZZM that she thinks her daughter's abductor was a past customer who knew Jessica and the store. ""She's very helpful, that's why I think he lured her out of the gas station,"" the mother told the station. ""He knew there wasn't security cameras."" People with information that may help find Heeringa are asked to call the Norton Shores police at 231-733-2691.","Police say there's scant evidence to go on .

"(CNN) -- Two New Jersey men are facing charges of running a 9/11 memorial scam allegedly by collecting donations and selling memorial T-shirts from the back of a pickup truck painted with the World Trade Center towers, according to the state attorney general's office. Mark Niemczyk, 66, of Tinton Falls, and Thomas Scalgione, 41, of Manahawkin, allegedly sold T-shirts and collected donations out of their truck at 9/11 events from June 2010 until July 2012. according to a statement from the New Jersey attorney general. They displayed a sign that read ""All donations for the T-shirts go to families of 9/11,"" but none of the more than $50,000 raised was sent to the victims' families or 9/11 charities. Both men were indicted Monday on third-degree charges of conspiracy and two counts of theft by deception, according to the statement. Niemczyk was also charged with failure to file a personal state income tax return in 2011, and for failing to report thousands of dollars in proceeds from the 9/11 T-shirt sales and donations and other money he had won at a casino. One count of theft by deception refers to the sale of T-shirts and collection of donations, and the second refers to the purchase of the T-shirts at a discounted rate by posing as a charity. The indictment did not specify a court date, and it could not be determined whether the men had retained attorneys. New Jersey in July 2011 filed suit against Niemczyk and Scalgione, alleging they defrauded donors. They were ordered to pay back $121,116 in donations and to pay civil penalties. They were also permanently barred from working for any charitable organization in New Jersey. The pair allegedly claimed they were father-and-son firefighters who were working at a firehouse near the World Trade Center on 9/11, Director Elie Honig of the state Division of Criminal Justice said in the statement. ""Their conduct was outrageous, and we urge any victims who donated money or bought T-shirts from these con artists to contact us,"" Honig said in the statement. According to the state attorney general's statement, the truck used by the men was painted with the names of police and firefighters who died on September 11, 2001. Rosemary Cain, mother of firefighter George McCain, who was killed, felt betrayed when she learned her son's name was being used as a part of the scam. ""I feel that he's dishonored the 343 firefighters, he's dishonored by putting their names on a truck and using it to scam people of their money,"" she told CNN affiliate WCBS, referring to the defendants. ""Absolutely it's a betrayal, it's disgusting."" The two men purchased hundreds of T-shirts with 9/11 themes printed on them from two vendors. The vendors charged between $3 and $6.90 per shirt, which Niemczyk and Scaglione then sold for $20 apiece, according to the state attorney general's office. ""The conduct of these two men wasn't just despicable,"" Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said. ""It was criminal, and we are bringing them to justice."" Scalgione was the alleged ""public relations"" part of the team, making arrangements to set up their truck at different 9/11 events, authorities said. The men were not registered with the state of New Jersey as a charitable organization as required by law. If convicted, Niemczyk and Scalgione could each face three to five years in prison.

"(CNN) -- Been thinking about wrestlers. No, not about Hulk Hogan or Andre the Giant or The Rock. I mean real wrestlers. Wrestlers who wrestle for real. Wrestlers who won't wrestle in the 2020 Olympic Games if the International Olympic Committee drop kicks their sport. It was revealed Tuesday that the IOC is giving serious thought to the elimination of wrestling from Olympic competition. Been thinking about Steve Fraser. He was a deputy sheriff from Ann Arbor, Michigan, when I watched him in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics on the night he became the first American ever to win a medal in Greco-Roman wrestling. It was shiny. It was gold. ""Knowing me,"" he said, ""I'll probably have it bronzed."" Been thinking about Joe Williams. Wrestling may be cut from Olympic Games . He was a high school and college wrestling champion from Harvey, Illinois, who was 29 when he finally made it to an Olympic Games. He went to Athens in 2004. He dedicated it to his older brother Steve, a former wrestler who died of heart failure right outside Joe's house in 2003. Joe did his best but did not win a medal. ""I don't care. It was still worth it,"" he told me. ""Every long, hard minute from Day 1."" Been thinking about Clarissa Chun. She -- yes, she -- is a wrestler. A mere 4 feet, 11 inches tall. (Women's wrestling became an Olympic sport in 2004.) Chun was a kindergarten teacher from Honolulu, the daughter of a Japanese-American mom and a Chinese-American dad. She defeated a seven-time national champion in the U.S. trials in 2008. Then she went to the 2012 London Olympics and got herself a bronze medal. Also been thinking a little bigger. Been thinking about Rulon Gardner, of course. He bulked up to 475 pounds before NBC's ""The Biggest Loser"" invited him to be a contestant. But before that, he stunned the 11-time world champion, Aleksandr Karelin, to become the super-sized Cinderella of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. I was in Indianapolis on the 2004 day when ol' Rulon qualified for the Olympics once more ... after a motorcycle crash, after dislocating a wrist in a pick-up basketball game and after a snowmobile misadventure led to a case of frostbite and the loss of a toe. Why keep wrestling? ""To be able to represent us in the greatest sport in the world ... the oldest sport in the world?"" Rulon replied. ""To get to do that? Wow."" Wow, for sure. That was my reaction Tuesday and the reaction from wrestlers everywhere -- a ""nightmare,"" the former collegiate king of the mat, Dan Gable, described it in one interview -- at the IOC's proposal (not yet a done deal) that certain sports are to be abandoned by 2020, with wrestling among those on the hit list. Somewhere among the gods, Hercules weeps. You might not know your Greco from your Roman, but it was 708 B.C. when wrestling was a part of the first Olympics, historians tell us. And it was 1896 when the so-called ""Modern Olympics"" were born ... and, yes, wrestling was there in Athens that summer as well. It is hand-to-hand combat in its essence. A fight with civility. It is global activity. Afghanistan and Austria have competed in Olympic wrestling, as have Belgium and Bolivia, and Cambodia and Cameroon, and Macedonia and Mongolia, and so many more. Do you have any idea how many Olympic wrestling medals have been won by athletes from Finland and Sweden? Take a guess. Six? 10? Try 167. Bulgaria has won 68 Olympic medals in this sport. Bulgarians don't wait around much to see how their athletes do in Olympic figure-skating or tennis or synchronized swimming. But in wrestling, Bulgarians kick butt. The Olympic Games aren't just for sports superpowers, not just for Russia and China and the USA, USA! Egypt has won golds in Olympic wrestling. I'll bet an Egyptian today would say, hey, if you want to drop something, drop badminton, drop beach volleyball. Leave wrestling be. As for these United States of America, well, you can prattle on about Michael Phelps or Bruce Jenner or Muhammad Ali or any other famed Olympian we have produced, but keep in mind this: Our wrestlers have won 50 golds. And 125 medals in all. That mat meant every bit as much to them as that pool did to Ryan Lochte, as that gym apparatus did to Gabby Douglas, as that hardwood floor did to Kobe Bryant. Wrestlers are human, man. If you pin them, do they not bleed? I am thinking of scholastic wrestlers all over the globe who starve themselves to make weight, devote countless hours to training for a match, learn every hold and every escape. Most don't dream of selling out Madison Square Garden some day. They do often fantasize about ducking their heads to have a necklace with a medallion draped around their necks. High school wrestling has been the stuff of literature and cinema, from ""The World According to Garp"" to ""Win Win."" It has been a part of many a young man's formative years. It has now become part of a 21st century young woman's world as well. Without it, we don't have young Jeff Blatnick of Niskayuna, New York, growing up to beat cancer and beat his opponent in the 1984 super-heavyweight gold-medal match, quite a feat for a kid who had his spleen and appendix taken out. We don't have Steve Fraser, a night earlier, caressing his gold medal with one hand, his pregnant wife with the other, and inviting a reporter (me), ""Hey, come on over to the hotel. We'll be partying all night!"" Because there won't be any Olympic wrestlers any more. Not if the IOC goes through with this preposterous proposition. Can't we talk these people out of it? Grant them some 2020 hindsight? I do think we can convince them, and I'm pretty sure that I know how. Twist their arms.

"(CNN) -- Comedian and actor Kevin Hart says he'll straighten up his act. And he's not being funny. Los Angeles traffic police arrested the stand-up comic on ""suspicion"" of drunken driving early Sunday. They observed him speeding down a freeway at 90 mph in his black Mercedes, weaving across traffic lanes and almost running into a gas tanker truck, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- A boyhood wish finally came true. But Maurice Griffin had to wait until he was a man for it to happen. At age 32, the California man was adopted Friday. ""It was the best day in my life,"" Griffin said after the proceeding in San Diego Juvenile Court. ""I fought for 10 years and finally the day came."" Adopting the burly, muscular, mohawk-sporting man is Lisa Godbold, his one-time foster mother. ""I was just overwhelmed with emotion,"" Godbold added. With a few pen strokes by Griffin, Godbold and Judge Richard Monroy, the adoption became official. ""This is going to be quite quick,"" the judge told mom and son, all seated at a table. ""If you blink, you miss it."" Then son hugged mom. Mom cried. ""Congratulations to you both,"" the judge declared. Then a deputy took a photograph of three of them, a tradition that the judge noted is always done with small children and their adoptive parents. Good time . The story dates to the early 1980s, when Godbold and her husband saw Griffin at an orphanage near their Sacramento home. The smiling child seemed to fit perfectly with their family: Godbold is white. Her late previous husband was black, and the couple had two children who were, like Griffin, biracial. The couple took Griffin in as a foster child. He quickly bonded with their sons, Gideon and Spencer. ""We were best friends,"" Griffin said. ""We'd run around, we did mischievous things and fun things. It was a good time."" He lived with the family as a foster child for four years, until he was 13. Then, just two months shy of being adopted by them, it all fell apart. Griffin said he wanted to be treated like a ""real"" son: He wanted to be disciplined like the couple's other sons. He wanted to be spanked, he said. So he innocently told a social worker that was what was going to happen. The social worker then told her superiors, and soon Griffin was about to be removed from the household, he said. Family ripped apart . One day, foster care officials took Griffin away, saying he could not live with Godbold's family anymore. ""You can't spank foster children. Maurice very much wanted that,"" Godbold said. ""We wanted him to feel like the rest of our kids. And there was a difference of opinion with some of the (child welfare) supervisors."" Godbold said she fought to keep Griffin and was told she could lose her biological children, too. CNN contacted the state agency responsible for the case, but its officials would not comment because it's still considered a juvenile matter. So Godbold had to let go. And as time moved on, Griffin says, he lost touch with what he felt was his only family. ""It was just an emptiness,"" he said. ""I couldn't talk to anybody about it because nobody was there. I couldn't call somebody; there was just a void in me."" Griffin said that he acted out every chance he got in hopes the state would reunite him with the people he considered to be family. He bounced from one foster home to another, never finding what he lost. ""I didn't let anybody get close to me again,"" Griffin said, holding back tears. ""I hurt a lot of people. It was a rough road."" Searching for each other . Despite several obstacles, Griffin and Godbold never stopped searching for one another. Godbold's husband died in 1998. She remarried and changed her last name, and moved. But six years ago, Godbold found Griffin on social media. They communicated online and then one day she called him. ""She said, 'hey baby,' and I said I got to call you back,"" Griffin said, trying to explain how overwhelmed he was by the reunion. As she entered the courtroom Friday, Godbold harbored fear that a surprise would halt the proceeding. ""I was actually really nervous before walking in, even though signing on the line was a formality,"" Godbold said. ""I thought something might happen to keep it from becoming official today."" Griffin is an example of triumph in foster care. ""I'm a living example of it, that I have been through it,"" Griffin said. ""I just never stopped. It will all work out."" CNN's Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","Maurice Griffin, 32, is finally able to call her ""mom"" legally .

"(CNN) -- Disgraced football legend O.J. Simpson is scheduled to return to a Las Vegas courtroom Monday in a bid to get his robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions thrown out. The one-time Heisman Trophy winner and Buffalo Bills halfback is more than four years into a 33-year prison term and is asking for a new trial. In court papers, he's arguing that bad legal advice led to his arrest and conviction in a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers. Simpson not only accuses his old lawyer, Yale Galanter, of having a conflict of interest and of failing to mount an effective defense in his trial. He also says Galanter told him before that confrontation that he was within his rights to take back property he believed had been stolen from him, ""so long as there would be no trespass and no physical force used against the persons with the property."" Simpson, 65, was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station hotel and casino and using threats, guns and force to take back the items from the two dealers. ""Simpson also contends that Galanter did not advise Simpson that carrying out the plan could subject him to criminal charges, regardless of the ownership of the property,"" his new lawyers wrote in seeking a new trial. Simpson also blames Galanter for preventing him from testifying in his own defense. Without putting him on the stand, ""There was no evidence presented to adequately challenge the state's evidence of criminal intent and knowledge of the guns or the bad character evidence to which the jury was exposed,"" his appeal states. The Nevada Supreme Court already upheld his conviction in 2010. Prosecutors have called the new attempt to reverse his conviction ""without merit,"" and Galanter is quoted in court papers as telling the judge in the original trial that he spoke to Simpson only after the confrontation. ""Other than Simpson's bare allegations, the record does not support any conflict of interest,"" prosecutors wrote in response to Simpson's claims. Galanter could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday. Simpson's October 2008 conviction came on the anniversary of his famous acquittal on murder charges in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Though cleared of criminal charges, a civil jury later slapped him with a $33 million wrongful-death judgment, and lawyers for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued his assets. His current sentence leaves him eligible for parole in 2017.

"(CNN) -- Hugo Chavez was always a leader with one eye fixed on his own place in history. In his frequent bombastic moments, the late Venezuelan president liked to imagine himself still in power in 2021, the bicentenary of his nation's independence, and as a latter-day Simon Bolivar, the Caracas-born soldier-statesman who liberated much of South America from Spanish rule and remains one of the continent's most revered sons. Some saw in Chavez's overseeing of the reinterment of Bolivar's remains in a grandiose new mausoleum -- perhaps with his own fading health in mind -- an attempt to forge that connection in monumental form. Hugo Chavez, influential leader with mixed record, dies at 58 . Yet, it's only now, with Chavez's premature death Tuesday at age 58, that we can begin to assess the legacy of one of the early 21st century's most politically gifted but divisive figures and his self-styled ""Bolivarian Revolution."" Having once served time in jail for leading a failed coup, Chavez perhaps made an unlikely convert to democracy. Yet, through a blaze of landslide elections and referenda, he placed his fortunes in the hands of the poor and the marginalized, demanding their votes as a first step towards building a new political order that would work in their interests. Chavez's initial 1998 election victory was hailed by the vote observers of the U.S.-based Carter Center as ""a true demonstration of democracy at work"" and ""a peaceful revolution through the ballot box."" In that year, Chavez won 56% of the vote on a 65% turnout. When he earned re-election in 2006, his support had swelled to almost 63% on a near-75% turnout -- the high watermark of his electoral fortunes. Between the two, Chavez defied an attempted coup in 2002 when hundreds of thousands of his supporters poured down from the hillside barrios of Caracas in protest, and a 2004 opposition-orchestrated referendum on his leadership made possible by the constitution introduced by Chavez himself in 1999. Chavez leaves a revolutionary legacy . ""A strange dictator, this Hugo Chavez,"" wrote Uruguayan author Eduardo Galeano at the time of that referendum. Galeano is the author of a leading dependency theory interpretation of Latin American history, ""The Open Veins of Latin America,"" that Chavez gave to U.S. President Barack Obama as a present after he won election. ""This tyrant invented by the mass media, this fearsome demon, has just given a tremendous vitamin-injection to democracy, which, both in Latin America and elsewhere, has become rickety and enfeebled,"" Galeano wrote of Chavez. Once in power, Chavez diverted revenues from Venezuela's oil industry into a series of healthcare, education and anti-poverty initiatives known as misiones, opening subsidized supermarkets and clinics -- many staffed by Cuban medics -- in the country's poorest communities. Between 1998 and 2006 the percentage of Venezuelans living below the poverty line fell from 50.4% to 36.3%, according to statistics from the World Bank's Databank. Infant mortality fell from 20.3 per thousand births when Chavez came to power to 12.9 by 2011, according to the same source. Education also became more accessible, with the number of children enrolled in secondary education rising from 48% in 1999 to 72% in 2010, according to UNESCO figures. Visiting Caracas ahead of the 2006 election, I met a friend who had recently graduated from a newly established public university which charged its students just 300 bolivars a term, at the time the equivalent of about 15 cents. Previously, he explained, students in higher education had to pay about 1 million bolivars a month to go to a private university. As we walked, he pointed out a stall selling orange juice for 500 bolivars a glass. ""Look at that,"" said my friend, ""education under Chavez is cheaper than orange juice."" iReport: Share your thoughts on the death of the Venezuelan president . Yet it will be for his interventions on the world stage that Chavez will be remembered beyond his homeland. Outspoken and often wildly undiplomatic, Chavez thrived on the intransigence and widespread international unpopularity of the George W. Bush-era White House, never more so than when he referred to his then-US counterpart as ""the devil"" in addressing the U.N. General Assembly in 2006. In Latin America, he provided inspiration for the rise of a generation of leftist leaders, notably Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and breathed fresh life -- and oil supplies -- into Cuba's anemic revolution. Others in Brazil and Argentina benefited from the renewed sense of regional confidence and solidarity that Chavez brought to the table. He also had a deft appreciation of the mischievous power of gesture politics, sending ""humanitarian aid"" in the form of discounted fuel to one of the most deprived areas of New York's Bronx in 2005, and signing a gas deal with London in 2007 that funded cut-price bus fares for a quarter of a million of the British capital's poorest residents. In the more nuanced Obama era, Chavez cut a less assured and less influential figure, particularly as his health problems forced him to step back from the limelight. His longstanding willingness to seek common cause with any regime also at odds with the West -- Iran, Syria and Belarus among them -- also came with considerable cost for his credibility, most notably in his enduring loyalty to late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The world reacts . At home, too, Chavez's scorecard remained blotted by the chronic failure to tackle the violent crime that make Caracas one of the world's most dangerous cities, by complaints about press freedom and economic mismanagement, and by the gradual blurring of elements of grassroots participatory democracy with a less savory streak of populist authoritarianism. Ultimately though, any judgment of Chavez's merits and failings will largely come down to political taste, with enough evidence to make for compelling argument on both sides. What is not in question is the formidable force of personality and political skill that enabled him to unite and hold together a broad leftist alliance always bubbling below the surface with ideological idiosyncrasies and internal divisions, and of the deeply personal bond of loyalty that Chavez commanded among the millions who made up his red T-shirted chavista power base. Whether that coalition holds together in the absence of the charismatic individual that forged it, and what replaces it if it fractures, may be the fundamental question that shapes Venezuela's post-Chavez future.

"(CNN) -- Actor Sean Penn, a friend of Bolivian President Evo Morales, nonetheless angered the South American country's government after his call for the release of a U.S. businessman who has been imprisoned since 2011. Penn, known for his chumminess with Latin America's leftist leaders, is also an advocate for Brooklyn flooring contractor Jacob Ostreicher, whose supporters say has spent two years detained in Bolivia without evidence. At a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting Monday, Penn asked U.S. lawmakers to pressure the sponsors of the off-road Dakar Rally to cancel its planned 2014 route through Bolivia if Ostreicher is not freed. ""The Dakar Rally, one of the world's most prominent displays of freedom and tenacity of the human spirit, will be parading through Bolivia even as thousands of prisoners like Mr. Ostreicher sit in feces-filled cells, forgotten behind locked walls,"" Penn said. On Tuesday, Bolivia's minister of culture shot back. ""The remarks by Mr. Penn are his worst acting in all of his career,"" Pablo Groux said, according to the state-run ABI news agency. ""The remark is offensive to the Bolivian people, totally out of context and lacking any understanding."" The minister said the actor's comments harkened back to a time when the United States exerted heavy influence in Latin America. ""Those days are long gone,"" Groux said. The rebuke from the Bolivian official is notable coming from a government that Penn has been friendly with. During his testimony before the subcommittee, Penn said that he does not blame Morales for Ostreicher's situation, but endemic corruption in the judiciary. Penn said that he met with Morales last year, with evidence supporting Ostreicher's innocence, and that ""these findings were received by the president with tremendous personal and human grief."" Ostreicher is under house arrest after spending 18 months in a notorious prison while his case crawled in the overburdened Bolivian judicial system. He was arrested in June 2011 on suspicion of money laundering tied to a rice-growing operation, and he languished in prison without formal charges. He maintained that corrupt officials had trumped up the case, and last year, six government officials were arrested for allegedly extorting and stealing from Ostreicher. But the case against him has not been dropped. READ MORE: American on hunger strike after 11 months in Bolivian prison .

"(CNN) -- Soraya Bahgat, a Cairo-based HR executive and postgraduate student, was on her way to join Tahrir Square protests on November 25 when an unwelcome thought stopped her in her tracks. Mobs in the square had sexually assaulted women protesters there a week earlier, and reports of such incidents had become common enough for her to fear a repeat occurrence. ""A panic attack gripped me and prevented me from going because I thought no woman should go through this,"" said the 29-year-old. ""It was almost two years since the Lara Logan incident,"" she said, referring to the harrowing sexual attack on the CBS correspondent by a mob in Tahrir Square. ""I didn't understand what else we needed before collective action was taken to prevent these assaults. I felt that it was time to step up and do something about it."" Instead of going to Tahrir -- where, according to local reports, three women were sexually assaulted among the crowds that day -- she took to Twitter and started an account, Tahrir Bodyguard, encouraging a ""collective effort to promote the safety of women protesters."" The response, she said, was ""overwhelming."" Today Tahrir Bodyguard has a database of 200 volunteers, who patrol the square during mass demonstrations, recognizable in high-visibility helmets and vests, intervening to halt the attacks on women that have blighted Egypt's revolution and its aftermath. In a recent mass demonstration on January 25, for example, 25 sexual assaults were reported on women in the square. Tahrir Bodyguard intervened to rescue the victims of 10 attacks. Read also: Lebanese women take on judges who call rape a ""marital right"" While the group consisted of men and women, Bahgat said it was generally men who intervened when an assault was detected, to prevent women bodyguards from being sexually assaulted themselves. The group also organizes free self-defense classes for women. Bahgat described Tahrir Bodyguard as ""a story of what an individual with a computer and a Twitter account can start,"" said Bahgat. ""It gives me faith when I see these young boys and knowing they're going to be potentially hurt to protect a woman and save her from sexual assault."" One of the men involved in the group is 27-year-old petroleum company employee Mark Beshara, who has patrolled Tahrir on seven occasions, intervening to stop 15 assaults and being injured in the process. He became involved in the group after being haunted by the memory of witnessing men in the crowd assaulting a woman in the square in November. ""It was very noisy and about 50 or 60 people were surrounding something. At first I thought they were catching a thief or there was a fight,"" he told CNN. ""Then someone told me 'There's a poor girl in there'."" The size of the crowd made it impossible to intervene alone, he said. ""On my own I can't help at all. If I was in a team I would be able to help her."" Read also: The Yemeni ""dictionary men"" recall the day Muhammad Ali came to town . When he heard of Tahrir Bodyguard, he didn't hesitate to become involved. The group has quickly learned what works in breaking up the assaults, he said. When trying to help a woman escape, he said, ""the most important thing is you have to get her trust."" ""She's in a hysterical state, standing there in cut clothes, and being harmed. First you have to tell her several times your name and that you're there to protect her."" Recounting a recent intervention by his group, he said the woman was too traumatized and disoriented by what was occurring to register the group's presence. ""I looked her in the eyes and said 'I'm your only chance to get out of this crowd.' Then I turned around and gave her my back to climb on to. When I felt her hands were catching, I told the crew, 'Let's move.'"" Sexual harassment is a longstanding problem in Egypt, said Bahgat. According to a 2008 survey of 1,010 women conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women's rights, 83% of Egyptian women and 98% of foreign women there have been sexually harassed. Activists have developed a system to track and map incidents of harassment through mobile phones, in an effort to challenge the social acceptability of harassment. But Bahgat said the mob assaults of women that had been occurring during protests since the revolution, some of which have reportedly included bladed weapons, were something ""entirely new."" Read also: Tackling racism in Lebanon . Exactly why the assaults were happening was ""the billion dollar question,"" she said. Many, like Beshara, are of the opinion that the assaults are likely premeditated and politically motivated to discredit protesters and scare off women from joining the demonstrations. But Bahgat said her focus was not speculating on the causes of the attacks, but stopping them. ""We focus on the fact we have a disease we need to cure."" She said the group's efforts and media attention seemed to be raising awareness of the problem and helping to change attitudes towards women. ""It takes a long time though,"" she said. ""Obviously a person who thinks this is okay, this isn't something they just decided to do today."" ""But they definitely realize now that there are people who will stand up against what they are doing, there are people who will do everything necessary to rescue women from this horror."" Many Egyptians were worried the assaults were casting their country in a bad light, she said. ""But the ones behind these attacks are not the true Egyptians,"" she said. ""The true Egyptian man is the man who took off his traditional jellabeya to give it to a girl who had just been assaulted and was stripped naked. The true Egyptians are the men who volunteer with us and get emotionally involved in getting women out of these situations.""","Tahrir Bodyguard is a group dedicated to preventing assaults on women in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- A line drive struck Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Alex Cobb flush in the head Saturday afternoon, sending him sprawling to the ground and eventually to a Florida hospital. The incident occurred during the fifth inning of the Rays' home game with the Kansas City Royals at Tropicana Field. Video shows Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer hitting a pitch right back up the middle -- hitting Cobb on the right ear, Tampa Bay explained in a tweet. The 25-year-old Cobb immediately clutched his head and fell to the ground as the ball careened back to Rays catcher Jose Lobaton, who proceeded to throw Hosmer out at first base. Cobb was later taken off the field on a stretcher and taken to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg. ""He remained conscious the entire time,"" the Tampa Bay franchise said on Twitter. A few hours later -- after the Rays wrapped up a 5-3 win -- the team tweeted about Cobb's condition. ""Alex Cobb was diagnosed with a mild concussion,"" the club said. ""All tests came back normal."" According to the Rays' website, Cobb -- a righthander in his third season in the majors -- has a 2.95 ERA in 12 starts this year. He's notched 73 strikeouts, versus 20 walks, and held opposing batters to a .233 average.","NEW: Cobb had mild concussion, tests came back normal, team says .

"Granbury, Texas (CNN) -- Scores of people stood outside a north Texas church Saturday morning, waiting to be escorted to their neighborhood for the first time since tornadoes devastated it three days earlier. They weren't going to like what they were about to see, Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds told reporters. ""This is going to be a traumatic day for the residents,"" Deeds said. "" ... We have clergy (going to the neighborhood with the residents) because it's going to be a traumatic time when they see their property."" At least 16 tornadoes hit Texas on Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Six people were killed in the Rancho Brazos neighborhood of Granbury, about 30 miles southwest of Fort Worth. A survey team for the National Weather Service concluded that the tornado that descended on this neighborhood was an EF4 -- the second-most severe classification on a scale of zero to five. Three people were taken to a nearby hospital, and 13 others were taken to hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, authorities have said. Of the 110 houses that stood in Rancho Brazos on Wednesday afternoon, 58 were damaged or destroyed, said Mario Flores, director of disaster-response field operations for Habitat for Humanity, which built 61 homes there. The neighborhood's estimated 250-300 residents were prohibited from returning until Saturday, because authorities needed to clear debris, Deeds said. Starting Saturday, residents would be able to visit the site on a limited basis -- from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. -- to collect belongings. With no water or electric service in the neighborhood, and generally unsafe conditions, no one is allowed yet to resume living there, even in undamaged buildings, Deeds said. ""We've got people on scene that are going to help them box things up and get some valuables out of there that they need today,"" Deeds said. How to help or find help . The Rancho Brazos residents had to obtain permits before being escorted to the neighborhood. Among those waiting in line was a 45-year-old woman who says she and her five children were temporarily trapped in the rubble of their home.

They said that they are staying with friends, and have only the clothes on their backs. ""Our neighborhood looked like it had gone through a terrorist attack,"" the woman said.

"(CNN) -- They call her the Queen of the Pacific. Sandra Avila Beltran's name stands out on the list of accused leaders of Mexico's male-dominated drug trade. The 52-year-old's life is the subject of a best-selling book and a popular ballad. And she made headlines two years ago when Mexican authorities said they were investigating a tip that she had received Botox treatments in prison. This week Avila -- one of the most well-known women accused of ties with Mexico's drug trade -- pleaded guilty in a Florida court to a charge connected to a cocaine trafficking case. She faces up to 15 years in U.S. prison after pleading guilty to being an accessory after the fact, according to an agreement filed in federal court this week. A sentencing hearing in the case is scheduled for July 25. ""It is a fair resolution in light of the actual circumstances. ... she is happy with the results and hopes to be able to reunite with her family soon,"" attorney Stephen Ralls told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Avila was first arrested in Mexico City on September 28, 2007, smiling before cameras as authorities trumpeted her detention. Mexico's case against her drew widespread attention as it made its way through the nation's courts. In 2011, authorities in Mexico City said they were investigating a tip that prison medical personnel had allowed a doctor to give Avila a Botox injection, an accusation that Avila denied, according to Notimex. Authorities extradited her last year to the United States, where she was accused of conspiring to smuggle cocaine along with Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez, a Colombian national who was also known as ""The Tiger."" Avila denied the charges. And despite the high-profile accusations against her, authorities have not convicted Avila of any drug-trafficking crimes. A Mexican judge convicted her on money laundering charges but ruled that Mexican prosecutors hadn't provided enough evidence to convict her of drug trafficking. And U.S. prosecutors dropped the cocaine trafficking conspiracy charge against her as part of this week's plea deal. A document signed by Avila as part of the plea agreement in U.S. federal court says she provided ""financial assistance for travel, lodging and other expenses"" to Espinosa from 2002 to 2004 ""with the intention of preventing or hindering his arrest for his drug trafficking crimes."" Prosecutors have said Avila was once a key drug trafficking link between Colombia and Mexico. And a 2008 U.S. Congressional Research Service report described her as ""a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel who was instrumental"" in building ties with Colombian traffickers. A popular ballad about her sung by the band Los Tigres del Norte, titled ""The Queen of Queens,"" describes her 2007 arrest alongside Espinosa. ""The more beautiful the rose,"" one line in the song says, ""the sharper the thorns."" A U.S. judge sentenced Espinosa to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to a cocaine distribution conspiracy charge in 2009. In an interview with Anderson Cooper that aired on ""60 Minutes"" and CNN that year, Avila denied the charges against her and blamed Mexico's government for allowing drug trafficking to flourish. ""In Mexico there's a lot of corruption, a lot. Large shipments of drugs can come into the Mexican ports or airports without the authorities knowing about it. It's obvious and logical,"" she said. ""The government has to be involved in everything that is corrupt.""

"(CNN) -- Major international hotel chains are increasingly rolling out thousands of new rooms in Africa's business hotspots, keen to expand their footprint on the continent's burgeoning economies. From Lagos and Kigali to Nairobi and Johannesburg, the world's best known hoteliers are targeting Africa's growing urban centers to benefit from a rising number of business travelers and a huge undersupply in available rooms. ""There's a growing demand in those capital cities because they are the centers of business, of government and of commerce -- all of which have hospitality needs,"" says Patrick Fitzgibbon, senior vice president of development for Hilton Worldwide, Europe and Africa. ""We have a very bullish feel for these markets and we are very excited about the opportunity Africa presents,"" he adds. ""I think that for the next 20 years we are going to have our hands full with opportunity."" 'World woken up to Africa' Last month, the International Monetary Fund said that sub-Saharan Africa's economy is expected to expand by 5.6% in 2013 and 6.1% next year, outpacing the global average of 3.3% and 4% in accordance. Andrew McLachlan, Carlson Rezidor Vice President for Africa and Indian Ocean Islands, says it is Africa's potential to offset the sluggishness in more developed markets that's appealing to global players. ""What has really happened is that post the economic crash in 2008/2009, the rest of the world has really woken up to Africa,"" says McLachlan. ""There's been such good news coming out of Africa from a GDP growth point of view; better telecommunications; improved security; political stability; and improved airlift,"" he adds. ""It's really become a sort of new scramble back into Africa."" Read this: Drug makers eye Africa's potential . Meanwhile, international tourism arrivals in the continent grew by 6% last year to reach a record 52 million, according to data by the World Tourism Organization. And whilst both international and intra-regional travel are on the up, partly thanks to Africa's natural resources boom, a shortage of rooms is prompting hoteliers to turn their attention to a continent ignored for decades. Business travel . According to a recent survey by Lagos-based consultancy W Hospitality Group, some 40,000 new rooms in 207 hotels are planned in the continent's under-served cities, up almost one third compared to 2011. Hilton, which operates nearly 11,000 rooms in 37 properties in Africa, says it has some 5,200 rooms and 17 hotels in the pipeline across the continent. Carlson Rezidor, which recently opened a Radisson Blu in Port Harcourt, its eighth hotel in Nigeria and 49th in the continent, is targeting 12 new hotel deals this year. French group Accor, owner of the Novotel and Ibis brands, has some 5,000 rooms in the pipeline, according to the W Hospitality survey. ""The vast majority of those hotels are business-oriented,"" explains Trevor Ward, managing director of W Hospitality. ""If you look at where those hotel chains are primarily going, it's the capital cities or the major commercial cities of Africa where the business traveler is going,"" he adds. Yet, it's not only the brands at the higher ends of the market that are keen to tap Africa's promise. In late March, pan-African conglomerate Lonrho teamed up with Stelios Haji-Ioannou's easyGroup to open their first Africa-based low budget hotel in Johannesburg's central business district. Read this: Low-cost airline in Africa by easyJet founder . Ewan Cameron, chief executive of Lonrho Hotels, says the company plans to roll out 50 easyHotel units by 2016 in the continent's high-growth destinations to cater to the needs of African business travelers. ""What's driving us is genuine trade and business in the continent,"" explains Cameron. ""If you're going to a city center like Nairobi, we want to be where the taxi rank is; where the market is -- unlike the competition who want to be, if you like, in the beautiful parts of the city,"" he adds. ""We will sacrifice this for economic drivers -- we want the trade and we want to be where you want to do business."" 'Real challenges' Still, international hoteliers have to overcome several infrastructure and logistics obstacles in their bid to plant their flags across the continent. Cameron says hotels often have to be self-sustained, depending on satellite connectivity for fast wi-fi and generators for back up power, as well as having to provide their own clean water. ""These are real challenges for us today,"" he says. Analysts also say that companies can face big delays during the construction process due to poor workmanship and a shortage of professional skills. Bureaucracy and corruption can often be a problem too, especially when it comes to importing materials that are not available locally. Quick returns . Yet, despite these hurdles, hotel groups remain very positive about their future in Africa as the continued rise in demand and undersupply in hotel rooms offer strong occupancy rates and high profitability margins in short periods of time. ""These challenges we face, we quickly forget about them the day the hotel opens,"" says McLachlan. ""Normally, we would say the hotel takes 1,000 days from the day it opens to stabilize but in a lot of these African markets it can take a couple of months to stabilize because of the high demand for hotels."" Fitzgibbon agrees. ""It's fascinating when you look at the change and opportunity on the continent and just what it represents,"" he says.","International hotel groups plan 40,000 rooms across Africa, according to a survey .

"(CNN) -- Intense black smoke billowing from the flames of an oil fire blocks out the sun. A teenage mom with a one-day-old baby seeks shelter in a dimly-lit basement from a barrage of missiles and shells. Incoming fire smashes through the wall of a house being used as an unofficial media center in Homs, the city that is the focus of anti-regime protests and Syrian efforts to silence them. The horror of enduring the all-out assault by the Syrian military is brought vividly to life in a CNN documentary airing this weekend. With the help of local activists, a CNN crew was smuggled into Homs, moving from house to house as the Syrian army fired missiles and tank shells. For more than a year President Bashar al-Assad's military had used brutal force to put down the uprising. Across Syria, protesters demanded change -- chanting ""down with the regime"" but it was Homs -- and especially the neighborhood of Baba Amr -- that became the epicenter. Even CNN correspondent Arwa Damon, with her vast experience of reporting from war zones, had reservations about the high-risk job. She said: ""I actually wrote a letter home the first time, to my family. And I went to see some very close friends as well, just in case."" She was joined by Neil Hallsworth, a veteran cameraman who has worked in Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel, and Tim Crockett, a former special forces officer to handle security and who would also become an unofficial stills photographer. Just getting into Homs was an ordeal that took five days for what would normally be a two-hour drive. Damon said: ""It involves a fairly elaborate process of being moved through farmlands, back roads, trying to avoid the government, ending up in various safe houses. And at every single leg, every single stop, you have a different person who's responsible to move you on to the next one, someone who knows the details of the lay of the land around you to ensure that they can actually get you through from one point to another."" For the thousands trapped in Baba Amr, the route was their only lifeline and CNN agreed to keep it secret. In Homs, there was no frontline meaning there was also nowhere that could be called safe. Damon said: ""It [seems] mostly deserted, most of the buildings have sustained some sort of damage. And then you'll see a kid peek their head out from a doorway, or you'll see a man walking in the street carrying an A.K."" Some of the most constant fire has been on Baba Amr where people are killed or wounded daily, and where two doctors -- and one of those was a dentist -- are fighting against the odds to help the casualties. In a makeshift clinic there was a man with head injuries from shrapnel, another whose leg injury was most likely going to lead to an amputation. The medics say the Syrian military regards the clinic as a target so they have set up in numerous temporary houses around Baba Amr, each with patients and with the doctors moving between them. But snipers posted on rooftops above the rubble-littered streets made even the shortest of trips treacherous. Mosques put out messages before the bombardment started, telling people to not live on the upper floors, to try to stay away from windows, and to try to find protective rooms, inside their homes. In basements used as bunkers, civilians pray the next bomb will miss their home and their loved ones. In one of these bunkers, the CNN crew met a teenager who had given birth the day before. Her daughter Fatimah was the face of innocence amid the hell of Homs. Her father does not know she's been born. He left the shelter to get supplies a month ago and has not made it back. And her gran trembled as she explained how two other relatives died. Virtually everyone in the shelter -- about 300 people -- had similar horrific stories of violent death. And it was easy to learn how death could come arbitrarily and suddenly in Homs and how survival was as much luck as anything else. Working in a home that had become an unofficial media center for the few Western journalists that have made it into Homs, a rocket slammed into the building just two floors up. Also in Baba Amr was Sunday Times correspondent Marie Colvin who would be killed alongside French photographer Remi Ochlik just a few days later. Throughout Baba Amr, word was spreading that a ground offensive by the Syrian military was imminent. And for CNN it was becoming too dangerous to let Damon, Hallsworth and Crockett stay. Damon said: ""It is fundamentally unfair that we live in a world where we can go film this, report on it, and leave, knowing that the people we've left behind's suffering is going to continue. Feeling as if we should've done more, we could've done more."" Hundreds of civilians are believed to have died in the siege of Baba Amr. At least three activists involved in getting video out of Baba Amr have been killed. At the end of February, the Syrian military broke the resistance of Baba Amr. Opposition activists claim the military carried out summary executions. Regime forces continue to bombard other areas that oppose Assad's rule.","CNN crew explains how they were smuggled into Homs, Syria, to witness a brutal crackdown on regime opponents .

"(CNN) -- Two International Space Station crew members will head out Saturday morning for a spacewalk to address an ammonia leak in the orbiter's cooling system, an emergency that forced NASA officials to work round-the-clock to hatch a plan. First detected early Thursday morning, the leak was causing ammonia to enter space -- which could be seen in the form of ""flakes of snow"" -- at a rate of 5 pounds per day, said Mike Suffredini, NASA's space station program manager. Ammonia is used to cool each of the solar arrays that provide electricity to station systems. The discovery spurred teams at NASA, over a busy 24-hour stretch, to go into ""a full-court press to understand what the failure is"" and how to address it, NASA flight director Norm Knight said at a Friday news conference. The space station's six-man crew is in ""good spirits"" in anticipation of the spacewalk, added Knight, a sentiment echoed by a tweet Friday afternoon by its commander. ""This type of event is what the years of training were for,"" wrote Cmdr. Chris Hadfield of Canada. ""A happy, busy crew, working hard, loving life in space."" Hours earlier, Hadfield wrote on Twitter that his crew was planning for a Saturday spacewalk to be conducted by NASA astronauts Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn. Hadfield -- who is with the Canadian Space Agency -- spent Friday preparing for his role as choreographer of the spacewalk, while Cassidy and Marshburn worked in an airlock to check out the spacesuits they will wear in space, among other tasks. Cassidy and Marshburn have done two spacewalks apiece, working together both times in 2009 while on a space shuttle Endeavour mission to the space station. ""Since the crew is prepared and our ops team is ready to go, we're going to try to get them outside,"" said Suffredini. Scheduled to wake up at 2 a.m. ET, the astronauts will begin their formal preparations about 1 hour and 15 minutes later, Knight said. A hatch will open around 8:15 a.m., sometime after which Cassidy and Marshburn will start moving along a truss the 150 feet out to the site of the leak on the space station's U.S. segment. Once there, Knight explained, the astronauts will do a ""visual inspection"" of the leak -- the location of which space agency officials have ""narrowed down"" thanks to imagery, though Suffredini notes any cracks may be ""very, very small."" They will also check and possibly replace a pump controller box on the truss, which NASA explains is ""the oldest component of the station's backbone."" The entire walk is expected to take about 6Â½ hours. The space station's crew, which also includes three Russian cosmonauts, is not in danger from the leak, NASA has said. Moreover, the agency has said the rest of the orbiter is otherwise operating normally. The leak is in a cooling loop in a solar array that has leaked before. NASA said crew members tried to fix a leak in November. It's unclear whether this is the same leak or a new one. The ammonia coolant for the power channel, one of eight used to supply electricity to the station, is likely to run out by late Friday morning and it will be shut down, NASA said.

"(CNN) -- An emergency responder to last month's deadly Texas fertilizer plant explosion will plead not guilty to the charge of having possessed materials for a pipe bomb, his lawyer said Saturday. Bryce Reed will enter that plea on Wednesday at a federal court hearing, lawyer Jonathan Sibley said. ""We have not been able to obtain specific information about the extent of the allegations, but Mr. Reed anxiously awaits his day in court and his opportunity to address these allegations,"" Sibley said in a statement. Authorities said Friday they were launching a criminal investigation into last month's blast in the town of West, but have not said whether Reed's arrest is connected. Local sheriff's deputies were called on Tuesday to a residence where they found components for a pipe bomb, according to a criminal complaint affidavit. The officers determined that Reed had given the materials to the resident of that home last month, the complaint says. Authorities rule out some potential causes of Texas blast . Among the materials found were a galvanized metal pipe, a fuse, coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders, it adds. Reed, who was arrested early Friday, is charged with possession of a destructive device. ""At this time authorities will not speculate whether the possession of the unregistered destructive device has any connection to the West fertilizer plant explosion,"" the U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Texas said in a release. But Sibley addressed ""speculation"" that the allegation was related to the April 17 incident, which killed 14 in the town of West. ""Let me be very clear,"" the defense lawyer said in the statement. ""Mr. Reed had no involvement whatsoever in the explosion at the West, Texas fertilizer plant."" Reed himself lost friends and family in the disaster ""and remains resolute in his desire to assist in the rebuilding of his community,"" Sibley said, cautioning against any rush to judgment. If convicted, Reed would face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Reed spoke last month at a memorial for the victims at Baylor University. Watch paramedic's CNN interview . The arrest details came as authorities said they were conducting a criminal investigation into the fire and explosion. ""This disaster has severely impacted the community of West, and we want to ensure that no stone goes unturned and that all the facts related to this incident are uncovered,"" DPS Director Steven McCraw said. On Monday, the state fire marshal's office said it had ruled out weather, other natural causes, anhydrous ammonium and ammonium nitrate in a rail car as possible causes. Texas blast victims, in their families' words . The fire began in the fertilizer and seed building; the blast happened about 20 minutes after the first report of a fire at the fertilizer facility. It registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake and could be felt 50 miles away. The explosion damaged numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school, all of which had been built within a few hundred feet of the plant. West is about 70 miles south-southwest of Dallas. At least 60 investigators have been on site each day and have conducted 411 interviews in trying to determine how the fire started and what caused the explosion. West Fertilizer Co., which operated the facility, had been cited by federal regulators twice since 2006. In 2012, the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer $5,250 for storing anhydrous ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning labels. The agency had originally recommended a $10,000 penalty, but reduced it after the company took corrective action. In 2006, the EPA fined the company $2,300 and told the owners to correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time. That same year, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated a complaint that the area around the plant smelled of ammonia.

"(CNN) -- The sheriff of a small Virginia county, where residents and officials alike had expressed dismay over the burial of a Boston bombing suspect within their midst, said Saturday that it appears ""all paperwork is in order at this point,"" suggesting the interment was legal and nothing can be done about it. The previous day, when news came out that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been buried in Caroline County, local officials said they would review the matter to make sure all protocols were followed. And if they weren't, county board of supervisors chairman Floyd Thomas said Friday, ""We would look into undoing what happened."" Caroline County Sheriff Tony Lippa said, in a statement Saturday, that he and David Storke -- the mayor of Bowling Green, Virginia, who also owns a funeral home -- spent Friday night reviewing the case. That includes looking at Tsarnaev's death certificate, burial permit official disposition, a removal or transportation permit from Massachusetts and deeds recorded at the Caroline County Circuit Court. Those checks did not turn up anything to indicate the burial was done improperly. In Caroline County, local officials do not need to be consulted or have to approve the burial of a person on county land in advance. Source: Russia withheld details about Tsarnaev . ""Like the rest of America, the citizens of this county were outraged by the Boston Marathon bombings. We too mourned the loss of life, prayed for the survivors and offered our support,"" Lippa said. ""Unfortunately, we now find ourselves forever connected to this tragedy in the most unsavory way, as the final resting place of one of the alleged terrorists."" As Thomas pointed out, Tamerlan Tsarnaev had ""no ties to Caroline County."" His body ended up there nearly a month after he died following a shootout with police just outside Boston, which took place days after the bombing. Most recently, his body was in a funeral home in Worcester, Massachusetts, where protesters appeared frequently outside amid calls for him to be sent back to where his parents live in southern Russia. That was until a Virginia woman named Martha Mullen came into the picture, reaching out to representatives of her church plus local Muslim, Jewish and Hindu representatives in an effort to find a final resting place for Tsarnaev, according to the Islamic Society of Greater Richmond. Mullen also talked with her local pastor about the moral implications of her spearheading the effort. What did suspected bomber's widow know? ""Jesus tells us, 'Love your enemies,'"" she said, according to the Islamic Society. ""Not to hate them, even after they are dead."" On Thursday morning, Tsarnaev was buried in an unmarked grave in Al-Barzakh Muslim Cemetery in Doswell, Virginia. Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni was a point man in the effort, and he expressed ""outrage"" that Tsarnaev's own parents ""have not been here for their children."" The burial caught people off guard in Caroline County, which has about 30,000 residents. In addition to voicing confusion and disgust, officials expressed concerns that the grave site might become a target for protesters or vandals. A sheriff's deputy was posted there after the news broke Friday. There were no incidents reported that night and into Saturday, according to the county sheriff's office, which added that the cemetery will get ""no more and no less"" protection than any other cemetery.

"KIGALI, Rwanda (CNN) -- As leader of the Tutsi rebels in 1994, Paul Kagame pleaded with the world to stop the Rwandan genocide. Paul Kagame: ""We say every Rwandan has the same opportunity to life ... as the other."" ""All along we thought that's why they were here,"" Kagame said, referring to the U.N. troops sent to monitor a peace agreement between the minority Tutsis and ruling Hutus. But the nations of the world, he said, turned a deaf ear and a blind eye. ""They didn't care. They were totally indifferent. It was just another bloody African situation where just people kill each other and that's it."" After 100 days of fighting between the two ethnic groups, the Tutsi militia defeated Hutu government forces, ending the war and the genocide. But the Hutus'  three-month slaughter of Tutsis left more than 800,000 dead. Today, Kagame is president of Rwanda, and he insists on reconciliation between the warring groups. It was an incredible transformation for both Kagame and his country.  Watch as Kagame discusses Rwanda's past and future » . In the late 1950s and early '60s, Kagame's family and other Tutsis were under siege as Hutu gangs went from village to village, pillaging and killing. The Kagames, including 3-year-old Paul, fled to Uganda. Paul Kagame would spend the next three decades as a refugee. During that time he rose through the ranks to become a senior officer in the Ugandan army. All the while, he and other refugees longed to return home to Rwanda. In 1990, Kagame was attending a training course at Fort Leavenworth in the U.S. state of Kansas when Tutsi rebels invaded Rwanda. After some initial success, the rebel forces were forced to retreat. Among the casualties was their leader, who had been killed on the second day of the attack. When news of the failed invasion reached Kagame, he left the United States, resigned from the Ugandan military and took command of the Tutsi rebel militia. Kagame instilled strict discipline in his growing rebel army. They would launch successful attacks that eventually brought the ruling Hutu government to sign a power-sharing agreement in 1993 known as the Arusha Accords. But the peace agreement was a façade. Hutu extremists had no intention of sharing control of the Rwandan government. And in April 1994, they began their attempt to exterminate the Tutsi population. Kagame's forces resumed their attacks, desperate to save their fellow Tutsis. The Hutu government had far more troops, but Kagame's soldiers had far more discipline. In battle after battle, they were victorious, gaining control of more and more of Rwanda, ultimately declaring victory in July 1994 -- but not before more than 800,000 were dead. Kagame recently sat down with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in his presidential compound to talk about the hope of reconciliation as well as the international community's indifference to the plight of Rwandans during the 1994 genocide. ""The common interests we have for a better future of this country [are] more important than any other interests, especially such interests as of different groups,"" Kagame said. ""And we say every Rwandan has the same opportunity to life, to the sources of this country, as the other.""","Rwandan Paul Kagame spent the first three decades of his life as a refugee .

"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) -- Mark Sanford is heading back to Washington after detours along the Appalachian Trail and Argentina. The former South Carolina governor finished his second term in office three years ago with his political career dead in the water thanks to a well-publicized extra-marital affair and ethics violations. But he came away Tuesday with a victory over Democratic opponent Elizabeth Colbert Busch in the special election for a vacant House seat in the Palmetto State's 1st Congressional District -- the same seat he once held. Here's what we've learned, or better yet, re-learned, from Sanford's victory . 1. Voters give politicians second chances . From the start of his bid for Congress, Sanford was very open on the campaign trail about the affair and made it the subject of his first TV ad. Sanford asked for, and received, political redemption from the voters. ""I want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances but third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth chances, because that is the reality of our shared humanity,"" said Sanford at his victory celebration Tuesday night. ""I am one imperfect man saved by God's grace."" He repeated that theme minutes later at a news conference with reporters. ""I think we're always on the search for redemption and I think this is certainly a degree of political redemption."" Colbert Busch's campaign, as well as two national Democratic groups which contributed money and support to her campaign, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch confronted Sanford about his 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress. And her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using ""tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character."" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the pro-Democrat House Majority PAC, which, combined, spent nearly $900,000 to try and defeat Sanford, also spotlighted the affair in their final ads. But in the end, it wasn't enough. 2. Candidates matter . For all his political baggage, Mark Sanford is a veteran on the campaign trail. And Elizabeth Colbert Busch showed her campaign inexperience at times. ""Sanford may be a flawed candidate but he's a fabulous campaigner,"" said Republican strategist Hogan Gidley, a former executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party. ""Forget the rhetoric or the policy or the delivery -- hand-to-hand, eye-to-eye he's very good and it's impossible to outwork him."" Sanford also seemed to win this election one voter at a time. The candidate appeared to be everywhere in the campaign's closing days. He held nearly 15 events on Monday, with another 10 on Election Day. 3. Turnout matters . We knew Democratic voters were fired up, but the big question concerned Republican voters in a district that the GOP has held for more 30 years. Would they vote even with their reservations about Sanford? The answer appears to be yes. It was a high turnout for a special election. Roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total, according to a CNN analysis of the vote. ""That seems to have helped Sanford,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn't vote for a Democrat. High turnout turns that around: Plenty of Republicans who had misgivings about Sanford came out to vote anyway."" And House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi might be one reason why. Sanford and his campaign repeatedly tied Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections. ""I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending,"" Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week. Two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate. The strategy appears to have paid off. 4. Location, location, location . Macro: The 1st Congressional District is GOP country. Mitt Romney carried the district by 18 percentage points in last November's presidential election. And Rep. Tim Scott was reelected by 27 points before he was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat vacated by Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Even a candidate with serious political baggage like Sanford was able to win. Micro: Sanford won all five counties in the district. He won big where he needed to, in the conservative counties of Berkeley and Dorchester, taking around 60% of the vote. He carried the district's second most populous county, Beaufort, by 6 percentage points. Some Democrats hoped that older voters in that county, which includes Hilton Head, would be turned off by Sanford's affair. Sanford narrowly carried his home base of Charleston County, where the most voters were at stake. That was also Colbert Busch's best hope. 5. Money doesn't always matter . Colbert Busch's campaign outspent Sanford's operation in the closing weeks. And the DCCC and House Majority PAC combined spent around $900,000 to try to defeat Sanford, who received far less support from outside groups. Money matters in campaign politics, but it's just one factor in determining a race.","Disgraced former Gov. Mark Sanford overcame past scandals to win House seat .

"(Health.com) -- Men in their 70s and 80s may be more likely than women of the same age to develop the memory loss and cognitive problems that often herald Alzheimer's disease, a new study has found. In the study, which appears in the journal Neurology, Mayo Clinic researchers examined 1,450 elderly people in Minnesota every 15 months for an average of three and a half years. During that time, 7.2% of the men and 5.7% of the women developed the mental-function problems known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with or without any accompanying memory loss. The findings surprised the researchers because previous studies have suggested that more women than men ultimately go on to develop Alzheimer's and other forms of full-blown dementia. The fact that men appear to have higher rates of MCI but lower rates of dementia may hold important clues for preventing or delaying cognitive decline, the researchers suggest. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . The lead author of the study, Rosebud Roberts, a professor of epidemiology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, says that women with MCI may progress to dementia faster than men, causing them to be under-counted during the MCI phase. But sex-related differences in physiology and brain function may also play a role. MCI isn't necessarily a permanent condition. Roughly one-third of the study participants who received an MCI diagnosis following a battery of tests and interviews subsequently improved to the point that they no longer met the diagnostic criteria at a later checkup. This so-called reversion to normal, which has been seen in other studies, may indicate that in some cases the brain actually repairs some of the damage it incurs -- and this may be where sex differences come into play, says Kenneth Rockwood, M.D., a professor of geriatric medicine at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Health.com: 7 ways to protect your memory . Physical activity, for instance, is believed to benefit men differently than women, says Rockwood, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study but was not involved in the new research. In women, exercise appears to be more likely to prolong life, he says, while in men it's more likely to improve brain function. ""We might be seeing the cognitive benefits of exercise in men"" in the study findings, Rockwood says. ""Women who exercise also get some cognitive benefit, but they appear to get a greater survival benefit."" The findings suggest also that men may be more vulnerable than women to certain risk factors for MCI, says Rhonna Shatz, D.O., director of behavioral neurology at the Henry Ford Health System, in Detroit. Health.com: Memory, mental function begin slipping as early as age 45 . High blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and other known -- and treatable -- risk factors for MCI and dementia tend to be more common in men, which may explain the higher rate of MCI, Shatz says. ""What [the study] tells us is that, particularly in men, there are probably a whole set of factors that we have to consider as particular to their gender or lifestyle, or both, that are impacting them a lot earlier,"" Shatz says. ""We need to take a step back and ask if we are really doing the job we need to control the things we know are modifiable."" Although Roberts and her colleagues didn't investigate risk factors such as high blood pressure, they did take into account other factors that have been shown to affect MCI risk, such as age, educational attainment, and marital status. (People with more education and people who were married had lower rates of MCI than the other study participants -- a pattern that has been observed in previous studies.) Health.com: Staying healthy from head to toe may help ward off dementia . Incorporating these factors into the data helped the researchers rule out the possibility that sex disparities in MCI and dementia rates are due merely to the fact that women tend to live longer, and are therefore more likely than men to live long enough to develop dementia. More research will be needed to confirm the findings, however. Although the new study was thorough and well designed, Shatz says, the definition of MCI remains open to interpretation. A particular doctor or nurse may be more likely to arrive at an MCI diagnosis than another health professional looking at the same patient, which makes it difficult to draw broad conclusions about the prevalence of the condition. ""We don't have good standard markers of what MCI is,"" Shatz says. Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","During study 7.2% of men and 5.7% of women developed mild cognitive impairment .

"Washington (CNN) -- The former head of transportation security said Wednesday he supports a new policy allowing small knives on planes, but said it does not go far enough, and should include instruments such as ""battle axes (and) machetes."" Sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft, former Transportation Security Administration chief Kip Hawley told CNN, and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can harm aircraft. ""In retrospect, I should have done the same thing,"" Hawley said of the rule, which allows passengers to board aircraft with certain small knives, as well as sports equipment such as ice hockey and lacrosse sticks. ""They ought to let everything on that is sharp and pointy. Battle axes, machetes ... bring anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able to commit an act of violence, you will not be able to take over the plane. It is as simple as that,"" he said. ""So my position would be, bravo on the 2.6 inch knife. But why not take it all the way and then really clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs and toxins, which are things that can destroy an airplane. And it would smooth the process, cost less money, and be better security."" Asked if he was using hyperbole in suggesting that battle axes be allowed on planes, Hawley said he was not. Air marshals, flight attendants want TSA to reconsider knife policy . ""I really believe it. What are you going to do when you get on board with a battle ax? And you pull out your battle ax and say I'm taking over the airplane. You may be able to cut one or two people, but pretty soon you would be down in the aisle and the battle ax would be used on you."" And, he pointed out, ""You can commit acts of violence on an aircraft with what is allowed now. With a Coke can, a key, a ruler, and some duct tape, you can make a 12-inch razor-sharp sword. And every eighth-grader would be able to do that."" Hawley headed the TSA from mid-2005 until early 2009, during the George W. Bush administration. During his term, the agency loosened restrictions on some items -- such as cigarette lighters, matches and small scissors -- while imposing limits on liquids and gels because of the August 2006 liquid bomb scare. The TSA's current administrator, John Pistole, was serving as deputy director of the FBI during the 2006 bomb scare, and has also cited the plot as a reason for the emphasis on bombs. ""If undetected, I believe there is a high likelihood the terrorists would have killed hundreds of people that day,"" Pistole says on the TSA blog. ""That's why we limit the amount of liquids you can bring on a plane."" Opinion: Is TSA serious about letting people carry knives? Both Hawley and Pistole have embraced ""risk-based security,"" the concept that the government should use intelligence and best practices to focus on known threats and unknown people. The TSA has expanded its PreCheck program under Pistole, expediting travel for frequent fliers and others who provide information on themselves. Hawley and other security experts say a number of factors -- including strengthened cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers -- has changed the security equation on planes, removing avenues once open to terrorists. Hawley said he is sensitive to concerns by air marshals and flight attendants about the rule changes, noting that they ""would be the people upon whom the wounds would be inflicted."" ""I do understand and respect their opposition, but from a security strategy point of view this is absolutely the right decision,"" he said of the knife rule. ""The air marshals and the flight attendants have legitimate concerns, certainly, for their own safety, but the threat of taking over a plane with a small, sharp instrument is zero,"" Hawley said. ""You cannot necessarily prevent violence on an airplane, but that is not the TSA's mission. TSA's mission is to prevent a successful, catastrophic terrorist attack, and you cannot get a successful, catastrophic terrorist attack with a small knife or a Wiffle ball bat.""","Kip Hawley says sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Dozens of Chinese workers angry over a pay dispute have held their U.S. boss hostage for five days, the American businessman said. Chip Starnes, co-founder and president of Specialty Medical Supplies China, has been trapped in the company's suburban Beijing factory since Friday. He told CNN it's all because of a misunderstanding about layoffs and severance packages. ""I tried to leave a day and a half ago, and there was like 60 or 70 of them here inside every entrance, and every exit was barricaded,"" Starnes said Tuesday from behind the gates of the factory. ""I can't go anywhere."" Starnes was calm but looked haggard, wearing the same blue jeans and a blue shirt that he said he has been wearing since last week. The incident started when the company laid off about 30 workers in its injection molding division. He said he transferred workers to another division, but some workers did not want to move. So the company gave them severance packages. Starnes said the problem came when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages. But workers who spoke to CNN from behind the factory gates gave an entirely different account. Some said they're owed two months' worth of back pay and feared everyone at the plant would be laid off, as they claimed no new materials had entered the factory. Starnes disputed that. ""There are no outstanding balances. There is no reason to be doing this other than bad information,"" he said. ""The wrong information got out. Things snowballed. I am in the process of trying to fix that, but the demands and the amount of money that it is taking to do that puts the company in a bad situation, so there has got to be some compromise."" About four police officers at the scene would not comment on the situation. U.S. embassy officials in Beijing met with Starnes on Monday and confirmed he is safe and is close to reaching an agreement, spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said. He said the executive has access to attorneys. Starnes said the employees haven't caused any physical harm but have disrupted his sleep by banging on doors and windows. He has a cot and is receiving three meals a day, said Les Capella, the U.S president of Specialty Medical Supplies. Capella said the company has offered protesting employees a lesser severance package if they want to leave. But he said the 80 to 100 employees at odds are demanding about $500,000 -- which would bankrupt the company. CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.","The U.S. embassy in Beijing says Starnes is safe and has access to lawyers .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Every time the door bell rings at Aidan Licata's home, the 6-year-old fears the gunman has returned. He worries the man in black fatigues and military-style vest who opened fire Friday on his Sandy Hook Elementary School classroom -- hitting his teacher and his fellow students -- has found him. ""He still hasn't internalized the fact this gunman, this bad guy, is gone,"" the boy's mother, Diane Licata, said. ""He wants to know if there are more bad guys in the world, and I don't know how to answer that for him."" For now, the Licatas have put a sign on the door asking people not to ring the bell. As this south New England town of 27,000 prepares to mourn the 20 children and six adults killed in the school shooting, parents of the youngest survivors are struggling to cope with the aftermath of a massacre that will require many of them to break the news to their child of the death of a teacher or a friend. ""The children eventually will learn about their friends and their teacher, and others that they know. We need to be able to explain to them as best we can,"" Robert Licata, the boy's father, said. Aidan doesn't know that his teacher, Victoria Soto, is among the dead. He also doesn't know some of his friends have been killed. Opinion: Slow down, listen to kids . The morning inside the school, when the gunfire started, Aidan said it sounded like ""falling hammers."" His teacher, Ms. Soto, moved her first grade students to the other side of the room. Moments later, the gunman -- identified by authorities as 20-year-old Adam Lanza -- was in the doorway. Soto positioned herself in front of the students, and the gunman shot her, Aidan told his parents. Aidan and the children had always been told during school drills and by his parents to run if he saw somebody with a gun. So that's what he did. ""They ran past the guy. He standing in the doorway, and they just ran right past him,"" the boy's father said. Aidan and the boys ran toward the front door, out of the building and then toward the main road where a woman stopped, picked them up and drove them to the police station. ""He loved his teacher. ...I think he's trying to reassure himself that she's going to be OK,"" Aidan's mother said. ""He keeps saying 'I really hope she is OK. He knows that that she's been hurt. He knows the kids he saw getting shot."" Nick and Laura Phelps also are struggling with what to tell their two children, a first-grader and a third-grader. They, like many of the parents, were alerted to a possible problem at the school by the district's robocall that instructed them to go to the fire station. There, they found their children. ""When I saw those teachers, I locked eyes with them separately. If I could go back, I would embrace them,"" Nick Phelps said, ""because I had no idea what they had gone through."" Phelps and his wife planned to attend counseling services being offered in Newtown, and the couple also are seeking guidance from their church pastor. ""We're definitely going to talk to counselors,"" Nick Phelps said. By Saturday night, the couple was fairly certain that their children were aware at the least of some of the developments. ""I think they do know more than they let on,"" Laura Phelps said. ""We are going to have to learn what to say before we say it. The Phelps did not want the names of the children out in the public. Even those charged with breaking the news to young family members struggled. At the St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, Father George Weiss was with the parents of a little boy as they told him his sister had been killed. ""We just told a little boy about his sister, and he asked, 'Who am I going to play with now? I have nobody to play with now.'"" ""Excuse me,"" he said as tears rolled down his face, ""it was just so hard."" CNN's Kate Bolduan reported from Newtown, and Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- A Florida judge on Thursday set a $1 million bond with new restrictions on George Zimmerman, saying he believes the suspect may have been planning to flee the country to avoid prosecution in the killing of Trayvon Martin. Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. found that Zimmerman's deceit over cash holdings at his first bond hearing in April was not enough to hold him without bail. ""This court has, thus far, declined to exercise its contempt powers and the state failed to prove that the defendant may be held without bond,"" the order said. Zimmerman will have to post 10% of the $1 million -- or $100,000 -- to meet the requirement for bail. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . But an even bigger challenge is finding a bail bond company that will work with the family on the requirement of $1 million in collateral, defense attorney Mark O'Mara said later Thursday. The family does ""not have anywhere near"" the collateral amount, according to the attorney. ""We are encouraged we can work this out,"" O'Mara said in a statement. Donations to Zimmerman's legal defense fund have dropped significantly while Zimmerman has been jailed, O'Mara said. ""Supporters have told us they were concerned that the court would set such a high bond that getting George out of jail could risk wiping out the entire defense account. It appears that they were right. However, George needs an aggressive defense and to help with that he also needs to be out of jail with his wife and family assisting his legal team."" The fund has a $211,000 balance, but has $40,000 in payables for defense expenses. ""Paying bond and scheduled expenses would effectively wipe out the existing balance,"" O'Mara said. O'Mara argued that Zimmerman should not be jailed because the state's case is weak and his claim of self-defense is strong. The original bail of $150,000 was revoked last month after Lester learned Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had failed to disclose more than $150,000 in donations from the public. The judge's order Thursday said that the new $1 million bond was not a punishment but an amount that assured the court that Zimmerman would not abscond. Zimmerman has the money to pay for his release, the court said. In his ruling, Lester wrote about the first bond hearing and noted an undisclosed second passport kept in Zimmerman's safe deposit box. ""Notably, together with the passport, the money only had to be hidden for a short time for him to leave the country if the defendant made a quick decision to flee,"" the judge said. ""It is entirely reasonable for this court to find that, but for the requirement that he be placed on electronic monitoring, the defendant and his wife would have fled the United States with at least $130,000 of other people's money."" Lester wrote the defendant's plans to flee were ""thwarted."" Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in Martin's February 26 shooting death. Under Florida law, second-degree murder is a bondable offense. What do you think about the judge's order? Sound off on CNN iReport . Prosecutors had asked for bond to be denied or, if not, for it to be set at $1 million. Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said the parents preferred that Zimmerman remain in jail, but ""they respect the ruling of the court and the strong message that the judge sent that deference to judicial integrity is paramount to all court proceedings."" ""Furthermore, they understand that this is not a sprint to justice, but a long journey to justice that they must bear for their son Trayvon,"" Crump said. The order said the evidence shows that Zimmerman and his wife acted together to conceal their cash holdings during the original bond hearing. ""Under any definition, the defendant has (flouted) the system,"" the order said. ""The defendant has tried to manipulate the system when he has been presented the opportunity to do so."" Investigator: Zimmerman missed opportunities to defuse situation . Lester imposed new restrictions on Zimmerman that he did not face when he was out on bond the first time. Zimmerman must report to officials every two days, cannot open or maintain a bank account and cannot be on the property of an airport. He also cannot apply for or obtain a passport. Zimmerman must abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., and like before, will be monitored electronically. Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda argued before the judge last week that Zimmerman should remain in jail without bail because he was complicit in lying to the court and can't be trusted. Forensic accountant Adam Magill testified that thousands of dollars in donated funds flowed into and out of Zimmerman's bank account in the days before the first bail hearing. Magill said it appeared Zimmerman and his wife were speaking in code during recorded jailhouse telephone conversations about the amount of money involved. He also said that transferring funds between accounts could have been done to make it appear that Zimmerman had less money available for bail than he did. De la Rionda reiterated that prosecutors believe Martin, a 17-year-old African-American, was an innocent victim who was confronted by Zimmerman without provocation. Zimmerman, a Sanford neighborhood watch volunteer, acknowledged fatally shooting the unarmed Martin after calling police to report a suspicious person. Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, said Martin attacked him. George Zimmerman: Trayvon Martin threatened my life .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's acquittal on murder charges was a sign from God that her daughter Caylee's death was an accident, Cindy Anthony said in a television interview aired Wednesday. Cindy Anthony, Casey's mother, told television host Dr. Phil McGraw that ""there is something seriously wrong with my daughter."" But she told McGraw, ""I'm not going to be her judge and jury. God is her judge, and he let her free."" ""I prayed to God for three years to find out what happened to Caylee, and I prayed during the whole trial that God would give me closure and if Casey was responsible for Caylee's death, that Casey would go to jail and be punished,"" Cindy Anthony said. ""And when that verdict came in and Casey was free, I got my answer -- that it was an accident,"" she said. ""And I believe that justice for Caylee was when her mother walked."" But while she said she believes Caylee's death was an accident, she dismissed the defense's argument that her husband, George Anthony, helped cover up the girl's death. ""I don't believe that for a minute,"" Cindy Anthony said. Caylee was last seen June 16, 2008, but was not reported missing until July 15, 2008. Her skeletal remains were found five months later, in the woods a short distance from the family's home in Orlando. After a lengthy investigation that became a media frenzy, Casey Anthony was acquitted of first-degree murder in July, but found guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. She has remained out of the public spotlight since her release from jail, but is on probation for a 2010 conviction on check fraud charges. Cindy Anthony's comments were aired in the second part of a lengthy interview that began airing Tuesday on the syndicated ""Dr. Phil"" program. Cindy Anthony and her husband, George, told McGraw they differed on how their granddaughter died, with George Anthony saying he believed Casey had help disposing of Caylee's remains. George Anthony said he suspects his daughter ""or someone else that she was with"" may have drugged Caylee to put her to sleep so Casey Anthony could ""go out and have a good time,"" resulting in the girl's death. Cindy Anthony expressed surprise at the assertion, telling McGraw, ""It's the first time I've heard it, and we've been through this for three years.""","Casey Anthony was acquitted of murder in July amid a media frenzy .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Eight service members were killed in three separate attacks in Afghanistan on Saturday, NATO officials said. In one attack, a roadside bomb killed five U.S. service members in southern Afghanistan, U.S. and NATO officials said. The blast killed took place in the Maiwand district of Kandahar province, said the governor's spokesman, Javid Faisal. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CNN that 10 soldiers were killed in the blast, though the group is known for exaggerating the number of casualties. In a second attack Saturday, two members of NATO's International Security Assistance Force were killed when an Afghan soldier turned his weapon on them, according to an ISAF statement. The incident in western Afghanistan is under investigation, ISAF said. The nationalities of those killed were not immediately released. And in a third incident, one ISAF service member died after an insurgent attack in northern Afghanistan, ISAF said. No other details about the attack were released.

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden, whose disclosures have triggered broad debate over the balance between privacy and national security, has left Hong Kong and is in Moscow, apparently headed to Ecuador. Hong Kong and the Department of Justice have issued different stories about whether Hong Kong authorities had enough information to prevent Snowden's departure. Moscow says since Snowden remained in transit through the Moscow airport, he could not have been detained by them. China and Russia seem delighted to facilitate Snowden's passage. Snowden's supporters assert a moral equivalence between surveillance by the United States and surveillance by China, Russia and other authoritarian regimes. This equivalence posits that surveillance by any nation, for whatever reason, whether of its citizens or of other nations, is morally equivalent. To pure privacy advocates, the use of surveillance makes no difference. The mere fact that Big Brother is watching is the central commonality. This is a mistaken view of surveillance. In the United States, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act distinguishes between U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons. It allows only metadata collection on the former: the origins, destinations and length of calls but not their contents. The volume of data is so enormous that no government official's prying eyes have access to what you or I say. Opinion: Why Ecuador might shelter Snowden . Computer algorithms sort the data, and additional safeguards exist when that data needs to be accessed by analysts, agents or officers to comply with Fourth Amendment requirements. The entire process operates under an umbrella of approval and oversight by an elected Congress, is vetted by privacy attorneys in the Department of Justice and is overseen by life-tenured federal judges. The watchers are the agents of the people. If President Barack Obama himself asked for data concerning an individual citizen, resident alien or casual visitor to the United States, the request would be vetted and denied if it did not meet probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment. The FISA statute explicitly protects First Amendment rights to free speech, which include criticisms of government policy and peaceful protests against government actions. It also requires minimal privacy intrusions -- however inadvertently -- of U.S. persons. The national surveillance state, to borrow a term from legal scholar Jack Balkin, is closely tethered to the rule of law and accountability to the people. Contrast surveillance in authoritarian regimes. China closely monitors its citizens' access to political information, and dissidents of all varieties are targeted at the whim of the unelected Communist Party leadership. The constitution is not judicially enforceable, so no independent authority can say no to a request of the party leadership. No opposing party can make political hay over surveillance of its advocates and adherents. Or consider Russia, where President Vladimir Putin's minions, again without judicial oversight or significant independent political opposition, can monitor and imprison those who oppose his regime's policies. Freedom of speech, and especially political speech, is closely cabined by the regime. The contents of communications found through electronic surveillance or otherwise can rapidly lead to imprisonment or house arrest. And defection, a cousin of espionage, can lead to polonium poisoning. In short, there is a world of difference between the United States and China or Russia when it comes to surveillance. The United States analyzes data to prevent terrorist violence to its people, while authoritarian regimes use surveillance to cabin political dissent by their people. But what about U.S. electronic espionage directed at Chinese e-mail contents, communications of Russia's president and NSA interception of communications of individuals thought to be Islamist terrorists, also revealed by Snowden's disclosures? Opinion: Why U.S. is being humiliated by the hunt for Snowden . These electronic intercepts concern the contents of communications, not just the fact of communications. And these intercepts do not respect the privacy or political free speech of the communicators. The difference is that snooping on foreign nations and alleged terrorists furthers national security, the most basic reason for the existence of the United States. National security pervades the Constitution, from the preamble's purpose to ""provide for the common Defense"" to designation of the president as commander in chief. It is nothing new for the executive branch, again under rules established by Congress and often subject to independent judicial oversight, to direct espionage against those who may seek to harm this country. Aliens outside the United States and the leadership of foreign countries are ""fair game"" for surveillance, and they have no Fourth Amendment or First Amendment rights. Moreover, foreign countries know as much or more, often from the public record, of United States defensive capabilities. As Justice Robert H. Jackson dissented more than 60 years ago, the Constitution is not ""a suicide pact."" Some may think Snowden's destination immaterial. But if he lands in a regime that represses its own people and seeks to further harm the United States, might the U.S. consider ratcheting up the diplomatic pressure beyond genteel mechanisms of criminal extradition to fulfill its mandate to ""provide for the common Defense?"" Instead of the Department of Justice writing a criminal complaint to begin a federal criminal process where Snowden could avail himself of all his constitutional rights, could the United States consider other options to protect its national security? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles A. Shanor.","Charles Shanor: Some think that surveillance by any nation is morally equivalent .

"(CNN) -- From a wing of the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, London, to the provincial capitol building in Toulouse, France to a spa resort in Japan, Denise Scott Brown's architecture has changed landscapes across the globe. In a partnership spanning more than 40 years, Scott Brown and her husband and partner Robert Venturi both designed iconic buildings and changed attitudes with their theories and books. Their efforts earned a Pritzker Prize -- considered the greatest accolade in architecture -- for Venturi in 1991. But, although the couple had always worked in partnership, Scott Brown's name was not included in the prize. Now, 22 years on, a group of young women architects is leading a campaign to retroactively include Scott-Brown on the prize. Their petition has been signed by more than 11,000 people at time of writing, including no fewer than nine Pritzker Prize laureates: Rem Koolhaas (2000), Wang Shu (2012), Zaha Hadid (2004), Richard Meier (1984), Rafael Moneo (1996), Renzo Piano (1998), Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron (2001) and Venturi himself. Venturi, now retired from architecture, wrote: ""Denise Scott Brown is my inspiring and equal partner."" The campaign was inspired by a video message Scott Brown recorded for the Architects' Journal's ""Women in Architecture"" lunch in London in March in which she raised the idea of an inclusion ceremony to recognize her in the prize. The message was picked up by Harvard graduate architecture students Arielle Assouline-Lichten, 29 and her colleague Caroline James, 30, who had just revived the school's Women in Design group. Watch: The woman behind London's Olympic Aquatic Centre . The architect . At the age of 81, Denise Scott Brown is still busy and in demand at architecture events, giving lectures and writing. She has just returned from Mexico where she spoke to 3,000 people at the release of the Spanish edition of her latest book, ""Having Words."" Her lifetime's work includes not only several iconic buildings, but influential theories of architecture, books and teaching. Her seminal book ""Learning from Las Vegas,"" written with Venturi and Steven Izenour and published in 1972, has been in print ever since and is still a standard text for architecture students. It argues that architects should take greater account of the tastes of ordinary people and move away from large, self-aggrandizing buildings. Scott Brown told CNN that, as a woman, she had felt excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career. READ MORE: The woman reshaping the world's skylines . ""In the 70s and 80s we thought we were suffering alone, by the 90s I was still having a great deal of trouble and when I said anything it made powerful men very angry."" ""By the 90s, we had to tell them we were not going to suffer in silence. ""I watched the advent of women in my field. Early on, if I went to a conference there would be one woman and one black in a hall with 500 white men."" She added: ""I think what happened to me could still happen, some of the inequities remain."" She said the Pritzker Prize was based on the fallacy that great architecture was the work of a ""single lone male genius"" at the expense of collaborative work. ""It wasn't just an oversight. They made a conscious decision not to include me,"" she said. The campaigners . Harvard graduate student Arielle Assouline-Lichten was reading architecture blogs in her living room when she came across Scott Brown's video message to the Architects' Journal and responses to it. ""I felt there needed to be a support network to help make it a reality because I believe she deserved equal recognition,"" she said. She contacted her colleague Caroline James who had just revived the Harvard Graduate School of Design's Women in Design group and the pair immediately began working on a change.org petition in March. Now, the Change.org campaign has generated over 11,000 signatures, nine of which are Pritzker winners. Both young women were impressed by Scott Brown as a pioneer female architect and through ""Learning from Las Vegas"", which they had read during their studies. ""She is a legend,"" said James, adding that her omission from the prize had been ""institutionalized sexism"". ""Our agenda is about recognizing equal creative participation in the field of architecture,"" said James. ""Our interest is not in disrespecting the Pritzker Prize, but drawing attention to joint enterprise. It's about raising awareness and creating a culture of intent to include not exclude people."" Assouline-Lichten added: ""I would like to see the profession become more egalitarian. It's important for this generation to speak out and ensure that there is some sort of responsibility by institutions to foster an environment that reflects what we want the profession to be.""

Martha Thorne, executive director of the Pritzker Prize, told CNN by email: ""Those jurors change over the years so this presents us with an unusual situation.

"(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago this month, Rwanda declared a cease-fire in a genocide that left more than 800,000 dead. In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage. In June of 1994, Rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage. Civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors. It was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents. What started the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry . The Tutsi ethnic minority and the Hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. The rivalry started during colonial times, when the Belgians considered Tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities. The Hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. The first major assault on Tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years. The animosity caused the Tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including Burundi and Uganda. The Hutus took over the government when Rwanda gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained. Hours before the genocide . In early April, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The president, his Burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. A few hours later, Rwanda erupted into chaos. Some have accused current President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, of masterminding the killing. Kagame, who led a Tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. He has accused Hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on Tutsis. Differences between Hutus and Tutsis . They speak the same language and practice the same customs. However, most Tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have Ethiopian heritage. During the genocide, the bodies of Tutsis were thrown into rivers by the Hutus, who said they were sending them back to Ethiopia. The aftermath of the genocide . After 100 days of death and destruction, the Tutsi militia led by Kagame defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the government. Scores of Hutus fled to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. Rwanda has invaded Congo various times to launch an offensive against Hutus allegedly linked to the genocide. After the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Kagame came into power. Bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. Kagame became president in 2000. Trials for genocide suspects . Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts. The latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field. The courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. Gacaca means ""open grass"" in the local language. Human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice. State of the nation 15 years later . Rwanda is now considered one of Africa's most stable nations. Education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. Kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in Africa. However, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media. Others have said the growth in economy is limited to urban areas and has not trickled into rural areas.","Simmering hatreds between Tutsi and Hutu erupted in genocide in 1994 .

"(CNN) -- The Bling Ring, Sofia Coppola's acerbically arresting fifth feature, is a tasty contradiction: a clear-eyed, empathetic look at people the movie doesn't even pretend you can like. It's a true-life drama of American youth culture gone mad. Based on a 2010 Vanity Fair article by Nancy Jo Sales, the film tells the story of a pack of L.A. teenagers (four girls and one boy) who in 2008 began to break into the homes of their celebrity idols (like Lindsay Lohan and Rachel Bilson) to steal their clothes, shoes, and jewelry. We see them troll the Web to find out which stars are going to be out of town, and they then sneak in easily, climbing over security fences. Once inside, they basically go shopping. They rifle through designer dresses, find roomfuls of necklaces, and get to Valhalla when they reach the sacred chamber where Paris Hilton keeps her shoes. Designer pieces worth stealing: 17 picks inspired by 'Bling Ring' The characters are presented as a new species of mutant. They care about nothing â€” nothing! â€” but fashion, star gossip, consumer goods, and the way these things mash together to a grinding hip-hop party beat. But where a lesser filmmaker might have turned the members of the Bling Ring into warped rebels, Coppola sees that they're acting out a sociopathic version of the obsessions that now rule far too many of us: They're the first generation to worship actors purely for being celebrity-endorsement show ponies. Given what a debased view that is, the clever beauty of The Bling Ring is its scandalous yet never mocking tone, its refusal to satirize. For a while, the girls' personalities seem almost interchangeable, but that's part of the texture. Katie Chang gives the leader a ripe synthetic glow, and Emma Watson does a remarkable job of demonstrating that glassy-eyed insensitivity need not be stupid. A- . See the original story at EW.com .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A top aide to the Rwandan president is in German custody for her alleged role in a 1994 assassination that sparked the Rwandan genocide, the German Foreign Ministry said Monday. Rose Kabuye is suspected of participating in downing of a plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana. Rose Kabuye was arrested Saturday at the Frankfurt airport while on a private visit, the ministry said. She is awaiting extradition to France, it said. Rwanda's government issued a statement saying Kabuye is innocent of the charges, and that she is ready to face trial in France. ""The government of Rwanda believes that this is a political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government,"" the statement said. She is one of nine aides to Rwandan President Paul Kagame that Europe is seeking to arrest on charges of plotting the assassination of the then-Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana in April 1994. A French judge ruled in 2006 that legal proceedings could proceed against Kagame and his nine aides, which prompted Rwanda to break its diplomatic ties with France. Habyarimana and Burundi's former leader Cyprien Ntaryamira were killed when their plane was shot down in April 1994, a move that fueled the genocide in Rwanda by Hutu extremists against mostly Tutsis. About 800,000 people were killed.","Aide to Rwandan president held over assassination that sparked genocide .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, President Obama took a meaningful step toward reshaping our nuclear arsenal in line with the reality of 21st-century security priorities. Standing at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, he announced that he would seek negotiated cuts with Russia of up to one-third of strategic nuclear weapons as well as address the issue of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe. But we must understand that these proposed reductions are significant only if they are part of an ongoing effort to eliminate nuclear weapons altogether. If they serve to legitimize the indefinite retention of nuclear weapons at an ""acceptable"" level, the specter of nuclear catastrophe will continue to haunt humanity, for arsenals of this reduced size would still inflict unimaginable destruction across the planet. A study by Physicians for Social Responsibility (PDF) showed that if only 300 warheads in the Russian arsenal got through to targets in American cities, 75 million to 100 million people would be killed in the first 30 minutes by the explosions and firestorms that would destroy all of our major metropolitan areas, and vast areas would be blanketed with radioactive fallout. In addition, the entire economic infrastructure, on which we depend to sustain our population, would be destroyed. The transportation system, the communications network, the public health and banking systems, the food distribution network -- all would be gone. In the months after this war, it is probable that the vast majority of the American population who were not killed in the initial attack would die of starvation, exposure, epidemic disease and radiation poisoning. Even with Obama's proposed reductions in nuclear weapons, the United States and Russia would each continue to possess more than triple the nuclear weapons required to cause that devastating scenario . But as unimaginable as these direct consequences would be, the effects throughout the world would be even worse. A recent study by Robock, Oman and Stenchikov (PDF) showed that a nuclear war, even with the reduced numbers Obama has proposed, would cause catastrophic global climate disruption (PDF).  The firestorms started by these nuclear explosions would loft 50 million to 100 million tons of soot into the upper atmosphere, blocking out the sun. In a matter of days, temperatures around the world would plummet by as much as 20 degrees centigrade -- 36 degrees Fahrenheit -- in the agricultural regions in the interior of continents. The result would be a catastrophic failure of crops throughout the world and a global famine that could claim a majority of the human population. The existential threat to human civilization that nuclear weapons would still pose does not mean these proposed reductions are not useful. On the contrary, they are a critically important step to reduce the nuclear danger, and it is essential that we implement them as rapidly as possible. But we can't stop there. This effort must lead to multilateral negotiations involving all nuclear weapons states, negotiations that will produce a nuclear weapons convention banning these weapons once and for all. These negotiations will not be easy, and the treaty they produce will have to be a hard-nosed agreement that establishes mechanisms to verify and enforce compliance. But we don't have an alternative. Some say it is unrealistic to think we can eliminate nuclear weapons. But in truth, it is unrealistic to think we can maintain nuclear arsenals indefinitely and still avoid a nuclear conflict. The Cuban Missile Crisis 51 years ago brought us to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Further, we know of at least five occasions since 1979 when either Washington or Moscow prepared to launch a nuclear war in the mistaken belief that they were themselves under attack. The most recent near miss that we know about was in January 1995, a full five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. On each of these occasions we were incredibly luck and a national security strategy based on luck is not a wise course of action. As long as there are arsenals of nuclear weapons, we are living on borrowed time. We owe it to our children to eliminate them from the world, and we should start by implementing the modest proposals made by Obama in Berlin this week. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ira Helfand and Alan Robock.","President Obama will seek cuts with Russia of up to one-third of nuclear weapons .

"(CNN) -- A tangle of dresses, skirts, jeans, suits, shirts and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles costume greeted Pamela Swidler when she opened her closet each morning. It was overwhelming and made her feel like she had nothing to wear. After submitting a photo of her overstuffed closet to Jill Martin, the closet guru helped Swidler to throw out most of her clothes. ""I'm amazed at how little is in my closet right now, and it would have scared me two months ago,"" Swidler said. ""But once you start, you'll find yourself getting rid of stuff that in a million years you never thought you'd get rid of."" That is exactly what Martin wants people to experience. Her new book, ""I Have Nothing to Wear!"", co-authored with Dana Ravich, provides a 12-step program for women to clear the clutter from their closets so they can dress better. ""I feel like you should always look like you're about to run into your ex-boyfriend,"" Martin said. ""When you can avoid it, you should never be a mess."" The book's title is a phrase every woman can relate to, standing in front of their closets when the contents resemble a mass of fabric without any discernible outfit choices. The recovery process outlined in Martin's book, like any other 12-step program, is designed to be taken seriously. ""When you look in your closet and the morning and everything is organized in a way that fits your life, it's just nice and easy, almost like you have a uniform,"" Martin said. Martin demonstrated the process during a segment taped in Swidler's home for NBC's ""The Today Show. "" Unlike reality shows where the fashion-impaired victim watches as while a stranger rips through their closet, Martin's wardrobe system encourages conducting your own closet cleanse with a trusted friend who will become your sponsor. They need to be the kind of friend who will honestly tell you what looks good or bad and knows what you wear most often. The book stresses you should minimize your closet by keeping only the very best items. Start three piles of items: those you want to keep, those you will donate/throw away and a pile for maybes. Anything with too much wear, holes or stains needs to go straight into the trash. It usually takes three times to sift through the mounds of shoes, stacks of jeans and endless hangers of impulse-bought outfits before a stress-free close appears. Each time, you'll enter your closet with a new mission. In the first round, you remove damaged items and in the second round, toss out the items that don't suit your style. During the third round, you try on everything left in your closet to determine whether it's a good fit. Martin and Ravich believe this process provides a confidence boost and stress relief. ""People think that fashion is this very superficial part of your life, but it really has deep psychological roots,"" Martin said. ""If you don't feel your best, it's going to affect your mood all day."" Martin's own sponsor is Ravich, her co-author, and the pair went through all three rounds of clearing together. Martin's impossible-to-walk-in designer shoes had to go and the perfect white button-down blouse stayed. A Valentino dress also got the boot while a pair of amazing jeans were given a place of honor. Many impulse buys cluttering your own closet probably first appeared in a daydream scenario. ""You'll walk into a store and see a sequin dress,"" Martin said. ""You think, 'When I'm invited by that random guy to a black tie affair, I'll wear that dress.' That's how we all buy things, we envision wearing them to certain events. How many times do you buy something and that story doesn't happen?"" Barbara Ellis, a style consultant who comes from a family of well-maintained closets, has helped many women with the closet cleanse. The biggest problem women have with their closets is the subtracting. Stuffing it with clothes is the easy part, but sifting out the old can feel as stressful as living with it. ""Clothing is very emotional for women,"" said Ellis of TheStylishChick blog. ""The first step is detaching yourself from emotion and understanding it is just clothing. It's got to have value, in that it does something for you."" Ellis recommends going through your closet twice a year to maintain an organized wardrobe. ""Even though they have fewer things in their closet, they feel like they have more to wear,"" she said. ""Women need to be better editors. Buy something you love that fits you right and blends into your wardrobe."" Swidler feels like a new person after going through her closet cleanse. Besides an organized space for her clothing, it has changed her shopping habits. She now faces potentially deal-breaking questions before she takes anything to the cash register: How often will I wear it, do I really love this and does it fit well? She's also cut back on online shopping because of the uncertainty pertaining to fit, color and appearance. Martin and Ellis both believe that just because you're cleaning out the closet doesn't mean tossing out your sentimental things. Martin will never get rid of the T-shirt her father used to paint his college dorm room or her grandmother's bracelet. Ellis will always keep the ugly sweater passed down from her great-grandmother. However, you won't see Martin or Ellis wearing these items outside of their homes, either. But your dye-to-match prom shoes or the ill-fitting dress you've never worn? Those can go to Goodwill or a consignment shop. ""Be ready to say, 'I'm going to make my life simple and I'm going to respect the fact that I should only have the best things that I could possibly have in my wardrobe,' "" Martin said.","Cleaning out your closet can also clean up your life .

"(CNN) -- The first time I met Margaret Thatcher, she was already a fan of mine, or so she said. With my co-writer Antony Jay, I had created and written the first seven episodes of ""Yes, Minister,"" a BBC TV comedy series about the British government . The first four episodes had been written during the last year of Jim Callaghan's disastrous premiership, which led to industrial paralysis and the so-called ""winter of discontent."" Practically every trade union went on strike about practically anything. The unions were running the country and, it has to be said, making a pretty bad job of it. I had always voted Labour, but the last straw for me was when six baggage handlers at Heathrow were sacked after they were found guilty in a criminal court of stealing from passengers' luggage. The Transport and General Workers' Union called a national strike, claiming the thefts were ""baggage handlers' perks."" It was no surprise to me that Mrs. Thatcher won a big majority, and I was one of the many who voted for her. The BBC, showing its usual courage, had refused to put our series on the air until the election was over, for fear that the winner would claim a lack of impartiality and reduce its funding. We were flattered that a mere comedy series could be thought to have any influence over anybody, but to our surprise, it rapidly became a massive hit when it was broadcast early in Mrs. Thatcher's rule. We learned that when it was on for half an hour every week, the business of the nation came to a standstill while MPs crowded into the many bars at the House of Commons to watch it. Of course, there could be no other possible reason for finding all the MPs in a bar, so that had to be it. Politicians and editors starting writing columns about ""Yes, Minister."" Tony and I were thrust blinking into the spotlight like a couple of anxious moles, pleased that people liked our show but with mixed feelings about celebrity. Fortunately, the celebrity interest focused on the actors because people, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, seem to persist in the belief that actors make it all up as they go along. This put a frightful burden on Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne, the stars of the show, to be tremendously witty and erudite every time they went on a chat show. Referring to our show, Mrs. Thatcher was quoted, ""Its closely observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power has given me hours of pure joy."" This was stunning. First of all, it suggested that Mrs. T had a sense of humor, something that no one had hitherto suspected. I was surprised that she had time to watch it, as she was now becoming awfully bossy and I was beginning to feel that she should reciprocate: Her government certainly wasn't giving me hours of pure joy. Mrs. Thatcher was changing Britain in many ways, both for better and worse. As France's Charles de Gaulle said -- not about her but about himself, of course -- ""a great career is bound to involve many mistakes."" ""Yes, Minister"" became known as Mrs. Thatcher's favorite TV show, and this worried me because the program was carefully neutral from a political point of view. I started telling people that Tony Benn, the leader of what was known as ""the loony left,"" liked it a lot, too. My queasy feeling, as one politician after another queued up to praise us, vanished as I realized why: Politicians love to watch anything about themselves on TV, and they are only interested in politics. Also, because our program showed how the Civil Service really runs Britain -- our version of checks and balances and the separation of powers -- we had unintentionally given politicians an alibi. The public understood for the first time that if politicians didn't keep their promises, it might be because they were obstructed by the Civil Service. So when I was invited to a big party at 10 Downing Street, I was not surprised. My wife and I walked up the grand staircase and there, at the top, was the Iron Lady herself and a major domo to announce us. I muttered my name to him. ""Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Lynn,"" he bellowed. Mrs. T held out her hand. I was ready for a normal handshake but was quite taken aback by what happened next: ""How do you do?"" she said with that curiously fake Eliza Doolittle diction as she gripped my hand and yanked me straight past her right shoulder. I shot into the Yellow State Room, crashing into a well-known TV personality, one Terry Wogan, knocking the drink out of his hand. As I started to apologize, my wife flew into the room and knocked into both of us. I started apologizing again. ""That's all right,"" said Wogan with a grin, ""That just happened to me, too."" More guests were cannoning into the party like billiard balls. Mrs. T couldn't help demonstrating her strength, determination and eagerness to get on with things that weren't important. Subsequently we were invited to dinner there a couple of times. And then came that dreadful sketch. We were to be given an award by the National Viewers and Listeners Association, run by Mary Whitehouse, the UK version of Jerry Falwell. A scarcely believable message arrived at the BBC from Number 10, saying that Mrs. T would present the award, that she had written a sketch and wished to perform it with our actors Paul and Nigel. It transpired that the scarcely believable message was not, in fact, to be believed: The sketch was written by her press secretary, Bernard Ingham. I learned recently that she rehearsed the sketch with Ingham and her private secretary no fewer than 23 times. Why were they not running the country instead, you might ask? Answer: She was losing popularity and, though not very amusing herself, she knew the power of humor. She was co-opting the show to make people like her more. Ingham wasn't a comedy writer, but as a publicist, he knew his stuff. The sketch was reported everywhere, seen on all the TV news shows and was carried live on radio. And when I was given the award, I thanked Mrs. Whitehouse and added, ""I should like to thank Mrs. Thatcher for finally taking her rightful place in the world of situation comedy."" There was a huge laugh, broadcast nationwide. The only person in the room who didn't laugh was Mrs. T. I was never invited to Number 10 again. But soon after, the actors were given honors, the CBE. Fair enough -- they made it up as they went along. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Lynn.","Margaret Thatcher said Jonathan Lynn's co-written BBC hit ""Yes, Minister"" was her favorite show .

"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- One of Israel's best-known singers, Rita Jahanforuz -- known simply as Rita -- performed during her country's 50th anniversary celebrations and has met president Shimon Peres. Now she is bridging a vast cultural gap, evoking her own Iranian roots and singing in Farsi. Her latest album, ""All My Joys,"" a compilation of classic Persian ballads, has topped the Israeli charts and made her a cultural ambassador between two sworn enemies. Rita was born in Tehran in 1962 and moved to Israel with her family at the age of eight. She settled in a Tel Aviv suburb and rose to stardom in 1998 singing in Hebrew. She was invited to sing the Israeli national anthem at the country's jubilee celebrations in 2010, and performed at a lunch hosted by President Peres for then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the same year. ""I felt something very special to (have been) a foreigner when you were a child and suddenly you were chosen from all of those amazing singers and artists of Israel to sing the anthem,"" Rita told CNN in an interview. ""It was a big moment."" Last year, Rita decided to revisit the soundtrack of her childhood with the album ""All My Joys."" ""I was in the middle of making another Israeli Hebrew record, suddenly I felt like something is not matching, something in my stomach that started to burn,"" she said. ""I felt that I want to make a record that is the music of childhood, my family."" Of her early childhood in Tehran, Rita said: ""I remember the colors, the taste, the smell, the people, and especially, I think, I remember my mother singing all through my childhood, from the lullabies, singing for me those lullabies while she was cleaning the rice. ""The music was a very big part of my life."" Rita says she has known she wanted to be a singer since she was four years old: ""We were at some celebration of my uncle, there were two violinists, and they put me on a chair -- I (sang), I think, some Persian song."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Fears for bubble burst after Ramallah boom . While most western-style music is banned in Iran, Rita is an underground hit among those who take the risk of downloading or buying bootleg copies. She says she receives emails and Facebook messages from Iranian fans. ""I want to show the real culture, the real, amazing culture of Iran,"" she said. She added that she gets emails from people in Iran telling her this makes them feel proud. As an Israeli citizen, Rita can't go back to her homeland, but she hopes one day it will be possible. Israeli passport holders are denied entry to Iran. ""When there will be peace and I'm going to sing there. Let me dream, let me dream,"" she said. Through her music, Rita hopes to be a bridge between her native Iran and her new homeland, Israel. ""We are not enemies at all, we don't have anything to be enemies. We live so far away from each other, it's only in the head,"" she added. Also on Inside the Middle East: 'Birthplace of Christ' to be first Palestinian World Heritage site?

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Carrie Prejean has been dethroned as Miss California USA for ""contract violations,"" including missing scheduled pageant events, according to a state pageant official. Donald Trump poses with Carrie Prejean in May. Prejean was removed as Miss California USA on Wednesday. Prejean, 22, retained her title last month despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump decided to fire Prejean a month after he gave her a second chance. ""Carrie is a beautiful young woman, and I wish her well as she pursues her other interests,"" Trump said. Runner-up Tami Farrell, who was Miss Malibu, will immediately assume the Miss California USA title, state pageant Executive Director Keith Lewis said. ""This was a decision based solely on contract violations, including Ms. Prejean's unwillingness to make appearances on behalf of the Miss California USA organization,"" he said.  Watch the new Miss California talk about the developments » . Lewis told CNN's Larry King on Wednesday that it wasn't one thing Prejean did, but ""many, many, many things."" ""She came to us and said, 'I'm not interested in your input; I'll make my own decision what I'm going to do,' "" Lewis said. ""You know, when you have a contract, when you're working for someone, you have a responsibility to follow through on what that requirement is."" Lewis told King it was clear ""she was not interesting in upholding the title or the responsibilities."" Trump brought Prejean and Lewis together in New York for a meeting last month, after which he announced that communications between the beauty queen and pageant officials had been repaired. ""I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract with the Miss California USA organization, and I gave her the opportunity to do so,"" Trump said. ""Unfortunately, it just doesn't look like it is going to happen, and I offered Keith my full support in making this decision."" Charles Limandri, Prejean's lawyer, said she learned about the decision Wednesday morning in a phone call from Trump's office. ""This is all kind of a big shock,"" Limandri said. ""We've been working with Mr. Trump's office. She's been doing all the speaking engagements she's been asked to do. It is not true that she has not been cooperating."" No one from the pageant organization ever warned Prejean she was not doing what they wanted, he said. ""Something is going on,"" he said. ""Truth is not being told. I don't understand where this is coming from, or why."" ""For people to say that she breached her contract, that she is not doing speaking engagements is false,"" he said. ""She did one last Sunday in Las Vegas and it went really well."" Prejean stepped into controversy at the Miss USA pageant in April when she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question asked during the national pageant by Perez Hilton, a pageant judge. Prejean finished as first runner-up, but it was not clear if her answer cost her the crown. During a radio interview Wednesday with Billy Bush, who also was host of the pageant, Prejean said it was that controversy that led to her losing her title, not contract issues. ""It's just because of my answer, I think,"" Prejean told Bush. ""None of this would be happening right now if I just said yeah, gays should get married, you're right Perez Hilton."" Wednesday night on Larry King, Bush asked the new Miss California USA the question that sparked controversy for Prejean. Bush asked Tami Farrell whether in light of several states allowing gay marriage she thought other states should do the same. ""I think it's a personal decision and a civil rights issue,"" Farrell said. ""It's something we should let each state decide."" In addition to Prejean's gay marriage answer, controversy boiled to a new level in early May when seminude photos of Prejean appeared on gossip Web sites. Miss California USA officials -- some of them outspoken advocates of same-sex marriage -- suggested the photos breached the contract Prejean signed with the pageant. These officials also complained they couldn't reach Prejean and she had missed important pageant events. The controversy seemed over when Trump declared the pictures not to be too racy and Prejean promised to do better in communicating with the state pageant. Hilton, the judge who asked the same-sex question during the pageant, cheered Prejean's firing. ""Better late than never,"" Hilton said. Shanna Moakler, a former Miss USA who resigned as co-executive director of the California pageant when Trump did not dismiss Prejean last month, welcomed Wednesday's decision. ""First and foremost, my faith has been restored in the Miss Universe organization and with Donald Trump,"" Moakler said. ""I believed eventually what I intimately knew would come to fruition.""","NEW: Prejean tells Billy Bush she thinks gay marriage answer was reason for firing .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Violence in the restive western Chinese region of Xinjiang has left 35 people dead, state media reported, but overseas Uyghur groups questioned the official version of events. Frequent outbreaks of violence have hit Xinjiang, a resource-rich region where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The latest bout of unrest took place early Wednesday in the remote township of Lukqun, about 250 kilometers southeast of the regional capital of Urumqi, Chinese state-run media reported. ""Knife-wielding mobs attacked the township's police stations, the local government building and a construction site, stabbing people and setting fire to police cars,"" state-run newspaper China Daily reported, attributing the information to officials with Xinjiang's regional committee of the ruling Communist Party. The official broadcaster CCTV posted pictures of burnt out cars in front of a police station whose facade was singed black in places. Twenty-four people were killed by rioters, including 16 Uyghurs and two police officers, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Police shot and killed 11 rioters and captured four others, who were wounded, the news agency said. Xinhua called the event a ""terrorist attack,"" a common description by Chinese authorities for violence in Xinjiang involving Uyghurs. Doubts raised . ""The official reports, however, must be questioned in view of the inability to independently verify this narrative,"" said the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), a Germany-based Uyghur advocacy group. The WUC said it had tried to gather more information about the events, but ""all Uyghur telecommunications have been shut down"" in Turpan, the prefecture where Lukqun is situated. The China Daily article didn't say what had caused the riots, and Xinjiang government officials didn't respond to phone calls from CNN seeking comment. Efforts to reach people and businesses in Lukqun were unsuccessful. The state-media account of what happened also didn't mention the ethnicity of those involved in the riots. But the WUC suggested that Chinese authorities' use of the standard term ""knife-wielding mobs"" to describe the rioters was an indication they were Uyghurs. It called upon authorities ""to independently investigate the incident and its root causes, and to alleviate the legitimate concerns of Uyghurs so as to avert such incidents in the future."" The Uyghur American Association said it ""urges the international community to exercise caution over details"" of the events. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Wednesday that the ministry was ""seeking information from relevant departments"" on the matter. Simmering tensions . Uyghurs have complained of discrimination by the Han Chinese and harsh treatment by security forces in Xinjiang, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. The worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting between Uyghurs and Han Chinese left around 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in Urumqi. That unrest was followed by a heavy crackdown by security forces. Tensions have continued to simmer. In April this year, clashes killed 21 people in Xinjiang's Kashgar Prefecture. Regional government officials called those events ""a terrorist act"" carried out by ""mobsters,"" an account that overseas Uyghur groups disputed. ""The increasing frequency with which these incidents occur illustrates the PRC's reticence to address the root causes of the tensions that are escalating,"" the WUC said, using an abbreviation of People's Republic of China. ""There is an ever pressing need for the PRC to afford linguistic, cultural and religious freedoms, as well as ceasing politically-motivated arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killing, in order to alleviate the recurrence of these needless and avoidable events,"" the group said. CNN's Dayu Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: Fatalities include 16 Uyghurs and two police officers .

"(CNN) -- It may sound crazy. Why would a high-ranking executive lie about his or her credentials, especially now, when all it takes is a quick phone call or Internet search to verify information? Yet it happens more often than you might think. From a white lie about time spent as a customer service rep to a whopper about earning an MBA, résumé padding occurs regularly across industries, experts say. In a 2010 survey of 1,818 organizations, 69% reported catching a job candidate lying on his or her résumé, according to employment screening service HireRight. The most common lie on a résumé has to do with education, said Kim Isaacs, founder and director of ResumePower.com and Monster.com's résumé expert. The discovery that Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson does not have a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science (he has a bachelor of science degree in business administration, with a major in accounting) makes him the latest executive to be targeted for falsely claiming to have a degree. Or, at least, a certain kind of degree. In the wake of the allegation, made by shareholder firm Third Point, Yahoo removed all references to Thompson's degree from his biography on its website and said the error ""in no way alters that fact that Mr. Thompson is a highly qualified executive with a successful track record leading large consumer technology companies."" The company's board said Tuesday that it has hired an outside counsel to conduct a review of the false statement. The incident has raised debate over whether the gaffe counts as inconsequential ""fudging"" or ""exaggeration"" of his credentials or a lie that casts a shadow over his long career. Readers weigh in on résumé padding . Many in the tech industry, including Third Point, are demanding Thompson's ouster. Others have spoken out on his behalf, calling upon the ""Silicon Valley bloggerati"" to stop picking on Thompson. ""Thompson has a degree in accounting, not computer science, but frankly at this point in his career does it really matter what he studied as an undergraduate?"" Newsweek technology editor Dan ""Fake Steve Jobs"" Lyons asked in a Daily Beast column. ""(Thompson is) 54 years old, has been CEO of PayPal, and before that held high positions at Inovant, a subsidiary of Visa, and Barclays Global Investors. He's qualified to run Yahoo."" CNNMoney: Yahoo may need to go back to the drawing board . Résumé ""embellishments"" among titans of industry have led to mixed results. Former RadioShack CEO Dave Edmondson resigned less than nine months after taking his post after the revelation that he did not have degrees in theology and psychology. On the other hand, Bausch & Lomb's Ronald Zarrella offered to resign when it was discovered that he had not earned his MBA from NYU, as he'd claimed. The board did not accept his resignation, but he was forced to give up his bonus that year. It's not a phenomenon exclusive to Fortune 500 companies. Former Notre Dame football coach George O'Leary resigned after five days on the job when it came to light that he did not have a master's in education from NYU or play football at the University of New Hampshire. Résumé padding has become a point of increasing concern for companies big and small, prompting them to step up screening methods and background checks for job applicants, according to HireRight's Employment Screening Benchmarking Report. ""Screening continues to be a heavily adopted practice by employers in order to protect their business from unnecessary risks, maintain compliance and avoid poor quality hires,"" the report said. ""Even where lies may not represent a huge loss to the employer, companies report that catching a candidate in an untruth undermines confidence and credibility."" The 2010 survey found that 94% of respondents performed criminal checks, 70% performed identity and previous employment verification, and about half verified education and references. Isaacs sees résumé padding with growing frequency in her role as a résumé adviser because of the fluctuating job market and high unemployment rates. People often omit months in the start and end dates of their last jobs to exaggerate periods of employment and minimize unemployment. They also exaggerate accomplishments, like raising sales from 15% to 25%, or take individual credit for a project that was accomplished through teamwork, she said. Inflating titles from receptionist to administrative assistant, for example, also occurs frequently, she said. People see job postings for which they feel they have the right experience but not the requisite degree, prompting them to fabricate an extra line on their résumés, Isaacs said. ""People feel inadequate and that they have to do whatever it takes to get their foot in the door. It's a combination of wanting to get an edge and jobs being limited due to the economy,"" she said. ""People see others getting ahead and think, 'maybe it's my résumé.' The temptation arises from a desire to stay competitive."" It comes at a high price, including eventually being found out or, for those with a guilty conscience, the constant fear of being found out, she said. It's easy to disparage Thompson, she said, but given the high incidence of résumé padding in general, people should use this opportunity to take a second look at their own résumés. ""He got caught, so he's the obvious target. But it's quite likely that many of the people who will talk about him have a similar lie on their résumés,"" she said. ""Sell your benefits, the ones that reflect ... why you're perfect even though you don't have the degree,"" Isaacs suggested. ""Armed with an excellent résumé, you'll get your foot in the door, and there'll be something that comes along that's perfect for you, and you can start a job on honest footing, and it's just better for everybody."" Do you think Scott Thompson deserves a pass or should he be reprimanded?

"(CNN) -- Leslie Elder was always a fighter. But in a message to a friend in the waning days of her life, she seemed exhausted. The note, written at a time of spiritual darkness, suggested defeat after a decades-long struggle for medical coverage. ""I honestly don't know how much more I can endure,"" Elder wrote earlier this year in a Facebook message to her friend Liz Jacobs. ""I am fighting for (Medicaid) and disability. I can't work I sit in bed I cry a lot. I am still fighting for healthcare and still fighting foreclosure. ""I am so upset but perhaps it was not meant to be. I don't know anything anymore,"" said Elder, who died in July at age 63 without insurance coverage. As she typed the note, Elder could scarcely breathe. Her lungs had filled with fluid over several months; her respiratory system was shutting down. After visits to the emergency room and several free clinics, Elder was finally diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. But what makes her family bristle: Elder did not have to die. If she had had health care, ""Absolutely she'd still be here,"" said Jacquelyn Elder, Leslie's daughter, adding that Hodgkin's lymphoma has a high survival rate. ""That is something really hard to deal with."" ""I know she felt scared because there were no options. Why do something (about illnesses) when you know you can't get proper care to fix it?"" Except there were options. The Affordable Care Act, which takes full effect in 2014, was supposed to save people like Elder (with pre-existing conditions and no medical coverage) in the interim by way of high-risk pools, also known as the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan or PCIP. The pools are supposed to be a safety net, but many, like Elder, are falling through the cracks. Elder's family spent her final months fighting for Medicaid, with no clue that they qualified for Florida's high-risk pool. They are not alone: Of the estimated 200,000-375,000 people expected to enroll in PCIP in the first year, less than one-third have done it, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Leslie's husband, Jim Elder, admitted that he did not know many details of the program, and much of the conversation about health care has been confusing. ""I was under the impression that pre-existing (PCIP) didn't start until 2014,"" said Jim Elder in a recent interview with CNN. ""I'm puzzled. Since this act was passed, to us, people with pre-existing, we were hoping and searching for some sort of way to get health care. The way it has divided the country, some states suing to try and stop it, it's just confused everybody. It certainly confused us."" Jacobs, a nurse who met Leslie Elder in her role as a health care advocate and spokeswoman for the group National Nurses United, fears the Elders' story will be echoed repeatedly, even with ACA's passage. ""In a humane health care system, as much of the rest of the world has, no one would have to know the arcane minutiae of how to apply for a high risk pool,"" said Jacobs. ""Everyone would have (coverage) that qualifies you for health care when and where you need it."" That sort of access is promised to many through the ACA, but stories like the Elders' suggest the act -- at least as it relates to high-risk pools -- still has some kinks. In the midst of the family's confusion, Elder was unwittingly suffering from cancer again -- her fourth diagnosis. During a 2009 interview with CNN she quipped, ""I don't get a cold, I get cancer, and cancer, and cancer."" That terrifying litany of cancer diagnoses began in 1988 with a bulging tumor found in her right breast. Thirteen years later, the same diagnosis, this time in her left breast. And in 2005, it was kidney cancer. The doctor's grim pronouncement, according to Elder: "" 'Your right kidney ... it's breaking apart. You have a tumor ... and you also have a tumor in your left kidney.'"" Crush of cancer, medical bills snares family . By then, the Elders had been on a roller coaster, going from what they describe as the best medical coverage to having none. In between came skyrocketing insurance premiums, high deductibles, and stacks of unpaid medical bills following each cancer diagnosis. At a certain point, feeling like her pre-existing conditions were to blame for her soaring and unaffordable insurance rates, Elder gave up on coverage. Her insurance company Aetna later said Elder's previous cancer diagnoses were not the culprit for the rate increases. Although the company did not cite a specific reason for the increased rate, Cynthia Michener, an Aetna spokeswoman said: ""There can be other contributing factors to rate increases for small business policies, including, for example, the aggregate cost of the entire pool of small business policies in the state."" During the interview with CNN three years ago, Elder admitted to volleying between fear of the unknown and acceptance of her fate, even though without insurance, she had no idea whether she had cancer again.

""And me, Ms. Healthcare CNN interview tough person now a scared little girl who after beating cancer 4x now sits in bed with oxygen and breathing treatments,"" Elder wrote to Jacobs.

"(CNN) -- Despite some early storms this year, forecasters Thursday predicted a near-normal Atlantic hurricane season with nine to 15 named storms, including four to eight hurricanes and one to three major hurricanes. Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center, told reporters that uncertainty about whether the El Nino weather pattern will form made it difficult to be more precise. The hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. For the Atlantic Ocean, a normal season would produce 12 named storms, including six hurricanes and three major ones. A major hurricane, designated as Category 3 or greater, packs winds of well over 100 miles per hour. Hurricane Bud now a Category 2 . In addition, forecasters predicted a near-normal Eastern Pacific hurricane season, with 12 to 18 named storms, including five to nine hurricanes and two to five major hurricanes. An average season in the Eastern Pacific produces 15 named storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes. It is extremely rare for an Eastern Pacific hurricane to affect the U.S. mainland, though some do have an influence on Hawaii. Thursday's announcement came as Hurricane Bud strengthened to a Category 2 storm as it churned toward the southwestern coast of Mexico in the Eastern Pacific. In addition, Tropical Storm Alberto broke up in the Atlantic this week and another tropical depression was causing heavy rainfall in southern Florida, Bell said. However, he said the early storms were no harbinger of a more active season than normal. CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Early storms this year don't portend a more active season, forecasters say .

"(CNN) -- Hjalti á Lava was searching his iPhone for a Bible app when he stumbled across Church Online, a service of Web site LifeChurch.tv. Soon he was regularly logging into the Oklahoma-based cyber-church -- some 4,100 miles away from á Lava's home in the Faroe Islands, west of Norway. ""It allows me to connect with others and have conversations about the message,"" says á Lava, who shares his faith with other believers in the site's live chat room. ""Technology allows us today to have fellowship across borders and cultures."" In doing so, á Lava joined growing numbers of Christians worldwide who are migrating from the chapel to the computer. A map on the Church Online site showed users from 22 countries logged into a recent service. Online religious services offer convenience to those who are too isolated or infirm to attend a real-world church. But can worshipping via a computer offer true spiritual fulfillment? Internet pastors and parishioners cite their 24-hour access to interactive tools and social-networking platforms to show their online experiences are as meaningful as those that take place with face-to-face congregations. ""We were blown away at how people could actually worship along [online],"" says Craig Groeschel, senior pastor at LifeChurch.tv. ""The whole family will gather around the computer, and they'll sing and they'll worship together. Instead of trying to get people to come to a church, we feel like we can take a church to them."" But critics believe virtual worship separates followers from a trinity of spiritual essentials found in brick-and-mortar Christian churches: community, Communion and connection with Christ. ""Online church is close enough to the real thing to be dangerous,"" says Bob Hyatt, a pastor who leads the brick-and-mortar Evergreen Community Church in Portland, Oregon. In a blog post for ChristianityToday.com, he writes that calling it virtual church ""gives people the idea that everything they need is available here."" The debate is an extension of a wider argument over social interaction in virtual environments versus the physical world. But because practices of faith are involved, both sides are deeply invested in the outcome, seeing it as a statement on the nature of the Christian person's relationship with God. Supporters of online churches have a common response to their skeptics: Try before you criticize. The virtual experience goes far beyond using live chat rooms to exchange emoticons instead of hugs and handshakes, they say. Links allow congregants to ""raise their hand"" and publicly commit to Christ, while prayer requests and one-on-one guidance are a click way. Sermon notes can be shared and discussed. And many online churches are aided by volunteers, allowing them to hold services several times each day. The Internet campus of the Flamingo Road Church in Cooper City, Florida, pulls in more than 2,000 congregants from around the world during its Sunday services. Pastor Doug Gramling said his three children are part of the Internet generation that will eventually decide the future of worship. They use Web tools to stay in constant connection with friends over vast distances, which Gramling says ""gives me confidence that it can happen in online church."" But the disconnect from physical closeness is what Hyatt said he's ""fighting hardest against."" His own church offers online extensions such as podcasts and forums. But he believes ""the computer screen is a supplement, not a replacement."" Hyatt and other critics are particularly distressed by the online offering of traditional sacraments, such as Communion and baptism. He believes it is ""ridiculous"" that someone can grab grape juice and a cracker from the fridge and watch a computer screen, thinking they are truly participating in a gathering of the faithful. ""Something about the physical presence, breaking the same bread, is what Communion is meant to be,"" he says. But Church Online participant Donna Cole disagrees. ""Knowing that others are also celebrating Communion, regardless of location, makes it an especially wonderful time,"" says Cole, who believes real-world Communion can ring hollow. ""When I've taken Communion in live surroundings, I often got the sense that it was ritualistic and without meaning."" Matthew Bailey, a parishioner in the Franktown United Methodist Church in Virginia, believes that the meaning of the ritual is what matters. ""If people are willing to go to the trouble of giving their own Communion, then it is quite probably 'real' for them,"" he says. While Bailey chooses to remain at his face-to-face church, he believes any person ""faithfully attending an online church service, is being more proactive, and thus probably more attentive, than many longtime churchgoers."" Douglas Estes, lead pastor of Berryessa Valley Church in San Jose, California, and author of ""SimChurch,"" a book about Internet church services, would like to see this debate go away. ""The Bible sees church not as a man-made building but as a people gathered to glorify God with their lives,"" he says. Estes believes the quality of a community should be judged by the spiritual fellowship it offers. ""There is only one substantive difference between an online church and a brick-and-mortar church: The place where they meet.""","A growing number of Christians worldwide are migrating from the chapel to the computer .

"(CNN) -- Dereck Chisora has been handed an indefinite ban by the World Boxing Council (WBC) after a post-fight scuffle with David Haye in which he threatened to ""shoot"" his fellow British heavyweight. Chisora also threatened to ""burn"" former WBA champion Haye after they traded blows in a press conference following this month's defeat to WBC champion Vitali Klitschko. The 28-year-old slapped Klitschko at the weigh-in before their bout in Munich, and spat water in the face of Vitali's brother Wladimir -- the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight champion -- in the moments leading up to the fight. Chisora's actions prompted the WBC to strip him of his ranking and forbid him to fight for one of its titles until he completes an anger management course. Chisora threatens to shoot Haye in brawl following Klitschko defeat . WBC president Jose Sulaiman said Chisora's conduct was some of the ""worst behavior ever by a professional boxer"" and confirmed the body would also be fining him. ""Dereck Chisora is not going to tarnish the sport for those born in the humblest beds, who become sports heroes of the world to live a life of dignity and pride,"" he said in a statement. ""Boxers are gentlemen and show to the world an example of honor and fair play when after a tremendous battle they go to the center of the ring to pay respect to each other. ""The WBC is imposing a serious fine to be finally determined after the hearing to be held under the supervision of our counsel representative attorney Stephen Beverly. Klitschko defends WBC title with points win over Chisora . ""The WBC will also take off from the WBC rankings the name of Dereck Chisora and declare an indefinite suspension against fighting again for a WBC title, while demanding Chisora to take an anger management medical treatment after which his suspension will be reconsidered."" Both Klitschko brothers condemned Chisora's conduct but praised him for his valiant showing in the ring, when he took Vitali the full 12 rounds in Germany. Chisora is also facing sanctions from the British Boxing Board of Control at a meeting in March. He was arrested by German police but released without charge after his scuffle with Haye. Haye retired from the sport after losing to Wladimir in Germany last year but appeared at the press conference that followed Chisora's defeat to challenge Vitali to a contest. As Haye is officially still in retirement, the British Boxing Board of Control can't bring sanctions against him. Chisora's promoter Frank Warren said the WBC should have given the fighter a chance to defend himself at a hearing. ""There are a lot of things that happened behind the scenes that need to be taken into account,"" Warren said in quotes reported by the UK Press Association. ""For the WBC to do this is outrageous. ""What happened outside the ring I'm not condoning, but you cannot do this to anybody without letting them have a hearing. Everybody's entitled to a fair hearing, whatever you think of them, whatever you've seen. ""There is a procedure which should take place and then determine whether and if there is a punishment necessary. ""A number of mobile cameras were handed in to the police so they could examine them for evidence. They took copies of all the different media's films regarding the incident that happened outside the ring and did not charge Dereck Chisora.""","British boxer Dereck Chisora given an indefinite ban by the World Boxing Council .

"(CNN) -- The Brazilian government is investigating the case of a 15-year-old girl who allegedly was raped and tortured after being put in a prison cell with 20 male inmates, officials said. The girl -- who said she was forced to have sex for food and suffered burns and other abuse -- has denounced police in the small town of Abaetetuba for keeping her in the cell. She is now in a witness protection program. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups as well as government officials. ""This is a shame, a shame in the whole system,"" said Claudio Puty, chief of staff for the governor's office in Para, one of the largest states in Brazil. ""There is a total collapse in the jail system in Brazil, but this is no excuse for them to wash their hands and do nothing,"" he said. ""We are doing all we can to punish these policemen."" The victim -- who has been identified only by her initials, L.A.B. -- was jailed for attempted theft, and was sent to a police station in Abaetetuba, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the provincial capital of Belem, according to the O Liberal newspaper. She remained in custody for about three weeks. After receiving an anonymous phone call, two social workers tried to visit the girl in jail, but police barred them from doing so, the newspaper reported. One of them, Maria Imaculada, told O Liberal the young woman was courageous and talked to them in front of several policemen. In testimony before a tribunal, the girl told authorities she asked to speak to her relatives, but the police never responded, O Liberal reported, citing court documents. She testified that when she was forced into a bathroom, ""I screamed and screamed, but to no avail,"" the report said. The girl's father, who is also in a witness protection program, told reporters police asked him to forge the girl's birth certificate, but he refused. He said police threatened him and even questioned his paternity rights. ""She was humiliated and sexually assaulted in an Abaetetuba cell by those who should be defending her rights,"" he told O Liberal. The Brazilian government has sent two commissions to investigate.

"(CNN) -- I knot my black tie carefully. I haven't worn it since my grandmother's funeral. I check my reflection in the shop windows near Westminster as I walk towards the chapel where my ""other mother"" lies in her coffin. For five years, I've been writing ""Maggie & Me,"" my memoir of surviving Thatcher's 11 years in power. I feel surprisingly protective or perhaps possessive about my relationship with the woman we called Maggie. She privatized my fractured family into poverty by closing the steelworks where my dad toiled and cutting my mother's disability benefits, all while not seeming to care about any of it. And yet, as my family descended into chaos and eventually abuse, Maggie was always there in some sense; always encouraging me to get an education, to get away, to be an individual. At 9am on the dot, I find a place right opposite Big Ben near Westminster Abbey. I will see her hearse as it leaves the scene of her greatest political battles. At this time in the morning, there are more police than observers on the scene. They've been on duty since 5am but remain good-humored. There are sniffer dogs and through the drizzle we catch flashes of color amidst the crenelations of parliament -- snipers on the roof. Read more: Mourners bid farewell . Tourists stop to take pictures. People who have to get to work are annoyed that the road is closed and they have to walk the long way round. A young woman, dressed entirely in cobalt blue from shoes to headscarf, joins my prime spot. She looks like a Thatcherite nun. Much fuss has been made about granting permission for protest but I come across only two placards and these are about the Â£10 million cost of the funeral. It's hard to see where this vast sum has been spent. There's no sign of bread, nor circuses. I am here to close not just a chapter of my life but a whole book. At various points, Maggie turned her back on me but I won't do that to her today. ""I wouldn't give her the satisfaction,"" I think to myself, and I feel oddly nostalgic. There's a definite sense of loss. Or is it release? Grief or relief? Maybe both. When Labour Party leader John Smith died I was heartbroken and this is certainly not that. But I do have some things to thank her for. I feel determined to show her at least some of the respect in death that she didn't show me, my family, or my community in life. So I stand with dignity as a small crowd forms. The usual anti-war protesters are seated on their chairs with signs. I wonder if they are glad to have a bigger audience or feel infringed upon? Read more: How life might have been without Thatcher . It's 9:45am now, and Big Ben bongs while he can. ""Is this the bell which summons me to heaven or to hell?"" I wonder. Now the police seem to be multiplying in force. I see three soldiers in desert fatigues with green berets on. A brown-and-white spaniel sniffer dog is off the leash. ""It's a moment in history isn't it?"" says a young Asian woman officer to a lady from Italy. With ten minutes 'til the top of the hour, a helicopter appears overhead. At exactly 10am, and with surprising speed, Maggie's hearse, flanked by half a dozen police on bikes, exits the chapel at Westminster. She's punctual and impatient in death as in life, I think. Big Ben stays silent but the Abbey bells peal incongruously. People tutt loudly at this. There are more police than mourners -- their backs facing the coffin, not in protest but so they can keep their eyes on us. There are no jeers, or tears. That's that. Done. The small crowd starts to shuffle off and a prim pensioner bustles up expectantly only to be told she's too late. An impossibly young constable smiles his best consoling smile and says ""You've missed her, madam. She's gone."" Gone but not forgotten. Not yet.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's a story that mesmerized the nation and one that many observers thought ended more than two years ago. The case of Chandra Levy, a 24-year-old Washington intern whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002, is back in court, but the actions of a D.C. Superior Court judge have given it a mysterious air. In a hearing Thursday, Judge Gerald Fisher, along with an appeals court, maintained restrictions on the media's ability to report on recent hearings in the case. Fisher has ruled that the substantive details of hearings on December 18, January 4 and at least one upcoming hearing remain under seal. When the sealed issues are discussed during the hearings, the lawyers and judge speak at the judge's bench, and observers in the courtroom cannot hear the conversations. The transcripts of those discussions are under seal. The judge's ruling was a disappointment to a group of media outlets, including Associated Press, Gannett, McClatchy, the Washington Post and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, that had filed court papers seeking to unseal the information. ""We're very disappointed with the court leaving in place essentially blanket secrecy,"" Patrick Carome, an attorney representing the media outlets, told reporters outside the courthouse. Carome predicted the secrecy surrounding hearings in the Levy case could last months. The man convicted of killing Levy made an appearance at a hearing on Thursday. Ingmar Guandique, 31, was led into the courtroom in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, sporting a large tattoo that covered most of his scalp. He conversed with a Spanish translator throughout the proceeding, but did not participate in talks at the judge's bench. Despite Fisher's restrictions on information, CNN has learned some key details of these unexpected hearings from Carome and court papers. ""The court has stated that a 'somewhat substantial' but unspecified concern about 'safety' supports its decisions to close the proceedings to all members of the press and the public,"" according to one court filing. It is not known to whose safety that refers. ""This was a terrible crime of violence,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst. ""The witnesses have histories of violence. So there could be violence threatened against any number of people: participants or even outsiders to the case."" In addition to the safety concern, Carome said the hearings address ""...some information relating to the reliability of the testimony from a government witness."" No one involved in the case is allowed to say who that witness is. Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member, testified at Guandique's trial that Guandique confessed to him in jail that he killed Levy. Two women testified that Guandique attacked them in the same park. But it's not clear whether the testimonies of Morales or the two women are in question. Levy, an intern with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, disappeared in May 2001. Her remains were found in Washington's Rock Creek Park more than a year later, badly decomposed. Guandique repeatedly denied involvement in her murder, and prosecutors acknowledged a lack of DNA evidence linking Guandique to the crime and a lack of witnesses. But in November 2010, a jury convicted Guandique of one count of murder with kidnapping and a second count of murder with attempted robbery. In February 2011, he was sentenced to 60 years in prison. The Levy case generated a swarm of media coverage in 2001 and 2002, in part because it was revealed that she had had an affair with Gary Condit, then a U.S. congressman from California. Condit testified at Guandique's trial and denied involvement in her disappearance and murder and was never charged. Condit, who served in Congress until 2003, currently serves on the board of directors of the Phoenix Institute of Desert Agriculture, a non-profit group that promotes sustainable farming. Levy's father, Robert, told CNN that the family has not been told anything regarding the recent hearings. Robert Levy said he's concerned that something will happen with Guandique's conviction, and ""we don't like that it's all coming up again."" Mistrial declared after eyeball pops out . CNN's Dugald McConnell and William Mears contributed to this report.","Several hearings in the case of Chandra Levy, a D.C. intern who was killed, have been held .

"(CNN) -- Rio +20, a major international environmental conference begins in Brazil on Wednesday, billed by its organizers as a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to safeguard our planet for generations to come. For three days from June 20, scores of world leaders and tens of thousands of people from all over the world will descend on Rio de Janeiro in the hope of reaching consensus on how to achieve this. Some critics have already dismissed the event as a hugely expensive talking shop that stands little more chance of succeeding than previous environmental summits. Others are more optimistic. Here we look at some of the key issues surrounding the conference. What is Rio + 20? Rio+20 is a summit that takes place from June 20 - 22, organized by the United Nations to tackle environmental issues. Its name signifies it is being held in Rio de Janeiro 20 years after a similar ""Earth Summit"" in the same city. The biggest U.N. conference in years, it is being billed as a major effort to improve mankind's relationship with the planet. See also: Five cities fight for climate survival . Who will be there? The 1992 event was attended by U.S. President George H.W. Bush but President Barack Obama is not expected to show at this year's event, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will head the U.S. delegation. British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the entire European Parliament have also declined to turn up. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Francois Hollande have confirmed they will be going. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will also be there, as will India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao expected to attend. Also present will be representatives of so-called ""stakeholder"" groups deemed crucial for future environmental decision making. These include organizations speaking for children, indigenous peoples, workers, farmers and the business sector. A huge security operation will also be deployed to safeguard the summit. In all an estimated 50,000 representatives from 190 countries are expected, including around 120 heads of state and government. See also: Teenager gives world leaders her vision for the future . What will they talk about? The summit will essentially look at how to safeguard global economic growth without destroying the planet in the process. It also aims to ensure that any new environmental policies will transcend international borders. Within these goals, there are key areas of discussion, including food security, water and energy -- and a focus on developing countries. Drafting an agenda and getting everyone to agree to talk about it is has not been easy, however. Ahead of the summit there have been weeks of haggling between participants. With so many vested interests, organizers have struggled to whittle down hundreds of pages of recommendations and goals into a manageable document. Why is it important? The world's environment has continued to suffer since the 1992 summit. The World Wildlife Fund's recent Living Planet report said the ever-swelling global population is still consuming far more than can be replenished. The report said there was a widening and ""potentially catastrophic"" gap between the ecological footprints of rich and poor nations. Global consumption of natural resources, carbon emissions and poverty have all continued to increase. Although some contest such claims, scientific research points to a steady rise in world temperature which, if unchecked, is forecast to have catastrophic consequences for the planet. See also: Extinction threat 'a call to leaders' at Rio summit . What do organizers hope to achieve? It is hoped that the conference will lay the groundwork for a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) that can be adopted worldwide. A text produced by negotiators, but still to be approved by world leaders at Rio, lists processes to establish ""action-oriented"" SDGs. If adopted the text would also strengthen the U.N. Environment Program and ultimately lead to better protection for the world's oceans. Will they succeed? Few expect hard and fast policies to be put in place after three days of discussion and the likelihood is that participants will sign up to a document committing themselves to further action in the future. What is open to question is how effective that document will be given the struggle to build consensus ahead of the conference. The absence of key players like Obama has cast a shadow, as has the relative failure of the 1997 ""Kyoto Protocol"" on limiting greenhouse gases, which was set in motion at the 1992 Rio summit. There are also numerous sticking points. Wealthy and poorer nations are likely to argue over sharing the burden of cutting carbon emissions. There have been concerns over the exclusion of references to basic human rights, such as access to water. Environmental monitoring methods are also expected to spark dissent. Pessimists say any agreement will be negated by the compromises needed to win universal approval. In a statement released by environmental group WWF on Tuesday, director general Jim Leape criticized revisions to the Rio +20 negotiating text made in recent days, calling it a ""colossal failure of leadership and vision from diplomats."" He said the summit is ""doomed to ridicule"" unless world leaders ""get serious about sustainable development."" But others, including UK Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, have commended the commitment to SDGs outlined in the negotiating text.","More than 100 world leaders are expected at Rio +20, but President Obama unlikely to show .
Summit aims to reach a plan on how to sustain economic growth without destroying the planet .
Difficulty in reaching a consensus among different vested interests could mean watered-down outcome ."
"(CNN) -- A flood of details has emerged in the past 24 hours about the case of Ariel Castro and the three women police say he held for close to a decade inside his modest Cleveland home. Based on an initial incident report obtained by CNN, we know the women -- Amanda Berry, 27; Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, 23; and Michelle Knight, 32 -- say they were beaten and sexually abused. One says she suffered at least five miscarriages induced by starvation and beating. And we know they only rarely, and briefly, left the home on Seymour Avenue that had become their prison. But some questions remain unanswered in this case. Here's a look at a few of them: . Did anyone know? And if not, how could that be? It seems implausible -- three women, and later a child, held captive for close to a decade within a 1,400-square-foot home in a densely populated urban neighborhood without anyone else knowing. Wouldn't his brothers or other relatives, his children -- somebody -- have noticed something strange going on? At first, authorities seemed to think so: they arrested Castro and his two brothers on Monday, saying initially that the brothers were linked to the investigation. On Tuesday, however, they said that didn't seem to be the case. One explanation may be Castro's penchant for obsessive privacy around his home, according to the father of his late common-law wife. Ishmael Figueroa once shared a home with his daughter, Grimilda Figueroa, and Castro. Figueroa lived downstairs, the couple lived upstairs. Castro, he says, would never let anyone visit the second floor. And when Castro and Grimilda Figueroa moved to the house on Seymour Avenue -- where the women were later discovered -- Castro wouldn't even let family members through the front door. ""Ariel kept everybody at a distance,"" said Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba. Timeline: From missing to liberated . Could Castro be charged with murder? It's an intriguing question. Ohio is one of 38 states with a fetal homicide law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Authorities have searched Castro's home and found no evidence of human remains. But in her initial interview Monday with police, Knight told investigators that she had suffered at least five miscarriages, according to the incident report obtained by CNN. Castro would starve and punch her in the stomach to induce miscarriage, Knight said, according to the document. Authorities haven't publicly discussed such an idea, but CNN affiliate WOIO -- citing multiple law enforcement sources -- said authorities are investigating the possibility of murder charges against Castro. Will anyone get the reward? Berry's and DeJesus' disappearances were frequently in the news, and a $25,000 reward was on offer in the case. In the immediate aftermath of Berry's daring escape, speculation centered on whether Charles Ramsey, one of two neighbors who came to her aid, deserved the reward. Ramsey himself suggested the money should go to the women. Authorities haven't concluded who, if anyone, should get the money, but are discussing it, Tomba said. ""That is going to be up to the entities that put up that reward money and what their protocol is, but Mr. Ramsey does deserve something. A lot of credit and he is the true key to this case,"" Tomba said.","Did anyone know?
Could Castro face murder charges?
What about the $25,000 reward?"
"(CNN) -- North Korea for the first time publicly specified the ""hostile acts"" that landed Kenneth Bae a 15-year sentence at a labor camp. The Korean-American tour operator set up anti-North Korean bases in China and distributed anti-regime literature, a spokesman for the North Korean Supreme Court told the state-run KCNA news agency. ""He committed such hostile acts as egging citizens of the DPRK overseas and foreigners on to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign against it,"" the court said, using the acronym of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Bae, who the North Koreans refer to as Pae Jun Ho, was arrested November 3 after arriving as a tourist in Rason city, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. He was later sentenced, but authorities until now had not elaborated on what he was accused of. READ MORE: Dennis Rodman asks Kim Jong Un to let U.S. citizen go . Bae was ""caught red-handed"" when he entered Rason City with anti-North Korea literature, the court said. He was accused of preaching at churches and lecturing to groups about the need to escalate confrontation, the court said. The statement said that the court did not allow Bae to have an attorney after he refused to give a plea, as North Korean law instructs. Bae confessed to his crimes, the court said, according to KCNA, and ""they were clearly proved in an objective manner by evidence and testimonies."" In previous instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitary -- in recent cases, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. But Bae's case could get caught up in the recent tensions between North Korea and the United States. The news comes on the heels of weeks of superheated rhetoric from North Korea, which conducted its third nuclear test in February and launched a satellite into orbit atop a long-range rocket in December. Washington responded by deploying additional missile interceptors on the West Coast, dispatching a missile defense system to the Pacific territory of Guam and bolstering annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises with overflights by nuclear-capable B-2 and B-52 bombers. But the intensity of the North's rhetoric appears to have subsided recently, and the U.S.-South Korean drills finished this week, removing another source of friction. CNN's Dana Ford, Jethro Mullen and K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","Korean-American Kenneth Bae was sentenced to 15 years at a labor camp .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf is back in Pakistan after years of self-imposed exile and is facing a hard time from courts in Pakistan amid a range of charges, including claims he illegally placed senior judges under house arrest during a period of emergency rule he imposed in 2007. Likely to add to his charge sheet, Musharraf recently gave an interview to CNN's Nic Robertson when he admitted that he had given the U.S. permission on a ""very few"" occasions to strike targets within Pakistan. Musharraf, an army general who overthrew a democratically elected government during a 1999 coup, had previously remained silent about the strikes Washington carried out under his tenure. But Musharraf left power in 2008, so why has he waited until now to speak? One obvious reason is sheer self-interest. Musharraf returned to Pakistan last month after five years of self-imposed exile in London and Dubai. He did so under the false belief that he might still be popular among the people and that he might be able to reclaim power in the upcoming elections. But upon his arrival he found only hostility. Pakistanis may not be happy with the way the country is being run now, but most don't want to see the return of a dictator who brokered secret deals that resulted in the deaths of so many innocent Pakistanis. Open hostility is not all Musharraf has faced, though. The Supreme Court has ordered Musharraf to appear before them on charges of treason, a crime punishable by death in Pakistan. Several lower courts are also considering murder charges against Musharraf for his role in several killings, including that of several seminary students at Islamabad's Red Mosque during a confrontation with security forces in 2007. The Supreme Court has banned Musharraf from leaving the country and his name has been placed on an exit control list. He is currently under house arrest at his ranch compound outside the capital. Musharraf himself believes the claims are politically motivated. It is, therefore, no surprise that Musharraf has chosen now to speak out about U.S. drone strikes. If he can appease the Americans again, perhaps the U.S. administration will once again ride to his rescue. He has given President Barack Obama's administration a much-needed headline of Pakistani support for U.S. drone strikes. But the headline itself is misleading. First, Musharraf's statement involved only a limited number of strikes, those conducted during the administration of President George W. Bush. His consent does not extend beyond those strikes to cover those carried out under Obama, when the intensity of drone strikes escalated dramatically to form the bulk of all drone strikes. Of the 367 drone strikes, only 52 were carried out before President Obama came into office, according to the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ). Under the Obama administration, Pakistan's parliament, in two different sessions, has declared the strikes both illegal and counter-productive. Unlike under Musharraf, the current parliament is democratically elected and speaks with the authority of the constitution behind it. There are also serious questions about whether Musharraf's consent was even valid for the few he supposedly approved. Any consent would have to comply with Pakistan's constitutional laws. The High Court in the Pakistani city of Peshawar considered this question recently. During his oral arguments, the Chief Justice made it clear that the Pakistani constitution protects its citizens' right to life and that no political leader can consent to an abrogation of that right without due process. The reality is drones -- with or without consent -- are a seductive option for the leader of the free world. It is good politics to keep America ""safe"" by engaging in a war that only lines up body bags on the other side. In this war, the human losses that normally bring an end to war -- like those in Vietnam -- don't exist. Even more seductive is the ability to wage war without oversight. For years, the CIA has refused to tell anyone who it may be killing. We're supposed to have faith in the CIA's good nature and their claims that they are only killing bad guys. In fact the claim drone strikes are killing only al Qaeda simply is not true -- I personally represent more than 100 civilian victims of strikes and they are absolutely not militants. According to nonpartisan public policy group, the New American Foundation, drones strikes have killed at least 1,990 Pakistanis, including hundreds of civilians. Obama campaigned and was elected on a platform of change, one that would end the abuses and torture so prevalent during the early years of the so-called war on terror. More than four years later, the ""change"" Obama has brought to Pakistan through drones has resulted in more needless deaths, daily suicide attacks, and growing instability. For the average Pakistani, whether a murderous, corrupt dictator consented to this brand of change is irrelevant. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mirza Shahzad Akbar.","Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf recently returned from exile .

"(CNN) -- The ear-splitting crack of 101 rounds of artillery will mark the final moment before late Cambodian King-Father Norodom Sihanouk is cremated Monday in a specially built crematorium outside the Royal Palace. Sihanouk's son and successor King Norodom Sihamoni and Queen-Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk were set to light the funeral flame at 6 p.m local time (6 a.m. ET), almost four months after the king's death last October at the age of 90. Obituary: Former Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk . The somber event comes on the fourth day of an elaborate seven day Royal Funeral Ceremony, which started on Friday when the late king's body was carried on a winding route through the capital Phonm Penh to the open square of Veal Preah Merhu. ""Everybody had on a pin, a brooch with a black and white ribbon and photograph of the king. People were holding photos of the king in their hands. A lot of people were crying, holding their hands in the worshiping position. (I was) very touched, very moved,"" said Joyce Clark, vice president of programs at the Friends of Khmer Culture from Phonm Penh. CNN iReport: King Sihanouk's Funeral Procession . On Monday, throngs of people wearing white, the color of mourning in Cambodia, some with their heads shaved, continued to queue for their chance to file past the crematorium. Many were weeping and stopped to kneel, their palms pressed together and heads bowed in a sampeah, a sign of respect. Attendants ushered them on to make way for yet more mourners as the hours passed until the king's cremation. Foreign leaders and dignitaries from 16 countries were expected to attend the Royal Cremation Ceremony, including the prime ministers of France, Vietnam and Thailand. Also present will be more than 400 prisoners who were pardoned as a gesture to mark the king's passing. Sihanouk died while in Beijing on October 15, 2012 of natural causes, according to Cambodia's official AKP news agency. His body was flown home to the Royal Palace two days later where it had been lying in state before the weekend process. Sihanouk reigned over Cambodia for more than 60 years before he abdicated in 2004 due to poor health, according to the king's official website. A panel elected Sihamoni as the new king. Cambodia's National Assembly then decided to give Sihanouk the title of King Father, allowing him the same privileges he has as the reigning monarch, according to his website. Sihanouk saw Cambodia go from French rule to independence, then to the brutal Khmer Rouge regime and the guerrilla war that followed its toppling. He then watched his country develop into the constitutional monarchy it is today. He came from a royal lineage, but it was France that placed Sihanouk on the throne in 1941, according to the foreign ministry of Australia, which has played a key role in Cambodia's transition toward peace. The king dissolved the nation's parliament in 1953, which helped bring about Cambodia's independence. Two years later, he abdicated the throne to his father but remained active as Cambodia's prime minister. In 1960, he became the South Asian nation's head of state following his father's death. In the 1960s, amid a region simmering with conflicts such as the Vietnam War, Cambodia soon became home to a number of North Vietnamese training camps. That prompted U.S. air strikes on those camps in 1969. CNN iReport: The King Father Returns to Cambodia . The following year, U.S.-backed Gen. Lon Nol declared a coup d'etat while the king was on an official visit to the Soviet Union and abolished the monarchy. Sihanouk aligned with the Khmer Rouge, a growing ultra-Maoist group which sought to transform Cambodia into an agrarian utopia. The king, forced into exile in China, led the resistance movement, while the Khmer Rouge gradually gained strength. When the group, led by Pol Pot, won control of Cambodia in 1975, Sihanouk returned as head of state. But by the following year, he was placed under house arrest. From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge led a bloody period of mass killings, public executions and torture centers. While no one knows for certain how many people were killed by the regime, experts estimate 1.7 million fatalities -- or at least a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died from executions, diseases, starvation and overwork . Sihanouk himself lost five children and 14 grandchildren at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. He was confined to the royal palace until Pol Pot was overthrown three years later. He was away from Cambodia from 1979 to 1991. The king subsequently became president of the new republic, but it wasn't until 1993 -- when Cambodia held its first parliamentary elections -- that the king's powers were restored and Cambodia became a constitutional monarchy. Elizabeth Becker, the author of ""When the War Was Over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution,"" told CNN after the king abdicated in 2004 that Sihanouk was ""larger than life"" and brought both good and bad to his country. He tried to bring Cambodia into the modern world and protect it from its neighbors, but he brought about divisions in the process, she said. ""He threw his prestige and politics behind the Khmer Rouge when they started the rebellion and it was his name that helped convince a lot of peasants to go along with the Khmer Rouge,"" Becker told CNN. ""Then later, after the Vietnamese invasion, he continued to help the Khmer Rouge at the United Nations with political prestige, so his is a very checkered legacy.""","Late Cambodia King-Father Norodom Sihanouk cremated Monday in Phnom Penh .

"(CNN) -- For most of us, it's hard to relate to the images of destruction we see on the television screen. It's nearly impossible to imaging losing it all. But for the residents of Joplin, it's all too familiar. Monday's massive EF5 tornado that tore through 17 miles of Moore, Oklahoma, brought back dark memories for those who survived the similarly powerful twister in Joplin almost two years earlier. Seeing footage of Moore, Oklahoma, takes Jennifer Parr right back to May 22, 2011, the day an EF5 tornado ravaged Joplin and killed more than 150 people. ""I can still feel the shock, the awe, the sadness,"" she said. ""I can still remember the smell too. It smelled like freshly cut wood."" CNN iReport followed up with Parr and other Joplin tornado survivors to find out how they moved on after the tragedy. They offered the following advice to the people of Moore: . 'Let others help you' Processing emotions has been difficult since Parr lost her entire home in the tornado. Two years later, the 32-year-old continues to work with a therapist. Talking out her struggles has helped her ""move forward and not stay stuck in the past,"" she said. ""There are some days it is still hard to comprehend what I went through."" Shock and adrenaline carried her through the first days after the tornado. But after that, she said she didn't know what to do. Parr empathizes with what the people of Moore are going through this week, remembering her own difficult experience. ""Right now it feels impossible to start picking up the pieces, not knowing where to even start,"" she recalled. Leaning on friends and family in the area helped as she started to piece her life back together. Her advice to Moore residents is simple: ""Let others help you, even when you think you don't need the help."" 'With patience we always get it right' Fernando Martinez hails from a Navy family and spent most of his life moving around. But when his grandparents retired, Joplin became home. The day of the tornado, Martinez, his parents, grandparents and niece were all home together. Everyone survived, but the tornado tore their lives apart. His mother was drained ""emotionally"" from the experience, so she and his father uprooted and moved to California. The rest of the family stayed in Joplin. ""I could never leave this town, and I have tried,"" said the 25-year-old. ""I just keep coming back."" It was Martinez's close-knit family and his friends that helped him get through the months of wrangling with insurance companies and repairing the damage to the house. ""I think that when you experience something so traumatic and difficult to understand, you become stronger willed and it hardens your emotions a bit, making you a bit braver,"" he said. Moving on though requires living on, Martinez said. ""Life sucks sometimes, and we are sometimes given the worst hands when playing, but with patience, we always get it right and we always win."" 'It helps prevent panic' Ben Callihan may have returned to his day-to-day life quickly after repairing the $2,000 worth of damage to his Joplin home, but the storm affected him psychologically. He and his roommate called their mothers as the twister barreled through their neighborhood. ""The calls lost connection, and when the tornado was next to us it sounded like a clothes dryer, with footballs being kicked at my house every couple of seconds,"" he recalled. These days, the 32-year-old lifelong Joplin resident is a lot more wary about inclement weather. ""Twice in the last month during tornado sirens I have sped to the temporary FEMA shelters in another town,"" he said, even though he knows that he should hunker down in the nearest available shelter, as FEMA recommends. Callihan, who survived by hiding in his bathtub, has found it comforting to make his way to a shelter even when the weather is less dangerous than a tornado. ""It helps prevent panic,"" he explained. He encouraged tornado survivors to take advantage of free counseling and therapy that may be provided in Moore.","Two years ago, a massive tornado swept through Joplin, Missouri, killing 150 people.

"(CNN) -- It's no miracle that Wendy Owan won't be stuck in highway traffic Christmas Day, carrying covered dishes to a family celebration in Brooklyn, New York. The Queens resident made sure of it months ago. Owan and her adult daughter will be leaving winter behind as they embark on the Carnival Miracle on Christmas Eve, setting sail for a seven-day cruise to Port Canaveral, followed by Nassau and Freeport in the Bahamas. They return New Year's Day. ""I've never cruised during the holidays before, but I am so looking forward to leaving all the stress behind for eight wonderfully relaxing days at sea,"" said Owan, the New York School of Urban Ministry's director of ministry services, who has been doing post-Sandy relief work for weeks. ""The Miracle apparently has a dome of some sort that can enclose the pool. I'm hoping for snow so that I can sail away in the midst of it in the pool."" Share your picks: Where to eat like a local . The prospect of traveling to a relative's home for the holidays or hosting all of those relatives leaves some people running for the hills -- or the sea, or the nearest resort. When everyone's a guest, no one relative or family has to bear the burden of taking care of everyone else. And no one relative gets to decide whose holiday traditions will be followed during the holiday season. About 84 million Americans say they plan to travel over the holidays this year, according to a recent American Express Travel Spending and Saving Tracker Survey. Many of them aren't traveling to anyone's home, say American Express travel agents. Resorts and cruise lines are popular choices . ""I have so many clients that are actually looking to get away during the holidays, with large resorts and cruise lines being among the most popular,"" said American Express Travel agent Debbie Wynne-Parry. ""Some may want to take advantage of those extra holiday days off so they don't burn as many vacation days during the year. Others may want to get away from the inclement weather, not want to deal with the hassle of cooking and cleaning. And many people are even turning to holiday vacations in lieu of presents, especially in cases where the family's children are a bit older."" Relaxation is usually the name of the game for people looking to get away for the holidays. ""For a multigenerational family, a cruise is a great way to meet up on one place but not meet up on anyone's home turf,"" said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic. ""There's less chance for family conflicts. You have your own space and time on a trip, but you can get together for dinner. You're not smooshed together all the time."" Five real-life wonderlands . Cruises are pricey, but ships do take care of meals and most decorations, leaving guests to decorate their room doors if they like. But if you want to get rooms near each other, Brown advises booking for next year about nine months in advance. And buy travel insurance, she says, in case anyone gets sick or hurt in the meantime. Land-based resorts also take care of the Christmas cheer and dÃ©cor. Kingsmill Resort in Williamsburg, Virginia, tries to attend to every Christmas detail for its guests, many of whom come 15 to a group year after year. Some holiday packages even include a small Christmas tree in the suite, so children can still find Santa's presents under a tree by the fireplace. Other holiday touches include carolers greeting guests at the entrance, Saturday lunches with Santa and sleigh rides that end up by the firepit with s'mores. ""You can still wake up Christmas morning with a tree by the fireplace and breakfast in our dining room with a buffet prepared by our chef,"" said Allison Patterson, Kingsmill's events director. ""It makes you feel like you're home for the holidays, but you don't have to make the beds or wash the dishes."" Everyone's on ""neutral ground"" San Franciscan Debbie Dare doesn't look for a ""traditional"" East Coast snowy holiday for her Christmas celebration. She's looking for fun, kitsch, good Chinese food and poker with her mom for her Christmas celebration in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is ""neutral ground (not going to any one's hometown of Los Angeles or San Francisco), it's bright and shiny (there's always something new, a restaurant, another tacky celebrity niche store), the Chinese food in their Chinatown is excellent, and there's constant entertainment as nothing ever closes in Vegas, even on Christmas,"" Dare wrote in an e-mail. Eight hotels that do the holidays right . Her family members have even established their own ""Christmas in Vegas"" rituals. ""My favorite thing is to sit next to my mom and play pai gow poker. She taught me how. I always ask her for advice, each and every hand, and she does her 'mmmmmm, not like that' or when looking at her own hand, 'Jeezus, I got nothing!' I'm nervous and happy at the same time."" That works for her six-member family, which doesn't include any small children. But if you're still traveling with small ones, you may want a more traditional Christmas. Make a plan for Santa and his presents . That can be hard to do via airplane, because anything that Santa brings on Christmas Day must be lugged back whenever you depart. (Driving vacations make it easier if you have trunk space.) After all, what child wants to wait until their best presents are shipped back? Consider trading the non-Santa presents before or after your travels and bringing stockings so there are some presents to open on Christmas Day. If the family includes Santa believers, American Express Travel's Wynne-Perry suggests having them write Santa a letter to tell him where you'll be during Christmas. Consider adjoining or interconnecting rooms for more family time (if you want it). If you enjoy them, stick to the same rituals on vacation as you would at home. Make any restaurant reservations well in advance. And be aware of any baggage that comes with some presents, like battery requirements or travel rules. (Airline security frowns on Daisy Red Ryder BB guns.) Top U.S. travel spots for 2013 . And talk to your children, says Eileen Gunn, founder of FamiliesGo!, a family travel website. ""When the kids are 2 or 3 years old, they'll go along with whatever you say,"" even that Santa came early or is coming later, Gunn said. ""At 6 or 7, they start asking questions. It depends on your kids, their ages and their inquisitiveness."" Drama may follow you on vacation . And remember you can't completely escape the family drama if you're traveling with the family that causes the drama (including yourself). ""You're not leaving everything when you travel with family,"" said Pauline Wallin, a psychologist with a practice in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. ""There's an initial settling-in period when everyone is nice to each other. The way you interact with family on neutral territory won't necessarily show up for the first 24 to 48 hours. After that, you become like your family is used to becoming. At least when it starts to grate on you (at a resort), you can retreat to the pool."" Just don't be surprised if Aunt Susie makes a comment about your weight or Uncle Harold teases you about not being married yet. ""If you can predict this going to happen, why are you so surprised when it does?"" asked Wallin. ""Remember that Christmas Day is just 24 hours. You can get through 24 hours. People can hold it together when there's a time limit."" Where are you going for the holidays? What are you hoping to find or avoid?

"(CNN) -- An otherwise lazy Sunday suddenly morphed into a manic Sid day. At 2 p.m. November 20, the Pittsburgh Penguins' public-relations staff was informed that the world's most famous hockey player -- who had not played in 319 days on account of the world's most famous concussion -- planned to lace up his skates 29 hours later against the New York Islanders. At 3 p.m., the Penguins broke the news on their website under the memorably modest headline ""Crosby Returns to Lineup Monday."" File that one as the sports equivalent to ""Man Walks on Moon."" At 3:01, the sports universe began to respond with the sort of urgency only a transcendent athlete could trigger. And make no mistake, the National Hockey League has only one transcendent athlete, one man who could move mountains (or at least television trucks and vacationing sports writers) on a moment's notice. USA Today hockey writer Kevin Allen was relaxing at a Detroit Lions game with his wife when the call came. He immediately made plans to cover the event. ""I'd already told my bosses, 'If Crosby comes back, I'm coming off vacation,' "" Allen said. ""I just thought, 'It's such a major story for our league.' "" He wasn't the only one. By the next afternoon, a Stanley Cup Final-sized fleet of seven TV trucks (there are normally two) had found their way to the loading docks outside Pittsburgh's Consol Energy Center. No fewer than 251 media credentials had been issued. All three major Canadian TV networks made the trip. Even ESPN -- which relinquished its NHL rights several years ago -- sent reporters to the scene and broke into programming with live updates all day. ""ESPN doing live hourly updates from an NHL arena in November? It just doesn't happen,"" said Tom McMillan, the Penguins' senior vice president of communications. Watch highlights of Crosby's return . Yeah, Crosby is that big a deal. He hasn't made the NHL must-watch TV in the United States -- even Wayne Gretzky couldn't do that -- but his impact is undeniable. He came along at precisely the right time, as the NHL emerged from its year-long lockout in 2005, and immediately established himself as the sport's marquee name. ""He's the best player in the world,"" said television analyst Jeremy Roenick, a longtime NHL player. ""If I'm going to turn on a hockey game, the first game I'm going to watch is one where Sidney Crosby is playing."" Crosby, 24, has transformed Pittsburgh into the NHL's U.S. leader in local TV ratings and its overall leader in merchandise sales. He has personally led the league in jersey sales for six straight seasons, according to the Sports Business Journal, while winning a Stanley Cup and scoring an Olympics-winning goal for Canada in 2010. Crosby's return enthralled Penguins fans, who have sold out 223 consecutive games. The Penguins B.C. -- Before Crosby -- were on the verge of being sold and relocated. Last in the league in attendance. Given up for dead. Everything changed when the team won the '05 draft lottery, on a 6.25% chance, and the right to draft ""The Kid."" The hype preceding his arrival was unprecedented. Yet he exceeded it. He usually does. ""It's hard for outsiders to understand how much Sidney Crosby means to the city,"" said Andy Conte, who chronicled the team's rebirth in the recently released best-selling book ""Breakaway."" ""Without him, the Penguins in all likelihood wouldn't be here. They would be in Kansas City, Las Vegas or some other city."" Nobody needs to recount the story to Penguins President David Morehouse, a Pittsburgh native who grew up rooting for the team. Morehouse points out that the Penguins' local TV ratings have rocketed from a pitiful average of 1.5 to well into the 8's since Crosby arrived six years ago. The team's season-ticket waiting list now exceeds 9,000. ""What Sid means to the city is not just what he does on ice but the type of person he is,"" Morehouse said. ""It's his youth and energy. He's taken what Mario (Lemieux, hockey legend and team owner) built to a whole new level. It has allowed us to build our brand in a way that has made Pittsburgh a hockey town."" The town exploded when Crosby scored on vintage backhander just 5 minutes, 24 seconds into his return game. He unintentionally punctuated his celebration with a joyous and easy-to-decipher profanity. ""Hopefully,"" Crosby said, ""everyone wasn't reading lips at home."" Rest assured, they were, and they won't soon forget the kind of where-were-you moment rarely seen at a regular-season sporting event. Calls came fast and furious to the local sports radio station, 93.7 The Fan, the next day as people relived Crosby's goal. One woman cried. A man claimed that his wife jumped on the couch and simultaneously yelled the exact phrase Crosby was mouthing on the ice. Crosby finished with two goals and two assists in a 5-0 victory. His return evoked memories of Lemieux emerging from a three-year retirement in 2000 to star in a 5-0 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. SI on Crosby's return . Crosby hasn't scored a goal since, but he easily leads the NHL in points per game (1.83) with 11 in six games. He has vaulted from nowhere to fourth among forwards in All-Star votes. The Penguins are 4-1-1 since his return and are averaging better than a half-goal more per game. But the larger story is Crosby's recovery. Concussions are a hot-button topic in the NHL and NFL these days. Unaware that he might have been concussed, Crosby initially returned to the lineup only five days after absorbing a head shot from then-Washington forward David Steckel at January's Winter Classic. He sustained another head hit in his next game. After that, Crosby was determined to heal fully. His advice to other athletes: ""I wouldn't come back until you're 100%. That's my advice, and however long it takes, it's worth the wait, making sure you listen to your body."" Crosby faced mounting criticism for not returning sooner. He bucked the sporting culture that says, ""Shake it off."" His respect for the recovery process could become a significant piece of his legacy, depending on how his comeback plays out. ""I do think the way this went down, the way it was managed and the outcome we've had so far, could change the culture of concussion management,"" said Dr. Micky Collins, who began treating Crosby in January. ""It's the most powerful case I've ever been involved in."" Collins is director of the UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program, the nation's busiest clinical practice for sports-related concussions. He sees thousands of patients each year, from elementary school athletes to professional stars. He treated Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow after Tebow sustained a concussion while at the University of Florida. Crosby's injury was more severe. And more closely monitored. ""I heard from NFL players, Major League Baseball players, soccer players, they were all interested in how this went,"" Collins said. ""It was unlike with any athlete I've seen. All eyes were on Sid going through this. I'm talking about parents, kids, pro athletes, community members, friends. Kids would tell me they felt a ray of hope with someone like him going though it, too. ""I hope it sends a message that this injury does have to be managed very carefully, and that if managed effectively, you can prevent bad outcomes."" Collins, who along with Penguins team physician Charles Burke cleared Crosby to return, won't soon forget the comeback game. ""I felt an incredible sense of pride,"" Collins said. ""I didn't feel nervous. I felt good."" By the end of the night, everybody felt good. Better than good, actually. They felt Sid-sational.","Sidney Crosby, hockey's biggest star, missed almost a year with a concussion .

"(CNN) -- Two people, including pro football player Donte Stallworth, were hospitalized Saturday after the hot air balloon they were riding in crashed into power lines in Miami, police said. A third passenger in the balloon was not injured. Police responded to calls at around 10 a.m. about the basket of the hot air balloon crashing into the power lines while airborne. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash with the help of Miami-Dade police, Detective Roy Rutland said. Video from CNN affiliate WSVN showed the basket (where people stand) upright on a two-lane road, while the envelope (the balloon part) sat some distance nearby. Stallworth suffered severe burns and is in stable condition at Miami's Kendall Regional Medical Center, said his attorney, Christopher Lyons. The wide receiver was in the balloon with a female friend when the accident occurred, according to Lyons. The lawyer did not name the woman or detail her condition. The third person was operating the balloon, according to local media reports. The California native began his NFL career in 2002 with the New Orleans Saints and most recently played for the New England Patriots. His is currently a free agent. Drew Rosenhaus, Stallworth's sports agent, said his client is ""in good spirits."" ""He was injured, but will be fine,"" said Rosenhaus, adding later that he hopes Stallworth is back playing ""in a matter of weeks."" ""He will be able to resume his NFL career."" Beyond his on-field exploits -- from his time at the University of Tennessee to his years playing with the Saints, Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens and Washington Redskins -- Stallworth is known for hitting and killing a construction worker crossing a street in Miami in 2009. Under a plea agreement, Stallworth was sentenced to 30 days in jail for DUI manslaughter. He also reached an ""amicable"" settlement with the Reyes family, his lawyer, Lyons, said. The NFL also suspended him for one season. CNN's Rick Martin and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: NFL player Donte Stallworth could be playing again in ""weeks,"" his agent says .

"(CNN) -- Recently, technology enthusiasts around the planet had the opportunity to get better acquainted with Elon Musk, the creator of SpaceX, the first privately owned company to send a spacecraft to the space station. Launched in the same manner as a Silicon Valley startup, SpaceX designed and manufactured the Dragon capsule, which successfully completed a mission with the International Space Station before splashing down into the Pacific Ocean. I see Musk, a 40-year-old entrepreneur who made his fortune by co-founding PayPal, as a ""visioneer."" That is to say, he is someone who combines scientific and engineering prowess -- in his case, a degree in physics -- with an expansive view of how technology will upend traditional economic models, and has the ability to inspire others to support his work. Musk has bold visions for the future. When he finished college, he identified three areas that could change the world. One was the Internet; another was new sources of energy; and the third was transforming our civilization in such a way so that it could expand out into the solar system. His success with PayPal and then with Tesla Motors -- a company he started that makes high-performance electric roadsters -- pushed him to take on the challenge of SpaceX. The successful launch of Dragon was a big step toward the completion of Musk's trifecta. Musk's entrepreneurial activities rest on the shoulders of previous visioneers. In the 1970s, Princeton physicist Gerard O'Neill achieved celebrity status for designing and advocating free-floating space colonies as the new frontier for humanity. In 1977, when California hosted its first Space Day, O'Neill's ideas were discussed by scientists, aerospace executives and politicians, including then-Gov. Jerry Brown. While today, such visions of the future seem fantastical -- space colonies ... really? -- they make more sense if seen in the context of their time. In O'Neill's day, fears of overpopulation, resource shortages and general eco-catastrophism permeated public discussions and popular culture as people fretted about an impending era of limits. Compared with that era's other mega-projects such as the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, O'Neill's ideas were not so far-fetched. Musk has inherited O'Neill's concept for the ""humanization of space."" But like other dot-com billionaires who make up the so-called NewSpace movement, his pursuits have a decided libertarian strain. Many visioneers champion free markets, less government, fewer regulations and profits for those who test the technological envelope. This is different from what O'Neill had in mind, which aimed mostly to benefit society at large. Musk may be the most prominent visioneer, but he is not the only one. Recently, the New York Times profiled J. Craig Venter, the biologist-entrepreneur who is hoping to create bioengineered bacteria that can generate food and fuel for an increasingly crowded planet. Then there are others who have proposed radical geoengineering schemes, such as injecting tons of sunlight-reflecting particulates into the stratosphere as a way to address the threat of climate change. So far, America has remained the No.1 destination for people such as Musk or Venter. As the rest of the world catches up -- think China -- and competes with us on innovation and technology, we must make sure that our country can continue to attract brilliant minds who can take speculative ideas out of the hands of sci-fi writers and technological forecasters and put them on firmer ground. The U.S. government as well as private groups like the X Prize Foundation can play an important role in stimulating and helping budding visioneers through prizes, funding or other forms of support. For someone like Musk, the present is merely a prototype -- a provisional plan for what may become a magnificent and perhaps less limited future. Who knows, his trailblazing might just make it feasible and affordable for you to take a vacation to Mars. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of W. Patrick McCray.","SpaceX successfully launched the Dragon capsule to the space station .

"(CNN) -- Our country is obsessed with the perils of attractive young white women, as this week's trio of high profile crime stories about Amanda Knox, Jodi Arias and the Cleveland kidnapping victims demonstrates. We don't see breathless coverage of the disproportionately large number of African-American men tried for crimes in our system. We see almost no coverage of missing boys, or missing children of color, or crimes against nonwhites. This week an African-American man in Mississippi, Willie Manning, was about to be executed, though he was denied access to DNA testing. Manning, convicted of murdering two college students in 1994, maintains his innocence and requested the scientific testing, which has exonerated many convicted murderers, including some on death row. The Mississippi Supreme Court denied that request and ordered his execution. At the last moment, U.S. Justice Department letters tipped the balance in favor of a reprieve. Few media outlets considered the monumental constitutional issues, or even the dramatic ticking clock toward his execution, worthy of mention. Isn't the fact that we still execute Americans without giving them access to DNA testing a stunning, significant story? Yet it got next to no attention. Instead, in the last week thousands of hours of attention have been devoted to every detail of just three crime stories. In Phoenix, Arizona, Jodi Arias (whose father is Latino) was convicted Wednesday of first degree murder, after the jury unanimously found that she intentionally and with premeditation killed her former boyfriend, Travis Alexander. The trial was covered live on HLN and followed closely on social media and other television networks. The next phase of the trial is scheduled to begin May 15. In Cleveland, Ohio, Amanda Berry reportedly screamed for help, a neighbor came to her aid, and she, her 6-year-old daughter, and two women, Gina DeJesus (who is Latina) and Michelle Knight were freed after a decade of captivity. Ariel Castro was charged today with kidnapping and rape. Amanda Knox, the American college student who was convicted, then acquitted of the murder of her roommate in Italy, has given tearful interviews in connection with her book tour, as an Italian court has reversed again and held that she should stand trial again for the charges. Each of these cases includes salacious allegations and high-stakes outcomes. The Cleveland victims were reportedly raped and beaten countless times over the years. Amanda Knox is accused of killing her roommate as part of a drug-fueled sex game. Jodi Arias posed nude for photos and had sex with her victim just before she murdered him. While each of these crime stories is worthy of news coverage -- especially the Cleveland story, which involved serious questions of alleged law enforcement lapses -- many others are equally worthy yet receive little or no attention, even as every detail of the high-profile stories is pored over and rehashed. Missing children websites carry pictures of many African-American and Latino kids who have disappeared, and photos of little boys who have vanished. News outlets rarely feature their stories. Their families grieve their absence and yearn for media coverage that could help find their children and energize law enforcement. And the biggest American crime story of all receives the least mention: that we now incarcerate more of our own people than any other country on earth, or in human history, and that minority males are disproportionately policed, arrested and convicted, and sentenced to harsher sentences. African-American juveniles are six times as likely as whites to be sentenced to prison for identical crimes. In Washington, three out of every four black men can expect some time behind bars in their lifetimes. In Baltimore and Chicago, the majority of young black men are currently under the control of the criminal justice system. In sheer numbers, more African-Americans are under correctional control today than were enslaved at the time of the Civil War. Our disastrous war on drugs has devastated inner-city communities, and led to large numbers of African-Americans being legally barred from voting, jury duty, public housing, food stamps, student loans, and many other civic rights and benefits, often for life. We cannot fix these problems if we are unaware of them. We cannot get a groundswell for reform if we are distracted by titillating outlier stories. The media choose which stories to make high profile, driven by public interest in those stories. We cannot call ourselves a nation of equals until we pay equal attention to all those in our criminal justice system whose stories merit our attention, regardless of their race or gender. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Bloom.","Lisa Bloom: Americans are obsessed with the perils of young, attractive white women .

"(CNN) -- What if robots ruled the world of golf? A fanciful notion perhaps, but already many tasks formerly performed by humans are now carried out by mechanical devices. And the same maxim is very much in evidence in golf, where products such as balls and clubs only reach the marketplace after being tested to perfection using robotic technology. One developer has mooted the possibility of metal caddies and robot suits to help with coaching, in a sport where human error on the course is cruelly exposed. An industry leader in this field is California-based Golf Laboratories Inc., whose founder Gene Parente saw a gap in the market when he started his company in 1990 -- and is now hoping to invent a fully robotic player. 'Iron Byron' led the way . Two decades ago, cutting-edge technology centered around a robotic-armed machine nicknamed ""The Iron Byron"" (after legendary U.S. golfer Byron Nelson). It relied on air pressure and pneumatics to generate club-head speed. The contraption was effectively a giant garage door spring, with three speeds: slow, medium and fast. Iron Byron's drawback was that it could only swing one way, whereas no ""human"" swing is exactly the same. Parente and his partner Sean Dynes incorporated robot technology and computer control drive systems to produce a much more sophisticated testing mechanism. ""If you can swing a golf club, we can simulate it,"" Parente told CNN. The approach has revolutionized the industry, enabling manufacturers to tailor their equipment to golfers of different abilities -- because not everyone has the athleticism to generate the 130 mph club-head speed of a Woods or a Bubba Watson. But Parente is not content with that level of perfection, and decided to take his company's innovations a stage further with a prototype robot golfer that will take to the course and hopefully battle the pros. ""It's more for the entertainment aspect than anything else,"" admitted Parente, who said he was in talks with partners to develop the project. Limited capability . Technology has clearly come a long way since the Sony Corporation introduced Qrio to the world in 2004. The likeable robot figure may have been able to hand the winner's check to Ernie Els at the Japanese company's sponsored PGA Tour tournament, but its capability was limited. At public demonstrations it could merely putt a ball into a large hole on a mat. Parente's ambitions extend a little further, inspired by the likes of the computer Deep Blue taking on chess grandmasters before large televised audiences. ""To be able to tackle something as difficult as golf takes this to another level,"" he said. While ""Man versus Robot"" has an obvious appeal, the majority of commercial applications in golf and other areas are generally based on the principle of ""Robot helping Man."" Perhaps this is because, as Parente flags up, there is a ""fascination/fear"" of the Terminator movie scenario where humans are enslaved by a ruthless robotic super race -- a similar theme also explored in the film RoboCop. But as Indianapolis-based company Precise Path Inc. has proved, robots can be put to more peaceful purposes and are very good at mowing grass. They have spent over five years perfecting the technology that sees its patented mower able to cut golf course greens and fairways to perfection. Robot mower ready to roll . The robot mower is programed by its users to carry out work on a designated part of the course, and will carry on with the task to completion, come rain or shine. Jason Zielke, chief operating officer and president of Precise Path, claims their product will change the face of golf course maintenance. ""Removing humans from that process has the combined benefit of a significant improvement in quality and consistency,"" he told CNN. Precise Path was used for one half of a course in Florida, with normal green-keeping staff cutting the grass on the other. Zielke claimed the greens mowed by the robot ""rolled about a foot faster"" than the others; in other words, they were smoother and better running. Precise Path will go to market in 2012 and Zielke believes its applications will extend to other sports playing fields and public open spaces, saving large amounts in upkeep costs and freeing up staff for other duties. Such advanced technology is expensive and remains outside the budget of the ordinary household, so robots cutting your lawn at home or employed in other tasks such as vacuum cleaning may be a little way off. But according to Rich Mahoney, the director of robotics at California's SRI International, the technologies employed in robotics and modern consumer electronics are converging. Increased availability . ""The cost of some robots is decreasing and the availability of certain types of robots is increasing,"" said Mahoney, whose research team is developing low-cost technologies and robotic applications. Extending this to golf, one of these might be in the form of your own personal caddy. ""Imagine a machine that carried your bag and could also give you advice based on every shot you have taken in the last year?"" he told CNN. For some this would be a nightmare scenario, but it would bring an end to those spats between player and caddy when each blames the other for a poor shot! Mahoney can see other applications in the form of coaching aids. ""A robotic suit, a form of 'super suit' that guides your movements as you wear it, helping you to learn how to better swing the golf club,"" he explained. For the time being, much of this remains in the future, but back in San Diego Parente is confident his robot golfer will hit the fairways soon and cause quite a stir. But he is struggling to come up with a catchy name for his creation like ""Iron Byron"" and has settled on Golf Laboratories Computer Controlled Robot. So Parente is hoping his creation will do the talking for him.","Robotics technology is becoming more widespread in the golf industry .
It is widely used in performance testing of equipment such as balls and clubs .

"(CNN) -- In July 2000, Bill Elliott and his wife, Muriel, were woken up by a knock on the door at 4 a.m. ""I heard the knocking and I thought, 'Oh my God, my son is dead.' I just knew. And then I heard (Muriel) scream and that nightmare became a reality,"" says Bill. Nearly a third of all U.S. traffic-related deaths in 2010 -- more than 10,000 people -- involved alcohol, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Their son, John, was killed by a drunk driver while driving home to celebrate his mother's birthday. A few months later, Bill and Muriel Elliott started an organization to keep people from getting behind the wheel drunk. Called the Ensign John R. Elliott HERO Campaign for Designated Drivers, the goal of the organization is to register a million designated drivers. The name comes from John's experience at the Naval Academy. During his senior year, John was selected by his peers to be a HERO (human education resource officer.) ""They saw him as a great leader who made them laugh and saw the humor and the positive in everything,"" says Bill. The Elliotts wanted to carry that theme into the campaign. ""Out of our heartbreak, we wanted to do something to honor our son, and that was an expression of his positive nature,"" says Bill. ""John represents all victims and all the people whose lives we are trying to save, and I think he would've liked that."" The HERO Campaign message is simple: Be a HERO. Be a designated driver. Bill says the group has ""a serious mission and a serious goal which can be achieved by people doing the right thing and appealing to the HERO in everybody. The HERO campaign is active in seven states and partners with law enforcement, schools and local businesses. Billboards, decals and magnets are used to get the message out. ""People see the billboard, they see sticker on the car, they go into a bar and they see the poster on the wall, and they're going to say, 'What is this HERO campaign?' "" It's a simple reminder, says Bill: ""Who's your driver tonight? Who's your HERO tonight?"" The group holds annual events like the HERO Walk and the HERO Golf Tournament. Last year over 2,000 people walked on the boardwalk in Ocean City, New Jersey, to show their support. ""It's really something that's captured the support of the community, because everybody has the same reaction when I talk about that knock on the door. That is the knock you never want to get,"" says Bill. The Elliotts hope that because of their message, other families will be spared from hearing that knock on the door at 4 a.m.","Bill and Muriel Elliott started a campaign to honor their son, killed by a drunk driver .

"(CNN) -- The University of Montana will overhaul its handling of sexual harassment and assault complaints after a federal probe found ""real and significant"" problems, the Justice Department announced Thursday. Justice and the Department of Education began investigating the school last year, after allegations that 11 complaints of sexual assault involving students had not been investigated thoroughly because of gender bias. Settlements with both departments will ensure that future complaints are addressed quickly and fairly and that students who bring them are protected from retaliation, officials said. ""We have worked together to create a blueprint for reform that can serve as a model across this country,"" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roy Austin told reporters. Seth Galanter, the head of the Education Department's civil rights office, said those problems created ""a climate of fear"" on the campus that drove some female students to quit. Austin called the problems ""real and significant."" But those officials praised the Missoula-based school and its president, Royce Engstrom, for addressing them. ""In the last year-and-a-half, President Engstrom has made several bold and difficult decisions,"" said Mike Cotter, the U.S. attorney for Montana. Those decisions will change the school's culture and were ""absolutely the right thing to do,"" he said. The federal investigation began after a university-commissioned review by a Montana Supreme Court justice, Diane Barz. Barz found the school has ""a problem of sexual assault on and off campus."" The Justice Department said it still was investigating the Missoula Police Department and the Missoula County attorney's office regarding allegations that they, too, failed to investigate complaints of sexual assault.","There was a ""climate of fear"" among female students at Montana, official says .

"(CNN) -- Reigning world and European champions Spain set up the purists' dream Confederations Cup final against host nation Brazil but only after squeaking past a stubborn Italian side on penalties. The heavyweight European nations produced an entertaining game which somehow ended goalless after extra time, as both sides' endurance was tested to the limit in the heat of Fortaleza. In contrast to the finishing seen in open play, the strikes at goal in the penalty shootout were of the highest standard until defender Leonardo Bonucci skied the 13th effort well wide of goal. That allowed Jesus Navas to coolly fire Spain into Sunday's final as 7-6 winners on penalties -- so maintaining their hopes of holding the world, European and Confederations Cup titles all at once. Having won the World Cup (2010), the European Championship (on three occasions) and the Olympics (1992), FIFA's so-called Festival of Champions -- which pits the continental champions against both the World Cup winners and hosts -- is the one trophy missing from Spain's illustrious cabinet. Yet Vicente del Bosque's side were not at their best against familiar foes and could have suffered an unexpected reverse had Italy not wasted a host of early opportunities, with Emanuele Giaccherini hitting a post early in extra time. The absence of injured striker Mario Balotelli was keenly felt as Christian Maggio, Alberto Gilardino and Claudio Marchisio all missed gilt-edged opportunities in the opening 45 minutes. ""I think it was an excellent performance from both teams, who proved they are right at the top of the European game,"" Spain coach del Bosque told FIFA's official website. ""Italy were better than us for the whole first period when they put us in uncomfortable situations several times. ""We couldn't control the game properly and we looked very open. But, bit by bit, we got a second wind, improved after the interval and ended up being the better side come extra time. ""Then fortune went our way in the shootout, which put us through to a great final. We're enormously excited about taking on Brazil in the Maracana."" ""Despite all the things they've won - our players feel like kids! They're playing Brazil at the Maracana and that's taken them back to boyhood days."" The host nation ensured they will be playing in the iconic Rio de Janeiro stadium, which is set to host the 2014 World Cup final, when beating fellow South Americans Uruguay 2-1 in a tight contest on Wednesday. Italy will feel they deserved more from the game than the chance to win third place when facing the Uruguayans in Salvador on Sunday, even if goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon did turn a Xavi effort against the post in the dying moments. ""The lads played a great match, from the first minute to the last, and we created plenty of situations that could have won us the game, but once it goes to penalties anything can happen,"" said Cesare Prandelli, whose tactics successfully stifled the Spanish. ""Spain are currently ahead of us because they've been following the same ideology for years, whereas we're still forging our own path. ""This match has been a great test for us, no doubt about that, and we passed it despite the result. We were convinced about how we needed to play, in both technical and tactical terms, and we proved that we have the quality to battle it out with the best."" Prandelli can reflect on a far superior display to the two teams' meeting in the European Championship final in Kiev one year ago, when Spain romped to a 4-0 victory as they lifted the continental title for the third time following previous triumphs in 1964 and 2008. When the sides had met in the group stages in Gdansk last year, the 1-1 draw was built upon Italy's decision to play a three-man defense -- and Prandelli's decision to revert to that system once again restricted Spanish creativity for large parts of the game. Brazil coach Felipe Scolari will have followed the tactical ploy with interest as his side bid to win the Confederations Cup for the third time in a row following successes in 2005 and 2009. As has become a feature of the Confederations Cup, the build-up to the match witnessed clashes between police and anti-government protesters. Brazil has been hit by wave of mass demonstrations as its citizens clamor for better public services in a land where $15 billion has been set aside to host the Confederations Cup and next year's World Cup. Over a million people took to the streets in the early days of the tournament but there were just an estimated 5,000 protesting in Fortaleza on Thursday, with police saying they arrested 72 people.","Spain beat Italy 7-6 on penalties after semifinal ends goalless after 120 minutes .

"(CNN) -- India has long been cited as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, but it hasn't always been the most hospitable place for business travelers. Ranked 132 out of 185 on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, the country is often viewed as a hassle by executives. Part of the problem is that India has grown faster than its infrastructure. ""Infrastructure that we created for 2020 are already getting filled up by 2012,"" says Amitabh Kant, the man who is planning to bring India up to speed by 2017. Kant already revolutionized his country once. The instigator of the ""Incredible India"" campaign, he polished India's flagging tourism image and turned it into a must-visit destination for the discerning traveler. Marketing aside, the campaign made sure journeying through the subcontinent was met with relative ease. Roads were repaved, landmarks rebuffed and the sector as a whole was trained to work with foreign guests. Today, the country sees 6.8 million overseas tourists annually. Now he is tackling what may be India's most ambitious infrastructure project to date. The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, a $90 billion state-run enterprise, will involve connecting the 932 mile stretch between Delhi and Mumbai with new ports, airports, highways and rail links. For Kant, though, the real achievement will be the undertaking's economic knock-on effect. ""The train opens up a completely new route for India,"" he explains. ""It opens up the heart of six states, and what it does is really drive manufacturing. It creates seven new industrial cities of India,"" he explains. The country has already seen several new cities develop on the outskirts of industry centers. Outside of Delhi, for example, sits Gurgaon, a 30 year old suburb with a GDP that has started to match its next-door neighbor's. Unfortunately, many key urban features like adequate power and sewage are only just starting to be built. ""The city is doing some retro fitting,"" admits Kant. ""You are seeing power lines coming up, you are seeing drainage and sewage coming up."" Kant is hoping to avoid this type of scenario with the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. ""You need to have a very good plan of the backbone of the city you've created, and then allow the private sector to come in at the appropriate time,"" says Kant. The project may be ambitious, but Kant notes that its supersonic timeframe is necessary given the speed the country's young population is growing. ""India has a very young population; the median age is 25, and the aspirations are very high,"" he explains. ""We have to push for reforms at twice the speed we have been doing."" Despite the wealth of foreign investment in India, Kant also notes that the drive for change is coming from within the country. India's middle class is 400 million strong, and Kant reckons that by 2021 it will account for 47% of the country's GDP. Many will likely work in cities, and the number is only going to keep growing. ""By 2030, 350 million Indians are going to get into the process of urbanization, 700 million Indians by 2050,"" he explains. ""India has to create two and a half Americas. That is the challenge for India.""","Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor scheme will cost $90B .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned consumers not to eat mamey-flavored ice cream sold under the La Nuestra brand because of potential health risks. Montalvan's Sales Inc. of Ontario, California, which sells the brand, has voluntarily recalled the product, the FDA said. The ice cream was distributed through retail stores and restaurants in Nevada and California. In August, the FDA told consumers not to eat frozen mamey fruit pulp after at least nine people in California and Nevada fell ill with typhoid fever. An investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed a link between an ongoing attack of Salmonella typhi infections and frozen mamey fruit pulp products. Typhoid fever, which can be fatal, is caused by Salmonella typhi. ""This recall was initiated after Montalvan's Sales, Inc. was notified by FDA and CDC that the affected product was made with La Nuestra Mamey Pulp which was implicated via a strong epidemiologic link to a recent outbreak of Typhoid Fever in several Western States,"" the FDA said in a statement.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's budget cutters left the Department of Homeland Security relatively unscathed Monday, less than a week after the department chief said the country's terror threat is at its ""most heightened state"" since the September 11 attacks. The proposed budget provides $43.2 billion in discretionary spending for the department, an increase of $309 million, or 0.7%, above the 2010 level. The total 2012 budget request for the agency is $57 billion. Homeland Security officials called the changes modest Monday, saying that most increases were ""follow-ups"" to more ambitious initiatives announced last year. The changes will allow the U.S. Coast Guard to continue upgrading its aging fleet, allow the Transportation Security Administration to put more high-tech screening machines in airports and keep the record number of Border Patrol officers along the southwest border. The plan also allots money to build up the nation's cyberdefenses. On the cutting side, the budget trims administration costs throughout the department, kills a few modest grant programs for local governments and delays construction of a new headquarters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a House committee the terrorist threat facing the U.S. ""continues to evolve, so that, in some ways, the threat facing us is at its most heightened state since"" September 11. A top Homeland Security official said Monday that the president's budget proposal for the agency ""allows us to continue to meet these evolving threats by prioritizing our essential operation requirements."" Among the highlights: . • The budget proposes $1.4 billion to modernize the Coast Guard's fleet: enough to fully fund the nation's fifth National Security Cutter, six fast-response boats, 40 response boats and improvements for some shore facilities. It also includes money to complete a new Coast Guard headquarters at the Saint Elizabeth's site. The site, in southeast Washington eventually will house most of the Department of Homeland Security's agencies. • The Transportation Security Administration budget includes $236.9 million to fund 3,336 behavior detection officers, which includes 350 new positions. It also includes $125.7 million to sustain 900 canine teams and $105.2 million to buy and operate 275 full-body scanners at airport checkpoints, bringing the total to 1,275 machines. • The TSA budget also has $109 million for 12 new VIPR teams, which are intended to provide a visible deterrent to terrorists on subways and other modes of transportation. Some 25 teams are already deployed. It also includes $12.4 million to vet air travelers against watch lists and $14.1 million for enhancing screening of international travelers before they board U.S.-bound flights. Finally, the government is increasing money for federal air marshals for domestic flights to replace those diverted to international flights following international plots uncovered in recent years. • For border security, the budget includes funding for 21,370 Border Patrol agents and 21,185 Customs and Border Protection officers. Both are all-time highs, the administration said. It also includes $242 million for surveillance technology along the southwest border and $55 million for northern border technology. • To combat illegal immigrant offenders, the budget includes $157.7 million to pay for 33,400 detention beds and to remove more than 200,000 criminal illegal immigrants during the fiscal year. Another $184 million is for the Secure Communities program, which helps local and state detention centers identify illegal immigrants for removal and prosecution of egregious employers. • To thwart hackers from infiltrating government computers, the budget proposes $233.6 million to expedite the deployment of the government's Einstein 3 system. • The budget includes $3.8 billion in grants for state and local governments, including $420 million to rehire an estimated 2,300 laid-off firefighters. The administration says it is streamlining the grant programs, consolidating six grant programs and eliminating a couple of small programs.","Agency would get $309 million more in discretionary funds .

"New York (CNN) -- To the delight of fans back home in Tokyo, Hideki Matsui drove in six of the New York Yankees' seven runs in their World Series-winning victory Wednesday and became the first Japanese-born player to win a series Most Valuable Player award. For much of his career, Matsui was a star player for the Tokyo Giants. Matsui's key role in the series highlights the close ties between American and Japanese baseball. Playing in the Yankees' new stadium, the successor to the ""House that Ruth Built,"" Matsui's performance brought to mind the key role that Babe Ruth played in the development of professional baseball in Japan, according to Robert Fitts, author of several books on Japanese baseball. Fitts became a student of Japanese baseball in 1993, when his wife, an attorney, was transferred to Japan. Fitts, then working on his Ph.D. in archaeology from Brown University, was looking for something to get him immersed in Japanese culture. He wrote to 30 of the greatest Japanese ballplayers and was surprised to hear back from nearly all of them, with some sending gifts. He's the author of ""Remembering Japanese Baseball: An Oral History of the Game"" and of ""Wally Yonamine,"" a biography of the first Japanese-American to play professional football and the first American to play professional baseball in Japan. ""He was called the Jackie Robinson of Japan,"" Fitts said. Yonamine led the Japanese league in batting twice and won the MVP award as a center fielder for the Tokyo Giants. CNN spoke with Fitts, who is based in New York, on Thursday. CNN: What are your thoughts on Matsui's key role in the Yankees' victory? Fitts: It's wonderful for Japanese baseball, of course. I would say that five years ago, maybe seven years ago, it would have been incredible, because people in America and in Japan weren't sure about the status of Japanese professional baseball. Many Americans and some in Japan thought that Japanese baseball wasn't as good as American baseball. ... Since then, Ichiro [Suzuki] came over, and he set numerous Major League Baseball records. ... And then Japan won both of the World Baseball Classics. So Japan's baseball has already proven itself to be of high caliber. Most Americans, even if they don't know the history of Japanese baseball, recognize now that they play a very good game. CNN: In Japan, how significant is baseball? Fitts: It's the Japanese national sport. It's been so since the 1890s. Japan had no native team sports. In the 1870s. American and British teachers introduced team sports to Japan. Cricket was introduced, along with rugby and baseball. Baseball is the one that became the most popular. In the 1890s, a Japanese high school team beat a team of American adults from the Yokohama Country Club. They beat them in three straight games. It took on national importance. Japan, of course, was opened up to Westerners in the 1850s by Commodore Perry. The Western nations were far more advanced in technology, and Japan did a rapid modernization. By 1890, Japan felt it was ready to join modern nations as an equal, but the Western powers weren't ready to accept Japan. CNN: How did the game develop after that? Fitts: The biggest change came with two tours. The first was in 1931, an American all-star team whose big star was Lou Gehrig, and the bigger tour came in 1934. Both of these tours were sponsored by the Yomiuri newspaper. In 1934, they brought over what at the time was considered the greatest baseball team ever. It included Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Charlie Gehringer, Earl Averill, Lefty Gomez, Connie Mack was the manager, and we can't forget Mo Berg, the future spy [for the United States in World War II]. The '34 tour was significant for two reasons: The first is that relations between Japan and the U.S. were really rocky at that point. There was a very significant treaty, the naval treaty, which limited the size of the major powers' navies. For every five warships the U.S. and Britain could have, Japan was only allowed three. Japan found this quite insulting, even though they had agreed to it in the 1920s. When the all-star team went over there, the Japanese people went crazy. Half a million people turned out on November 2 for a welcoming parade in Tokyo for the American baseball team. The tour really did create a great deal of goodwill. However, that ended quickly. Within a month of the tour ending, Japan announced that it would not renew the naval treaty. Several months later, in February 1935, an ultranationalist group tried to assassinate the president of the Yomiuri newspaper because he brought over the American team. He was wounded very seriously but survived. CNN: What was the importance of the tour for Japanese baseball? Fitts: The Yomiuri newspaper used the enthusiasm generated by the tour to start their own professional league. The first team they created -- to play the American visitors -- was a Japanese all-star team called All-Nippon. After the tour, the All-Nippon team transformed into the Yomiuri [Tokyo] Giants. CNN: What was Babe Ruth's role? Fitts: Babe Ruth was credited as the man who helped start Japanese [professional] baseball. He was just Babe Ruth. He sold out every game. He had just been released by the Yankees prior to the tour. He hit over .300; he led the Americans and Japanese for most home runs. CNN: How did Hideki Matsui become a baseball star in Japan? Fitts: He was signed right after high school. He was the hero of the annual high school tournament. His rookie year was 1993 with the Yomiuri Giants. He spent much of '93 in the minors. By 1994, he became a true star, and he was the face of the team from '94 till he came over to the Yankees in 2003. CNN: How did people feel about Matsui coming to the Yankees? Fitts: The vast majority of people were very happy for him. There was no sense of betrayal except for the true Giants fans. This was very exciting news. I was there when it happened. This was a chance for Japan's most popular player to prove himself in the major leagues. The Yankees are a special team in Japan just like they are in the U.S. They're probably the most popular American team in Japan. When [Hideo] Nomo first came over in 1995, I found my Japanese friends only cared about how the Japanese players did. They were a fan of the Dodgers one day when Nomo pitched; they were a fan of the Angels when [Shigetoshi] Hasegawa pitched, but over time the Japanese fans became fans of different major league teams as they watched more major league baseball on TV. CNN: What have been the differences between the American and Japanese games? Fitts: There were real substantial differences from the 1940s even through the early 1990s. ... The Japanese would sacrifice bunt far more than the Americans (they still do but less than they used to). Players didn't go first to third on singles often. They would play line drives on hops rather than trying to make a shoestring catch and risk giving up more bases. It was a very conservative brand of baseball. Since the ties have become closer, Japan's baseball has become more aggressive, more exciting, in my opinion. There are still differences. The Japanese really focus on practice and perfection of the technique. That's something American players can learn from, and I think it helps explain the success of Hideki Matsui and Ichiro. They're both dedicated players who practice many, many hours. If you watch Matsui at the plate, he's a very disciplined hitter. His swing is very compact, very practiced, almost perfect. He rarely makes mental mistakes when he's playing the field or running the bases. CNN: How do you think people view the fact that he's going to be a free agent and might not stay with the Yankees? Fitts: I think the Japanese people would be very disappointed if he doesn't remain a Yankee ... and I think most New Yorkers would be very disappointed, too. He's an extremely classy player and a classy individual. CNN: Were you rooting for the Yankees? Fitts: I'm a Phillies fan. I grew up in Philadelphia. I'm in mourning this morning, but at least it was Matsui who did the damage.","Japanese baseball book author says Babe Ruth sparked professional game in Japan .

"(CNN) -- In the two-hour season premiere of ""Mad Men,"" there is an incidental character, an old woman, who is probably pushing 90. Her clothes are proper, if drab, and her demeanor suggests someone to the manner born. She seems like the type of person who has spent her life in privileged drawing rooms above Park Avenue, her feet never touching the dirty streets of New York as the 20th century went by. Indeed, she's lived through so much in the 1960s alone: communications breakthroughs, space flight, social movements. And yet, it appears the decade hasn't affected her at all. She has a good deal in common with ""Mad Men's"" major characters. The AMC show, about a 1960s advertising agency, returns Sunday for its sixth season. Buzz abounds for the return of 'Mad Men' Forget about the civil rights marches, the Vietnam War protests, the youth culture and all the rest that's become shorthand for ""the '60s."" From their Midtown Manhattan aerie, the characters of ""Mad Men"" have glided over a good deal of it. Sure, there have been occasional glimpses of those turbulent times. Creative director Don Draper used to have a lover in the beatnik precincts of Greenwich Village, even lived there himself for awhile. Office manager Joan Harris' husband was sent off to 'Nam. Copywriter Peggy Olson remains a proudly independent single woman. Former copywriter Paul Kinsey went off to register black voters in the Jim Crow South. The office went into shock when John F. Kennedy was shot (though they were just as shocked by the lawnmower that ran over an executive's foot). But, essentially, the messy '60s have been lived by someone else. And why not? The ""Mad Men"" are in advertising. Their lives are about new-and-improved consumer products, tropical getaways and the wonders of better living through chemistry -- not hippies, war and drugs. Their '60s are not the '60s we've come to know, says Jerald Podair, a history professor at Wisconsin's Lawrence University. ""You can't understand the 1960s if you only focus on hippies,"" he says. ""That's obviously a part of the 1960s but not the full 1960s."" After all, he points out, most people of the time went to work and lived their lives -- and weren't attired in tie-dye and love beads. Your photos: What the late '60s really looked like . One of the smart moves of the show, he adds, is that the ""Mad Men"" characters don't have to be immersed in the times. They just have to be keen observers. ""Don Draper doesn't necessarily have to become a hippie himself to sell being a hippie, or sell an America that is changing in ways he's trying to understand,"" he says. ""He can be of it, but not necessarily in it."" Surfaces and shadows . From the beginning, ""Mad Men"" has tended to view the '60s from the establishment's perch. Sterling Cooper -- the first incarnation of the show's ad agency -- was part of the clubby Madison Avenue set, its ranks filled with WASP-y Ivy Leaguers and Cheeveresque commuters. Even the new incarnation, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, is more staid than swinging. It's been the ad agency of Richard Nixon and Lucky Strike (and, if a contract alluded to last season worked out, napalm-maker Dow Chemical). Its staffers are generally a generation older than the baby boomers and have a stake in preserving the status quo. The insurgents were its competition, such as Doyle Dane Bernbach and Wells Rich Greene, the real-life agencies that shook up Madison Avenue with irreverent work and ethnically diverse staffs. The show's shiny surfaces appear to have distracted many viewers from ""Mad Men's"" shadows, something that leaves creator Matt Weiner bemused. The first season included a suicide and Don's desperate identity crisis, and succeeding seasons haven't let up. ""There's been an interesting experience for me to hear people talk with nostalgia about the early seasons of the show,"" he says. ""I think season 1 was the darkest thing that's ever been a commercial success."" There may be a reckoning coming now, though. The late '60s were so filled with turmoil it seems impossible to avoid the fire this time. Season 5 ended in spring 1967; over the next 18 months came race riots, the Martin Luther King assassination, a clamorous presidential campaign, the Robert Kennedy assassination and the war, the war, the war. Closer to ""Mad Men's"" New York home, in 1968, Mayor John Lindsay's administration was beset by a teachers' strike, a garbage strike and a general sense of rot later immortalized in such films as ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""The French Connection."" It was, in columnist Dick Schaap's sarcastic phrase, ""Fun City."" ""Mad Men"" character Henry Francis -- a Lindsay adviser -- will likely have a lot on his plate this season. Jaguar is not mad at 'Mad Men' 'Week of shock,' world of wonders . But even with all that, the world rolled on. Take the April 12, 1968, issue of Life magazine, the publication that Podair, the history professor, describes as reflecting ""what America was really about."" ""Week of shock,"" blared the cover line over a photograph of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who had just been killed. Inside: Articles on MLK's death, Lyndon Johnson's March 31 speech announcing he was not running for president, Democratic challengers Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy and a piece on the Doors, ""the kings of acid rock."" But also: ads for Zenith televisions, Firestone tires, Ritz crackers, Hunt's ketchup, the Big Three automakers and ""the friendly world of Hilton,"" all the sunny, capitalistic wonders of life. This is the world of surfaces, the one most people take refuge in. ""('Mad Men') shows us that American capitalism rolls on regardless of the era that it is in,"" Podair says. ""It will try to sell that culture and commodify that culture. That's what the Mad Men are doing."" That's not to say the characters won't be affected by the coming calamities. The cast members lightly allude to changes. Jon Hamm, who plays Don Draper, says the show will get to the heart of the loaded question that ended last season: Don, approached by two women at a bar, being asked, ""Are you alone?"" John Slattery, who plays the wisecracking agency head Roger Sterling, says his character -- who ended last season nakedly enjoying an LSD trip -- could reassess his whole life. ""I think at this semi-late date in his career he's trying to shake it up and find something to be interested in,"" he says. ""That's really all you can ask -- surprisingly I think he's the character that appears to be most open to that."" Living large in Don Draper's New York . 'Where we are right now' But Podair doubts the group is suddenly going to bolt the establishment. ""In the back of many fans' minds (there's the thought that) this is the year, this is the season we're going to see them become complete hippies. It's not going to happen,"" he says. ""Weiner's too smart for that. He wants to show that this other '60s -- this corporate '60s -- adjusted to the new 1960s and ended up selling the new 1960s."" Given that, can ""Mad Men's"" characters stay disengaged? Creator Weiner, forever cagey about revealing too much, suggests they won't -- and that what they go through will echo down to the present day. ""I think you'll find this season more than ever really interacts where we are right now in society,"" he says. He leaves the point hanging, of course, but it's easy to see what the show might address: the splintering of society, destructive politics, what the baby boomers wrought. But maybe ""Mad Men's"" characters will still muddle through, mildly oblivious to the deeper currents of the age. In that, they wouldn't be so different from the old woman -- or the rest of us. Podair mentions a student he once had, another old woman, who took a course about the decade. He guesses she was born around 1930, and nothing he showed the class -- including movies such as ""Easy Rider"" and documentaries about '60s movements -- seemed to reach her. Finally, Podair grew upset at her indifference. ""What were you doing during the 1960s?"" he asked tartly. ""Raising my children,"" she responded.","""Mad Men"" returns for sixth season on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- When Wendell Pierce opened a new grocery store in a tough neighborhood in New Orleans, what he did not put on the outside -- bars on the windows -- was as important as what he did put inside -- fresh fruits and vegetables, affordably priced. With his Sterling Express convenience store and Sterling Farms supermarket, Pierce, who portrayed Bunk Moreland on ""The Wire"" and Antoine Batiste on ""Treme,"" is turning food desert neighborhoods into food oases. While Pierce is a hit in the food-access movement, the stores, and his style, are also manifestations of a commitment to place. Spending an afternoon with Pierce in New Orleans, his hometown, it's easy to see Pierce's larger purpose. In the language of the Project for Public Spaces, Pierce's work is about placemaking. Through his neighborhood inquiry, Project for Public Spaces founder Fred Kent crafted a definition of placemaking: ""Turning a neighborhood, town or city from a place you can't wait to get through to one you never want to leave."" So it's magical to have fresh papaya, melons and bell peppers in Pierce's supermarket, but it's not enough. Pierce's team set up a technology-driven security system that lets the supermarket operate efficiently, without bars on the windows. He saw neighbors walking home, loaded down with grocery bags in the New Orleans heat, and imagined an amenity. Now Sterling Farms offers free rides home for customers spending $50 or more. The branded SUV is a rolling reminder that the store is sensitive to neighborhood needs. In his Sterling Express convenience store, the fresh bananas by the register signal an interest in healthy customers. The restrooms, which Pierce wants to show off, are about making the neighborhood a better place. They are brightly lit and spotless. Pierce's passion for placemaking shows up when he extends our supermarket tour to visit Columbia Parc at the Bayou, a mixed-income development that replaced the old St. Bernard housing project. Part of the Purpose Built Communities network, Columbia Parc is a national model for neighborhood transformation. Housing, education, workforce training, recreation and wellness programs are integrated into one place. Pierce is bringing a supermarket. St. Bernard was dangerous. Columbia Parc is safe. It's the same dirt underneath. Somehow the place changed. Warren Buffett believes in the approach and is backing Purpose Built. Columbia Parc is a good lesson for charitable foundations that often parse life into a list of simple check-boxes, one for education, one for transit, one for arts and so on. Placemaking recognizes that all these things, and more, are tied. With a community kitchen, Columbia Parc can offer cooking classes to families that get new access to fresh produce, thanks to Sterling Farms, which is also generating jobs. The fitness center makes regular physical activity the norm, not the exception, and the design invites residents to walk, not ride, to school. The community garden lets kids put their hands in the dirt, which reinforces the science being taught from preschool through high school. Around the country, the allure of placemaking is evident. New York's High Line is more than an elevated walkway. Its arrival ignited recreation, environmental inquiry, congregation, arts and romance. The Atlanta Bicycle Coalition draws thousands of people to its Streets Alive events, modeled after Columbia's Ciclovia. There is attention to better biking, but mostly it's residents coming together to make a better place. In Denver, the FasTracks Program is re-shaping residential life,.Featuring 122 miles of new commuter and light rail lines, FasTracks promotes ""a pedestrian-oriented environment that allows people to live, work, shop and play in places accessible by transit."" Dan Gilmartin, author of ""The Economics of Place: The Value of Building Communities Around People,"" is an expert on placemaking. Communities that figure out placemaking, Gilmartin believes, will see greater economic growth and improved quality of life. He's developing 25 case studies on the best placemaking ideas from U.S. cities. Perhaps a key to placemaking is the ability to see the potential for beauty in situations where others see a tangle of bad. Or, as Project for Public Spaces encourages, ""start with the petunias."" This is how an abandoned rail line, a nuisance and a danger, becomes a space famous for its sunset views. Pierce's vision for placemaking is rooted in recollections of the places of his youth. He grew up in Pontchartrain Park. ""It's the memory of that Friday night grocery trip that I used to take with my mother,"" Pierce told NPR. ""It was the town square, you know, men and women getting off of work and you would see them at our neighborhood grocery store. For, you know, a little 8-year-old boy that was, you know, the fishmonger in the butcher, these were, you know, common people in my life on the beginning of my weekend, and I felt as though that was something culturally that everybody should have in their neighborhood."" It's one thing to see a supermarket as a great place to get healthy food. It's even better to imagine how the supermarket can help make a place great. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Bare.","Actor Wendell Pierce opens a new grocery store in New Orleans neighborhood .

"New York (CNN) -- Federal authorities running a sting operation arrested a 21-year-old Bangladeshi man, who came to the U.S. on a student visa and was allegedly planning to blow up the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with what he believed was a 1,000-pound bomb, officials said. Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis was detained Wednesday after an alleged attempt to detonate the device, which was inert and part of an elaborate investigation by federal authorities and NYPD detectives. Prosecutors say Nafis was apparently motivated by al Qaeda and traveled to the United States in January under the pretext of attending college in Missouri in order carry out ""a terrorist attack on U.S. soil"" and to recruit members to form a terrorist cell. Accused 9/11 mastermind says U.S. tortured in name of national security . It's not clear whether Nafis maintained al Qaeda ties, but authorities say he apparently claimed that the plot was his own, and that it was his sole motivation for the U.S. trip. One of the people Nafis apparently contacted was an FBI source to whom he proposed multiple targets, including a high-ranking U.S. official as well as the New York Stock Exchange, authorities said. At one point, the suspect contemplated President Barack Obama as a target, but that idea never progressed, a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation said. While the details surrounding the suspected plot remain murky, prosecutors say Nafis indicated that he wanted to ""destroy America"" by going after the nation's financial institutions and ultimately settled on the landmark bank. The undercover agent, authorities say, also provided 20 bags of 50 pounds each of purported explosives to Nafis, who then stored the material in a warehouse in preparation for the strike. They say Nafis further divulged a ""Plan B"" that involved carrying out a suicide attack should police thwart his initial effort. Packing his van with what he apparently believed were explosives, Nafis then allegedly traveled with the undercover agent to Manhattan's financial district, attached a detonator to the material and recorded a video statement in a nearby hotel. ""We will not stop until we attain victory or martyrdom,"" he allegedly said, covering his face, donning sunglasses and disguising his voice. While en route to his target, authorities say, Nafis detailed how his jihadist views were -- at least in part -- formed by watching video sermons by American-born al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed last year by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen. With his van parked next to the Federal Reserve, Nafis allegedly attempted to detonate the inert device by using his cell phone. The effort failed, and he was arrested soon after, authorities said. Much of the sting operation was also captured on video, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Nafis faces charges of ""attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to provide material support to al Qaeda."" His arrest came as a result of the ""culmination of an undercover operation"" after he was being monitored by NYPD detectives and the FBI New York Field Office's Joint Terrorism Task Force, the statement said. The Federal Reserve declined to comment, while Police Commissioner Ray Kelly reminded New Yorkers to remain vigilant against potential threats. ""Al Qaeda operatives and those they have inspired have tried time and again to make New York City their killing field,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""We are up to 15 plots and counting since 9/11, with the Federal Reserve now added to a list of iconic targets that previously included the Brooklyn Bridge, the New York Stock Exchange and Citicorp Center."" He added that ""after 11 years without a successful attack, it's understandable if the public becomes complacent."" ""But that's a luxury law enforcement can't afford,"" he said. Jay Carney, White House press secretary, told CNN that President Barack Obama has been briefed on the threat. Meanwhile, Nafis made an initial court appearance Wednesday at a federal courthouse in Brooklyn. His attorney, a public defender, declined to comment. Nafis was a student majoring in cybersecurity at Southeast Missouri State University from January to May of this year, said Ann Hayes, a spokeswoman for the university. Taking tea with a terrorist .

"(CNN) -- High-flying acrobats. Death-defying leaps. Bright lights and performance tents filled with adoring fans. It's the stuff of which dreams are made. After all, who doesn't want to run away with the circus? But for Joe Putignano, it wasn't as simple as running away -- it took a lifetime of dedication and a battle against addiction to get where he is today: dangling from the 40-foot-high catwalk above the Cirque du Soleil big top. The house lights are off, and one lone spotlight shines upon Joe's reflective mirror-ball suit. He is tethered at the waist, head tilted back, arms reaching behind him to grab his foot, which is quickly flexing up toward his head. He starts to spin -- literally because that's what his character is supposed to do, and figuratively, because of the searing pain he's feeling in both shoulders as he contorts into this position. Though it may seem that Cirque characters are superhuman, they too can get injured. Joe is a real human being with real muscles, bones, connective tissue and joints. And for Joe, it's not just high-flying acrobatics that cause him pain. ""It's sort of mundane things,"" he says. ""Sleeping hurts a lot, because I'm rolling over on my shoulder. Just drinking a coffee. Washing my hair hurts a lot."" After nearly 1,000 performances of ""Totem"" and a lifetime of gymnastics training, Joe has finally hit a wall. ""I need to have surgery,"" he says matter-of-factly. ""I really wanted to see if I could continue on, and just kind of manage it, do a lot of physical therapy, and get out of this pain. But we've done that, and we're kind of out of options."" Cirque du Soleil star: Why I fear pain . Joe has what's called a superior labral tear from anterior to posterior -- a SLAP tear for short -- in his right shoulder. His biceps tendon is also torn, and he has a third tear in the subscapular area underneath his shoulder blade. His left shoulder has just the one injury -- another SLAP tear. That one needs to be operated on as well, and soon, before he has permanent damage to the joint. And surgery has to be done in a way that preserves Joe's abilities to perform. ""I suppose there's always a risk that when they do fix it, that it will destroy my flexibility,"" Joe says. ""I'm useful in this industry because of my flexibility."" Now this contortionist is headed to another arena with bright lights, where all eyes are focused on him: the operating room. Surgery is scary for anybody, but for Joe, it is potentially the most terrifying thing he's ever encountered. Joe is a recovering heroin addict. He's been clean for more than five years, but the thought of anything affecting his sobriety -- particularly opioid painkillers after surgery -- is something he isn't willing to risk. ""Opiates made me feel like I was the greatest human being possible. Protected, cared for, loved -- all internally,"" he said. ""So I started my path on opiates and abused them, which ultimately lead me to heroin."" ""I'm terrified that if I have an opiate, will it trigger this kind of sleeping demon inside of me?"" Joe's fears aren't unfounded. ""I recently met a woman who was 10 years sober, and she had breast cancer,"" he said. ""She was given Percocet for the pain, and she ended up relapsing. Why does that have to be our reality?"" He's determined to not let it become his reality, both for his own benefit, and to show other addicts they don't have to fear a day where they need surgery. In 2009, 605,000 Americans who were 13 and older reported abusing heroin in the preceding year, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. That same year, 16 million Americans ""misused prescription pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants or sedatives for nonmedical purposes,"" according to that same report. Most of these nearly 17 million Americans will need surgery someday, and many of them will be prescribed opioid painkillers to combat post-operative pain. ""We don't have exact numbers of the percentage of former addicts that are going back for surgery, but this is definitely a growing problem in America,"" said Dr. Boris Spektor, assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain management at Emory University and the person who will be managing Joe's pain throughout the process. ""As more and more people are using opioid substances for nonmedical reasons, and using them for medical reasons out of proportion for the dosages that they should be prescribed, it's something we're going to see a lot more of."" Joe's specific plan for post-operative pain management has several facets, the first of which is a pre-operative nerve block. ""It's a way of giving some numbing medication directly to the nerves that are going down to the shoulder,"" said Spektor, ""and we'll do that for as long as possible, because with each passing day, the pain is going to get better."" There is one problem -- Spektor says nerve blocks are usually inserted while the patient is awake to make sure they're placed properly. Typically they would also give the patient a sedative to help with the pain and anxiety of the procedure, but Joe has abused all three of the medications they use for sedation. So he'll be fully awake as Spektor pokes around in his shoulder to place the nerve block. Step two of Joe's pain-management plan involves a cocktail of medications -- none of them drugs of abuse -- intended to reduce swelling, turn down the nerves' pain signals and reduce Joe's stress-response to pain. Step three involves going to Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly before and after surgery. During step four, Joe will see a psychologist the day after surgery and regularly after that to ensure he stays on the right mental path. And just to add insult to injury, Joe has to go through this intense process twice -- once for each shoulder. ""In my head, it's like -- OK, we're going to go and visit hell, not just once, but twice,"" he said. ""I feel like it's somewhat of a cosmic joke on me."" But will these efforts pay off? Will the plan work? ""I think every patient is unique,"" Spektor says. ""But I think Joe has an incredibly good psychological framework going on. He's got a psychologist that's definitely on board with him, he's got a group of friends that are on board with him. He's got NA and AA meetings that he goes to, and we have a medical framework that's here for him."" ""With that combination, I think the likelihood of success is pretty good, but none of us known for sure."" Today marks the first day of the rest of Joe's life. He's dropping into a new type of circus, possibly as you read this. Today he rolls into the OR for the first of his two surgeries. ""I'm fearful; I'm scared; I don't know what's going to happen. I'm jumping into a freezing cold pool, and I don't know how I'm gonna react,"" he said days before the surgery. ""I can tell you what I'm going to do, how I'm going to think -- all of it's untrue, because I won't know until I'm there. When you're met with pain, only then you'll know how you'll react to it.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia congressman said Wednesday he's received death threats and found Nazi graffiti outside his office in the aftermath of heated protests about health care reform. Rep. David Scott's staff found a swastika on a sign outside his district office in Georgia. David Scott, a Democrat from north-central Georgia, told CNN he has received several offensive faxes and letters, including some with death threats and racial abuse. Scott is black. His district includes part of metro Atlanta. The congressman showed CNN a cartoon of Barack Obama, depicting the president as a clown with a swastika on his head, which Scott said he had received in the mail. Tuesday, his staff found a swastika painted over Scott's name on a sign outside his office. ""I was just simply appalled,"" he said. ""This symbol represents the most heinous period in world history, indicative of man's greatest inhumanity to man, where nearly 6 million Jewish people and others were murdered purposely by Adolf Hitler,"" Scott said. ""So when you reach that point ... this is very, very dangerous."" Local police and the F.B.I. are investigating. Scott said he believes the swastika and hate mail are a result of the acrimonious health care debate. Lawmakers holding public forums in their home districts during their August recess have been the target of some angry protests over the proposed health care overhaul. An argument Scott had with a doctor at a public meeting has been featured on both local TV and CNN. The Georgia representative said he does not believe the vocal protests against Obama's proposed changes to the health care system are spontaneous. ""I think to a degree they're organized and orchestrated,"" Scott said. ""There's no question about that but they have a right to do it -- that's very, very important. This is America, it's rough and tumble, that's what we're here for, but this is something else,"" he said. ""This is not good for America, not good for this debate, it's a distraction,"" the congressman said. And he says Obama should call for an end to it. ""I think he really has to speak strongly ... before somebody gets hurt at one of these things.""

"(CNN) -- A member of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot -- convicted last summer after a protest performance inside a Moscow cathedral -- had her parole bid rejected Friday when a judge said she'd broken prison rules and never expressed regret, state news reported. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's lawyer argued that she should be freed because she has a small child, hadn't had conflicts with other inmates and would have a job once she was freed, reported RAPSI, an official news agency focused on legal matters. But the judge in Mordovia, in central Russia, sided with prosecutors and took into account Tolokonnikova's behavior at a penal colony in Perm, about 1,000 kilometers (700 miles) east of Moscow. ""She had not always observed the rules of conduct,"" the judge ruled according to another state news agency, RIA Novosti. ""She has two disciplinary penalties not yet removed from her record."" Irina Khrunova, Tolokonnikova's lawyer, told state news that her client will appeal Friday's ruling. Tolokonnikova and another band member, Maria Alyokhina, both in their 20s, were sentenced in August for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals. Yekaterina Samutsevich, a third member of the band, was sentenced at the same time. But she was freed from prison last October. Footage of the brief but provocative protest action in February 2012 attracted worldwide attention after it was posted online. It showed the band members, their faces shrouded by balaclavas, screaming ""Mother Mary, please drive Putin away"" inside Christ Savior Cathedral, outraging many of the Russia church's faithful . The three women, who were arrested shortly after the act, were all convicted of hooliganism. Two other members of the all-female group have fled Russia. Human rights activists and celebrities alike rallied around Pussy Riot -- and railed at Russian authorities for going after women who, they said, were expressing their political views -- following the band members' arrest. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for example, both issued reports earlier this year sharply criticizing Russia's record on freedom of expression. The heavy clampdown on government critics and activists, the groups said, has increased since Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency -- which happened a few months after the Pussy Riot protest act. Putin subsequently denied his government employs ""Stalinist elements"" -- which he equated to a ""personality cult and mass violation of law, reprisals, prison camps."" ""But that doesn't mean we should have no discipline, no law and order -- and all people in Russia should be equal before the law."" That includes the women in Pussy Riot, Putin said. ""No one puts anyone in prison for political reasons, for their political views. They get punished for violating the law. Everybody should observe the law."" CNN's Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, one of 3 arrested Pussy Riot members, had asked for parole .

"(CNN) -- Most of us can appreciate that the world is an ancient place and that a lot has changed in the almost 4.6 billion years since it took its shape. It's not easy to have a feel for the amount of time that has passed, but grappling with deep time helps you understand why an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) of 400 parts per million (ppm) is meaningful. Deep time is geologic time and the scale needed to fathom the evolution of life, mountains, oceans, and Earth's climate. Climate, one must note, is not weather. Weather is experienced day to day. Climate occurs on longer scales: the tropics are hot and wet; Antarctica is freezing and miserable. If you wanted to consider the climate of the whole planet you would need to consider its temperature. Without greenhouse gases the world would be a much colder (~30˚C or 65˚F colder) and lonelier place. All of us have felt the greenhouse effect because water vapor is a greenhouse gas and when summer humidity is high you just can't get any relief. Even at night when the sun is gone, water vapor keeps radiating the heat. Dry desert nights are just the opposite, with temperatures falling fast when the lights go out. CO2 works the same way as water vapor. More CO2 radiates more heat, increasing the average temperature and turning more surface water into water vapor, which radiates more heat. This is an example of a positive feedback and positive feedbacks push temperatures higher than CO2 alone. Global climate models tell us that doubling CO2 will lead to a global temperature increase between 2 and 4.5˚C (that's 3.6 to 8˚F), reflecting the climate sensitivity to CO2. Since 400 ppm marks a 43% man-made CO2 rise (from 280 to 400 ppm in ~200 years), we should soon expect 1˚C (1.8˚F) of warming if low-end estimates of climate sensitivity are correct. Well, a 1˚C (1.8˚F) global temperature increase is close to what we've already measured, but full warming is not expressed overnight or even over decades because the world is mostly a cold ocean that helps ameliorate immediate warming by taking up heat. Also, man-made atmospheric particles could be masking up to 0.5˚C (0.9˚F) of the potential temperature rise. With this in mind, we expect temperatures to further increase even if CO2 stopped rising, and so it's not alarming to assume that climate sensitivity might be higher than the belief of an optimist. So, how much CO2 is too much? This is where deep time helps frame our expectations of things to come. First, as far as we know, the rate of our CO2 rise is unprecedented in Earth history. That's saying something, isn't it? During the well-known glacial-interglacial cycles that occurred in the last one million years, CO2 fell to a cold 180 ppm and back up to 280 ppm. Those changes took thousands to tens-of-thousand of years, so, 400 ppm not only breaks that record, but it breaks it in record time. When climate scientists say that they are worried about 2 to 5˚C (3.6 -- 9˚F) of global warming, keep in mind that global temperature was, at most, 4 to 5˚C (7.2 -- 9˚F) colder during the last ice age when miles of ice piled up on land and pushed enough dirt to make Long Island. Small numbers, like 4˚C (7.2˚F) of cooling can mean big things, but that's not where we're headed any more. Now we're headed deeper into the past. At best, CO2 levels are similar to 4 million years ago when global temperatures were 3 to 4˚C (5.4 -- 7.2˚F) higher, and there was little-to-no ice on Greenland, and sea levels were at least ~~20 m (65 feet) higher. Even if we were to resolve to live in the warmth of the relatively recent past, the nagging problem is that atmospheric CO2 levels will continue to rise and stay around for a very, very long time without intentional intervention and/or a surprising technological innovation. CO2 is increasing at about 3 ppm per year and we will be arriving at a minimum CO2 concentration of 700 ppm by year 2100 if nothing is done. In terms of our history, that places us somewhere beyond 35 million years ago when there was no permanent ice on the poles and sea level was over 200 feet higher than today. Add more CO2 to the mix and we step back towards peak temperatures 50 million years ago when CO2 is estimated to have been about 1000 ppm and sub-tropical plants and crocodiles inhabited the poles. There's lots of uncertainty when trying to reconstruct ancient climates and the factors that produced them, but having some sense of the past informs us in the same way as knowing the history of our grandparents and the potential inheritance of future ailments. Deep time tells us that we are traveling forward to a world that is an extraordinary warm and different place, something Earth scientists refer to as a greenhouse world. Hopefully we will resist the urge to take the trip, but if we don't, I know a few people who would be happy to study how it all went down. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Pagani.","Mark Pagani: CO2 level in atmosphere portends major changes .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- -- Predatory mice are critically threatening the albatross population on a remote South Atlantic island and have caused the birds' worst nesting season on record, a British bird charity said Thursday. Tristran albatross chicks are in danger from non-native house mice. The research from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicates bad news for the Tristan albatross, whose only home is Gough Island in the middle of the South Atlantic. House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said. The mice are also threatening the native population of bunting, one of the world's largest finches, the RSPB said. ""Without removal of the mice, both the albatross and the bunting that live there are doomed to extinction,"" Grahame Madge, a conservation spokesman for the RSPB, told CNN. The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said. This makes it especially difficult for the albatross population to survive because the birds lay eggs only once every two years -- a very low reproductive rate compared to other birds, Madge said. ""What (the mice) are affecting is ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population,"" he said. Adult Tristan albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea, a practice in which boats put up numerous 100-meter-long fishing lines baited with squid or fish. The albatrosses are attracted to the bait and while some manage to steal it successfully, many more get snagged and drown, Madge said. Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction. Gough Island, a British territory almost midway between Argentina and South Africa, is a place of stunning natural beauty. Its green mountain slopes, topped with snow at its highest points, stretch into the deep blue sea. The island is not inhabited by humans. Gough Island and nearby Inaccessible Island are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said. A later survey revealed only 246 chicks had survived to fledgling. ""We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers,"" said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem. ""However, we now know that the albatrosses have suffered their worst year on record."" The bunting suffer because the mice eat their eggs and chicks, and may also compete with them for food in the winter, Cuthbert said. ""The decline in bunting numbers is alarming,"" said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town, who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s. ""Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice, both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time."" The RSPB has been studying whether it is possible to remove the mice. It said trials so far look promising, but it urged the British government to step up funding for the project. It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species. The RSPB said it has been working with New Zealand conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters. Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world. Albatrosses principally live in the southern Atlantic but some also live in the northern Pacific, the RSPB says. Albatrosses are among the largest flying birds, weighing up to 25 pounds (22.5 kilograms). One species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet, the RSPB says. The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.","House mouse is threatening survival of Tristan albatross and Gough bunting .

"(CNN) -- Islamists attacked a gas field in eastern Algeria, killing two people and seizing hostages, including Westerners, Algeria's interior minister said Wednesday. The incident may be linked to France's military support for the government of nearby Mali, according to reports from the region. The Westerners, accompanied by Algerian security forces, were en route to In Amenas Airport when they were attacked early in the morning by a group of no more than 20 people, the official, Diho Weld Qabliyeh, told Algerian state television. The security forces returned fire, and the attackers withdrew to the base of the petroleum operation, some 3 kilometers away, he said. Upon arrival at the base, he continued, the attackers ""took in a number of Westerners and Algerians -- some people told us they were nine, some people told us 12."" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Americans were among the hostages. Accounts over the number differed. An Algerian and a Westerner were killed in the attack, and two other Westerners, two of the security forces and two guards from the base were wounded, Qabliyeh said. A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office, citing the Algerian government, said a British national was among the dead. British Foreign Minister William Hague, speaking in Sydney, Australia, said the captives included ""a number of British nationals."" Hague said the Foreign Office had sent a ""rapid deployment team"" to Algiers to beef up staffing at the embassy. Algerian military forces were surrounding the building holding the hostage-takers and the hostages, Qabliyeh said. Late Wednesday, the hostage-takers released the Algerians they had been holding but continued holding the Westerners, Algerian state television reported. The group has issued demands, but they elicited no response, Qabliyeh said. ""The authorities do not negotiate, no negotiations; we have received their demands, but we didn't respond to them,"" he added. A Mauritanian news agency, Al Akhbar, said the attackers demanded in a news release an end to ""brutal aggression on our people in Mali."" It cited ""blatant intervention of the French crusader forces in Mali"" and accused the world of having left Syria's people ""groaning under the pressure of the butcher"" President Bashar al-Assad. The news release said they chose to carry out the operation in Algeria because the country's president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, had allowed French military forces to cross Algerian air space in attacking Mali. A U.S. official was skeptical. ""The level of planning suggests that this was in train before the French overflights ever took place,"" the official said. That view was echoed by another U.S. official, who told CNN's Erin Burnett that, ""as of now, the attack appeared organized,"" not put together quickly or opportunistic. The official said it was likely that the attackers had cited Algeria's opening of its air space to French fighters as the reason for the attack to protect their operational methods and make the attack appear spontaneous. The news release put the number of hostages at ""more than 40,"" including seven Americans, two French, two British and a number of other Europeans. An Islamist group claiming responsibility for the attack told the Mauritanian News Agency and Sahara Media that 41 ""Westerners including seven Americans, (as well as) French, British and Japanese citizens have been taken hostage."" But the real number of U.S. hostages could be as few as three, two U.S. officials said Wednesday. The Algerian Press Service, citing a source from the provincial administration of Illizi, reported that ""a little more than 20 foreign nationals are held hostage."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in Europe meeting with NATO allies, called the incident ""a terrorist attack."" Nine or 10 Americans were working at the site, and U.S. officials were trying to determine who had been abducted, a State Department official told CNN. The source said the abductors were demanding that members of their group being held prisoner be released and sent to northern Mali. The official was not clear about where the prisoners were. ""The first priority is to gain understanding of what is happening,"" a senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the matter said. ""We are working on ways to improve that now."" The official added that a Special Operations team -- the Commanders In-extremis Force -- ""is on a very short string."" He said that ""another important piece will be for Libya to really lock down the nearby border on their side,"" so personnel and weapons cannot get through. A U.S. official said the capability existed ""to see the area"" around the facility and that the ability to monitor the situation will ""improve soon."" The CIF unit is prepared to move within four hours of being ordered to do so, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The official said that, before the hostage incident, the unit had been headed to Senegal, where it was to be on standby for missions in Mali, but that it may now move elsewhere. A second U.S. official said that any operation would take time to unfold. ""This is not the type of mission that you plan and execute overnight, it's just not,"" the official said. ""We don't know specifically how many militants or hostages there are. But with so little information, if you're talking dozens of militants and up to 40 hostages, I don't see how you go in without killing half the hostages."" The second official said that Marine Corps' Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams would be deployed only to augment security at any nearby embassies. None is under threat. They would not be deployed for field operations in any rescue attempt, the official said. The Pentagon's Africa Command is taking the military lead on the matter, and the State Department and FBI are the lead agencies in contact with the Algerian government, a Defense official said. The official said commanders have assets ""not too far away,"" including aircraft from the Air Force's base in Aviano, Italy, and a Marine Corps FAST team in Sigonella, Italy. Any action would need to be approved by Algeria, ""which is more than just a formality,"" the official said. A spokesman for the group -- whose name means ""those who sign with blood"" -- said that jihadists controlled the plant. Saying that the operation was an act of revenge against Algeria, the spokesman said 400 Algerian soldiers were on the site ""who have not been targeted by jihadists."" A spokesman for the Norwegian Prime Minister's office told CNN that ""13 Norwegians, all employees of Statoil, are involved in the incident at Amenas gas field in Algeria."" The UK Foreign Office said British nationals were caught up in the incident. Ireland's foreign minister said there were reports that an Irish citizen was involved; the office of the French president refused comment on reports that French citizens were among the hostages. Oil giant BP, which operates the In Amenas field in a joint venture with Sonatrac, the Algerian national oil company, and Norway's Statoil, said it was attacked by ""unidentified armed people"" who were occupying the site. Statoil Executive Vice President Lars Christian Bacher said 17 of its employees -- 13 of them Norwegian -- were in or around the facility at the time of the attack. ""We have received information that five of the 17 are brought to safety in a military camp in the area,"" he said in a statement. Four are Norwegian and one is a Canadian resident; two people were injured and have received medical treatment, he said. The gas field lies about 60 kilometers west of the Libyan border and some 1,300 kilometers from the capital, Algiers, BP said. The attack comes four days after Libyan, Algerian and Tunisian prime ministers reached security agreements during a summit in Libya, where they agreed to work together against terrorist threats. In a statement, Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, called the attack ""the latest demonstration of a large and growing radical movement across North Africa"" and said the French ""have acted appropriately"" in intervening in Mali. ""Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and its offshoots have been conducting regular kidnappings for years -- financing much of its operations through ransoms, earning millions,"" the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said. ""The network has planted deep roots in Europe. In recent years, cells have been broken up by authorities in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. In Mali, its brethren are imposing the strictest interpretation of Islamic law -- banning music and chopping off limbs. Large amounts of weapons are flowing into the region.""

"(Health.com) -- Broom or vacuum? Dust mop or Swiffer? We've been trying to figure out the best way to get rid of dust since we first started playing house. And now there's real reason to get serious about the stuff. A new study from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Environmental Protection Agency suggests that the residues of flame-retardant chemicals in essentials like mattresses and TVs are showing up in household dust. Scientists found these chemicals -- known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) -- in the dust of all 16 homes they sampled. No one knows whether PBDEs can hurt you. But their structure is strikingly similar to that of PCBs, which are suspected of causing cancer and can definitely alter human development. Some PBDEs are banned in most parts of Europe. The good news? Some simple changes can really make a difference in your indoor-air quality. 1. Vacuum and dust regularly (once or twice a week should be plenty), and use a vacuum with a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter. Also, try to avoid sweeping, which only circulates dust. 2. Put used vacuum filters in a bag and close it tightly before discarding. Try to avoid touching the filters with your hands. 3. Open your windows as soon as the weather allows it (including those times when you're vacuuming). A recent study from the Canadian government found that PBDE flame retardants were present in indoor air at concentrations 50 times higher than those found outdoors. Fresh air and ventilation can help dilute indoor concentrations. 4. Don't bother using 'ionizing' or 'ion-generating' stand-alone air purifiers. Recent research shows they're unlikely to reduce particle concentrations and may generate ozone, a respiratory irritant. 5. Go easy on air conditioning; when you turn it on and close your windows, it keeps fresh air from getting in. 6. Use an air-conditioning filter with the highest minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating suitable for your system. The higher the MERV, the more efficient the filter is at removing particles. And change the filter regularly, depending on the manufacturer's specs. 7. Consider buying home furnishings from IKEA (800-434-4532), which phased out PBDEs in 2002. If you're looking for a computer or a cell phone, check out Apple and Motorola products; neither uses PBDEs. 8. If you need new upholstered furniture or carpet, try to buy cotton or wool products, which contain no PBDEs and are naturally fire resistant. And to limit your exposure to the PBDE-laden material, don't reupholster furniture that contains foam. E-mail to a friend . Try a FREE TRIAL issue of Health - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- A cold case detective working to identify eight bodies found in John Wayne Gacy's home in 1978 developed a new way to find other possible victims of Chicago's most notorious serial killer. Gacy, who worked as a contractor and part-time party clown, lured his male victims with promises of construction jobs, drugs, alcohol or money for sex, or by posing as a police officer. He was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 men and boys in the Chicago area between 1972 and 1978, but investigators always suspected he had more victims than the 28 found in the space beneath his house and in a nearby river. His DNA was never added to the FBI's national DNA database -- officially called the Combined DNA Index System or CODIS -- because it didn't exist when he was put to death in 1994. Illinois law did not provide for the DNA of convicted killers not in prison after it was enacted in 2002 to be added. But Cook County, Illinois, sheriff's detective Jason Moran, who discovered vials of Gacy's blood in the cold case file a year ago, also found a legal loophole that allowed Gacy's DNA and that of others to be entered into the database. Man believed to be Gacy victim found alive . Sheriff Tom Dart hopes the new approach will give investigators around the United States another tool to solve their cold cases. ""This has the potential to help bring closure to victims' families who have gone so long without knowing what happened to their loved ones,"" Dart said. Moran learned that when the state executes an inmate, the coroner lists the manner of death as homicide. The law allows for the DNA of homicide victims to be added to the database, the sheriff said. ""After review, the Illinois State Police Crime Lab deemed this interpretation acceptable and Gacy's DNA profile was to be obtained and entered in CODIS,"" a news release from the sheriff said. The DNA of two other executed Illinois killers -- Walter Stewart and Durlyn Eddmonds -- have also been added, according to Will County Coroner Patrick O'Neill. The DNA may not have qualified if these men had died of natural causes while waiting on death row, he said. Computers have reported no matches yet for Gacy, O'Neill said. But Moran's cold case work did lead to one of the eight unidentified bodies being identified a year ago. DNA comparisons on the exhumed body of ""victim No. 19"" positively identified him as William George Bundy, who was reported missing in October 1976.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Andrew Breitbart, the conservative blogger whose posting of a sexually explicit photo of former U.S. Rep.

The final cause of death was listed as heart failure, which was caused by Breitbart having an enlarged heart and some heart disease, said Chief Coroner Craig Harvey. Breitbart had a small amount of alcohol in his system, but no prescription or illicit drugs were detected. No significant trauma was present and foul play is not suspected. A full report is expected to be available within two weeks. Breitbart was the first to post Weiner's infamous Twitter photos last year, in which the married congressman appeared bare-chested and in his underpants in pictures sent to a woman online. Weiner eventually stepped down amid the scandal. Breitbart's regular appearances on FOX News, his websites and his speeches to conservative groups made him a star on the right and a villain to the left. Republican presidential candidates quickly responded to news of Breitbart's death last month. Former Sen. Rick Santorum called him a ""powerful force"" who was ""constantly out there driving and pushing."" ""What a huge loss, in my opinion, to our country and certainly to the conservative movement,"" Santorum said. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweeted: ""Andrew Breitbart was the most innovative pioneer in conservative activist social media in America. He had great courage and creativity."" And former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney called Breitbart a ""brilliant entrepreneur, fearless conservative, loving husband and father."" Breitbart was a driving force in the conservative tea party movement. In a posting on the Tea Party Nation website, blogger Judson Phillips wrote that Breitbart was an ""amazing patriot"" who ""relished fighting those who would destroy this great country."" Breitbart came under heavy criticism in 2010 for posting an edited and incomplete video of a speech by Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod, who is black, appearing to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance. She was forced to resign over the video. A full version of the speech showed that Sherrod had assisted the farmer. The department later offered her job back when it was clear she had been misrepresented. Breitbart also posted video of a sting operation against the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, which showed conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute seeking advice on how to set up a brothel. The video prompted a groundswell of action against the organization, including a limited investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and a slashing of funds from the federal government and several states. ACORN went bankrupt and closed its doors. Breitbart got his start helping to run the original right-wing online media behemoth the Drudge Report and helped launch The Huffington Post before founding his own websites.

"(CNN) -- A statue resembling the goddess Athena and jewelry bearing images from Greco-Roman mythology may not be objects you'd expect to see in a museum exhibit of Buddhist art from Pakistan. Their presence among carvings of Buddha and Indian deities is meant to serve as a reminder of Pakistan's oft-forgotten multicultural roots, which form the basis of a new exhibit, ""The Buddhist Heritage of Pakistan: Art of Gandhara."" The show, which runs until October 30 at New York's Asia Society, is the first to bring works of Gandharan art to the United States since 1960. The pieces, on loan from museums in Karachi and Lahore, highlight Pakistan's history as a crossroads of cultural influences, despite present-day associations of the country as an incubator of religious extremism, museum director Melissa Chiu said. ""When we think of Pakistan, Americans might associate it with the place where Osama bin Laden was captured, with terrorism and natural disasters,"" she said. ""But actually, it has a much longer history that dates back to an ancient culture that gives us a sense of a pluralistic tradition that was all about tolerance."" At its height, Gandhara encompassed present-day Peshawar in northwest Pakistan and parts of eastern Afghanistan, the Hindu Kush, and northwest India, making it a major center of trade, commerce and the development of arts and education. Pakistan may be 95% Muslim today, but Buddhism flourished in Gandhara between the 2nd century B.C. and 10th century A.D., giving rise to a distinct style of Buddhist visual art. The statue of Athena and a gold carving of Aphrodite in the exhibit demonstrate the early influence of Greco-Roman culture in the region, which began with its conquest by Alexander the Great. Themes from classical Roman art persisted in Gandharan art even as Buddhism began to flourish in the first century A.D., fostered by Silk Road trade and cross-cultural connections from the Mediterranean to China. Depictions of the Buddha and the concept of bodhisattvas, or ""enlightened beings,"" became the main icons of Gandharan art. A section of the exhibition, ""Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,"" explores the diverse visual imagery of Buddha and bodhisattvas in Gandhara and how it relates to the multifaceted nature of Buddhism in the region. A carving of a standing Bodhisattva bears drapery and folds reminiscent of what you might find in classical art; another flaunts a chiseled torso reminiscent of, well, a Greek god, Chiu said. ""A number of sculptures show us the narrative of the life of Buddha, where we see Buddha represented as person, in symbols, footprint, but it's his representation in human form that went on to influence art that went to China, Japan, Korea, other parts of Asia,"" she said. Getting the pieces to the United States is a tale of bureaucracy in true form two years in the making, but the initiative never suffered from a lack of desire, Chiu said. As an international team begins rebuilding two massive Buddha statues in Afghanistan destroyed by the Taliban in 2001, the exhibit also demonstrates Pakistan's dedication to preserving its multicultural heritage, Pakistan's representative to the United Nations said. With Buddha at its thematic core, the exhibit also highlights lessons of tolerance and humanity of enduring relevance, especially in a time when relations between the U.S. and Pakistan are not at their best, UN Amabassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said. ""Buddha represents a human being whose ethereal qualities were so magnified by his enormous wisdom that his values of himself, which were espoused by Gandhi and so many others, became his contributions to mankind,"" said Haroon, who was instrumental in helping secure the works on loan from the National Museum in Karachi and the Lahore Museum in Lahore. ""This was one of the great periods of the world of fundamental equity, of human rights and so many other important principles, which are important to Pakistan and the United States today,"" he said. ""We're constantly going to strive for a better understanding of each other and a better relationship, and despite what's happening between the U.S. and Pakistan, there are very strong grounds for us to coexist in peaceful fashion.""","""The Buddhist Heritage of Pakistan: Art of Gandhara"" opens at Asia Society in N.Y.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Youssif shows off his ""certificate of citizenship,"" an award given to the Iraqi boy by his school in Los Angeles for being exceptionally nice. ""One kid got hurt, and I helped him,"" Youssif says. Another boy had gashed his arm, and Youssif applied an ice pack and helped stop the bleeding. He smiles and proudly clutches the award. He says he likes to help kids who get hurt because he once was. Seeing Youssif now, it's hard to believe he's the same boy CNN met in Baghdad four years ago -- the young boy who was grabbed by masked men, doused in gas and set on fire. Gone is the sullen, angry child, the one who withdrew when asked questions about his pain and what happened that day. He was so savagely disfigured it looked as though his face melted and then froze into rivers that cut through swollen hard flesh. Since then, he's undergone dozens of facial reconstructive surgeries in California and been through extensive counseling with his family. He still has scars from the attack, but it's his upbeat attitude that's most impressive. He points to a recent photo. He says his looks no longer bother him. ""Because, like, none of my other friends make fun of me,"" he says in perfectly American-accented English. His mother beams. ""His personality has changed so much,"" says Zaineb. ""The way he interacts with people -- everything. It began as soon as he started school and realized that the children don't care about his appearance. It allowed him to have a normal life."" 'The skin melted off' Youssif, now 9, no longer remembers the details of that horrific day in Baghdad. CNN's Arwa Damon's original report . It was January 15, 2007, the same day the ""surge"" of American troops began in the Iraqi capital to cut down on sectarian violence that plagued Baghdad. Youssif played outside. His mother was upstairs when she heard her boy screaming. She rushed outside. ""I thought someone was fighting or something,"" Zaineb said in 2007. When the mother first saw her son on fire, she fainted. When she awoke, she barely recognized him. ""His head was so swollen, you couldn't see his eyes, and his nose was pushed in. ""The skin was melted off."" Youssif's mom: Why my son? He spent two months in an Iraqi hospital, where he received primitive care. His father, Wissam, was determined to get his son help. He pleaded with doctors and government officials -- anyone -- to give his son proper medical care. No one would listen. Doctors told the family there was little they could do to help the child. His dad ended up on CNN's doorstep in Baghdad, desperate to tell his son's story, anything to help get his little boy's smile back. When CNN first aired Youssif's story, viewers around the world responded to the family's plea, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Children's Burn Foundation, a Los Angeles-based foundation that took on his case. His mental recovery has by far outpaced his physical one. He still needs more surgeries. Treating Youssif has been challenging, his doctors say, because his skin tends not to heal well. His doctors want to slow down the pace of surgeries for now to determine how his scar tissue and skin will develop and change as he gets older. He loves soccer and plays on a local team. ""I never used to do that in my country,"" he says, ""because it was kind of dangerous there."" He wants to be a doctor so he can help others when he grows up. Immigrant life in the U.S. Life in the United States hasn't been easy. The family remains grateful for those who've helped them on their journey, but the realities of an immigrant family have sunk in. The family struggles on their father's salary of $9 an hour as a security guard. To help make ends meet, they receive welfare and food stamps. Youssif's surgeries are covered by California Children's Services, as they be would for other children with disabilities who live in the state. The family, which has political asylum, has expanded since arriving in the U.S. -- baby Mustafa was born two years ago. Youssif and his 5-year-old sister, Aya, hope to become American citizens one day, too. Youssif's family arrives in U.S. The family lives in a cramped one-bedroom apartment. Youssif and his sister sleep on the floor. ""I am trying to just help my kids, let them live like a normal life. It's very hard for them,"" Wissam said. On a recent outing at a California beach, Youssif raced along the water's edge. He stopped and scooped up a sand ball. ""You better not get close. This is a muddy one,"" he said. I armed myself with seaweed. He ran shrieking toward the water. ""This is going to be more fun than last time,"" he said. The last time was when the family first arrived in the United States in September 2007. Youssif had never seen the ocean before: He laughed and giggled every time the waves crashed against his feet. The ocean still brings that healing quality. Between our sand ball fights, Youssif grows reflective. He's lived nearly half his life in the U.S. He loves it here, but he's still desperately homesick. He wishes he could go back to Iraq. ""Because it's kind of my country, and I miss everyone I used to know there."" Yet he and his family know a return home will likely not come anytime soon. Youssif's father says family members back in Iraq say it remains far too dangerous. ""They tell me it's still not safe. Sometimes when I tell them, 'I wish I could visit you,' they say, 'No, you cannot come.' "" And with U.S. troops preparing for their final pullout by the end of the year, the family worries they may never be able to go back home.","Masked men doused Youssif in gas and set him on fire in 2007 in Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- On the track, Regina Frazer is known humbly as saBOBtage. The pre-school teacher is co-captain of the Fairbanks Rollergirls in Alaska. As a jammer, it's her job to get past the opposing team's blockers to score points. Frazer's size, strength and speed make her ideal for the position. That wasn't always the case. When Frazer first joined the league in September 2009, she weighed close to 260 pounds. She could barely complete 25 laps on the track without feeling sick. Since then she's lost 100 pounds and 75 inches from her 5-foot, 7-inch frame. Learn more abut saBOBtage's story on iReport . ""It's been incredible,"" says Frazer's teammate Kristen Thomas, a.k.a. Qwerty. ""She went from an overweight asthmatic who was on the slower side... to become one of the fastest skaters that we have."" When Frazer and her husband, Steve, first moved to Fairbanks 14 years ago, they lived in what's called the bush. It's a term used to describe rural portions of the state where transportation and other modern conveniences are spotty at best. In the bush, residents rely on packaged food and whatever they can hunt. Frazer had just given birth to son Morgen. On a diet of Ramen noodles, spaghetti and caribou meat, she had difficulty taking off the pregnancy weight. Over time she and Steve packed on more insulation against the cold. In 2009, 65% of adults in Alaska were overweight or obese, according to the state's Department of Health and Social Services. And more than three-quarters of adults did not consume the recommend five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Food has to be shipped to Alaska, making fresh produce expensive, even in metropolitan areas. And with subarctic temperatures that often drop below zero, staying active outdoors is out of the question. Moving to Fairbanks opened up healthy opportunities for Frazer's family. But it wasn't until she put on her first pair of skates that she realized just how much her weight was slowing her down. ""My teammates liked my size -- I could use my weight to move people and be in their way,"" she remembers. ""But I couldn't move very fast."" In the fall of 2011, Frazer's teammates voted her co-captain of the roller derby team. ""It just kind of hit me,"" she says. ""I needed to be a leader, and I felt like I needed to be an athletic leader. That was kind of the turning point."" Frazer talked to her husband and the pair did a complete overhaul of their diet. They reduced the amount of sugar they were eating, swapped white bread for whole grain and started planning high-protein meals with lots of vegetables. They cut out fast food and added daily exercise to their routine. On the new plan, Frazer's husband and son also lost weight. Steve has now dropped more than 90 pounds. They've also supported Frazer in her journey on the track, adopting derby nicknames: Steve as bench coach ""Burley"" and 14-year-old Morgen as ""Trucker Chuck."" Frazer has gone from a size 22 to a size 8. She can now skate 100 laps with no problem and no longer feels clumsy on her feet. ""I think she's always had fun,"" her teammate Thomas says. ""Now she feels empowered to do whatever she puts her mind to. She doesn't feel as limited. She's faster on her feet. She's more comfortable in her body."" She's also inspired her team and her community. Thomas' partner has lost 50 pounds with Frazer's help, and ""she's inspired a lot of members of our league to take care of themselves."" Frazer has noticed the difference in her day job too. As a special needs teacher, she moves around a lot during the day -- crouching down to speak to a child then standing back up to take charge. ""I would go home at the end of the day feeling so tired,"" she says. ""Now it doesn't even faze me. My energy level is so outstanding -- I love it!"" Roller derby is kind of like football on wheels. The hits can be hard, but the camaraderie is stronger. After events the competing teams often go out together to socialize with beer and bar food. This could have been Frazer's downfall. ""[I'd hear] 'Why aren't you eating? You should have this. It's OK,'"" she says. Instead of indulging, she carried around a cup of hot liquid, be it coffee, tea or chicken broth. For some reason, the hot beverage quelled her cravings. Still, Frazer credits her weight loss to the supportive roller derby community. She says she loves meeting new women whom she otherwise wouldn't know. Being a skater brings out the best in people, she says, whether it's a competitive spirit or a slimmer self.

"(CNN) -- CNN's story about Noor al-Zahra Haider touched readers and viewers, many of whom wrote to say they felt some responsibility for the Iraqi girl whose life was saved by Americans at the height of the Iraq War. Others simply wanted to know how they could help. Childspring International, the Atlanta-based Christian charity that sponsored her stay in the United States in 2006, said it was setting up a special Baby Noor Fund so it could channel donations specifically to Noor's family. Noor was born with a severe form of spina bifida. Alison Fussell, the executive director of Childspring, said Thursday the charity set up the fund after being contacted by people who saw the CNN story. She said she was not yet sure exactly how the donations would be used and that the charity was still determining what the right action would be. She said it would look into possibly linking Noor's family with specialists in Baghdad or shipping medical supplies to them. ""We are keeping a separate account for her,"" Fussell said. ""I do know that we will do the right thing. I am 100% sure of that."" Anyone who wants to donate should include the words ""Baby Noor Fund"" in the box that reads ""Who should we notify of this gift"" on Childspring's Donate Now page. One CNN reader with spina bifida wished the Iraqi girl well. ""As someone born with a mild case of spina bifida, I've faced certain physical challenges throughout my life -- I'm 49 -- but nothing like this young Iraqi girl,"" wrote Paul Keyes. ""May God grant her continued life, improving health and a happy heart."" Another reader, John Last, wrote: ""We humans possess the power to turn our world into garden or wasteland. Tools are right here. ... So she was given hope by noble soldiers who still believe that they are warriors and not mercenaries. (The) journalist that was trying to make the difference instead of chasing some celebrity. Doctors, members of (a) charity group and host families who showed this child the best we humans can offer -- compassion. And then she was forgotten, received the worst we humans can offer -- indifference."" Noor, now 7, was discovered by U.S. soldiers when she was 3 months old during a routine raid of her house just before Christmas 2005. Noor's grandmother told the soldiers that Iraqi doctors could do nothing for Noor, who was born with vertebrae that did not form completely around her spinal cord. She was certain to die. The soldiers sent her to the United States, where doctors performed life-saving surgery. After six months, she was returned to her home in the town of Abu Ghraib. Another reader, Linda Shinn, thought Noor should not have been sent back to Iraq. ""When her family asked for help, they probably thought that more could be done for her in America than was possible, and they somehow imagined that she would be returned to them in good health,"" Shinn said. ""If it was just that she lacked the use of her legs, it wouldn't be so bad, but when it involves her bowels and bladder as well, that is just beyond what any poor family could possibly handle. If she were in the U.S. and possibly in a home for disabled persons, she might have more quality of life, and her family (would) have the huge burden of her care removed from them, and she might have actual nurses who would care for her."" Noor's family paid a price for the association with Americans. They were threatened and forced to restart life in a new neighborhood. CNN caught up with them a few weeks ago in Baghdad and published Noor's story on Tuesday, the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War. It evoked all sorts of emotions and comments about the war itself and what America's role ought to be in that part of the world. Noor's family is struggling to make sure the little girl gets the proper care she needs for her complex medical issues. Noor has a shunt in her brain to relieve pressure from fluid buildup, and she often experiences urinary tract infections that could possibly lead to renal failure. She also has no feeling in her pelvis and her legs, and she cannot walk. Some of Noor's family members wondered whether America had forgotten them. A question that naturally arose from the story was whether America owed anything to Noor. Readers felt both ways. Many agreed that Americans ought to help. ""The article speaks to the idea that many people are happy to help for a time, but it's easy to forget once the headlines go away,"" said Sharon Braddock. ""The follow-up years later presents the question of whether people who step up to assist have a duty to follow through and, if so, for how long? If we start to help, how far should we go? Is it the right thing to separate the child from her family? These are all serious questions with no right or wrong answer, but we should each consider them carefully. Whatever our answer is, it tells us something about ourselves and the world in which we live,"" she said. But others, like alexDW said this: ""Right now she is just a Third World girl with a bladder problem, no different from millions of others. Now the help should be directed to the people who need it most now, and I am sorry to tell you, that is probably not her."" Braddock acknowledged that Noor's case was a tough one. Braddock likes happy endings; she wants everyone to be in a safe place and lead a life of quality. She knows that's easy to say but in this case, difficult to accomplish.","Childspring International has set up a special account for Noor .

"(CNN) -- The world of ""EVE Online"" is brutal. There are enemies and alliances, death and destruction. Gamers fight for territory, profit and fame in a never-ending quest to top their opponent. It's a bit like the real world that way. When Marcus Dickinson first created his ""EVE"" character, Roc Wieler, the two had little in common. Roc was a retired colonel from the Minmatar tribes -- a stoic, physically imposing disciplinarian. Dickinson was a 230-pound Canadian with an affinity for bacon. Over time, the line between fiction and reality has blurred. ""I'm a role player inherently,"" Dickinson says. ""I take it seriously."" For Dickinson, Roc Wieler is a brand. The 40-year-old advertising director has a blog called Roc's Ramblings that he writes for daily -- as Roc. He also creates music albums and 3-D artwork. He even sells Roc-related paraphernalia to his fans through the blog and social media sites. Brand loyalty is one of the reasons Dickinson first decided to shape up. During his trip to the 2009 ""EVE Online"" FanFest, real life hit him smack in the face. Walking into the convention, he didn't feel like Roc. He felt like a stereotypical geek, surrounded by other stereotypical geeks. ""We were all just a bunch of pathetic losers,"" Dickinson remembers. ""We paid good money to fly all the way to Iceland and instead of enjoying Iceland, most of us spent all our time sitting around playing the video game we already played back home."" ""Something snapped inside me, and I realized I wasn't being true to my brand. Why can't I be this character? Why can't I look like this? He acts and talks like me because he is me. I'm the one who gave him life."" Why gamers are a great fit at the gym . For years, Dickinson's wife, Farah Iqbal, had been bugging him to go the gym. When he returned from Iceland, the pair joined on a trial basis. The first month was hard, Dickinson says -- his knees hurt, his feet hurt and he could barely run a mile. But he kept at it. He executed his fitness plan as seriously as Roc would execute a mission. He told himself his weight loss was a matter of life or death. ""If I do not make these changes today, and every day going forward, I will die,"" he says. ""I know it sounds tragic but that's what it took for me."" So he made the changes. He got up at 5:30 every morning. He did leg workouts that made him collapse. He pushed himself until he vomited. He did fitness programs like P90X and Insanity. He ran a half-marathon. Dickinson also changed the way he ate. Iqbal remembers a trip to visit friends in Montreal when Dickinson created a grocery list for their hosts and made all his own meals. ""It was almost embarrassing,"" she says of the grocery list creation, ""but you know what, I got over myself. Because he's on a path that I support."" Dickinson now eats 3,000 calories a day -- mostly lean protein and vegetables -- to sustain his body-building lifestyle. ""Five years ago if I was eating 3,000 calories a day, it was because I had bags of Doritos in front of me,"" he says with a laugh. He's rigid about his lifestyle. He doesn't eat dessert or allow for cheat days. It's a struggle, but one he embraces as a sort of real-life challenge. ""He always had this attitude of not giving up, but now it's extreme,"" Iqbal says. ""He's become very well-focused -- or stubborn -- with (the) journey he's on."" His laser focus has paid off. Dickinson now weighs 185 pounds and is only 14% body fat. He can squat almost twice his weight and dead-lift 450 pounds. ""I'm closer to looking like Roc than I've ever been,"" he says. Dickinson realizes he sounds slightly schizophrenic. But if you think about it, he says, all guys have fantasy lives. When they read comic books, they envision themselves as caped crusaders. When they watch James Bond, they envision themselves as suave womanizers with oodles of money. ""Superman, Vin Diesel -- we want to be them so badly,"" Dickinson says. ""The difference is you'll never be Superman. You're setting yourself up to fail. ""The reason Roc worked was that he was a fantasy hero of my creation, so I was already part way there. I just had to get the physical."" Iqbal says she keeps her husband from crossing the line between fantasy and reality. She's not a big fan of Roc -- she prefers her men balanced, with a feminine side. When Dickinson slips into Roc's deep voice with a ""Hello, darling..."" greeting after work, ""I'm like 'Oh, shut the hell up,'"" she says. ""I have to remind him that it is a character."" Still, Iqbal encourages him to blog and play ""EVE Online"" as much as possible because she knows his fans are eager for more advice on how to get fit. Plus, there's that other side benefit... ""If I said to him, 'This is affecting our relationship,' I know he would (stop),"" Iqbal says. ""But I don't want to -- he looks yummy!""

"(CNN) -- A movement away from using chimpanzees for research is gaining speed. This month, a working group organized by the National Institutes of Health issued a report recommending that most federally supported chimpanzees be retired and taken to sanctuaries. ""It's not that the chimpanzee is not itself a valuable animal,"" said K.C. Kent Lloyd of the University of California, Davis, who co-chaired the working group. But newer technologies, other animals and non-animal systems have been ""shown to address questions that we before may have only been able to address for chimpanzees,"" he said. A 60-day comment period has begun on this report, and the public is invited to weigh in. After that, NIH Director Francis Collins will determine whether he will accept the report in its current form or make changes, Lloyd said. The recommendations pertain to the 360 chimpanzees that the NIH owns that are currently either ""research active"" or ""research inactive."" An additional 91 chimps eligible for research live at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio; although the NIH financially supports their maintenance, the agency cannot itself retire these animals, Lloyd said. A separate group of 219 NIH-supported chimpanzees has been retired and is living at Chimp Haven Inc. in Keithville, Louisiana, or the New Iberia Research Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Laboratory chimps get a new lease on life . Plans to accommodate additional retiring chimpanzees should begin ""immediately,"" the report said. But the report does not call for the elimination of all research on chimpanzees, who share about 99% of their DNA with humans. About 50 chimpanzees should be kept for potential research needs, the report said. They could all live in the same colony to minimize costs. In December 2011, the Institute of Medicine proposed guidelines (PDF) for chimpanzee research, stating that there is little anticipated need for these animals in research and that they should live in appropriate environments and social settings. At that time, the Institute of Medicine committee highlighted two areas where chimpanzees could still be useful in biomedicine: creating a hepatitis C vaccine and developing therapies for cancerous tumors. Studies of chimpanzees' cognition and brain activity may also fit the group's standards. The NIH accepted the institute's report and established a working group to give further advice on how to implement those recommendations. To gather information for the new report, Lloyd and colleagues went on field trips to various facilities to discuss with their experts what works and what challenges they encounter. ""We were not there to inspect facilities; we were there to learn and to be exposed to how chimpanzees are maintained in a variety of environments,"" Lloyd said. The report recommends that chimpanzees live in social groupings of at least seven and that no chimpanzee should live alone for extended periods of time without a documented medical reason or social circumstances. ""Pairs, trios, and even small groups of 4 to 6 individuals do not provide the social complexity required to meet the social needs of this cognitively advanced species,"" the report said. Chimpanzees should have a living space of at least 1,000 square feet per animal and should be able to climb at least 20 feet vertically, the report said. The Humane Society of the United States is happy about the report's recommendations for chimpanzee retirement and for the standards of living conditions for the animals, although its ultimate goal is to end all animal use in research, said Kathleen Conlee, vice president for animal research issues. ""It finally confirmed that there should be no chimpanzee breeding, which we were also very pleased with,"" she said. Conlee said no U.S. laboratory meets the guidelines for chimpanzee living conditions described in this report. But Lloyd could not confirm this, as the working group did not evaluate individual sites based on those standards and didn't visit every single U.S. laboratory. The report included the observation that smaller animal models have helped scientists make strides in highly virulent viruses. Mice, rats, hamsters and guinea pigs are among the animals that are increasingly used for the research of emerging infectious diseases. ""The availability of these models will continually raise the scientific bar for justifying the use of chimpanzees,"" the report said. If the recommendations go into effect, they will have jurisdiction only over NIH-supported or owned chimpanzees. But there are other chimpanzees that are part of research in the United States that do not fall into these categories. The Institute of Medicine report counted more than 930 chimpanzees at U.S. medical research facilities as of May 2011. Many are used for hepatitis testing.

The Philadelphia hip-hop crew's drummer shakes his head: It's just business, man. ?uestlove said he doesn't appreciate a lot of the labels placed on the band -- underground, alternative -- but he conceded that some of The Roots' moves of late keep their fans curious and he doesn't mind making them say, ""OK, I gotta see what happens next.""  Watch what defines a sellout » . Known as sticklers for remaining ""independent"" and bucking trends that drive many of their hip-hop counterparts, The Roots joined Island/Def Jam in 2005 and earlier this year walked on stage as the house band for NBC's ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."" ""I don't know if selling out is even a factor in 2009. There's being responsible, and there's being businessmen,"" he said. ""My definition of selling out is when your products start sounding crappy and when you phone it in from home. But I don't think there's anything compromised or rushed or ill-timed or misthought about our career decision. ""As long as the music's funky and true, and our art is still represented, I don't see that at all,"" he said during a recent stop in Atlanta for the Hennessy Artistry Series that he and rapper Common are promoting.  Meet The Roots » . Playing on a late-night show, ?uestlove said, is a nice fit for The Roots. The six-piece band, fronted by ?uestlove's childhood friend and band co-founder, Black Thought, has always placed a special emphasis on its performances. They've performed with a slew of musicians, ranging from blues legends Robert Cray and Etta James to R&B's Erykah Badu and hip-hop's Jay-Z and Talib Kweli. During Saturday's performance in Atlanta, Georgia, they backed up Common, singer Amerie, Canadian songstress Anjulie and '90s R&B sensations Boyz II Men. They also played a few songs from the 10-album catalog they've compiled since 1993. Their next album, ""How I Got Over,"" is slated for release next month.  Watch The Roots, Common declare loves of their lives » . ?uestlove said collaboration is one of the reasons the band enjoys the late-night circuit. ""The fact that we get to back up or play with or collaborate with Q-Tip, Paul Simon, Ghostface, Michael McDonald, a whole array of artists -- that's the coolest job in the world to me,"" he said. ?uestlove, whose real name is Ahmir Thompson and whose nom de stage is pronounced ""Questlove,"" acknowledged that some of The Roots' fans didn't see the move as a ""a glamorous or glorious thing."" ""They sort of see it as a second-banana, 'minionized' position, and I think that slowly but surely we're really just trying to redefine the art of the house band,"" he said. The key, ?uestlove said, is to keep doing what they're known for -- meshing thought-provoking rhymes with horns, keyboards, strings and percussion, and by showing off their ""chops"" backing up any artist you can throw at them.  Watch them back Boyz II Men » . In a musical genre known more for its synthesis and DJs than for its sousaphones and electric guitars, ?uestlove said he never saw The Roots as going ""against the grain."" ""Despite the fact that in the beginning we were marketed as alternative -- you know, no samples, no DJ, just a funky band -- I think at the end of the day we were six cats that loved hip-hop so much that we just knew how to duplicate the break beats that hip-hop was sampling,"" he said. Often, DJs are influenced by their parents' record collections, he said. They'll take the albums and use them to make new beats and rhythms. ""We just took it a step further,"" ?uestlove said. ""We took our parents' record collection and we just emulated it. We were musicians."" Hip-hop is not famed for the longevity of its luminaries, but ?uestlove and Black Thought, aka Tariq Trotter, have been performing for crowds since the late 1980s. They've seen a handful of artists and MCs come and go since forming the band under the moniker The Square Roots in 1991 -- among them, the infamous human beatboxes Scratch and Rahzel as well as record producer Scott Storch, who used to play keyboards. So, how does a band stay relevant in an era when hip-hop fans seem to prefer overproduction and auto-tune to substantive musical compositions? ""I don't know if there's a secret that I can say that makes us unique or that I can pinpoint to the magic. I just say that we're very, very disciplined, we're professional, we practice a lot and we show up on time,"" ?uestlove said, laughing. ""That's it. That's all you need.""","The Roots became house band for ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" this year .

"(CNN) -- Police in Finland say they have arrested more than 20 men on charges related to the sexual abuse of children. The men are suspected of using the Internet to approach girls between the ages of 9 and 15, engage them in sexual discussions and, in some cases, to meet for sex in exchange for money, cigarettes or alcohol, the National Bureau of Investigations said in a statement. The men acted alone, police said. It was not clear when the arrests were made. The agency's statement did not say and police officials were not in the office to comment Thursday afternoon. At least one of the men, who range in age from 22 to 48, has a history of similar crimes against children, the agency said. Three of those arrested have already been convicted and sentenced to prison, according to the statement. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Police in Finland arrest more than 20 on charges related to child sex abuse .

"Editor's note: Ted Sorensen was special counsel and adviser to President John F. Kennedy. Ted Sorensen says the Kennedys are not American royalty, but have dedicated themselves to service. NEW YORK (CNN) -- With the death of John F. Kennedy's brother, Senator Edward M Kennedy, and their sister, Eunice Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics for the developmentally challenged, there has been a wealth of news stories -- obituaries and otherwise -- about the recurring tragedies endured by what some call America's ""royal family."" All of these comments are well intended but off the mark. The Kennedys have been a remarkable family since its founding roughly a century ago by Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. But, its members have never asked for pity or privilege. Their history has emphasized more success than tragedy. Their love of family and country stood out during some of the most cynical and selfish periods in recent American history. Like any large family, particularly one which deservedly remained in the public eye for many decades, a large number of afflictions and setbacks, also in the public eye, was unavoidable. Nevertheless, the members of that family have never considered themselves ""royal"" or entitled to special privileges. We have no royalty in America, but ever since the Adams family sent several generations to public service in the earliest days of our nationhood, other families have demonstrated similar interests and commitments to public service. The Kennedys were taught as children and genuinely believed that American citizenship was a special privilege and honor, in return for which every citizen had an obligation to serve and help the country. Even the youngest generation of Kennedys today acts not out of a sense of entitlement but a sense of commitment. From the beginning, those members of the family who held or sought public office had the courage to take public positions on controversial issues, not always approved by the leaders of their party, church or respective constituencies. Nevertheless, they stood up and spoke out for what they believed was right, regardless of political and personal consequences. In short, they have had a proud tradition of becoming -- not merely writing about -- profiles in courage. As the result of the elder Joseph P. Kennedy's success in business, many of his descendants could have lived lives of luxury and ease. After all, they liked family fun, in the sun, on the water, sometimes competing with as well as teasing each other. Yet, they devoted and donated more of their valuable time than most families to the service of others, their country, their communities, and those who did not have their good fortune, good education and good opportunities to lead. President John F. Kennedy was their star, their pride, their model and their leader. But his siblings, Robert, Edward, Eunice, Pat and Jean all played their own special roles, making their own special contributions throughout their lives. This country has long been a wealthy country, with all its wealth of brilliant and devoted leaders and traditional ideals. But it would have been a much poorer country without the Kennedys. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ted Sorensen.","Ted Sorensen: People have focused on the tragedies endured by Kennedy family .
He says focus should be on how family has been dedicated to public service .

"Habib Battah is a blogger, freelance journalist and documentary filmmaker based in New York and Beirut. BEIRUT, Lebanon -- When I heard Snoop Dogg was coming to Beirut, I jumped at the opportunity to show the world a different side of the country I had grown up in. So I hit the phones, tracked down the promoter and before I knew it, I was driving to the airport to film Snoop's arrival. Beirut blogger Habib Battah with U.S. rap legend Snoop Dogg. When I first met the Dogg (as he's known by his very courteous suit-wearing bodyguards), he was seated in the VIP lounge of Beirut International Airport, surrounded by entourage while awaiting passport control. The U.S. rap legend had never been to the Middle East before, and I was wondering why he decided to perform in Beirut of all cities. Outfitted in a hooded sweater, despite the sweltering heat of the Beirut summer, Snoop leaned forward and told me in his low voice: ""There are a lot of places I could have started but I chose to start here because I felt they've been supporting me you know -- they've been down with me for long time."" By ""starting"" in Lebanon, Snoop meant that he intended to embark on a Middle East tour in the coming months. ""Me and my man Roger had a nice conversation about putting together a Snoop Dogg Middle East tour ... so we gonna try to get that together over the next couple of months,"" Snoop, flanked by his forever-smiling local organizer, Lebanese entertainment mogul, Roger Kalaouz, told a room full of eager photographers and entertainment journalists. But the Lebanese paparazzi still wondered, why Beirut? ""This is my first chance to party with the people of Lebanon,"" Snoop said. ""They were always partying to my music but now they get a chance to actually party with Snoop Dogg. ""This is the party capital of the world,"" he added and the room filled with applause. Hours later, Snoop drove the locals wild once again during his performance in front of thousands of adoring young fans by holding up a Lebanese flag on stage and then performing an impromptu sing-along with the chorus line ""Beirut, Lebanon."" When the show ended just before one a.m., Snoop did not leave Beirut without living up to his promise to party hard. Acting on a tip from a source close to Snoop's circle, I managed to follow Snoop's entourage to the afterparty, at a massive and highly exclusive rooftop club overlooking the Mediterranean Sea and the Lebanese mountains. I entered the club through the back entrance with members of Snoop's band that I had met at the airport. When we got inside, the champagne was flowing and the club was rocking with hundreds of people. A mixture of house and trance music reverberated across all surfaces as fireworks lit up the evening sky. Snoop's band and crew were ecstatic, sporting looks of awe when they reached their VIP tables in the balcony section which boasts outdoor air conditioning. And even though the European electric beat was quite a stretch from the hip hop he produces, Snoop himself seemed to be getting down -- waving his hands in the air. But it wasn't long before the Dogg switched things up grabbed the microphone: ""You are now rocking with the big Snoopie D.O. double jizzle for shizzle dizzle"" he said, sending screams through the glamorous crowd. Then he turned toward the DJ podium: ""Hey! Yo! DJ! Why don't you play some of that Snoop Dogg sh*t? Once again the crowd was electrified, as Snoop began rapping to his track ""Drop it Like It's Hot,"" (Part of the that performance is available on Snoop's Web site.) Later he played other local favorites such as ""Gin and Juice"" and then rocked to a new track ""That's the Homie"" from his upcoming album ""Malice in Wonderland"" while being filmed by two cameraman and a flash light. The Beirut show producer, Roger Kalaouz later explained that Snoop was actually filming part of the music video for the new track that night. And when Snoop left the club at 3 a.m., the party continued till seven in the morning, according to Kalaouz, in true Snoop fashion, back at the hotel. Kalaouz says he's now preparing for Snoop's Middle East tour beginning in December, with a focus on cities in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf states, such as the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and maybe even Saudi Arabia. Though it remains unclear how much Kalaouz actually paid Snoop to perform in Beirut, he emphasized that the bidding process was intense with much competition from promoters in other Arab countries.

"Westminster, California (CNN) -- The arraignment of Catherine Kieu Becker, the Southern California woman accused of cutting off her husband's penis and throwing it into a garbage disposal, was continued Friday to September 23 at the request of her public defender. Orange County Superior Court Judge Debra Carrillo also set bail at $1 million for Becker, 48, who had been held without bail since her arrest this month. She is charged with torture and aggravated mayhem. The judge also rejected her attorney's request to bar cameras from the courtroom. Orange County Deputy Public Defender Frank Bittar unsuccessfully argued that the intense media coverage would jeopardize Becker's ability to get a fair trial. Bittar also argued that the media coverage could lead to threats against Becker while in jail, but the judge said authorities aren't aware of any such threats. When she entered the courtroom inside a defendants' cage, Becker draped her long black hair over her face to hide from cameras. She was shackled and dressed in a blue jumpsuit. Though authorities said she speaks English, a translator spoke to her in Vietnamese during the court proceedings. ""At this stage in the proceeding, I believe what we have before me is a citizen accused and not someone presumed guilty,"" the judge told the defense in ruling against the camera ban request. She added: ""There are no threats we're aware of."" After the hearing, Bittar declined to comment the day's events other than to say: ""There's a lot more to the case than meets the eye."" The Vietnam-born Becker, who is also known as Que Anh Tran, is also facing special allegations, or sentencing enhancements, for great bodily injury and personal use of a deadly weapon, specifically a knife, according to the felony complaint. If convicted on all counts, she would face a maximum sentence of life without the possibility of parole, prosecutors said. An initial police investigation alleged that Becker, of Garden Grove, California, put a drug or poison in her 60-year-old husband's dinner on July 11 to make him sleepy. Senior Deputy District Attorney John Christl said a toxicology inquiry looking into the alleged drugging should be completed in two to three weeks. ""I'd be speculating as to what the toxicology might show and what drug if any"" may be involved, Christl told reporters after the hearing. The defense sought the delay in the arraignment because Becker's attorney is new to the case and needs time to review police reports with his clients, Christl said. Becker told authorities her husband ""deserved it"" when officers arrived at the scene after she called 911, the police report says. The couple married in December 2009, but separated in April. The husband filed for divorce on May 16 in Orange County Superior Court, citing ""irreconcilable differences,"" according to the divorce papers. They have no children, and their only shared assets are a condominium and a 2010 Toyota Prius, court papers said. He is listed as president of a fabric and design firm whose address is the same as his residence, court papers show. She recently submitted a license application to become a real estate agent, Christl said. On the night of July 11, Becker and her husband argued about friends staying at their Garden Grove residence, prosecutors said in a news release. Becker served her husband dinner, and after feeling tired at about 9 p.m., he went to bed, authorities said. Becker then tied her husband's legs and arms to the four corners of the bed with nylon rope, according to the district attorney's office. As he woke, she pulled down his pants, grabbed his penis and severed it with a knife, prosecutors said. Becker then took the penis to the kitchen, threw it into the garbage disposal and turned it on, ""mutilating the organ,"" the prosecutors' statement said. The husband underwent emergency surgery at UC Irvine Medical Center, authorities said. He has since returned home, but prosecutors weren't commenting on the husband's condition out of respect for his privacy. The Orange County case has been widely compared to the1993 attack against John Wayne Bobbitt by his then-wife, Lorena, who cut off his penis with an 8-inch carving knife while he slept. Lorena Bobbitt then drove away, tossing the penis out her car window. The penis was eventually found and surgically reattached. Lorena Bobbitt was later found innocent by reason of insanity. During her testimony, she tearfully described her life at the hands of her abusive husband. In a separate trial, John Wayne Bobbitt was acquitted of sexually assaulting his wife. He later made appearances on ""The Howard Stern Show."" He also made a number of adult films.","NEW: A judge sets bail at $1 million and rejects a request to bar courtroom cameras .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- It has been dubbed India's version of the Hollywood blockbuster ""Avatar."" And just like the movie, the indigenous group fighting to save its sacred homeland has won a major fight. A plan by British mining giant Vedanta Resources to dig in the mineral-rich eastern state of Orissa has stalled. Environment authorities on Tuesday rejected proposals to mine the mountain, saying any such activity in that area would jeopardize livelihoods of tribes. ""If mining is permitted on this site, it will not only be illegal, but it will also destroy one of the most sacred sites of the Kondh Primitive Tribal Groups,"" the Ministry of Environment and Forests said. The multi-billion project has come under scrutiny as advocacy groups, such as Survival International and Amnesty International, likened the Dongria Kondh tribe to the Na'vi from James Cameron's film. ""This is the real Avatar,"" reads one of Survival International's campaign posters. For years, the 8,000-person indigenous community has been fighting to defend the Niyamgiri Hills, which it considers sacred. The Niyamgiri Hills contain some 72 million tons of bauxite, which Vedanta was planning to extract for its aluminum refinery located nearby. Several calls to Vedanta were not returned. Earlier this month the company announced that it had invested in Indian oil-gas company Cairn Energy in a deal worth $9.6 billion. The ongoing dispute between the Dongria Kondh tribe and Vedanta Resources highlights a broader standoff between industry and local residents. Earlier this month, the government put a ""stop work"" order on another major venture in Orissa -- a $12-billion steel plant proposed by South Korea's POSCO. Analysts say these recent moves could signify a change in the Indian government's approach toward the broader issue of tribal rights versus development.","Indian authorities reject company's proposal to mine in eastern state of Orissa .

"(CNN) -- Prince Philip received a birthday visit on Monday from his wife, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, as he recovered from abdominal surgery at a London hospital. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Philip, who turned 92, was ""comfortable and in good spirits."" The visit lasted about an hour. The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the hospital on Thursday and is expected to stay there for up to two weeks, according to the palace statement. After that, he likely will convalesce for two months. The surgery took place Friday, the palace said. It went as planned and Philip is ""progressing satisfactorily."" Prince Philip: The man behind the queen . Philip left Greece a year after he was born there, following the 1922 overthrow of his uncle King Constantine I. Despite his roots, he has a mixed ancestry and, like his wife, is a great-great-grandchild of Britain's Queen Victoria. A Royal Navy veteran, he met Elizabeth in 1939 and married her in November 1947. They have four children. In addition to his royal and military duties, Philip has served as president of the World Wildlife Fund and the International Equestrian Foundation. Philip has had a number of documented health problems in recent years, including treatment for a blocked coronary artery in December 2011 and a hospitalization in June 2012 for a bladder infection. He was admitted again to a hospital -- this time in Scotland -- for treatment of the latter ailment two months later.

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey police officer charged with attempted murder and arson for allegedly setting fire to his captain's home has been released on $2 million cash bail, the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office said. Michael Dotro, 35, was released Tuesday after a bail source hearing in Middlesex Superior Court, said Jim O'Neill, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. The bail was put up by Dotro's family: $110,000 from one of Dotro's brothers, $400,000 from another brother, and the remaining $1.49 million from Dotro's parents, O'Neill said. His bail was originally set at $5 million, but a judge granted a request by his attorney to reduce it to $2 million. Dotro, a nine-year veteran with the Edison police department, is required to surrender his passport and his firearms. He is not permitted to have any contact with alleged victims, nor with the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. He must not visit the Edison municipal complex, where the police department is located, and is not allowed to travel outside New Jersey, O'Neill said. Dotro was arrested and accused of setting fire to the house of Edison police Capt. Mark Anderko and his family after an investigation by the prosecutor's office and the Monroe Township Police Department determined that the fire had been intentionally started outside the house. Police, emergency medical personnel and firefighters were called to the two-story, colonial-style home shortly before 4 a.m. on May 20. Anderko was in the house with his wife, two children and 92-year old mother. The fire was extinguished within 10 to 15 minutes, and there were no injuries, but the house was damaged. ""The investigators described it as considerable; one part of the house had damage on the first and second floor of the home,"" said O'Neill. Dotro has pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder and one count of aggravated arson, authorities said. He has been suspended from his job with pay. Citing court restrictions, the prosecutor's office declined to give details of the evidence or to talk about a possible motive. Lawrence Bitterman is no longer representing Dotro. He was required to withdraw from the case after reviewing a list of potential witnesses Monday afternoon. ""That list included former and present clients of mine, so there was a conflict of interest,"" he said. However, Bitterman told CNN in May that he believed police arrested the wrong person. He said that Dotro also told him, ""The thought of anyone doing this to his brother officer makes me sick."" Dotro's current lawyer, Robert Norton, declined to comment on the details of the case but told CNN that ""the family has enough confidence in Michael that they pooled all of their savings and posted the $2 million cash bail."" A court date has not yet been set, O'Neill said. CNN's Julia Talanova contributed to this report.","Michael Dotro, 35, has been released after a hearing; family provided $2 million for bail .

"(CNN) -- A Texas grand jury declined to issue charges Thursday in a November 2012 deadly collision between a freight train and a parade float that killed four veterans and injured more than a dozen people, Assistant District Attorney Eric Kalenak of Midland County said. The accident happened on November 15 during the ""Hunt for Heroes"" parade to honor members of the U.S. military. The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing the tracks when an eastbound Union Pacific train slammed into it, Midland police said. An attorney representing Smith Industries, the owner of the truck that served as the float, identified the driver as Dale Andrew Hayden. Civil litigation, however, is pending as the family of at least one deceased victim and several surviving victims, including one left paralyzed, are suing the railroad and Smith Industries, according to the website of the law firm Glasheen, Valles & Inderman in Lubbock, Texas. A second suit on behalf of families of two deceased veterans was filed in Dallas against the railroad, the law firm said. ""Of the twelve families who were on the float stuck by the train, nine have filed suit,"" the law firm said in a January announcement. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board said the grade crossing warning system, which consists of a bell, lights and a gate, operated as designed, giving a 20-second warning of the train's arrival. But the truck entered the crossing and the gate lowered, tipping over flag stands on the float. The board re-created the accident as part of an investigation. An NTSB board member said the south traffic light at the grade crossing turned green 21 seconds before the train's arrival at the crossing, as designed, to allow traffic time to clear the crossing. At 20 seconds before the collision, the bells and lights on the mast activated, in keeping with the minimum time under federal law. Those killed were identified as Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer, 37; Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin, 47; Army Sgt. Joshua Michael, 34; and Army Sgt. Maj. William Lubbers, 43.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Armed men and vendors attacked protesters in Tahrir Square on Sunday as clashes continued for hours, leaving many injured. ""The vendors always existed in Tahrir, but today around 6 p.m. they joined dozens of armed men in plainclothes who attacked us with swords, sticks and threw cooking gas canisters at our tents in the center of the square,"" said Kareem El Agami, a protester living in the tents since the sit-in started on June 28. The protesters fought back with rocks and sticks as the clashes turned bloody. Ambulances sped into the square to treat dozens of people injured. Two women suffered major cuts to their scalps. High-ranking police officers in uniform were seen at the entrance of the Egyptian museum several meters away from the Tahrir Square enclosure. ""We were moving our tents away from the center square toward the Mugama Tahrir government building when these men attacked us brutally. They were thugs sent by the police to disperse our sit-in,"" said Islam Ismael. His tent is now set outside the government building's garden. Dr. Adel Aldawi, an official spokesman from the ministry of health, said he dispatched 14 ambulances to the scene. ""So far 20 people were critically injured and transferred to the hospital while 27 were treated on the scene,"" he said. Panic continued after the clashes ended as many witnesses who have been sleeping in the square accused the police of sparking the attack. ""We caught a low-ranking policeman in plainclothes among the attackers and checked his identification, then handed him to the military police outside the Ministry of Interior,"" said Dr. Yehia Abdel Shafie, a protester who was surrounded by eyewitnesses who confirmed the story. ""The policeman has been lurking around the square since we started our sit-in on June 28 and we noticed him trying to push in men between us to gather information. Today we actually saw him join the attackers and guide them toward our tents, "" Ismael told CNN. Dozens of people are continuing their sit-in at Tahrir Square in a cautious atmosphere. They are using ropes to surround their tents to keep street vendors and thugs away. Young men are directing traffic in the square and its side streets because the police are not present. The army deployed hundreds of troops with armored vehicles onto the streets Wednesday to protect the Ministry of the Interior after the police were forced to withdraw from Tahrir Square when anti-government protests raged. Many Egyptians are angry at the slow pace of change since President Hosni Mubarak resigned on February 11 after protests. A group called the January 25 Coalition issued a range of demands Wednesday, one day after the latest demonstrations began. They called for the ""speedy trial of snipers and killers of protesters, the removal of Cairo's head of security and the official spokesman of the Ministry of Interior"" and ""an immediate investigation in the events of last night."" The group, named for the day anti-government protests began this year, also called for the release of detainees held overnight and the ""immediate expulsion of security officers who continue to butcher and kill Egyptian people."" The military-led government that took over when Mubarak resigned has been prosecuting several former officials accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters. A police officer accused of killing 20 protesters during a January 28 demonstration has been sentenced to death. Former Interior Minister Habib El Adly has been sentenced to 12 years for corruption charges but still awaits the verdict for the charge of killing protesters. Mubarak is scheduled to face the Cairo Criminal Court on August 3 on charges of corruption and deaths of protesters, the justice department said Wednesday. Egypt's military rulers have set parliamentary elections for September. Protests have continued in the months since Mubarak's ouster as Egyptians have demanded speedier reforms and economic improvements. Street vendors on mobile carts that sell tea, corn, fresh juice, sandwiches among other products have been present in Tahrir Square for months during the revolution. The same activists that led the protests on January 25 that ousted Mubarak have called for a massive protest Friday, which has been labeled the ""second revolution."" The organizers have announced that no street vendors may be present for next week's protests and national ID cards will be required for entrance to the square.","Dozens injured in hours-long clashes .

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for Angelina Jolie's former body double -- who is suing Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. over alleged phone hacking -- said Tuesday that other people have contacted his team with their own claims. ""There's been a bunch of people, the majority residents of England, but some in the United States, who have asked us to bring claims for them,"" Norman Siegel told reporters in New York. ""The legal team is researching those and, at some later date, we'll make a collective judgment as to whether we have enough evidence to go forward."" Siegel said that threshold has been reached in the lawsuit filed June 13 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles by the body double, Eunice Huthart. The suit alleges that Huthart's cell phone was hacked in an attempt to find information about Jolie, with whom Huthart lived in Brentwood, California, from early January until mid-June 2004, while they were working on the film ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith."" Huthart also lived in Los Angeles from mid-March until mid-May 2005 doing reshoots for the film, it says. ""On occasions from 2004 to 2005, Plaintiff did not receive messages left and stored on her cellular telephone system while she was in the United States and in the United Kingdom,"" the 40-page complaint says. ""Plaintiff complained to her service provider, Vodafone, about lost voice messages. On occasions friends and relatives asked Plaintiff why she had not replied to their messages. They included Ms. Jolie, who left messages concerning hotel arrangements where she was staying, code names for hotels and individuals, dinner reservations, meet-up times and, on occasion, when she sought the help of Plaintiff during times of need."" The missed calls affected Huthart's daughter and caused her relationship with her husband to suffer, the complaint alleges. Huthart's name, her cell phone number, her account number and/or her PIN number appear on four pages of notes written by Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who did work for News Corp's now-defunct ""News of the World,"" and obtained by Metropolitan Police, the complaint says. Mulcaire and unidentified investigators and journalists ""intentionally and willfully reset Plaintiff's PIN number on several occasions in order to intercept her cellular telephone messages,"" it says. Some of the journalists then deleted them ""to gain an exclusive of the private and confidential information that was on the voice-mail message,"" it alleges. The defendants ""knew or should have known that executives, employees and agents of The Sun and News of the World were engaged in widespread phone hacking,"" the suit alleges. A charge sheet from the Crown Prosecution Service, dated July 24, 2012, lists Huthart as a phone-hacking victim, the complaint says. It cites an April 1, 2005, item in The Sun that said, ""Yesterday The Sun exclusively revealed [Brad] and Angelina checking into a hotel posing as a married couple during a weekend trip to plug their new movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith."" At the time, it was not publicly known that the two actors were a couple, it says. The lawsuit is seeking damages in an unspecified amount that would include any profits made by the defendants, punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs. A News Corp. spokesman declined comment on the lawsuit. Siegel said he also represents families of victims killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks whose phones may have been hacked by News Corp. employees, and that the FBI has opened an investigation. Accusations that journalists at Murdoch's British newspapers hacked into the phones of politicians, celebrities and unwitting people caught up in the news shook his media empire in 2011 and caused the closing of the 168-year-old News of the World newspaper.

"(CNN) -- A suspected serial killer has killed for the last time. Authorities say Israel Keyes, who was arrested and charged in the killing of an Alaskan barista, killed himself while in custody. Before committing suicide on Sunday, Keyes confessed to at least seven other slayings, according to the FBI field office in Anchorage, Alaska, which on Monday asked for the public's help with tracing Keyes' travels over the years in the hopes of identifying any additional victims. He crisscrossed the country, and authorities may never know how many he killed. ""Based upon investigation conducted following his arrest in March 2012, Israel Keyes is believed to have committed multiple kidnappings and murders across the country between 2001 and March 2012,"" the office said in a statement. ""Keyes described significant planning and preparation for his murders, reflecting a meticulous and organized approach to his crimes."" Investigators are continuing to investigate those crimes, though they say Keyes confessed to killing at least seven other people besides the barista: two in Vermont, four in Washington state, and one somewhere on the East Coast, disposing of the body in New York. Keyes did not know any of his victims, the FBI said, but looked for them at remote locations like parks, campgrounds and cemeteries. He is said to have buried supplies he planned to use in future crimes, and investigators recovered two caches, one in Eagle River, Alaska, and one near Blake Falls Reservoir in New York. They contained weapons and items used to dispose of bodies, the FBI said. Keyes allegedly confessed to killing Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex Junction, Vermont. He flew into Chicago, rented a car and drove across several states before arriving there, the FBI said. He is then thought to have traveled around the East Coast before returning to Chicago and then Alaska, where he had lived since 2007. Prior to that, he lived in Washington state, where he confessed to killing four people, the FBI said. He is likewise alleged to have admitted to killing another person, somewhere on the East Coast, in 2009. The identities of those five victims were not released. Finally, Keyes was accused and charged in the death of 18-year-old Samantha Koenig, the Alaskan barista. She was last seen on February 1 being led away by a man from the parking lot of the coffee stand where she worked. Her body was found in a lake north of Anchorage. Authorities in Anchorage released a chilling account of the killing of Koenig in part to ""help investigations of other murders committed by Israel Keyes."" Keyes had planned to commit a kidnapping at Koenig's coffee stand even though he did not know her, according to the joint statement by local and federal authorities in Alaska. He approached near closing time on February 1, wearing a mask and ordered coffee. After Koenig made the coffee, Keyes brandished a gun forced himself into the coffee stand and bound the 18-year-old woman with zip ties. She tried to escape, was unsuccessful and he took her to his truck. ""Keyes drove around town, explaining to Samantha that this was a kidnapping for ransom,"" the statement said. He killed her at his home, hid the body in a shed and then went on a cruise he had been planning. He returned on February 17. ""He went into the shed and retrieved Samantha's body, taking steps to make it appear that she was still alive, and took a Polaroid picture of her tied up,"" the statement said. He sent the picture to girl's family members using her cell phone. He demanded $30,000 be sent to an account associated with an ATM card he had stolen from her. The young barista's family was able to raise the money from donations and sent it. Authorities arrested Keyes after he made withdrawals of that money. But not until the alleged serial killer made withdrawals in Anchorage, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.","Israel Keyes committed suicide while in custody on murder charges, officials say .

The father of the Toms River, New Jersey, boy -- who died earlier this week after being shot by his young playmate -- said he and his wife decided to donate Brandon's organs, in hopes some good will come of their tragedy. ""We both decided that it would help carry his name, that he's helping somebody,"" Ron Holt told the Asbury Park Press.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A group of Heath Ledger fans have taken their reverence for the late ""The Dark Knight"" star to a whole new level. Heath Ledger fans launched a petition calling for studios to remove the Joker from future Batman movies. Followers of the actor, who electrified audiences with his chilling reinvention of the Joker in the second Batman blockbuster, are calling for the character to be retired from the movies permanently. Ledger supporters at new Web site, The Ultimate Joker, launched a petition last week calling for studios to remove the Joker from any future Batman movies. The petition currently has 2,431 supporters. ""We think Heath deserves this honor,"" the site's team leader, Fer Barbella, told CNN from Buenos Aires, Argentina. ""He is the ultimate Joker. ""We are Batman fans from the comics and from the movies,"" he said, ""After we saw 'The Dark Knight,' we thought this Joker was really the best. It deserves to be withdrawn from any Batman sequels. ""When Michael Jordan retired, they withdrew the number 23 jersey as an honor. It's the same thing with Heath."" Barbella said he thinks any new performance just won't be able to top Ledger's. ""He upgraded the character in a thrilling way,"" he said. ""Although a lot of actors would love the chance to play the Joker, as Batman fans and now Heath Ledger fans, we think no one could ever perform it as well as he did."" The Web site is the brainchild of Barbella, 34; Nico Pimentel, 33; and Natalia Rodoni, 33, all advertising creatives in Buenos Aires. The trio say that if they collect enough names, they may go to the studio to present their petition. ""As soon as we start seeing that we have more than 50,000 names on our Web site, perhaps we will go to the Warner Brothers gate and do a bit of activism,"" Pimentel said. The huge buzz around Ledger's performance as the Joker last year stemmed from his update of the iconic character played by camp comedian Cesar Romero and as a hateful clown by Jack Nicholson. Ledger's Joker was a very different proposition from those that had come before: In a ripped, stained suit, with clown makeup smeared across a scarred, twisted mouth, his Joker was a nihilistic, sociopathic prankster. ""Why so serious?"" he sneered in a performance that received rave reviews from critics globally. Do you agree that Heath Ledger's Joker should be the last one ever? The actor was found dead after overdosing on prescription drugs at his apartment in New York on January 22, 2008, shortly after concluding work on ""The Dark Knight."" Ledger has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the Joker, having been awarded a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor. Barbella says that the Web site and petition are their award: ""The Academy gives an Oscar,"" he said. ""This is a new award from the people. A user-generated award.""","Heath Ledger fans are calling for The Joker to be removed from future Batman films .

"(EW.com) -- The USS Enterprise picked up steam throughout the weekend, despite a somewhat unimpressive start. Early estimates show that J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (CinemaScore: A) could bring in $70.6 million on the three-day weekend, and $84.1 million for the four and a half days that it has been open. Though nothing to scoff at, it's still underperforming according to initial projections, which hoped for a $100 million extended weekend and $80 million on the three-day. The first ""Star Trek"" of the Abrams era opened in early May of 2009 and made an impressive $75.2 million on its first weekend out of the gates, without the benefit of 3-D surcharges. This newest film is showing in 336 IMAX 3-D theaters, whereas the first showed in 138 IMAX venues — accounting for $8.5 million in ticket sales on its first weekend. EW review: ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" As we previously said, the nature of Abrams' four different directing projects makes him difficult to analyze in terms of pure box office numbers, so his ""Star Trek"" successes and potential will have to stand on its own. The first film stayed in theaters for 21 weeks, ultimately grossing $257.7 million for Paramount. This is a franchise that seems separate from its stars. Chris Pine, who plays Captain Kirk, for example, has not proven to be a box office draw on his own. Again, this opening weekend isn't bad, but it's interesting to think about why it couldn't live up to early estimates — especially considering the runaway success of ""Iron Man 3."" Perhaps four years is too big of a gap between films. There was a three-year gap between ""Iron Man 2"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" but releasing ""The Avengers"" during the hiatus was likely important for keeping the character present. ""Iron Man 3"" continues to do well at the box office in spite of the new competition from ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" making an estimated $35.2 million in its third weekend in theaters. This brings its domestic total to $337.1 million. ""The Great Gatsby"" took the No. 3 spot with a $23.4 million weekend, bringing its domestic total to an estimated $90.2 million. The $100 million mark is close for Baz Luhrmann, and it would be a first for the Australian director, even accounting for price inflation. This could partially be the Leonardo DiCaprio effect, the ubiquity and appeal of the novel, or an indication that there is room amidst sci-fi and comic book blockbusters for other types of films — even if this literary adaptation is also a 3-D release. Leonardo DiCaprio: Could anyone else have been Jay Gatsby? The No. 4 spot went to Michael Bay's ""Pain & Gain,"" which made $3.1 million in 2,429 locations. It's only down 38 percent from last week despite the fact that it lost 874 theaters. The relatively inexpensive ($26 million) Dwayne Johnson/Mark Wahlberg flick has made $46.7 million domestically so far. Rounding out the top five is ""The Croods,"" the Nicolas Cage and Emma Stone-voiced cave-family animated picture, which last appeared on the list two weeks ago. The $135 million movie has made an estimated $176.6 million domestically in its 9 weeks in theaters. As one of the only family friendly films available in theaters at the moment, it's unsurprising that it continues to quietly do well. 1. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" — $70.6 million (3-day) 2. ""Iron Man 3"" — $35.2 million . 3. ""The Great Gatsby"" --$23.4 million . 4. ""Pain and Gain"" — $3.1 million . 5. ""The Croods"" — $2.8 million . Noah Baumbach's ""Frances Ha"" also opened this weekend in four theaters, bringing in $134,000 with an impressive per theater average. Baumbach's previous three films all played in under 200 theaters. Check back next weekend for some powerhouse face-offs, with Universal's ""Fast & Furious 6,"" Warner Bros. ""The Hangover Part III"" and Fox's ""Epic"" all opening wide. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The redshirt freshman quarterback who led the University of Notre Dame to an undefeated regular season in 2012 and a berth in the national title game has been suspended for the fall semester for ""poor academic judgment,"" Everett Golson said in a statement released by the school Sunday. Golson did not provide details on what led to his suspension, and Notre Dame declined to comment beyond confirming late Saturday that the former starting quarterback is no longer enrolled, citing ""federal law and our own policies."" ""I take full responsibility for my poor choices and will do all that is asked of me to regain the trust of my family, friends, teammates, coaches and the entire Notre Dame community,"" Golson's statement said. Golson, 20, led the Fighting Irish to 10 straight victories to open his starting season in 2012. The team's undefeated season came to a crushing end when Alabama's Crimson Tide defeated the Irish in a 42-14 rout in the BCS National Championship. The Irish last won a national championship in 1988, beating West Virginia 34-21. Golson, originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, left open the possibility of a return in 2014. ""At this point, I understand how my integrity could be in question but I want to reassure my supporters that through this experience I will return a better student athlete as well as a better individual,"" he said, thanking the university for ""the opportunity going forth to regain my eligibility in the winter of 2014."" News of the suspension comes during an embarrassing year for the university's football program, which faced intense media scrutiny in January after reports surfaced that star linebacker Manti Te'o was the victim of an elaborate hoax involving a fake girlfriend.","Everett Golson led the team to an undefeated regular season in 2012 .

"Boston (CNN) -- As the horror of explosions near the finish line of the nation's most famous marathon sank in, government officials mobilized to respond on Monday afternoon. FBI director Robert Mueller briefed President Barack Obama by telephone, the White House said. All off duty-police officers in Boston were told to report to their districts, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, and the Red Cross sent additional blood products to Boston-area hospitals, spokeswoman Anne Marie Borrego said. Aviation authorities banned planes from flying over of the site of the explosion, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The temporary flight restriction came at the request of law enforcement and originally extended three nautical miles in all directions before being reduced to two. It reaches up to a height of 3,000 feet, FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said. The agency ordered a brief ground stop at Boston's Logan airport but it did not last long.

In Miami, police said they were increasing security at critical infrastructure sites, while the Los Angeles Police Department restated its advice to the public: ""If you see something, say something."" Secretary of State John Kerry -- a former Massachusetts senator with deep ties to Boston -- found out about the blasts when he was on his way to Chicago on his way home from a 10-day foreign trip, and called his daughter Vanessa, who has run the Boston Marathon in the past, a senior State Department official said.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A train speeding through a forested corridor in India's West Bengal killed three elephants and another is in a critical condition, a wildlife official said Friday. A baby elephant was among the animals killed in the pre-dawn collision in India's Jalpaiguri district some 620 kilometers (385 miles) north of the state capital Kolkata, said V.K. Sood, chief conservator of forests in West Bengal state. Another elephant is still in a critical condition after the train plowed into part of a herd crossing the tracks, he said. Concern over similar incidents had prompted railway authorities to restrict train speeds in the area to 25km an hour. However, the railway department has said a speed of 50km an hour was permissible in the area where the accident occurred. Sood said an inquiry is now underway to determine the speed of the train that killed the elephants Thursday, he said, adding that investigators were also looking at the levels of visibility on the track at the time. As many as 36 elephants have been killed by trains in the area since 2004, Sood said. India's former rail minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said in a Railway Budget speech in February the department needed to make special provision to protect what he called ""these gentle giants."" ""The railway family is deeply grieved by some incidents of death of elephants on railway tracks passing through forest areas. Several measures have been initiated in consultation with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, which I am confident will substantially reduce such accidents and safeguard the lives of these gentle giants,"" he said. He said the department had already proposed a bypass rail link around one reserve with a sizable elephant population. Conservationists estimate that India has a wild population of some 25,000 Asiatic elephants but their habitat is increasingly under pressure as human settlements encroach on nature reserves. India has recently witnessed a number of cases of wild animals entering urban environments. In one high-profile incident a leopard killed one person and injured two other after wandering into a residential area in northeast India.","Train in West Bengal kills three elephants and left one in a critical condition .

"Washington (CNN) -- In testimony that sharply contradicted the Obama administration's initial narrative of the September 11, 2012, terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, three witnesses shared firsthand accounts this week of what happened before, during and after the attack. The three testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, recounting the horrific events that took the lives of four heroic Americans that day at the U.S. Consulate. Much of what we have known about Benghazi to this point has come from Obama administration sources. The accounts of these brave witnesses raise troubling questions about the veracity of what we've been told by official sources since the attack took place. The first contradiction pits former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's explanation of security conditions at the compound against that of Eric Nordstrom, the former regional security officer at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. In his testimony Wednesday, he repeated assertions he'd made to Congressional investigators last year that his recommendations to upgrade security were ignored at the highest levels. Yet roughly four months after the attacks, Clinton told the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that ""specific requests and decision making"" on security ""rest with the security professionals."" Even more disturbing was the discrepancy over what happened during the attack. The official story in the Accountability Review Board (ARB) report concluded there was no ""undue"" denial of support or assets. Yet we heard testimony from Deputy Chief of Mission Greg Hicks that four special operations military personnel in Tripoli were preparing to go to Benghazi on a rescue mission when they were told to stand down. This is jarring, taken against then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's claim in February that ""time, distance, the lack of an adequate warning. . . prevented a more immediate response."" Opinion: Benghazi hearing's real target: Clinton in 2016 . Furthermore, the Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST), which the State Department's website calls ""the United States Government's only interagency, on-call, short-notice team poised to respond to terrorist incidents worldwide"" was not called into action. For nearly two weeks after the attack, the Obama administration continued to peddle the story that it began as a demonstration against a video and got out of hand -- a claim that is now universally understood to be false. But at Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, quoted what he said was an internal e-mail dated the day after the attack in which Assistant Secretary of State Beth Jones told the Libyan ambassador that Islamic group Ansar al-Sharia was responsible for the attack. The video claim was pure fiction, but Hicks testified that he was reassigned to a lower-level position after he questioned it. (A State Department spokesman maintains that Hicks was not subjected to retaliation.) More troubling than the initial video claim, however, is the allegation of serious flaws in the report issued by the Accountability Review Board, convened by Clinton, whose members include retired diplomat Thomas R. Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. All three career diplomats who testified Wednesday complained about the report, which they said was incomplete and assigned blame to the wrong personnel. As Congressional investigators have tried to get answers, the State Department has thrown up roadblocks. For example, Hicks testified that the State Department sent a lawyer from Washington in an unsuccessful attempt to ensure that I did not speak to him privately during my visit to Libya after the attacks. These concerted efforts by the State Department to conceal information from Congress should raise red flags. We have four dead Americans. To date, nobody has been captured or killed. The terrorists are still on the run. And we have an increasing number of contradictions between what we were led to believe and what the witnesses say actually happened. It's hard to take any refutations of the testimony seriously given the impeccable credentials of the witnesses and the despicable record of misdirection from this administration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of . Jason Chaffetz.","Jason Chaffetz: Testimony this week on Benghazi contradicts administration's initial narrative .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Hungary indicted a Nazi war crimes suspect Tuesday with involvement in the brutal treatment and deportation of thousands of Jews during World War II. Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary was allegedly ""actively involved"" in sending nearly 12,000 Jews to various concentration camps in the spring of 1944, according to the Metropolitan Chief Prosecution Office in Budapest. According to prosecutors, Csizsik-Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice, which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s. Csizsik-Csatary topped the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of ""most wanted Nazi war criminals"" as of April this year. The Wiesenthal Center, a worldwide Jewish rights organization, and a British tabloid, The Sun, highlighted the case against him last year after the suspect, who is reportedly in his late 90s, was found living in Hungary in 2011. The prosecution's indictment describes how most of the local Jewish people were forced into a ghetto and a deportation camp housed in a brick factory in April 1944, a month after the town was occupied by German troops. Csizsik-Csatary was made commander of the ""collection and deportation camp"" in the brick factory at the beginning of May 1944, it says. During that month, he ""regularly beat the interned Jews with his bare hands and whipped them with a dog-whip without any special reasons and irrespective of the sex, age or health condition of the assaulted people,"" the indictment alleges. From mid-May to the start of June, the almost 12,000 Jews held in the camp were transported in packed freight wagons to the concentration camps in German-occupied territories. The majority of the Jews deported from Kosice went to Auschwitz, it says. The defendant ""was actively involved in and assisted the deportations,"" the indictment says. In early June, he also allegedly ""prohibited cutting windows on the wagons which could have helped the about 80 people being crammed under inhuman circumstances in the windowless wagons to get more fresh air."" The indictment concludes that Csizsik-Csatary ""intentionally assisted the unlawful executions and tortures committed against Jewish people who were deported."" According to the Wiesenthal Center, Csizsik-Csatary was previously convicted in absentia and sentenced to death for torturing Jews and his role in the mass deportation to Auschwitz. He escaped to Canada after World War II but was stripped of his Canadian citizenship in 1997, and chose voluntarily to leave the country, the center claims. He was rediscovered in the fall of 2011 as part of the center's Last Chance project, and was charged last July with the torture of Jews in the Kosice ghetto, it says. In March this year, a Slovak court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment to enable Slovakia to seek Csizsik-Csatary's extradition from Hungary to stand trial for his crimes in Kosice, it adds.

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- The ""Mona Lisa"" has long been shrouded in mystery, including one long-standing question about the famous lady: What happened to her eyebrows and eyelashes? A French engineer and inventor examined the famous painting with a camera of his own design. Now, a French engineer and inventor says he's uncovered part of the enigma. Pascal Cotte announced at a press conference Wednesday that he has found definitive proof that when Leonardo da Vinci painted the original portrait he included ""Mona Lisa's"" lashes and brows. Cotte examined the world's most famous painting using a high-definition camera of his own design. The device scanned a 240-million pixel image using 13 light spectrums, including ultra-violet and infrared. The resulting ultra-high resolution photograph of 150,000 dots per inch yielded a reproduction of the ""Mona Lisa's"" face magnified 24 times. And there Cotte found the evidence he sought -- a single brushstroke of a single hair above the left brow.  Watch as expert announces findings on ""Mona Lisa"" » . ""One day I say, if I can find only one hair, only one hair of the eyebrow, I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow,"" said Cotte. So, if she once had lashes, where did they go? Possibly faded pigment, Cotte suggested, or possibly a poor attempt to clean the painting. ""And if you look closely at the eye of 'Mona Lisa' you can clearly see that the cracks around the eye have slightly disappeared, and that may be explained that one day a curator or restorer cleaned the eye, and cleaning the eye, removed, probably removed the eyelashes and eyebrow,"" he said. Cotte's high resolution camera led him to numerous additional discoveries about the enigmatic artwork. The infrared layer of the image shows that the fingers of the ""Mona Lisa's"" left hand were originally painted in a slightly different position than in the final portrait. Cotte said the change in position was the result of a lap blanket held by Leonardo's model. In today's faded image the blanket is all but obscured, but the highly detailed camera detected the faded pigment. ""It was really the first time that we have this kind of position of the arm,"" Cotte said, ""and after Leonardo da Vinci, thousands of painters have made a copy of this position but without understanding why we have this position. The real justification of the position of the wrist is to hold the blanket on her stomach. It's really a great, for me, it's really a great discovery."" One of the results of Cotte's work is a ""virtual"" restoration of the painting, an exact replica showing the original colors as they would have looked when the painting was new. The skin tones of Leonardo's model appear as a warm pink and the sky behind her is a glowing blue, far different from the gray-green tint that covers the artwork today. That dark patina is the result of 500 years of aging, according to Cotte. Cotte presented numerous other findings within the infrared layer he photographed. The researcher said the ""Mona Lisa's"" smile was originally slightly wider than it appears today, and, in fact, so was her entire face. Leonardo kept this painting with him for more than a decade, and is said to have worked on it up until his death. The Renaissance artist once said, ""Art is never finished, only abandoned."" The results of Cotte's study are on display at the Metreon in San Francisco, as part of the exhibit ""Da Vinci: An Exhibition of Genius.""

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- One of two men charged with killing the crew of the Joe Cool charter fishing boat last year has agreed to plead guilty to first-degree murder, a victim's relative said. Kirby Archer is expected to plead guilty in exchange for prosecutors dropping the death penalty. Kirby Archer is expected to change his plea to guilty in exchange for a prosecutors' agreement not to seek the death penalty against him, according to Jeff Branam, an uncle of slain boat captain Jake Branam. He said prosecutors told the victims' relatives about the plea deal. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, Florida, declined to comment. Court documents filed Friday show that Archer is scheduled to change his plea at a hearing Thursday. Archer and Guillermo Zarabozo are charged with four counts each of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery in the deaths of Branam; his wife, Kelly; his half-brother Scott Gamble; and first mate Samuel Kairy. None of the victims' bodies has been found, and authorities have said it is unlikely they will be. The abandoned Joe Cool was found by the U.S. Coast Guard on September 23, floating about 60 miles south of the island of Bimini. Zarabozo and Archer were found a few hours later, about 10 miles away on a life raft. The two had paid the Joe Cool crew $4,000 in cash to take them to the Bahamas from Miami, where they said they were planning to meet some girlfriends. The trip should have taken about an hour each way. The boat did not return. Zarabozo told authorities the boat had been hijacked by pirates who fatally shot Jake and Kelly Branam and ordered the crew thrown overboard but spared the two of them. This spring, Zarabozo said in court documents that Archer killed the crew, using Zarabozo's gun. No gun was found. Police believe that the bodies of the crew were pitched overboard between Miami and Cuba. Jeff Branam said the victims' relatives met with prosecutors a few days ago. ""They said he was going to plead guilty,"" he said of Archer. ""I would have liked to have seen him get the death penalty, but if he's going to be in prison for the rest of his life with no chance of getting out, that'll work."" CNN was unable to reach Archer's defense attorney. Jeff Branam said the government's case against the two appears strong but said he's glad a jury won't decide Archer's fate. ""I think they have a lot of circumstantial evidence,"" he said. ""If you have just one person on a jury who might feel there were pirates, they might not [convict],"" he said. ""Without bodies, it could be an uphill battle."" Archer, 36, was once an Army MP who served at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Investigators and victims' family members say they were told he wanted to go back to Cuba. Archer befriended Zarabozo, 20, who left Cuba with his family. Last year, Archer fled to Florida after he was accused of stealing $92,000 from an Arkansas Wal-Mart where he was working. Zarabozo's lawyer, William Matthewman, had little to say about Archer's pending plea. ""All I can say is, Mr. Zarabozo pled not guilty. He maintains his not guilty plea, and he plans to proceed to trial."" No trial date has been set. Jake and Kelly Branam are survived by their children: a girl who was 2 at the time of their deaths and a boy who was 4 months old. A court has awarded custody of the children to Kelly Branam's stepsister, according to relatives.","Victim's relative says plea deal is in exchange for dropping the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to negotiating a salary for a new job it can pay to ask for a precise figure. New research has suggested that asking for an amount that is less ""round"" -- like $105,000 instead of $100,000 -- increases the final outcome. The idea is that precise numbers give recruiters the impression a candidate has thoroughly researched the job. ""It matters because round numbers seem less informed. People who use them seem like they haven't really done their homework, or they're just sort of being arbitrary,"" said Malia Mason, an associate professor at Columbia Business School, who led the study. She says the perception that a number came out of nowhere leads negotiation counterparts to be more aggressive in their counteroffers, which translates into worse outcomes for people who make round offers, compared with people who make precise offers. ""Precise numbers are just one way to communicate to people 'don't mess with me' or 'I'm informed, I'm not just throwing some number out there,'"" Mason said. Read more: Can Twitter help you land a job? The real burden for the job seekers is to then prove they are not just throwing numbers out there. Mason says actually doing the calculations of how much to ask for, to back up the offer amount, is ""far more important"" than simply using the precise numbers recommended by the study. Candidates may figure out the going rates for the jobs from Websites or by asking someone within the company who would be open to telling you. Ramit Sethi, author of ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"" offers courses on negotiation using techniques based on his own experience, real-world data from his students and tests that he runs. He says that doing relevant research, and then giving the perception that you have reasons for the dollar figure sought, is the most important part of negotiation. ""When you walk into a room, you should already know not only the pay range of your job, but you should have it documented and printed out and ready to present,"" Sethi said. Good negotiators should be able to justify why they should be paid the higher end of that range, Sethi said. It involves explaining one's experience, knowing the company's challenges and letting the recruiters know how you can solve their problems. Read more: What does it take to get a job in China? To show recruiters that you can back up your salary request, Sethi recommends candidates use the ""briefcase technique,"" actually typing up a plan of how they would help the company and pulling it out (possibly from a briefcase) during a negotiation. ""It shows what they would do in 30, 60, 90 days. And when you do this people's jaws drop. And when that happens, five or ten thousand dollars' raise in negotiation is almost trivial. It's almost beside the point, because you're showing how much value you can add to the company,"" he said. Mason points out that there are broad benefits to providing reasons in a salary negotiation. Not only does it help convince the recruiter of the candidate's worth, but it gives the recruiter material to back up the decision. ""People don't like being told 'it's my way or the highway.' People like to have reasons,"" she says. ""What you want to do in a negotiation is have your counterpart understand why that number that you're suggesting makes sense, so that he or she can explain to herself why it makes sense, so she can go explain to the rest of her company or the rest of her team why it makes sense.""","In negotiations, there is an advantage to offering a figure that is not a round number .

"(CNN) -- Those who knew Canadian folk musician Taylor Mitchell say her passion for her craft was matched by her affinity for nature. Fresh out of high school, she embarked upon a three-week tour of Eastern Canada earlier this month full of hope over her blossoming career and excited to explore the region with a new car and driver's license. The 19-year-old rising star was in between gigs when, according to a Nova Scotia Cape Breton Highlands National Park official, she was killed by coyotes during a hike on Tuesday afternoon. ""If there can be any comfort at all, it is knowing that Taylor was doing two of the things she loved most, sharing story and song on the road and spending time in nature's fold,"" her manager, Lisa Weitz said in an e-mail. ""She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity."" Mitchell was a ""seasoned naturalist"" well versed in wilderness camping who wouldn't want the coyotes responsible for her death to be killed, her mother said Thursday. ""When the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes, I clearly heard Taylor's voice say, 'please don't, this is their space.' She wouldn't have wanted their demise, especially as a result of her own. She was passionate about animals, was an environmentalist and was also planning to volunteer at the Toronto Wildlife Centre in the coming months,"" Emily Mitchell said in a statement Thursday. ""Tragically, it was her time to be taken from us so soon,"" the mother said. When she was 15, Mitchell began vocal lessons with her future producer, Michael Johnston. ""Taylor inspired and impressed everyone from her musical peers to members of the Canadian roots-music community who were two and three times her age,"" he said in a statement. ""They saw in her the rarest of the gifts -- an ability to sing not only from the heart, but in a way that transcended her age and experience and became something universal."" The Toronto-based musician's career began to take off earlier this year after the April release of her debut album, ""For Your Consideration."" She was nominated for Young Performer of the Year honors by the Canadian Folk Music Awards, which will be awarded in November. On her Facebook page, she detailed her busy summer performance schedule, describing it as her ""craziest summer yet."" In July, she said she took a Greyhound bus to perform in the Young Performers Program at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, her first show west of Ontario, which featured acts including Arlo Guthrie, Neko Case and Elvis Costello. She played more shows in the Toronto area, relishing the airplay her album was receiving, and worked on songs for her next album, Weitz said. Yet she managed to return to nature with her aunt, mother and best friend at the family cottage in Owen Sound, Ontario, delighting in its simple joys. ""Our cottage is on the shores of Georgian bay. It's 125 years old with three bedrooms that sleep two and one bedroom that sleeps four, plus a bunkhouse. It's old and creaky and absolutely beautiful. As I sit on my couch in my apartment, I'm homesick for the precariously slanted stairs, tennis courts, lake and wonderful memories,"" Mitchell said on her Facebook page. Before she set out eastward for her tour of the Maritimes, she shared her works in progress at the Ontario Council of Folk Music conference in Ottawa, impressing all those in attendance, Weitz said. ""Taylor Mitchell's vocal style and consummate songwriting craft belied her vernal years. Indeed, her songs told the tales of a seeker, a sojourner with a sage wisdom atypical of most, let alone one of such tender years,"" Weitz said. On her Facebook page, she had begun counting down the days to her East Coast tour in September, saying in a September 18 status update that she was ""feeling the pull of the road."" In her last post on the site, she described playing a show in someone's home, calling it ""a welcome dose of normality after a whirlwind weekend"" at the Ontario Council of Folk Music. Those closest to her said they'll derive inspiration from her passion for life. ""Taylor was my shining light, my baby, my confidante and best friend,"" her mother said. ""I don't know how to move forward from here but I know that she would want that for me, and I will try to do that in her memory and celebrate her life in the way she lived it -- with passion, commitment and an unbridled loving heart.""","Taylor Mitchell was a ""seasoned naturalist"" versed in wilderness camping, mother says .

"(CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush is visiting Zambia to promote a health initiative that focuses on cervical and breast cancer prevention and treatment. In the city of Kabwe, Bush worked with local residents Saturday to refurbish a clinic used to screen, diagnose and treat cervical cancer. Bush heads to the capital of Lusaka, where he will designate a cancer center at a university teaching hospital and meet with governmental and health care leaders. He will then travel to Botswana to launch a similar program aimed at combating cancer. The trip to both nations -- which ends Thursday -- is part of the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon initiative spearheaded by his foundation that seeks to expand cervical and breast cancer screening, and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. Cancer in Africa is an emerging global concern. The continent has an acute shortage of experts such as oncologists, and lacks infrastructure and data to combat the disease, exacerbating the concern. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush have previously visited the continent as part of his foundation's health initiative. In a 2008 trip to Tanzania, they highlighted U.S. initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and poverty during a trip to five African nations that included Rwanda and Benin. ""Different people may have different views about you and your administration and your legacy,"" Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said at the time. ""You, Mr. President, and your administration, have been good friends of our country and have been good friends of Africa."" As president, Bush introduced an emergency AIDS program that saved millions of lives in Africa by providing antiretroviral drugs. Analysts have said that his health initiatives offer a chance to make the case that his legacy on foreign policy should not be judged on the Iraq war alone.","Cancer is emerging as a global concern in Africa .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods tied Jack Nicklaus on 73 PGA Tour victories after sinking a sensational chip from off the green late in the final round of the Memorial Tournament on Sunday. The former world No. 1 was congratulated by the legendary ""Golden Bear"" after completing a five-under-par 67 which gave Woods a two-shot victory. Nicklaus, who founded the Ohio tournament and designed its Muirfield Village course, said the 36-year-old's chip from the rough at the par-three 16th hole was ""the gutsiest and best shot I've ever seen in my life."" Woods' second victory this year left them second equal in the all-time PGA list, nine behind the late Sam Snead. Late lapses cost Tiger at Memorial . ""I've been very proud of what I've done so far and I feel like I've got a lot of years ahead of me,"" said Woods, who raised his hopes of a first major win since 2008 at this month's U.S. Open at San Francisco's Olympic Club. He has 14 already -- four behind Nicklaus' record total. ""I'm excited, because I'm hitting the golf ball real well -- and at Olympic the people who have done well there have hit the ball well,"" Woods said. While Woods ended a 30-month wait for a PGA Tour title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March, he then struggled to maintain that form as he finished 40th at the Masters, missed the cut at Quail Hollow and then tied for 40th at the Players Championship. He has had to defend himself from criticism over the work he is doing with coach Sean Foley to rebuild his swing, but if Woods needs evidence of a turning point in his fortunes then he will look no further than the 16th hole at Muirfield. Having hit his tee shot into the deep rough, he took aim with a wedge. As the gathered spectators inevitably cried ""Get in the hole!"" the ball did just that -- and Woods exploded with trademark fist pumping that was once a regular sight on the golf circuit before marital problems and injuries took their toll on his fortunes. McIlroy seeks solution, Tiger finds one . ""I knew if I hit it short it would have been down and left, if I hit it long it was in the water,"" Woods said of his chip. ""The lie wasn't all that great, that was the hard part. I had to take a cut at it, and it came out just perfect."" He trailed leader Spencer Levin by four shots going into the final round, but four birdies in his first seven holes kept him in contention -- and three in the last four gave him his fifth victory at the event and first since 2009.

"(CNN) -- On Friday afternoon, restaurant owner Neil Hart was standing in the local branch of his bank, ready to withdraw his life-savings to buy a house. Then his lawyer called to tell him the deal had been postponed. He woke on Saturday morning, switched on the news and heard the government had announced plans to raid his nest-egg and take 10% to pay for the mistakes of the country's crippled banks. Hart's problem? He lives in Cyprus (population: less than one million people) where the banking system is severely overstretched and has been exposed to the debt-ridden Greek financial industry which has occupied Europe for the past few years. Why is Cyprus trying to tax bank deposits? The fate of the Cypriot economy, which accounts for only 0.2% of European Union GDP, is unlikely to reignite the financial troubles of the single currency area. But Hart, a Scottish expat who has lived in the southwest coastal city of Paphos for 13 years with his wife, says the ""overnight robbery"" by the recently-installed government is devastating people in his community. ""If they can just get into your account in the middle of the night and take money out, in any other situation that would be theft,"" he says. The Cypriot government plans to tap its citizens for 5.8 billion euros [$7.5 billion] and impose a one-off 9.9% levy on deposits over â‚¬100,000. Those with smaller savings would be subject to a 6.75% levy. Watch this: Cyprus business owner lost 10% of savings . The unprecedented tax on bank deposits led to a run on cash machines over the weekend, as customers scrambled to protect their life savings. With banks ordered to stay closed until Thursday, and people struggling to get cash, Cypriot lawmakers are dithering on a deal that still needs to be ratified in parliament, while also revising the conditions in an effort to place more of the burden on the rich. But it seems the damage has already been done: a run on the banks now looking increasingly likely. Hart says he can no longer trust the Cypriot government or the country's banks after this ""underhanded"" and ""calculated"" move to eat away at the savings of ordinary people. Watch this: Russians prepare to withdraw from Cyprus . Lawmakers waited until the end of business on Friday for the long public holiday weekend in a ""well-orchestrated"" plan, according to Hart. He told CNN: ""I can tell you 100% now, whether they take the money off me or not. When I can get into the bank on Thursday, I will take all my money out of the bank and put it offshore."" In an address to the nation on Sunday night, newly-elected Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said the country must secure a 10 billion euro package or face economic collapse. Cyprus may be the fourth eurozone country to request a bailout from international creditors -- after Ireland, Portugal and Greece -- but it is the first nation where politicians have attempted to force taxpayers into handing over their personal savings to rescue the banks. Read more: Cyprus: Turning a drama into a crisis . Magda Chrysaphiades says the chaos and panic she witnessed on Saturday after the announcement reminded her of the Turkish invasion in 1974 when she first moved to Cyprus from the UK to set up a leather and suede manufacturing business with her family. Chrysaphiades returned to Cyprus in 1996 and is now retired. ""It feels similar, back then we woke up one day and all hell had broken loose,"" she recalls. ""But today we just feel absolutely helpless."" She worries that banks will collapse as savers who feel betrayed seek to withdraw their deposits. ""If the banks collapse, people will go hungry because Cyprus is a very small community and there's no backup... I thought these bailouts and committees were there to help people not take their money away."" Chrysaphiades and Hart both fear that policymakers are setting a dangerous precedent for future crises. ""If they did it with Cyprus, what's to stop them doing it in other troubled euro countries?"" Hart demands.","Cypriot government plans to tap its citizens for 5.8 billion euros [$7.5 billion] and impose a one-off levy .

"Alamogordo, New Mexico (CNN) -- Shortly after her birth, Moesha was taken away from her mother and sent to a laboratory for a life of medical testing. Like the 265 other chimpanzees at the Coulston Foundation's facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico, Moesha would be poked and prodded in the name of medical research. Moesha was one of the lucky ones: She survived. Others were not so fortunate. Three chimpanzees housed at the Coulston Foundation were literally cooked to death when their enclosures heated to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. When federal authorities found out about the facility's mistreatment of these animals, it lost its funding and went bankrupt. That's when a team of animal welfare experts stepped in and changed these chimpanzees' lives forever. With the help of a $3.7 million grant, the Save the Chimps organization purchased the facility in 2002 and transformed it into the world's largest sanctuary for chimpanzees. It would serve as temporary housing for the chimps until the organization could create a more permanent outdoor sanctuary in Florida. But first, Moesha and the others -- isolated for most of their lives -- would have to learn how to live as family units. And that process would take nearly a decade of rehabilitation. Learning to become chimps again . One of the first priorities in rehabilitating the chimps was modifying their cages, known by the Save the Chimps team as ""the dungeon."" This gray, concrete structure housed 54 chimpanzees, most of them crammed into small, individual cages. The cages where the rest of the chimpanzees were housed weren't much bigger but they shared the space with another animal or two. ""It was six months of cutting doors into six-inch thick concrete walls so that chimps could actually see each other for the first time and meet each other for the first time,"" said Save the Chimps sanctuary director Jennifer Feuerstein. Even with the new doors and skylights, the dungeon still had a dark feel to it, and resembled a concrete block of prison cells. Once the buildings were modified, the care of the animals became routine and the team began to slowly create diverse family groups for the chimps. ""The ultimate goal was forming family groups of 20 to 25 chimpanzees,"" explained Feuerstein, ""We did it by introducing one chimpanzee at a time, so we're talking over the past 10 years thousands of thousands of introductions."" Meet one of the oldest chimpanzees in captivity . For Moesha and many of the other chimps, this was a completely new experience. Moesha would rock back and forth and often scream for no apparent reason. She was pale, balding and anxious when Save the Chimps took over the facility. Moesha was immediately introduced to another chimpanzee, Alari, and soon after bonding with her, Moesha was introduced into a chimpanzee family. Her hair has since thickened and her skin darkened from the sunlight that peeked through the bars in her newly improved cage. Feuerstein said it took a while for the chimpanzees to get used to each other. Some groups took up to a year to form. ""When a family was ready and an island was ready, then we would migrate a group to Florida,"" she said. ""Eleven groups were formed and migrated over a period of six years. We started doing large scale migrations in 2005, 2006."" Chimpanzees as medical test subjects . The United States is one of two remaining countries -- the other being Gabon -- that legally allow chimps and other great apes to be used in invasive biomedical research, according to the Humane Society of the United States. However, other countries still contract the services of research centers that use chimps, according to Dr. Thomas Rowell Director of the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana. There are more than 930 chimpanzees at U.S. medical research facilities, most of them used for hepatitis testing, according to a report by the Institute of Medicine issued in December. The report stated that chimpanzees are not necessary for most biomedical research. The institute recognized two possible uses for chimps: one for cancerous tumors that are already part of ongoing investigations, and the other for a hepatitis C vaccine. A panel of experts advising the National Institutes of Health on how to implement the the Institute of Medicine's report is expected to issue its recommendations by the end of the year. Read more about the Institute of Medicine report . A bill that would end invasive research on chimps and other great apes has been before Congress since 2008, reintroduced in subsequent years, most recently as the the ""Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act of 2011."" A Senate subcommittee has the bill on its agenda for Tuesday. Frederick Coulston began using chimpanzees for toxicology tests in the 1940s at Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Coulston, who died in 2003 at age 89, helped develop hepatitis vaccines and spent years working on a vaccine for AIDS, according to his obituary in the Los Angeles Times. But the use of chimpanzees in his research made him a target of animal welfare advocates. In 1993, he established the Coulston Foundation in Alamogordo -- considered the largest chimpanzee laboratory in the world -- where he carried out his research on chimps and loaned them out to other laboratories, with the help of government funding. The facility was cited numerous times for violating the Animal Welfare Act and federal funding was withdrawn, forcing it to close in 2002. That year, Coulston reached out to Save the Chimps founder Dr. Carole Noon, offering to sell the laboratory and donate all 266 chimpanzees to the organization, according to Save the Chimps. Nine years later, the chimps were ready to move from the former laboratory to the outdoor sanctuary in Florida. Getting ready for the journey . Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are handed out to Moesha and her family as they get ready for the 2,000-mile cross-country journey. Moesha is one of the final 10 chimps heading to the sanctuary in Fort Pierce: 150 acres of former orange groves, transformed into islands where the chimpanzees will be permanently retired. The islands keep the chimpanzees, who are afraid of water, on the property without the need for fencing. It will be their first time living outdoors. Before the specially designed trailer carrying the final 10 chimps departs New Mexico, tears fill the eyes of the Save the Chimps staff as they say goodbye. The chimps are wheeled onto the trailer in small, single cages near the members of their family units. Each chimpanzee has a window seat. It is after dark when Alari, the last chimpanzee, is loaded into the trailer. She is placed next to Moesha and across from Taz. As the staff takes pictures and says their goodbyes, high-pitched hoots and screams can be heard outside the trailer, which the chimpanzees aggressively rock. This behavior is barely noticed; it is no different from the past 26 times workers have loaded a group of chimpanzees destined for Florida. But this trip is different and Feuerstein's thoughts are on the Save the Chimps founder, who passed away before the ""Great Chimp Migration"" could come to a happy end. ""I wish Carole Noon was here. She started it. All this was her project. This was her dream,"" Feuerstein said. As the truck pulling the trailer slowly drives out of the gate, a crowd of former and current employees gives a loud cheer. The last of the Coulston chimpanzees is heading for a new life far away from the former research facility. Back to nature . The 2,000-mile road trip will take a day and a half, because of frequent stops to check on the chimpanzees. They are fed fruits and juice and medicine is administered. Moesha, Alari and Sarah are on birth control pills and Bart, Alari and Brody are given medicine for anxiety. When the trailer arrives in Fort Pierce, Florida, the chimps are greeted by a cheering crowd of workers and volunteers. After being reunited with the other nine members of their family that arrived ahead of them, Moesha and her traveling companions are let out onto the island. It's the first time these chimpanzees have felt grass under their feet and direct sunlight on their skin. Feuerstein recalls how far Moesha has progressed over the past decade. ""Moesha is amazing,"" said Feuerstein, with the emotion of a proud mother. ""When she first came, she was the most scared, timid chimp."" Showing no fear of her new surroundings, Moesha --- unlike her other family members -- confidently walks across the grass to the middle of the island. There she sat for a few minutes, taking in her new green surroundings, soaking up the kind of life she never knew existed.","Save the Chimps spent nearly a decade rehabilitating chimps from the Coulston Foundation .

"(CNN)  -- The Avenue Gordon Bennett in France's capital is everything you would expect of a leafy lane in a quintessentially Parisian suburb. The Serres D'Auteuil botanical gardens -- home to a myriad of rare and exotic plants -- sit alongside the center of a Gallic passion that is Roland Garros -- the site of the annual French Open. But beneath the genteel surroundings a simmering war is brewing, one that pitches fauna lovers against forehand followers and has battle lines drawn between the ornate, glass greenhouses of the gardens and the clay of the courts that welcome stars like Roger Federer and Caroline Wozniacki to the second grand slam of the year. Welcome to the fight to expand Roland Garros. In one corner -- the French Tennis Federation (FFT) -- which maintain the tournament has become a victim of its own success and has outgrown its current site following player complaints of cramped conditions. The FFT, as a solution, propose expanding into the botanical gardens next door, replacing greenhouses with a new arena fit to house some of the world's best tennis matches. In the other corner, campaigners and local residents who accuse the tennis body of ""environmental vandalism"" and who bitterly opposed to the move. Ahead of this year's tournament next month, it looks like the row is destined to be thrashed out in the French courts. The opposition to the move hardened when the FFT voted in February to keep the French Open at Roland Garros in the 16th arrondissement (district) of Paris rather than move to an alternative site. They rejected bids from three other venues in the inner and outer suburbs of the French capital, Gonesse, Versailles and Marne-la-Vallee (near Disneyland Paris) to the dismay of the anti-expansion campaigners. The Serres d'Auteuil is one of only three botanical gardens in Paris and contain a series of unique greenhouses and campaigners say the very rare plant life will be lost forever. ""What the FFT is proposing is the equivalent of Wimbledon deciding to expand the All-England Club and take over Kew Gardens in the process,"" Agnes Popelin, who heads the campaign, told CNN. Christiane Morin Muller worked as an English speaking guide in Paris's  Botanical Gardens for 18 years until she retired and said she was ""very distressed and very upset"" by the latest developments. ""We don't have many botanical gardens in France and just three in Paris and Auteuil is the main one,"" she added. Under the plans, Roland Garros will grow from its current 8.5 hectare site to 13.5 hectares, with a new planned show court in the corner of the gardens. Muller said that the encroachment will destroy the character of the gardens and the expansion would not stop there. ""With over 40,000 people going through this botanical garden every day for a fortnight it will be destroyed and little by little more ground will be given over to tennis,"" she added. The 'no' campaigners, who also include local residents worried about the introduction of night matches and floodlights, have gathered an online petition of over 40,000 signatures and have vowed to fight on. But Gilbert Ysern, the chief executive of the FFT and the man responsible for overseeing the project, told CNN that the protesters fears were groundless. ""I fully respect those who disagree with us but my concern is that most of the opposition is based on a lack of information, false information or false rumors,"" he told CNN. ""I would not have supported any project in this gorgeous place that would have destroyed ancient greenhouses,"" he added. His assurances over the future of the plant life cuts no ice with Popelin, or that of the Mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, who campaigned to keep the French Open at Roland Garros. ""The mayor is promising their relocation in an other 'wonderful place', located at the floral park in the Bois de Vincennes,"" she said. ""But there are no existing greenhouses there and none can be built because this is classified as a protected site. There are only pavilions. But the mayor and his staff cannot tell the difference between a pavilion and a greenhouse. ""There is no temperature control, shade or ventilation."" What is not in doubt is that the status quo was not an option with players such as Federer speaking out. ""The players and the fans feel that even if it's quite a nice experience it's quite tough to live in every day. We need more room,"" he said last year. Ysern spoke with Federer and other leading players when drawing up his plans and found support from five-time French Open champion and World No 1 Rafael Nadal, who wants the tournament to stay at Roland Garros. ""I believe we are going to meet the expectations of the players and the fans, all of those who have a strong attachment to this place,"" he said. But others were not so sure about the viability of the extension, with France's former World No.1 Amelie Mauresmo voicing her doubts. ""I think that in Paris today we don't have the possibility to have the necessary space to develop Roland Garros,"" Mauresmo told Reuters. ""We are the smallest of the four grand slams and I think it is important to have the chance to grow, and for the public to have more room."" Mauresmo declined to be interviewed by CNN on the topic which has divided opinion in France with many such as Franck Ramella, the chief tennis correspondent of L'Equipe, having conflicting views. ""It looks very strange to put a tennis court on these gardens, it doesn't suit the place. ""But the tournament is for only two weeks and if you want to make room there is no other solution,"" he added. Popelin is adamant that power politics has played a big part in the decision. ""The mayor of Paris has already lost the Olympics to London (for 2012) and couldn't be seen as playing a part in Roland Garros losing the French Open. ""I am a big tennis fan and I love watching the French Open but I am passionate in my opposition of these plans."" Lawmakers in the French capital must decide if they want to make changes to the local urban plan to allow the planned expansion but only the Green Party has expressed outright opposition. Popelin and her followers are not hopeful of the outcome but she says they are prepared to take legal action to protect the botanical gardens and is also speaking with representatives of the three failed bids. ""I have told them not to sell their land for other projects because in perhaps two years I am convinced the French federation will change their mind on this matter,"" she added. But again, Ysern has a completely different view and believes that once the political and likely legal process is exhausted that work will start in late 2012 and be finished at an estimated cost nearly $340 million by 2016. ""We are breaking no law here,"" he insists. ""We are not ashamed of what we are going to do which will be in the best interests of sport and France."" But even with the controversial expansion it will remain the smallest site of the for four slams, with Wimbledon just over half as big again. ""I don't care about being the biggest, we have a gorgeous location in a gorgeous city and as long as we have that why should we go anywhere else?,"" said Ysern. ""The best way to protect integrity of the tournament is to concentrate on the unique aspects of our tournament and make it even more unique.""","French tennis federation want to expand French Open venue Roland Garros .

"(CNN) -- Bradley Wiggins' bid to add the Giro d'Italia title to his Tour de France crown suffered another blow Saturday as the British cycling star lost more time in the eighth stage time trial. Wiggins, who crashed in wet conditions on Friday, dropped to more than a minute behind the new leader Vincenzo Nibali after a puncture forced him to change bikes. The 33-year-old battled back to take second place in the 54.8-kilometer stage between Gabicce Mare and Saltara, 10 seconds behind the winner -- his compatriot Alex Dowsett. Nibali was 21 seconds adrift in fourth but it was enough to give the Italian rider a 29-second advantage over Australia's 2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, who was seventh. Previous leader Benat Intxausti lost more than three and a half minutes as he dropped to 14th overall. Wiggins, who will not lead Team Sky at this year's Tour, was frustrated after his latest setback. ""I think there was some initial disappointment because I wanted to win the stage,"" he told his team's website. ""It's been a challenging few days with the crash yesterday and then to come back up. It wasn't an easy course. ""Then obviously to have a puncture and have to change bikes and disrupt the rhythm is never going to help. But then the second part of the course was really suited to me and I took back a lot of time on people there. ""It's put us right back up there now. It's going to be a hell of a race for the next two weeks."" His former teammate Dowsett, the British time trial champion, is now racing for Spain's Movistar alongside Intxausti in the three-week event -- one of the three elite races on the cycling calendar along with Le Tour and the Spanish Vuelta. ""I'll need some time to digest this victory, I still can't believe it,"" said the 24-year-old, who pledged to help Intxausti move back up the standings.","Bradley Wiggins second in eighth stage despite needing to change bike after puncture .

"(CNN) -- How much hope can I have in the president who has deported people at a higher rate than any other in the nation's history? Asking myself this question is how I kept my emotions in check as I watched President Obama announce his policy on immigration Tuesday. After living undocumented for more than 18 years, and hoping that one day my sister, my parents and I won't be considered ""illegal"" in this country, my mental health often depends on managing my expectations. My family and I came to the United States when I was 10 years old from Mexico City, and have grown up thinking of Chicago as our home. Opinion: U.S. needs 21st century immigration plan . Although my parents have tried to shield us from the effects of being undocumented, we know that my father used to walk the streets looking for work, and that more than once his wages were stolen, with employers using his immigration status as a threat. I think of my father as the most likely member of our family to be racially profiled, and I worry every time he goes to work. My mom has seen her father only once in the last 18 years, and I know she misses him and her sisters and brothers. And my sister and I are reminded every day of the barriers of being undocumented, when we cannot apply for a job, a scholarship, or pay the bond of a family friend in deportation proceedings. The first time I watched President Obama speak about immigration, I felt the excitement in my stomach. It was sometime early in his presidency, when many of us still believed he would make significant changes in immigration policy during his first term. I listened to every word he said -- that we are a nation of immigrants -- and allowed myself to imagine a life without worrying my dad would not come home; a moment when my mom might get to see her dad and her sisters again without having to chose between our lives here and her family; a chance for my sister and I to be evaluated on our work and contributions and not our immigration status; a moment to live without fear. But the actions of his government failed to match his words. Opinion: Stars align at last for immigration plan . This is why I have learned to keep my hopes in check. Not only because of the years without action, but also because the lives of immigrant communities have become even harder. Here are a few examples: . -- More than 1.4 million people have been deported since Obama took office, at a faster rate than under any other president. -- The federal government has continued to collaborate with local law enforcement that uses immigration laws to intimidate immigrant communities and racially profile Latinos, such as Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. -- Immigration detention centers continue their inhumane treatment of detainees, particularly those with mental health problems, medical illnesses and those who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. -- Undocumented workers continue to be targeted by the Department of Homeland Security, even in my hometown of Chicago, where a series of operations led to the detention of scores of workers, including more than a dozen day laborers detained while looking for work. -- Even with prosecutorial discretion policies, undocumented people who have no criminal history, those who are not a threat to the safety of the country, and those who are only working to support their families, continue to be deported.It is important to say I also recognize significant steps forward under Obama. My sister and I qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and are in the process of applying. I must admit, I am excited about having a work permit and being able to travel outside the United States. After the failure of the Congress to pass the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, it has been a welcome, if limited, relief.But I cannot ignore the continued suffering and uncertainty that my parents and my community live with every day. And I cannot ignore how harmful President Obama's policies have been to the most vulnerable: undocumented immigrants. Opinion: Key to immigration -- Worker visas . With the group of bipartisan senators announcing a blueprint for immigration reform, and the president's announcement of support, it might just be possible for a comprehensive bill to pass. Unfortunately, I don't expect it to address all the needs of immigrant communities, or of the country. The blueprint that has been presented by the eight senators, for example, already delineates harsher punitive measures for future undocumented migrants, and harsher enforcement at the border. It also does not address the situation in detention centers, or the collaboration with local law-enforcement plagued with racial profiling. I know that the president has a chance to go outside party politics and make significant changes to immigration policy that could stop the suffering of millions of families by stopping deportations and giving work permits to undocumented adults. He was able to do that with young people; why not do the same for our parents? What the years of disappointment have taught me is that our communities cannot depend on the goodwill of legislators for change. We must make it happen ourselves through organization. And so I am going to continue to fight for the rights of undocumented immigrants and for the happiness of my family. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Tania Unzueta Carrasco.","At 10, Tania Unzueta moved to U.S. with undocumented family, who are considered illegal .

"(CNN) -- The prospects for immigration reform just got a lot brighter. Eight leading senators, four Republicans and four Democrats, came together to announce on Monday their agreement on broad principles to modernize our immigration laws, which have been largely unchanged since 1965. Since then, the world has changed dramatically and globalized markets have revolutionized our economy. But our antiquated immigration laws are still designed for an economy that existed when people were watching black and white TV. As China offers generous stipends, access to prestigious incubators, honorary titles and other benefits to lure home the scientists and engineers who come to America to study, we turn these innovators away. As Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore and Chile offer visas and other incentives to attract entrepreneurs to their countries, we make it nearly impossible for most entrepreneurs to come here. And as countries like the United Kingdom experiment with using independent economists to help determine which immigrants their economy needs, we continue with an immigration system that not only ignores our economic health, but actively works to undermine it. Opinion: Stars align at last for immigration plan . In South Korea, Spain and Switzerland, roughly 80% of all permanent visas are used for employment needs. Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom allocate around 60% of all permanent visas this way. But in the United States, we give just 7% of our permanent residency ""green cards"" to fill gaps in our economy. In the past, we could afford an immigration system that was not focused on recruiting top workers. With the American economy such a dominant force, these workers had no other choice but to wait and wait until they could get to America. But in the global economy, talent is transient. A top scientist who cannot gain access to the United States can easily go work in a lab in Germany, India or any other of America's direct competitors. Canadian immigration authorities recruit scientists with just this pitch, promising far easier entry and access to permanent residency then they could gain in the United States. The economics are simple. If we attract and retain the world's top talent, our economy will grow faster. A recent study by the conservative American Enterprise Institute and the bipartisan Partnership for a New American Economy found that, from 2000 to 2007, each foreign-born worker with an advanced degree from a U.S. university who stayed in the country to work in science, technology, engineering and math -- the STEM fields -- created, on average, 2.62 additional jobs for American workers. Their innovations power new technologies, new products and new companies. And the reverse is equally true. If we fail to attract and retain the world's top talent, our economy will falter. By 2018, the United States is projected to have a shortage of more than 230,000 advanced degree STEM workers. Jobs in these fields are exploding, growing three times faster than the rest of the economy over the last decade, but we simply cannot fill them, even in a recession with so many people looking for work. The same is true in industries all over the economic spectrum. Harsh immigration laws that discourage migrant farm workers have led to millions of dollars of crops rotting on the vine. Overly bureaucratic and restrictive visa application processes have forced hotels to run at less than peak capacity even when demand is high because they can't get workers to staff them. Opinion: Key to immigration reform -- Worker visas . In an iPad and smartphone world, we need an iPad and smartphone immigration system. We need a system that recognizes that it is not only possible, but even probable, that a business would have its manufacturing in China, its headquarters in Europe, its back office in India and its sales offices all over the globe. We need a system that makes it easy for entrepreneurs, scientists, farm workers, engineers, hotel workers, business travelers and all the workers our economy needs to easily come here and help our companies compete. And we need a system that is flexible to changing economic demands, attracting workers when and where they are needed and easing immigration when demand for workers slows. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the 500 business leaders and mayors who make up the Partnership for a New American Economy have been making the economic case for immigration reform for the last several years. Republicans and Democrats are once again, for the first time in years, having honest discussions on how to overhaul the system. Reforming our immigration laws is not just good economics, it's also good politics. This was made evident on Monday when leading Republicans and Democrats in the Senate came together behind principles that, in their words, would improve our immigration system so that it ""will help build the American economy"" and ""establish an improved process for admitting future workers to serve our nation's workforce needs."" Recruiting the talent we need to compete and succeed in a global marketplace is an idea that crosses party lines. Opinion: Immigrant -- Can we trust Obama? America became the world's most dynamic and powerful economy by opening our doors to all those seeking freedom and opportunity. If we are to retain that position in the 21st century, we must open our doors not only to family members and asylum seekers, but to more of the talented and hard-working people our economy needs to grow. This is a moment of progress. Leading members of both parties in Congress understand the need for action and are standing together with an agenda for reform. Let's capitalize on it and get the modern immigration system our economy deserves. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- The new U.S. push for immigration reform is drawing praise -- but some skepticism -- south of the border. Mexico's foreign ministry said Tuesday that it ""welcomes the principles that have been set out"" in U.S. President Barack Obama's remarks calling for immigration reform, and the proposal presented Monday by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators. A Mexican lawmaker told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that U.S. politicians were proposing a plan that would help millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States -- nearly 60% of whom are Mexican, according to government estimates. ""It's a real reform"" and a significant step, said Sen. Marcela Guerra of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. The Mexican government hasn't weighed in on specific details in this week's proposal from eight U.S. senators, a plan that would give undocumented immigrants immediate but provisional legal status to live and work in America, and eventually allow them to apply for green cards. But there are an estimated 6.8 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico living in the United States who could benefit from such an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system. And that's a statistic that isn't lost on Mexican officials, who have been pushing for changes in U.S. immigration policies for years. In legal briefs and public speeches, they've argued against racial profiling they said would be fostered by U.S. state immigration laws and called for changes in federal laws to bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. 'At last, the U.S. government is taking notice' The fresh possibility of immigration reform in the United States has made headlines in Mexico's leading newspapers this week. In the central Mexican city of Atlixco, where many residents have family members living in the United States, proposals to change U.S. immigration policies were hailed as a positive step. ""It's good news,"" said Rene Velasquez, who watched a Spanish translation on Mexican television of Obama's Tuesday speech. ""At last, the U.S. government is taking notice of this problem that is important for their country and ours."" Eduardo Palacios, who came back to Atlixco to run a pizza restaurant after working as an immigrant in the United States, said he was happy to hear that change could be coming. ""I'm glad immigrants may be able to fix their documents,"" he said, ""because many die on the border or suffer a lot."" In Mexico's capital, the new push for immigration reform in the United States was met with some skepticism. ""It is possibly a waste of time. I don't see it succeeding,"" said Luis Gonzalez, an accountant. ""There is no compassion, and we need to work much more diplomatically."" Nancy Perez, director of the Mexico-based immigrant rights organization Sin Fronteras (Without Borders), cautioned against high expectations for reform based on recent comments from U.S. politicians. ""These are the first steps,"" she said, adding that what the government does will speak volumes. ""We find contradictions in the willingness expressed publicly and the concrete actions of the government,"" she said, noting that deportations from the United States have increased in recent years. Mexico's foreign ministry noted Tuesday that the push for immigration policy changes seemed to be gaining momentum. ""The priority of protecting the rights of individuals, regardless of their migratory status, has been rightly included at the center of this debate,"" the foreign ministry said in a written statement. While the issue is an internal U.S. political matter, the foreign ministry said, it concerns millions who live in Mexico and in other countries. ""Because of this, the Mexican government will continue respectfully promoting an informed debate of the many dimensions of this topic, and protecting the rights of its citizens abroad,"" the foreign ministry said. Advocating for migrants, pushing for change . The Mexican government hasn't shied away from pushing for changes in U.S. immigration laws in the past. In recent years, Mexico has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in lawsuits challenging state measures aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration in Arizona and Alabama, arguing that the measures would lead to profiling and violate the human rights of Mexican nationals. And Mexico's foreign ministry has sharply condemned what it has called ""disproportionate use of lethal force in the exercising of immigration control functions"" by U.S. Border Patrol agents. Shortly after he was named as Mexico's new ambassador to the United States earlier this month, Eduardo Medina Mora said the issue of immigration reform was of ""great interest"" to the Mexican government, while noting that it was a complicated political issue in the United States. ""This is an issue on the internal political agenda of the United States. It is not an issue on the bilateral agenda. Nonetheless we have a very great interest, an unavoidable responsibility to defend the interests of our fellow citizens and to promote an argument that increases opportunities for them,"" Medina Mora told reporters. For more than a decade, the Mexican government has played an active role advocating for millions of migrants abroad. Shortly after taking office in 2000, then-President Vicente Fox met with migrants in his official residence and soon created a Cabinet-level position dedicated to Mexicans who were living in other countries. During his administration, Mexicans won the right to vote abroad in 2005 after a hard-fought legislative campaign. And Mexican government officials have created matching programs aimed at using the money Mexicans sent home to fund public works projects south of the U.S.-Mexico border. It's a significant shift in a country where emigrants were once treated as traitors abandoning their homeland. Now, it's common for Mexican officials to acknowledge emigrants' contributions, and to advocate on their behalf. In a visit to the White House last year, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said he supported Obama's push for immigration reform. ""More than demanding what you should do, I do want to tell you that we want to contribute,"" he said. ""We really want to participate and we want to contribute toward the accomplishment, so we can participate in the betterment and well-being of so many people who live in your country.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A bipartisan group of senators on Monday introduced a plan for overhauling U.S. immigration policy a day before President Barack Obama was to lay out his plan. The eight senators say their plan will secure the border and provide a path to citizenship some undocumented immigrants already in the country. Critics say the citizenship component is granting amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. Immigration plan: A new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity? Here are some frequently asked questions on immigration reform: . Q: What's behind this latest immigration reform plan? A: The new push for immigration reform follows devastating poll results for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who in November won just 27% of the Latino vote. That's down from 44% for President George W. Bush in 2004 and 31% for Sen. John McCain four years ago. The dramatic slide jolted key Republicans to act quickly on the complex and emotional issue that has divided the parties for years. Republicans long have argued that Latino voters, many of whom are Catholic and pro-life, would find a home in the GOP if not for the harsh rhetoric some Republicans use to debate illegal immigration. Democrats also are under pressure to reach a deal. Many Latino voters were disappointed that President Barack Obama didn't work harder in his first term to pass a bill. Immediately after his election, Latino leaders pushed the president to make sure it would be a priority for his second term. As a signal of how important the issue is for Senate Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced last week an immigration reform bill would be labeled S-1, meaning it's Senate bill No. 1 of the new Congress -- and clearly a top priority. Why this time? Q: Why did the senators announce their plan the day before Obama was to present his? A: The senators decided to unveil their plan ahead of the president in order to give their proposal -- and the entire reform effort -- a bipartisan tone, something they believe is critical to winning passage in the Senate and House, according to sources familiar with the bipartisan Senate framework. In fact, at a private White House meeting Friday, some senior Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pushed the White House to hold off introducing its own legislative language out of fear that the specifics, as spelled out by a Democratic president, could upset the delicate bipartisan balance the negotiators had reached. Why the time may be right . Q: Will there be enough support in the House for this plan? A: It's unclear because many House conservatives have opposed allowing undocumented workers an opportunity to gain U.S. citizenship. This controversial issue could prove to be a real test for House Speaker John Boehner's leadership because it splits the House Republican conference. If the Senate is able to pass a bill, the speaker could again be faced with a decision whether to bring up a measure that has significant Democratic support but potentially only a minority within his own ranks. Or Boehner could decide to move a separate House immigration plan. Boehner was noncommittal when the details of the Senate were unveiled. His spokesman put out a brief statement not taking a position, but pointing out Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who is popular with conservatives, was part of the group drafting the plan. ""The speaker welcomes the work of leaders like Senator Rubio on this issue, and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal in the coming days,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told CNN. There are also bipartisan discussions going on in the House on immigration, but one Democratic aide familiar with the discussions told CNN of that effort, ""It's not quite ripe yet."" But in a speech last week, Boehner signaled the House would act, saying, ""It's time to deal with it. I said it the day after the election, I meant it. We're going to have to deal with it."" Boehner also alluded to the House bipartisan talks, not giving any details, but saying the group was ""in my view the right group of members."" He also added, ""My theory was if these folks can work this out it would be a big step in the right direction."" But already, some House Republicans are dismissing the most controversial piece of the Senate plan to allow a path to citizenship as ""amnesty"" illustrating the challenge to get a deal through the House. Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith put out a statement on Monday arguing ""by granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration."" By the numbers: Immigration and naturalization . Q: Could any of the Senate plan be a starting point for compromise with the House? A: Many House Republicans have called for strengthening border security, and insist that issue be the top priority before any steps are taken to grant citizenship to those in the United States illegally. But the bipartisan immigration framework from the Senate ties the two issues together to attract support from both parties. If House Republicans attempt to separate these it could up jeopardize the chance for comprehensive immigration reform. The new Senate framework also includes a component that the GOP-led House already addressed last year -- it awards green cards for those foreigners at U.S. universities studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics, to encourage them to stay and work in the United States. House Republicans passed a bill establishing so-called ""STEM"" visas last fall, but it was largely opposed by Democrats because it canceled another visa program.","Push to get immigration reform through Congress shows power of Latino vote in last election .

"(CNN) -- The sudden momentum toward a bipartisan plan to reform the U.S. immigration system has sparked a torrent of discussion about this politically charged and emotional issue. Here's a sampling of voices from across the spectrum of viewpoints: . ""Anything other than having these people going home and apply through our regular immigration system that successfully admits over 1 million people every year is amnesty,"" said a CNN commenter using the screen name ninesixteen. ""Allowing them to wait in the U.S. is a reward. Our immigration is deliberately constructed to not let in unlimited numbers. These people violate our laws yet expect to be allowed to stay and work when others wait patiently in their countries. Legalization is wrong."" Immigration Q&A: Amnesty or path to citizenship? ""Illegal immigration has already put massive and unaffordable burdens on the welfare state and with 20 million or more applying for Amnesty, this will simply accelerate this process,"" said Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips, who argues that the real number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is higher than the frequently cited 11 million figure. Mexico 'welcomes' new U.S. immigration reform push . ""I'm a liberal democrat but here's the problem with this law,"" said a CNN commenter going by the screen name Riprod. ""Legalize them and now they have to pay taxes, SS (Social Security), get minimum wages, union participation etc. Now they are no longer economically employable by farmers, construction, landscapers and hotels, hotel workers, etc. So we are left with 11 million more on welfare while these companies search outside our border for more workers. No, I'm totally against this, they're illegal, arrest them and kick them out. Secondly, it took me 20 years and about $40,000 to get my citizenship legally and I feel cheated when I see this."" By the numbers: Immigration and naturalization . ""They need to make them do things the right way. Spend the thousands of dollars to file that paperwork properly. Make sure all the criteria is met. Put them through the ringer like they do anyone else who applies for Residence in the United States,"" CNN comenter Melissa Bickers said. ""First fix the border. Then make e-verify federal law, and enforced. After that is done, I will welcome the 11 million illegal immigrants,"" CNN commenter ""David"" said. What's in Senate immigration plan? ""What I am asking for is that President Obama consider every category of immigrant as he moves forward with immigration reform. I have to say, it irks me a bit when I hear that illegal immigrants will not be deported when I have waited for months and spent thousands of dollars to do it 'the right way,' "" said CNN iReporter Julie Richard, a Canadian who married an American but said she wasn't allowed back in the country after a visit home with the couple's infant daughter. The couple has had to spend seven months apart, she said, while sorting through immigration issues. Immigration plan: A new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity?

"(AOL Autos) -- For those of you who are schoolteachers, you will understand what I am about to relate. While at the car repair facility, look for certifications displayed on the wall.

So for those of you who have either never read my columns pertaining to this topic, or have ""forgotten,"" allow me to refresh your memory with a few updates. Before I start, I want to emphasize that the question ""How do I find a good auto repair shop?"" represents a universal concern. This question comes to me from virtually all over the world on a regular basis (Singapore, Scotland, England, Brazil, Calcutta India, just to name a few). An interesting story related to this concern: A man from Calcutta (his name is Moeeb) asked me if I would come to Calcutta and open an auto repair shop with him, because there was such a need. To quote Moeeb, ""There is great opportunity for great profits to be made."" He said he would front all the money we needed for a building and equipment. In jest, I pointed out to him that I was not proficient in camel repair and would have to decline. His response was serious. ""Tom, people who can afford a car in Calcutta are wealthy, and they usually drive a Rolls Royce, Mercedes, Porsche, Lincoln, or a Cadillac, and NOT a camel! i.e. Sheiks and the like."" I still found myself declining the offer, after watching the reaction on my wife's face to the possibility. Anyway, it just goes to show you, car care problems are the same everywhere! AOL Autos: Most stolen cars . So what is the answer to the universal perplexity pertaining to auto repair? First of all, start shopping for a repair facility BEFORE you need one. Why? Because a more sound decision is made when you're not facing an urgent need for transportation because your vehicle just broke down. We all make poorer choices when we are under the stress of the moment. AOL Autos: 10 best cars of 2009 . Call around to various repair shops and ask them if they are members of associations such as: ""NAPA Autocare,"" ""ASP,"" ""Parts Plus,"" ""AAA,"" or ""TechNet."" Membership is these associations means the shop has qualified in some way. For instance, to become a AAA Approved Auto Repair Facility, a shop must undergo a rigorous investigation. In addition to having state-of-the-art equipment, training, qualified technicians, and information systems in place, the shop must score high with its customers. AAA contacts about 100 of the shop's most recent customers and conducts a CSI (Consumer Satisfaction Index) study. AOL Autos: Top 5 crossover vehicles . They ask the customers such questions as: . • Was the estimate accurate (or significantly less than the actual bill)? • Was the job done on time? • Did they fix it right the first time? • What kind of warranty did they give you? • Was the shop clean and presentable? • Did they offer a ride to work or wherever you needed to go? • Was there a comfortable, pleasant, and clean waiting area? If the repair facility passes the test, it can hang the ""AAA Approved"" shingle. As you can see, membership in associations such as the ones mentioned above is a significant qualifier for a shop. AOL Autos: Best selling sedans . Visit the shop. Is it clean and orderly? Or does it look like it ought to be condemned by the health department? Ask customers in the shop, ""Why do you do business with this shop?"" Answers such as ""They are the cheapest"" or ""They offer a lot of specials"" or ""Because the owner is a friend of my father's"" don't have much credibility. Look for responses such as: . ""They fix my car right the first time.""  ""I can trust them to do the job at a fair price.""  ""They welcome my questions and concerns and take the time to answer them."" ""There are never any surprises when I come to pick up the car.""  ""They patiently explain in plain English what the problem is and explain my options."" AOL Autos: Cars with best resale values . While at the facility, look for certifications displayed on the wall. If there aren't any, then ask to see their qualifications; this will tell you a lot about the facility. What shingles and certifications should you look for? • Do the technicians have certification from ASE, Delco, ASP, and/or manufacturers such as GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, etc.? • Do they have after market training from such leaders as NAPA/Echlin, Moog, TRW, or Bendix? • How about continued education from BOCES or a technical college such as an Alfred University or Erie County College Vehicle Training Center? These shingles indicate that the technicians have taken the initiative to go beyond the requirements to keep up with the changes in their field. This indicates serious interest as well as pride in their work (not to mention the fact that they are trained in the latest technology). And this extra training not only takes time, but costs them a lot of money! In addition, membership in such associations as the BBB (Better Business Bureau), ATEA (Automotive Technology and Energy Association), ASP (Automotive Service Professionals), ICAR (Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision Repair), and ASE (The Institute for Automotive Service Excellence) tells you that the owner of the shop cares about the quality of the workmanship and, most likely, operates by a code of ethics required by the association. In addition, membership in these associations usually means that the shop is willing to subject itself to an arbitration process that is binding, should the need for arbitration between customer and shop arise. Another factor to consider when choosing a repair facility is the equipment available. Is the shop equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, such as hand held computer scanners and diagnostic software, digital volt-ohm meters, logic probes, lab scopes, and on-line computer systems like CAS, Alldata, or Mitchell-On-Demand? Don't be afraid to ask the shop if they have this equipment. These systems and tools are necessary to diagnose and repair your hi-tech car accurately. Without them, fixing your automobile is a hit-and-miss proposition. Sometimes it's best to take your car to a specialist. Specialists cost more money initially. But because they are specialists, they often know how to pinpoint and repair certain types of problems more efficiently and effectively. Why? Because they deal with these problems every day, plus they have the knowledge, equipment, and information systems necessary to get directly to the problem. While ""Joe down the street"" is floundering and replacing parts trying to correct the problem, the specialist diagnoses with laser-like accuracy. He can locate the problem and replace only the parts that are necessary. Less guesswork and fewer parts translates into money in your pocket, even though the labor rate is higher! Don't be short-sighted! Common areas of automotive specialties: . • Transmission and Drivetrain . • Computer, Drivability, and Electrical . • Collision Repair . • Foreign Car Repair . • HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) • Radiator Repair & Cooling System Repair . Remember, consider the long-term cost. Don't sell yourself short for a few bucks. Quality repair is not expensive ... it's PRICELESS! Equipment, information systems, and technical training must be up to date! A final note about shop size. Some people think that the cost of repair varies with the size of the shop (a large shop or dealership is probably more expensive). Not true! These days, with the high cost of equipment, training, and information systems, the cost of repair at dealerships, large repair facilities and small shops is balancing out. As a matter of fact, in a lot of cases, I see the larger entities, such as the dealers and larger repair facilities, offering competitive pricing to the little guys. If service facilities meet the criteria I discussed (and the quality of the parts and warranties are similar) you will find prices are about the same, regardless of size. So your decision at this point is a matter of whom you feel most comfortable dealing with. Some people prefer a larger shop or their dealership, others prefer a smaller shop. Don't trust your $25,000 automobile, which carries your family through life's daily trips, to just anyone. Pick your repair facility like you would your family doctor. In the long run, this approach saves you not only money, but time and aggravation. Even more importantly, a well maintained vehicle is a safer one.

"(CNN) -- As the Northeast digs out from a second major storm in little more than a week, experts say Internet scam artists are preying on generous Americans who want to donate to the victims of Superstorm Sandy. According to a Maryland-based Internet watchdog company, more than 1,000 Internet domain sites with the words ""Sandy"" or ""relief"" were registered either as the storm was approaching the Caribbean last week or, in some cases, even before the hurricane hit. ""We have no idea who these people are,"" Johannes Ulrich, president of SANS Security told CNN from his home in Jacksonville, Florida. ""And what we notice is that they do register hundreds of these domains, in part, trying to trick people who go to these domains and then donate the money."" 8 ways to help after Sandy . Many of these types of domain sites are registered as soon as the National Weather Service announces the names of forthcoming hurricanes in the late spring, Ulrich explained. Some of these websites were created by construction companies, lawyers or repair companies for potential business opportunities. Others are more questionable. In one instance, a website linking Sandy to the damage it caused on the island of Jamaica popped up as news accounts reported the growing intensity of the storm. The site urged people to donate and linked any would be donors to a Pay Pal account. Ulrich tracked down the registry to an individual in North Carolina. ""I couldn't find out who's behind it,"" Ulrich told CNN. ""A person in North Carolina has it registered, but whether or not it's real, who knows?"" CNN checked with the secretary of state's office in North Carolina, where the law requires charities to register. The site does not show up. Other Internet sites serve as an aggregate location for individuals to ask for money for themselves or their businesses. Indiegogo, an international crowd funding site, has more than 32 pages of pleas for cash donations from Sandy victims. One woman wrote that she needed money because ""We left the city and headed south towards family in Pennsylvania. We were finally let back into Salem and our home was destroyed."" CNN checked on that one as well but there was no information to prove or disprove the woman's posting. Art Taylor, president of the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance, says 70% of Americans donate money without ever really checking to find out where their money goes. ""I worry that things are going to get worse,"" he said. ""People are going to continue to get duped by unscrupulous claims."" Earlier this week, the FBI took time to issue a public warning about scam artists in the wake of devastating storms. ""The Department of Justice and the FBI remind the public to apply a critical eye and do due diligence before giving to anyone soliciting donations on behalf of hurricane victims,"" it said. ""Solicitations can originate as e-mails, websites, door-to-door collections, mailings, telephone calls, and similar methods."" On Tuesday, hundreds lined up at a Newark, New Jersey, church to receive food, water, blankets and cleaning supplies donated by Missouri-based Convoy of Hope. Speaking of charities in general, a spokesman for Convoy of Hope said his organization was well aware that both individuals and even organizations sometimes prey on donors. ""There are going to be others out there that do things wrong, that do things for the wrong reason,"" Jeff Nene said. ""But when you go in with the right heart in the first place, everything works out."" The American Red Cross, the largest national charity dealing with the effects of Sandy has raised $103 million so far for Sandy victims, and that contributions ""continue to pour in,"" according to spokeswoman Anne Marie Borrego. She said all of those funds are earmarked for dealing with the victims of Sandy. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform. Suddenly the phrase is on everyone's lips. From President Barack Obama to rising Republican star Sen. Marco Rubio to right-wing television hosts Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. As if by magic, everybody's for it after six years of ducking and using reform as a political wedge issue -- everybody wants to get it done. But what exactly is it? What kinds of changes will it entail, and what will they mean for America? After more than 10 years of on-and-off debate in Washington, the most important piece of the puzzle is still rarely discussed and poorly understood. Obama often talks about reform without even mentioning it. It never came up on the campaign trail. It's not what brought Latinos out to vote in record numbers. And although it's likely to be included in the framework for reform expected to be released Monday by a bipartisan group of Senators, the concept gets very little attention from the media, English- or Spanish-language. iReport: Under deportation, above fear . What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of? It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future -- for immigrants and the U.S. economy. Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States. Many have been here for years and have put down roots. We're not going to deport them -- not even the harshest restrictionists think that's practical. Nor are most likely to go ""home"" voluntarily, no matter how difficult we make their lives with tough enforcement. For the overwhelming majority, America is home by now. And they are sure to be the most contentious issue when the immigration debate resumes in months to come. News: Possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape . But most contentious is not the same as most important. We all must ask: What created this problem in the first place? Exactly what is it about the broken immigration system that produced this vast underground world of workers and families -- a population the size of Ohio? The root cause: For less-skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the United States, there is no ""line"" -- no available visas. The two existing programs for low-skilled temporary workers are for seasonal labor only: farmhands, landscaping crews, summer and winter resort workers. And there are virtually no permanent visas to be had for unskilled workers. There simply is no avenue for an uneducated Mexican unless he has family members living legally in the U.S. who can sponsor him for a family visa. Many, if not most, of the 11 million already here would have preferred to enter the country legally if that were possible. But they and others like them have no lawful option. This wouldn't be a problem if we didn't need immigrant workers. But we do. And we're going to need them increasingly as the economy recovers. This isn't because American workers are somehow lacking or inadequate. On the contrary, for the most part, it's because Americans are doing better than in decades past. We're becoming better educated and aspiring to the kinds of jobs for which our better educations prepare us. News: GOP needs to back immigration overhaul, lawmakers say . In 1960, half of the native-born men in the labor force were high school dropouts happy to do physically demanding, low-skilled work. Today, less than 10% of the native-born men in the labor force are high school dropouts. And meanwhile, far from shrinking, the demand for low-skilled labor is growing over time. In 1955, for example, 25 cents of every dollar spent on food was spent in a restaurant. Today, the figure is nearly 50 cents. And one of the fastest-growing occupations in America is home health aide. But very few Americans with high school diplomas aspire to careers as busboys or home health aides. And they shouldn't -- their educations equip them to do more productive work, making better wages and contributing more to the economy. No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy -- and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce. But we still need some, and they need a legal way to get here. And whatever program we create needs to be flexible, growing in good times to accommodate rising labor needs and shrinking back in down times when demand subsides. Don't get me wrong: The goal of reform is not to increase the overall number of unskilled immigrants entering the country. What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally -- creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants. This is not just an economic imperative. Without it, there can be no successful immigration law enforcement. Even the best, most effective enforcement is no match for the dynamism of the U.S. economy. As long as there are jobs available, foreigners will want to come to work here. And if we want to prevent them from coming illegally, we need to create lawful alternatives. Finding a solution for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already in the country addresses the mistakes of the past but fixes nothing going forward. Unless we create ways for the immigrants of the future to enter legally, we're going to find ourselves in exactly the same predicament a decade or two down the road -- wondering what to do about 10 or 20 million unauthorized immigrants living among us but beyond the rule of law. The only way to prevent this: a legal immigration system that works. Now if only Obama would mention it. Then we'd have some hope of getting somewhere as the debate resumes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby .","Tamar Jacoby: Immigration reform in air, but focus tends to be on the undocumented .
She says for real reform, discussion must be on providing unskilled worker visas .
She says there's no way to ""get in line"" if no visas are available .

"Placerville, California (CNN) -- California's attorney general is ""actively reviewing"" an animal charity executive who had agreed not to take a higher office with another charity after a state investigation into how her previous employer had spent its donations, a spokesman for the AG's office told CNN. The woman at the center of the review, Terri Crisp, has been identified by SPCA International in its tax filings as one of its directors or officers. She also serves as the spokeswoman for the charity's ""Baghdad Pups"" program which, according to SPCA International, ""helps U.S. troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone."" Before her work with SPCA International, Crisp headed the California-based animal rescue charity Noah's Wish, which received millions of dollars in donations after Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005. It promised to use the money to help animals affected by the disaster . The California attorney general investigated whether contributions to Noah's Wish for ""rescuing and caring for the animal victims of Hurricane Katrina"" were used for that purpose. In the summer of 2007, Noah's Wish reached a settlement agreement with the state of California in which the charity agreed to forfeit $4 million in donations out of the $8 million raised by the charity. Under that settlement, Crisp agreed not to ""serve as an officer, director or trustee or in any position having the duties or responsibilities of an officer, director or trustee, with any nonprofit organization for a period of five (5) years from the date of the execution of this Settlement Agreement."" Yet in a filing with the North Carolina secretary of state's office last year, SPCA International named Crisp in its list of officers and directors. California's attorney general launched the investigation into Noah's Wish after a bookkeeper with the charity and others alerted his office to questionable business practices. The former bookkeeper, who wants to conceal her identity for reasons unrelated to her work at Noah's Wish, told CNN that donations came pouring into Noah's Wish soon after Hurricane Katrina. Crisp had appealed for donations on numerous television networks, including CNN. ""There was cash, there were checks, there were cashiers checks, there were letters -- heartbreaking letters from kids who, instead of having birthday parties, they wanted all the money to go to Noah's Wish to help those poor little animals,"" the woman said. ""On a given day, we would have, oh my gosh, easily $20,000 ... just in checks."" And she said suddenly Terri Crisp changed, hiring her daughter and acting as if the money was hers to keep. Both made six-figure salaries, the former bookkeeper said. ""Terri at one time said, 'I've worked hard for so many years, doing animal rescue, I am entitled to this money.'"" When approached by CNN at her Placerville, California, home, Crisp told CNN she has ""nothing to hide"" but refused to answer any detailed questions without permission from the organization's communications director. CNN requested an on-camera interview several weeks ago from Stephanie Scott, the SPCA International public relations director, but Scott never responded either by phone or e-mail. Standing on the lawn of her home, Crisp told CNN that ""you've taken a lot of the information"" provided by SPCA International and ""reported it incorrectly."" CNN said now was her chance to correct the record she saw as inaccurate. ""I would love to but as I said, I'm an employee of SPCA International."" She added, ""I can't answer any of your questions. Believe me, I would love to."" She did tell CNN that the Noah's Wish board of directors set her salary and that she is now an employee, not a director, at SPCA International. A CNN investigation into SPCA International found that the charity raised close to $27 million to help animals worldwide but spent nearly all of that money on fund-raising expenses paid to a direct-mail company. In 2010, SPCA International owed $8.4 million to Quadriga Art and its affiliated company, Brickmill Marketing Services, according to publicly available Internal Revenue Service 990 tax records. Quadriga Art is one of the world's largest direct-mail providers to charities and nonprofits. It is the same fund-raiser hired by two veterans charities that spent tens of millions of dollars for its services -- triggering a Senate investigation last month into whether one of the charities should retain its tax-exempt status. That charity, Washington-based Disabled Veterans National Foundation, collected nearly $56 million in donations over the past three years yet paid Quadriga Art more than $60 million in fees, according to a CNN investigation into the charity's tax records. The other veterans charity, National Veterans Foundation, raised more than $22 million in donations over the past three years to help veterans yet spent about $18.2 million to pay Quadriga Art, according to IRS 990 forms. SPCA International is still in debt to Quadriga Art, according to a spokeswoman for the direct-mail firm, adding that's part of the charity's ""aggressive strategy"" to build a broad donor base. ""That resulted in an expected high cost in the beginning of their acquisition program,"" said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named. She called SPCA International's efforts a ""successful strategy."" There's no question that a charity needs to spend money to raise money, according to Bob Ottenhoff, president of the charity watchdog group Guidestar. But he said that SPCA International's tax records raise ""a number of red flags."" ""No. 1, there is an enormous amount of money going into fund-raising,"" Ottenhoff said. ""It's not unusual for a nonprofit to fund-raise. In fact they need to fund-raise. But this organization has an enormous amount of fund-raising costs, certainly relative to the amount of money being spent."" Of the $14 million raised in 2010, SPCA International reports it spent less than 0.5% -- about $60,000 -- in small cash grants to animal shelters across the United States. It also said it spent about $450,000 -- about 3% of the total raised in 2010 -- to bring back animals from Iraq and Afghanistan as part of its ""Baghdad Pups"" program. In addition to its questionable finances, CNN found that SPCA International misrepresented the ""Baghdad Pups"" program on its tax filings. On its website and its tax filings, SPCA International describes as a program that ""helps U.S. troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone."" Yet the charity admitted that only 26 of the nearly 500 animals transported to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan were actually service animals. The rest were stray animals, said Stephanie Scott, the charity's communications director. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- A Yemeni military plane crashed into a residential area of the capital Monday, killing the pilot and injuring at least 18 people on the ground, the Yemeni government said. The government would not confirm the death toll. It was unclear how many people were aboard the plane. The Russian-made Sukhoi Su-22, a fighter jet, was on a training mission when it crashed in southern Sanaa, Yemeni state TV reported. Three houses and a four-story building caught fire after the crash, and the fire was spreading. Firefighters later managed to extinguish the fire in the four-story building, state TV said. The Defense Ministry said a mechanical fault caused the crash and the jet was not shot down. It was the third fatal air crash in Sanaa in the past year. In February, a military fighter jet on a training mission went down in a residential section of Sanaa, killing at least 10 people and injuring 21. At least one of the missiles the plane was carrying exploded in that crash. Last November, a military cargo plane caught fire and crashed in the city, killing 10 people.

"(CNN) -- The Sacramento Kings won't be headed north to Seattle after all -- despite its owners reaching a deal to sell the team to a Washington state group -- after NBA executives voted Wednesday to reject such a move. Twenty-two members of the league's Board of Governors rejected the Kings' relocation bid, while eight voted in favor. Commissioner David Stern cited the existence of a ""strong ownership group,"" a construction team and plan to build a new arena, plus strong support from Sacramento's mayor and others in the region, as reasons why the Kings will remain in northern California. ""I would say it's a victory for Sacramento, not the NBA,"" Stern told reporters, applauding the ""excellent"" if ultimately unsuccessful Seattle bid. Wednesday's vote follows months of talks between members of the Maloof family, the majority owners of the Kings, and a Seattle-based group that includes investor Chris Hansen and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. In January, these two parties reached a deal for that group to buy the Maloofs' 53% share of the team as well as minority owner Bob Hernreich's 12% stake. But that agreement needed the OK of the NBA's Board of Governors to go through. It didn't happen. The Maloof family and Hansen's group, though, kept on talking, leading to another deal (for a higher price) and this week's scheduled vote by the NBA board. Meanwhile, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson -- himself a former all-star NBA guard -- kept pushing to keep the Kings in his city. That involved crafting a stadium plan and working with a group of individuals committed to keeping the team in Sacramento. Stern said that over the ""next 24 to 48 hours,"" NBA officials will talk to the Maloofs to try to ""facilitate an agreement"" for them to sell the Kings to the so-called Ranadive group, thus assuring the team remains in California. And he vowed ""fair dealing and ultimate consideration down to the road"" for any future efforts to land an NBA team in Seattle, which saw its last franchise -- the Supersonics -- leave for Oklahoma City in 2008. After Wednesday's vote, Johnson said he was excited the Kings are staying put, saying it will be a boon for his city. And he promised that he and others in Sacramento will continue working to execute their plan. ""We're going to deliver. Why? Because it's bigger than basketball,"" Johnson said. ""We're talking economic development and job creation.""","The NBA Board of Governors votes 22-8 to reject the Kings move to Seattle .

"(CNN) -- Part of being a child is developing your identity. School can teach you knowledge. Society can teach you what it expects of you. But, once you develop a sense of yourself, no one and nothing can tell you who you are. You come to know that -- to your core. When a child's sense of self develops in ways that are traditional and unremarkable, nobody takes much notice. But when it happens in ways that challenge traditional norms or expectations, people often try to ""correct"" it. Such is the heart of a controversy brewing in Colorado involving a first-grader and, of all things, a bathroom. The unlikely center of this uproar is a little 6-year-old girl, Coy Mathis. Coy knows she's a girl. She dresses as a girl. Her legal documents recognize her as a girl. Her parents accept her as a girl. On the playground, you would have difficulty identifying her as different from any of the other girls, because in all ways that matter socially and legally, this child is a girl. The problem is that Coy was born in the body of a boy, so the school district wants her to use the boys' bathroom, or some bathroom other than the one the other girls use. The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund has filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division on behalf of Coy and her family. Discrimination complaint filed for transgender girl . Although generations of people facing a similar mind/body dissonance have been forced to hide, to pretend, to live unhappy and empty lives simply for being different, the world is changing. Kids such as Coy finally have a chance to avoid a similar fate with their dignity and their self-image intact, given the right support and opportunity. Vice President Joe Biden has long been a supporter of gay, lesbian and transgender rights, referring to them as civil rights issues. It seems odd to think of this first-grader who simply wants to use the bathroom as a civil rights pioneer. But crossing seemingly simple barriers for rights is nothing new -- whether to ride a bus, to attend a school or to use a bathroom just like everyone else. It is unfortunate that we keep having to relearn these lessons. I doubt many people stop to consider that the single most significant moment in their lives happens within minutes of their births. That's when, upon simple inspection, a doctor or a nurse pronounces a baby a boy or a girl. That seemingly simple and obvious proclamation has reverberations for the rest of our lives. I can empathize with Coy because I faced those same overwhelming questions myself, almost 50 years ago. I came to know a similar mistake had been made, except that at that time, I didn't have words to explain it. I learned to live a lie. Pretending to be what you're not, hoping things will magically fix themselves, seems easier at times. But lies have consequences. News: Frat pays for brother's sex change . It is unfortunate that Coy's school has not learned the lesson that so many other aspects of our culture have already acknowledged, that a person's gender is more complicated than a body part or a chromosome. Workplaces across this country are recognizing the challenges that their transgender workers face and are removing deeply embedded barriers to health care and wellness benefits. Organizations ranging from the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the Girl Scouts are accepting transyouth, sometimes under fire, treating children based on identify, not body parts. Transwomen have openly competed in mainstream beauty pageants and have been featured in magazines such as Vogue. Transgender athletes, artists and writers, people in all fields, have shown there is a pathway to a happy, well-adjusted and fulfilling life -- not as an ""other,"" but as the men and women we know ourselves to be. Apparently none of this matters to the school that denies Coy the use of the girls' bathroom or to the parents who demonize her and her family. Arguments to treat Coy with dignity often fall on deaf ears. Why? Because discussion of the topic quickly becomes emotional rather than rational. When I came out to my own mother, at 40 years old, I was a parent, I had been married to a woman I loved for 20 years, I had a successful career, we owned two homes, and there wasn't a single person who would have guessed my secret or my struggle. But in the end, a quote from AndrÃ© Gide: ""It is better to be hated for what you are than loved for what you are not,"" resonated to the point that I finally became who I should have been. Today, my family and I have never been closer. I have never been more in tune with myself and the world around me. My relationships have never been more fulfilling. Those who would cling to outdated stereotypes of transpeople as sad, lonely, misguided, freakish and broken see more and more examples of people who bloom when they find the strength, and the opportunity, to become authentic. My own advice for Coy and her family: Keep the spirit of the Serenity Prayer close to your heart. Love one another.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court ruled for agribusiness giant Monsanto on Monday in a patent case that could have an enormous impact on a variety of biotech fields. The justices unanimously found the world's largest seed producer has intellectual property control over its best-selling ""Roundup Ready"" soybeans. That means the product cannot be reproduced without paying the company a fee. Products like genetically engineered seeds and live vaccines have been hailed as scientific and industrial breakthroughs, but they often can be reproduced easily and cheaply. Monsanto sued an Indiana farmer, Vernon Hugh Bowman, claiming he violated a farming agreement when he used genetic copies of the company's soybean product without paying a ""technology fee."" Monsanto claimed that the seeds could only be used for one growing season, meaning their offspring could not be saved and replanted without compensation. The high court agreed. ""Bowman planted Monsanto's patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. The high court is deciding a separate case on whether human genes can be patented. Monsanto dominates the soybean seed market. Its Roundup Ready variety is used to grow about 90 percent of the nation's crop for the estimated 275,000 American soybean farmers like Bowman, according to its petition. The company's scientists perfected a system in 1996 for injecting genes into seeds that are resistant to the herbicide Roundup. This allowed farmers to plant with reduced risk of weeds, insects, and disease. Those soybeans cost more and farmers must agree not to replant their progeny, thus buying seeds each year. The corporation says it has sued 146 U.S. farmers including Bowman. Eleven cases have gone to trial and Monsanto won them all. Bowman grows corn, wheat, and soybeans on 300 acres in Sandborn, Indiana. He used the patented soybeans for his main spring crop, but went to a local grain elevator and purchased so-called commodity seeds for a riskier, late-season crop. Such soybeans are typically used for feed livestock and for milling, but not for replanting. But Bowman said there were no restrictions on how he used the mixed-variety seeds, which he did for eight consecutive fall crops. The company found out and sued him six years ago was awarded more than $84,000 in damages. Lower courts said the second-generation seed planting was a ""newly infringing article."" Mark Walters, Bowman's attorney, said farmers take all the risks when they plant, while the company can sit back and control how its products are used in perpetuity. ""If exhaustion [first-sale doctrine] is eliminated, rather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in commerce,"" he told the court during February oral arguments. ""You have essentially a servitude on these things that are exchanged and every grain elevator who makes a sale is infringing,"" he said. Food safety experts have raised concerns about the proliferation of genetically engineered food products, saying such production technologies can prove harmful. But Monsanto, backed by the Obama administration and a range of businesses, say protecting intellectual property is more important than ever, especially in fast-developing technological fields. ""America's leadership in fostering the incentive to invest in research and development has created the world's leading innovation economy, with millions of high-technology jobs-not just in our field of agriculture, but in other R&D-intensive fields like medicine, biotechnology, computer science and environmental science,"" said David Snively, Monsanto's general counsel. Bowman argued the soybeans naturally replicate or sprout themselves and had done so without much input from him. But Kagan, writing for her eight colleagues, was not convinced. ""We think that blame-the-bean defense tough to credit,"" she said. ""In all this, the bean surely figured. But it was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (to the eighth generation) of Monsanto's patented invention."" But Kagan also issued a measure of caution, saying this decision might not necessarily apply in other areas. ""Our holding today is limited -- addressing the situation before us, rather than every one involving a self-replicating product,"" she said. ""We recognize that such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse."" The case is Bowman v. Monsanto Company (11-796).","Supreme Court rules for agribusiness in patent dispute .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean President Park Geun-hye apologized Monday for a damaging scandal involving a spokesman she fired last week over allegations of sexual misconduct in the United States. The former aide, Yoon Chang-jung, is accused of making inappropriate advances toward a female student who was hired as a guide while Yoon was in Washington for Park's first official visit to the United States last week. ""I am very sorry that an unsavory incident, which a public official should never be involved in, happened near the end of my visit to the U.S. and hugely disappointed the people,"" Park said Monday at a meeting with senior officials. It was the first time she has commented publicly on the matter. Her office hasn't disclosed details of what Yoon, 56, is alleged to have done, and Washington police have said only that they are investigating a report of a sexual abuse misdemeanor without specifically mentioning Yoon by name. But South Korean news media have widely reported that Yoon is accused of grabbing the buttocks of the young woman, who has not been identified, after drinking with her. Allegations denied . On Saturday, Yoon denied the allegations circulating about him, saying he had patted the woman on the waist once and encouraged her to ""live life to the full in the States and be successful."" ""I swear I did not have any intention of sexually harassing her, and I did not molest her,"" Yoon said during a news conference in a Seoul restaurant. ""Now, I deeply regret not properly understanding the American culture, and I offer my sincere word of consolation to the guide,"" he said. Yoon also denied allegations in the South Korean press that he had called the woman to his room the morning after the incident and answered the door undressed. He said he had only answered the door in his underwear because he believed it was somebody with an urgent message for him. ""I never imagined my guide would have come,"" he said. He apologized to Park, South Korea's first female president, for the ""trouble"" he had caused. State visit overshadowed . The scandal has cast a pall over Park's five-day visit to the United States, her first high-profile trip since her inauguration in February. Before news emerged of Yoon's dismissal and the allegations against him, the visit had generally been considered a success, with Park and President Barack Obama reaffirming the U.S.-South Korean alliance in the face of recent threats from North Korea. Yoon is alleged to have made the inappropriate advances toward the woman on Tuesday night, hours after Park held talks with Obama. He said his boss, chief presidential press secretary Lee Nam-ki, told him to leave Washington quickly and return to South Korea as soon as the allegations of misconduct began to surface. Yoon said he told Lee he had done nothing wrong and wanted to stay and explain the situation. But he said he followed his supervisor's order and gone to the airport. Lee made a statement to the media on Thursday in Los Angeles (Friday morning in South Korea), saying Yoon had been dismissed after he had ""damaged the dignity of the country."" Media uproar . By the time Park stepped off the plane that brought her back to South Korea on Friday evening, a media firestorm was raging over the scandal, and opposition parties were demanding a public apology. After earlier apologies by senior members of her staff, Park addressed the matter herself on Monday. She apologized for the ""shock"" that she said the student and her parents must have experienced. South Korea ""will take whatever measures are necessary and will actively cooperate with the U.S. investigation,"" Park said. Yoon, a former journalist and political columnist, served as spokesman for Park's transition team before his appointment, according to the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap. Critics had said at the time he was unsuitable for the job as spokesman, claiming his columns were sensational and biased, Yonhap reported. Journalist Soobin Park reported from Seoul, South Korea. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","President Park Geun-hye says she is sorry about an ""unsavory incident"" involving an aide .

"(CNN) -- The leaders of Turkey and the United States are huddling in Washington on Thursday over how to handle the Syrian civil war, the raging conflict that has left an estimated 80,000 people dead and a few million displaced -- despite more than two years of diplomacy to halt the bloodshed. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meeting in Washington, discussed how to strengthen the Syrian opposition, help the many people displaced by the war, and mobilize the international community to put more pressure on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and forge a political transition. They spoke as the warfare in Syria raged Thursday. The opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria said at least 63 people were killed, including 45 in Damascus and its suburbs. ""We're going to keep increasing the pressure on the Assad regime, and working with the Syrian opposition,"" Obama said. ""The prime minister has been on the forefront of the international effort to push for a transition to a democratic Syria without Bashar Assad. And Turkey is going to play an important role as we bring representatives of the regime and opposition together in the coming weeks."" Obama said he and Erdogan agree that al-Assad needs to transfer power. ""That is the only way we're going to resolve this crisis. And we're going to keep working for a Syria that is free from Assad's tyranny, that is intact and inclusive of all ethnic and religious groups, and that's a source of stability, not extremism, because it's in the profound interest of all our nations, especially Turkey."" Turkey has been a major player in the effort to push for change in Syria, which sits on its southern border. At one time, Erdogan and al-Assad had close ties, but the war has made them antagonists. Turkey has long harbored many Syrian refugees and hosted opposition entities. ""I've made it clear again today that the United States is going to keep on helping countries in the region, including Turkey, shoulder this burden, doing our part as a major donor of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, including those refugees in Turkey. And we're going to keep working with our Turkish partners to deliver the food, shelter and medicine that's needed to save lives."" Erdogan said ending the war and meeting the people's demands for a new government ""are two areas where we are in full agreement with the United States. Supporting the opposition and Assad leaving are important issues. "" ""We also agree that we have to prevent Syria from becoming an area for terrorist organizations. We also agreed that chemical weapons should not be used and all minorities and their rights should be secured. These are all priority areas for all of us,"" he said. Obama said that solid evidence of chemical weaponry would constitute a red line in the conflict and produce major consequences. ""I've said in the past, we have seen evidence of the use of chemical weapons inside of Syria. It is important for us to make sure that we're able to get more specific information about what exactly is happening there,"" he said. ""But separate and apart from the chemical weapons, we know that tens of thousands of people are being killed with artillery and mortars and that the humanitarian crisis and the slaughter that's taking place by itself is sufficient to prompt strong international action."" He cited a ""whole range of options that the United States is already engaged in"" and said he preserved ""the options of taking additional steps, both diplomatic and military, because those chemical weapons inside of Syria also threaten our security over the long term as well as our allies and friends and neighbors."" ""This is also an international problem, and it's very much my hope to continue to work with all the various parties involved, including Turkey, to find a solution that brings peace to Syria, stabilizes the region, stabilizes those chemical weapons, but it's not gonna be something that the United States does by itself, and I don't think anybody in the region, including the prime minister, would think that U.S. unilateral actions in and of themselves would bring about a better outcome inside -- inside of Syria."" Diplomatic moves . On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a political transition in Syria. The resolution, which passed by a 107-12 vote, with 59 abstentions, also condemned the government's increased use of heavy weapons and ongoing ""widespread and systematic gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" said a U.N. statement. It was the fifth resolution on Syria voted by the body since 2011. ""If we are unable to do anything to stop this tragedy, then how can we sustain the moral credibility of this organization?"" Assembly President Vuk Jeremic said before the vote, according to the statement. Meanwhile, in Sweden, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the revival of a peace initiative based on last year's Geneva conference. That conference, brokered by Russia and the United States, outlined how a transitional government could be formed in Syria. ""I think it's fair to say that both of us are confident about the direction that we're moving in and very, very hopeful that within a short period of time, the pieces will have come together fully so that the world, hopefully, will have an opportunity to be given an alternative to the violence and destruction that is taking place in Syria at this moment,"" Kerry said. Lavrov cited the Russian-American proposal to convene a conference to start implementing the Geneva communique last June. ""It's self-explanatory, and what we need now is to mobilize support for this initiative on the basis of what was, I believe, in Geneva and what was proposed by Washington and Moscow: to mobilize support, first of all, by all the Syrian groups, the regime and all opposition groups; and second, by those outside actors who have influence on either one or the other Syrian group,"" Lavrov said. Obama and Erdogan addressed the Geneva initiative. ""I do think that the prospect of talks in Geneva involving the Russians and representatives about a serious political transition that all parties can buy into may yield results,"" Obama said. Erdogan said that ""we will continue to explore what we can do together, what we can consider as part of a road map looking at Geneva and beyond.""

"(EW.com) -- American Idol finalists Kree Harrison and Candice Glover wowed the audience at the Nokia Theater at L.A. Live Wednesday evening with three show-stopping ballads each. After the performances, Glover, Harrison and judge Keith Urban came backstage to talk about their night, that coin flip, and singing those soulful songs. ""As different as they are, they have a lot of similarities. They have a lot of vulnerability and strength that are both apparent when they perform. They both come from very roots-y, earthy, real families and I think that's what's apparent in what they do. There's no pageantry in either of them,"" said first-time judge Urban. ""They sing because they need to sing. Not because they want to be famous."" But as to what he thought of their performances, Urban said: ""I was really taken with the original songs, particularly Kree's. Kree's to me was the one that just hit me."" Harrison and Glover may not have Urban's luxury of distance, but both offered up insights into their performances as well. EW: Latest 'American Idol' recap . On those emotional songs and staying confident onstage . Harrison may own the stage when she's belting out those ballads now, but she admitted she wasn't always so comfortable going to those dark place. ""The truth is before I committed to this competition, I wasn't so good with emotional songs,"" Harrison said. ""I put a wall up because I didn't want to get to that point where I couldn't handle the lyrics and couldn't get it out. But I found that there's a happy medium of connecting and really showing your heart through your lyrics."" Glover was no different. Her swagger, she says, is just an act. ""I always feel very unconfident, but I don't show it onstage,"" Glover said. And it was her drive to succeed that prevented her from getting lost in the sadness of her song. ""I got emotional in the middle of the song but I couldn't stop because I didn't want to go off-key,"" Glover said. On that fateful coin flip . Reality television devotees may be surprised to learn that as Ryan Seacrest was flipping that coin last week that would give the winner the choice to go first or second in Wednesdays finals show, Kree was whispering to Candice to ask which position she preferred. ""I was very surprised. She asked me while it was spinning. I said 'I don't know? Second?' and she said 'OK, I'll go first,'"" said Glover. ""That's Kree. Every day. She doesn't think about herself at all. She puts everyone before herself."" Harrison said, ""I think it comes down to the singing, the connection, the order doesn't matter."" Though Glover wasn't in the room to hear her say that, she echoed the sentiment in nearly the same words. EW: Should 'American Idol' lose the results show? On what they're going to do the day after tomorrow . Glover said that she's just relieved that they don't have to go through another round. ""We've just been taking it one day at a time and doing our best, but I have to think about [plans] when I go home,"" she said. Harrison, on the other hand, didn't know exactly what she'd be doing, but knew that she'd have at least something to celebrate. ""My birthday is the day after the finale,"" Harrison said, adding with a laugh: ""Vote for me for my birthday!"" As many know, Glover was an American Idol contestant before, but despite her success this year, she doesn't feel as though she was robbed before. ""Honestly I don't think I would have won,"" Glover said. ""I think everything happens for a reason and I don't think I would have made it as far as I did this year. I was just auditioning because I was a 19-year-old who happened to know how to sing. And this year I think I'm more of an artist and I think I know myself a little bit better."" In less than 24 hours the world will know who was voted the Season 12 American Idol and who gets to go home in second place. With that kind of pressure, it's tempting to think that Harrison and Glover are enemies, just playing friendly on stage. But just ask how they spent the night before the big show. ""Me and Kree watched some TV together. She fell asleep on me. I made sure she was sleeping and then I went to my room,"" said Glover. ""We just chilled."" There are no rivalries here.

"(CNN) -- Ohio State University President E. Gordon Gee, who came under fire after controversial remarks about other colleges, has announced plans to retire, school representative Gayle Saunders said Tuesday afternoon. Gee said he recently returned from a family vacation that included time for self-reflection. ""And after much deliberation, I have decided it is now time for me to turn over the reins of leadership to allow the seeds that we have planted to grow. It is also time for me to re-energize and refocus myself,"" he said in a written statement. According to the Columbus Dispatch newspaper, Gee apologized last week to top officials at schools in the Big Ten Conference and others. Gee reportedly made disparaging remarks during a December meeting with the Ohio State Athletics Council. Gee referred to ""those damn Catholics"" at Notre Dame and joked that Louisville didn't have the academic integrity to join the Big Ten. He also cast aspersion on some schools in the Southeastern Conference, the paper reported. CNN affiliate WBNS reported that in March the university's board of trustees sent Gee a letter that outlined corrective steps in the wake of the remarks and that he could be fired if there were any more gaffes. On Tuesday, the chairman of the school's board of trustees said Gee has transformed the school. ""His service to Ohio State has been superb. This man has been an inspiration to many people, including me, and we all are forever grateful for his friendship. His thoughtful and unique leadership style has taken the University to new levels,"" said Robert H. Schottenstein. Gee has twice led the university, which has 63,000 students -- from 1990 to 1997, and from 2007 until now. His retirement takes effect July 1. Joseph A. Alutto, an executive vice president, will take over as interim president.","NEW: CNN affiliate says Gee was told in March to be careful with his remarks .

"(CNN) -- Yet another top Rutgers University staffer has come under scrutiny, this time for being named in an age discrimination lawsuit involving three former employees. Gregory S. Jackson, who was appointed by Rutgers President Robert S. Barchi as his chief of staff in April, is being sued for allegedly unlawfully terminating three staffers in the university's career services department. All of the former employees were in their late 50s and early 60s, according to the complaint, which was filed in a New Jersey court in January. Barchi was aware of the litigation when he appointed Jackson, according to university officials. ""President Barchi believes that Professor Jackson is an effective administrator capable of confronting challenging and complex problems and is an effective manager and steward of the university's resources,"" said E.J. Miranda, director of media relations at Rutgers. Jackson continues in his roles as associate vice president and interim vice chancellor for undergraduate academic affairs and as an associate English professor. He took over the academic affairs office in January 2011. Almost immediately, Jackson reportedly told staffers that ""there was going to be a review of Career Services and that there would be changes."" the complaint said. Jackson reportedly implied at several meetings that his practice is to force people to leave or retire and told certain staffers that they should begin to look for other employment opportunities, the complaint said. In April 2012, the three staffers were notified that they had met standards during their regular performance reviews, the complaint said. Jackson then requested an external review of the department later that month. The complaint alleges that Jackson revised the performance reviews for three staffers after the external review to reflect that they had not met standards in any of the categories for the positions for which they were being evaluated. All of the employees had worked at Rutgers for more than 20 years. One staffer had worked there for more than 40 years, the complaint said. In November 2012, the three staffers and the university received letters notifying them of their termination. Before receiving the letters, the three were demoted and forced to work in isolated and dilapidated conditions, the complaint said. Jackson did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Attorneys for Jackson and Rutgers asked that a judge dismiss the entire complaint. They called the case baseless and inaccurate. ""The University views the plaintiffs' claims in this lawsuit as lacking merit and plans to vigorously defend its business decisions made in restructuring the University's Office of Career Services,"" said John K. Bennett, the attorney for Rutgers and Jackson said. Juan C. Fernandez, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment. Rutgers has had no shortage of controversy over the past few months. Head basketball coach Mike Rice came under fire after a video of him physically and verbally abusing players was broadcast on ESPN in April. He resigned, along with Athletic Director Tim Pernetti and assistant basketball coach Jimmy Martelli. Julie Hermann was hired as the new athletic director in May. Reports surfaced that she had been named in a gender discrimination lawsuit in 2008, while she was working at the University of Louisville. Hermann was also accused of verbal abuse by group of University of Tennessee volleyball players whom she coached in the 1990s.","Rutgers President Robert Barchi named Gregory Jackson as chief of staff in April .

"(CNN) -- Reputed Boston mob boss and longtime fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger is the defendant in a sensational murder and racketeering trial, but proceedings Friday in federal court had one prosecutor choking up with emotion while defending the work of another law enforcement officer. And that moment came before a jury has even been seated. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak choked up during arguments in the case as he defended one of his main investigators, Massachusetts Lt. Steve Johnson. Wyshak was responding to a defense claim that one of the key witnesses in the case may have been involved in further criminal activity since his release from federal prison in 2007, and that a member of the Massachusetts State Police claimed the investigation into that defense witness' activities was compromised. In court, Bulger attorney Henry Brennan said the state trooper who complained felt ""undermined by one of his superiors, Steve Johnson."" Brennan says the trooper was ""not only undermined....so discontent he made complaints."" The defense witness, John Mortorano, has admitted he killed 20 people as part of Bulger's criminal organization that ruled south Boston for decades. He was released as part of a plea deal in exchange for his testimony. Wyshak acknowledged in court that the Massachusetts state police investigated claims from ""sources"" that Mortorano was again involved in criminal activity after he was freed. Wyshak said the investigation included ""numerous interviews"" and that the ""allegations were unfounded,"" calling the accusations ""a lot of smoke."" Wyshak said the information was turned over to the defense in May. What apparently wasn't turned over was an additional internal state police investigation into Johnson's handling of the case. Wyshak, addressing U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper, became emotional as he defended Johnson, calling him, ""one of the best law enforcement officers I know."" Wyshak said the the internal investigation found complaints against Johnson were ""unsubstantiated"" and that the ""real villain is the state trooper"" who he says ""went off the deep-end"" and denied the allegations when confronted. Wyshak said that trooper faces disciplinary action. The judge did not rule on whether the defense is entitled to documents pertaining to the internal investigation. The conduct of law enforcement is key in the case since prosecutors allege a corrupt FBI agent aided Bulger in his criminal actives while Bulger himself was a government informant. The Friday back-and-forth came as the two sides attempt to seat a 18-member jury, including six alternates, in the high-profile case. One hundred and 50 potential jurors whose questionnaires passed muster will be further scrutinized on Monday. Bulger was arrested in California in 2011 after 16 years on the run. Now 83, he's charged in the killings of 19 people during his days as the leader of south Boston's Winter Hill gang. Federal prosecutors say Bulger led the Irish mob from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s. But after Bulger fled impending racketeering charges, investigators found he had been an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the inspiration for the Oscar-winning 2006 drama ""The Departed.""","A jury has yet to be seated in the ""Whitey"" Bulger trial .

"(CNN) -- Twenty years ago, Edward Djerejian, a former U.S. diplomat, famously worried that Islamists would exploit democratic elections to come to power, after which they would pull the democratic ladder up behind them. Instead of one man, one vote, he said, Islamists wanted one man, one vote, one time. Last week, Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and his country's first democratically elected president, seemed to fulfill Djerejian's grim prophecy. In a series of unilateral amendments to Egypt's interim constitution, Morsy declared that his word ""is final and binding and cannot be appealed by any way or to any entity,"" and that he is empowered to ""take the necessary actions and measures to protect the country and the goals of the revolution."" But, as shocking as Morsy's actions are, they do not prove that Islamists cannot be democrats. Morsy's decision to grant himself unquestioned authority was not the final, spectacularly public phase in some hitherto clandestine Muslim Brotherhood plan to erect a holy autocracy. Instead, the Egyptian president simply did what Egyptian presidents have been doing for more than 60 years — that is, loosening institutional restraints on their authority in order to more easily fulfill their agendas. News: Is Morsy Egypt's next strongman? That Morsy is an Islamist is largely irrelevant. It's likely that the autocratic temptation would have seized Egypt's president regardless of his party or ideological orientation. This is not only because Egypt has had a distressingly long history of powerful executives, it's also because, at this moment in Egypt's political history, there is no actor, institution or organization able to keep the presidency in check. Under such circumstances, even the most earnest democrats would find themselves flirting with authoritarianism — first in the name of the greater good, and then later, when pretenses can be dropped, in the service of naked ambition. Usually, presidential ambitions are tamed by legislatures, and this was to be the case under Egypt's interim constitution. A parliament was elected in January, but the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court dissolved the body once it became clear that Morsy was on his way to being elected president. The ostensible reason for the dissolution was that the parliamentary election law ran afoul of some foggy constitutional provision, but the real reason was that Islamists dominated parliament, and the court feared that this Islamist legislature, coupled with a Muslim Brotherhood president, would lead Egypt irretrievably down the road to theocracy. In the absence of an elected legislature, it was left to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces -- the consortium of generals who ruled Egypt for the 18 months following former leader Hosni Mubarak's overthrow -- to counteract the presidency. But the Egyptian people and the generals had grown weary of each other. Word in Cairo was that the septuagenarian minister of defense, Muhammad Hussein Tantawi, wanted a way out, a ""safe exit"" in which he could live out his days free of the indignities visited upon his old boss, who bounced between prison and infirmary. A bargain was worked out. The president clawed back the council's powers and sent the minister of defense and the armed forces chief of staff into cossetted retirement (while naming them presidential advisers). The political landscape now lay prostrate before him. Except for the judiciary, and particularly the SCC. To Morsy, the 17 men (and one woman) who make up that body constitute a defiant remnant of the Mubarak order. That a clash was inevitable was apparent from Morsy's first moments in office, when his inauguration was delayed for several hours over his reluctance to be sworn in before the outgoing head of the court. Business: Morsy makes his power plays . When the president decreed that the dissolved parliament should return to work, the judges shut him down. Later, he tried to fire Egypt's attorney general, a Mubarak appointee. Again, he was told that this was outside his ken. Rumors swirled that the SCC was planning to dissolve the second constituent assembly; others reported that a court was about to rule the Muslim Brotherhood itself illegal. Morsy and his men point to these things and argue that he was forced to take action. But what's remarkable is what the president didn't do. For all of his complaining about SCC's dissolution of parliament's lower house, and for all the damage that the decision did to Egypt's democratic transition, the president has indicated that he will uphold it. Essam el-Erian, deputy chairman of the Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, has publicly called on Morsy to reinstate the parliament, but a presidential spokesman has said that there are no plans to do so. The president's reluctance to bring back the parliament further reinforces the impression that his main aim is to expand the powers of his office, which he probably believes is better able to put Egypt right than a raucous legislature packed with unreliable Salafists and a fractious ""liberal"" wing. Though the Muslim Brotherhood has generally fallen into line behind the president, there are signs that at least some of its members are deeply uncomfortable with what he has wrought. Muslim Brotherhood politician Ahmed Fahmi, the speaker of the upper house of parliament and a relative of Morsy's, was reported to have said, ""We wish that the president had conducted a popular referendum on the constitutional declaration, because what he has done has divided the country between the secular and Islamic forces."" (Fahmi has since denied making the statement.) Muhammad Abd al-Quddus, a Muslim Brotherhood member and a member of the board of Egypt's journalists union, reportedly said, ""despite my membership in the Brotherhood, I am a son of the revolution for freedom. Therefore, I reject unlimited powers for the president, regardless of the reasons and the duration."" Even some of the president's defenders have betrayed hints of ambivalence over his radical decision. Muhammad al-Biltagi, secretary general of the Freedom and Justice Party's Cairo branch, declared that ""many have a right to be worried"" about the president's move to place his decisions above oversight, and he called for a national dialogue to arrive at a solution that would preserve ""the right of the president to perform his duties with full authority without political interference from Mubarak's Constitutional Court, as well as the right of the political and social forces to receive guarantees against even temporary presidential tyranny."" Today, the only check on Morsy's authority comes from the streets. And while the protests against the president's decisions have been surprisingly robust, Morsy has so far resisted making concessions. In a meeting with Egyptian judges, he reassured them that he would limit his use of his new powers, but, as of this writing, his decree still stands. Though large protests are scheduled, the president may believe that he can afford to wait them out. After all, a repeat of the January 25 scenario is unlikely. The opposition to the president, though significant, remains fractured and uncoordinated, and in any case is far narrower than it was in 2011. The military, which proved essential in removing Mubarak from power, has no appetite for a repeat engagement with the responsibilities of governance, and Morsy has more legitimacy — at home and abroad — than Mubarak did. And Morsy may believe that the great, silent majority of Egyptians are behind him. After all, Egypt's GDP is about an eighth of the United States', and a greater percentage of Americans were literate during the Civil War than Egyptians are today. The vast countryside is likely untroubled by the president's constitutional maneuverings. One might be tempted to ask what the United States, Egypt's greatest foreign patron, can do to set that country on the right course. Some have suggested withholding aid, canceling loans and other means of pressuring Morsy to step back from the authoritarian ledge on which he now finds himself. These measures may produce flurries of positive statements and signals in the near term, but they won't change the fundamental alchemy of Egyptian politics. One only need examine the example of Iraq, which, after almost a decade of American tutelage has nonetheless glided into a form of dominant party autocracy, to realize that genuinely democratic governance cannot be imposed, especially on poor, underdeveloped countries. None of this — Egypt's tradition of executive dominance, its feeble institutions, its weak political organizations or its enervated society — is particularly the fault of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, if we are to take any lesson from the turmoil on the banks of the Nile, it is not that Islamists can't be trusted with Egypt's presidency, it is that no one can. Morsy may yet reverse course, but odds are that this will not be the last time that an Egyptian leader tries to convince his people that he must kill democracy in order to save it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tarek Masoud.","Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy announced measures vs. judiciary .

"(CNN) -- The ""rich man's club"" of Europe faces economic decay as it struggles to absorb the ""poor people"" of eastern and southern Europe, according to economic experts on the troubled region. The Marketplace Europe debate, hosted by Richard Quest and featuring Lufthansa boss Christoph Franz, chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL Frank Appel and Financial Times International Affairs Editor Quentin Peel this weekend thrashed out the topic: Can a European single market be globally competitive? The participants pointed to Europe's rapid growth as a reason it struggles to remain competitive, while the region attempts to pull itself out of the economic crisis. Read more: Euro recession deepens: So what can the ECB do now? According to Peel, the problem for Europe is its ""dramatic expansion"" to take in all the eastern European countries. ""Everybody wants to catch up to the same level and I think that we have blinded ourselves,"" he said during the CNN debate. ""Everybody wanted the German standard of living and maybe productivity wasn't keeping up."" The expansion of Europe over the last 10 years has seen the Brussels-based political union embark on the biggest recruitment drive in its history. Since 2004, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia were all admitted into the EU, with Romania and Bulgaria joining in 2007.

Since then, two of those countries, Latvia and Cyprus, have needed financial aid from the EU and International Monetary Fund, while Slovenia is restructuring its ailing banking system to avoid requesting a bailout. The World Economic Forum global competitiveness index shows that of the 27 nations in the European Union, 12 are more competitive in 2013 than 2012, while 12 are are less competitive with three unchanged. Read more: Auto industry revs up recovery on Spain . But the problems have not prevented more countries lining up to enter the club. Marco Simoni, political economist at the European Institute of the LSE, believes a ""slow decay"" of member state economies is the biggest risk to the EU and countries should not assume they are immune from financial collapse as soon as they sign up. ""Europeanization has not gone far enough,"" Simoni told CNN. ""It's not that you're safe once you're in, you still have to do your homework,"" he added. So who's up next? Next month, Croatia, one of the countries to emerge from the wreckage of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, will become the 28 member of the EU after completing the accession process. Read more: Croatia PM: We need Italy to recover . But with endemic corruption, and unemployment over 18% -- behind only Greece and Spain -- and stagnating economic growth, Croatia's entry has left the EU open to being criticized for not playing by its own rules. Natasha Srdoc, Co-Founder and Chairman of the Adriatic Institute for Public Policy, in April wrote an open letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly recommending that Germany block Croatia's entry into the EU on the grounds that the country's economy is not competitive enough due to high corruption and taxes. Srdoc believes as soon as Croatia, or any of the states in the Western Balkans seeking membership, enters the EU, young people will flock abroad in search of work. ""The enlargement programme is flawed,"" Srdoc told CNN. ""Croatia will be the next Greece unless rule of law, an independent judiciary and property rights are imposed... all these measures are needed if we are to have a competitive economy.""

Croatia is ranked 62nd in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2012, beating debt-stricken Italy and Greece as well as relative newcomers Romania and Bulgaria. Europe's victims of financial crisis . Since the outbreak of the crisis in 2010, countries such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland have dominated the headlines as nation-states were bailed out, governments rescued banks and unemployment hit record highs. Read more: Finnish PM: Eurozone nations must follow the rules . Now, after three years of slimming budgets and raising taxes, lawmakers and central bankers are in the midst of a policy rethink, pursuing pro-growth agendas to improve economic competitiveness rather than stern austerity measures. Some economists have suggested that heavily indebted countries such as Greece should quit the euro altogether. But during the debate Lufhansa boss Christoph Franz told CNN: ""I don't believe that is a path we should even consider, because we are now all in this together. There is no choice."" An exit from the 17-nation single currency would hand back key monetary policy powers -- such as setting interest rates and currency devaluation -- to respective national central banks. Deutsche Post DHL's Appel, who heads up the world's leading mail and logistics group, pointed to the Germany model as an example to all European countries on how to boost competitiveness. Since Germany's reunification, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, the country has gone on to become the region's economic powerhouse. Appel said time is the ""silver bullet"" to enhance a country's competitiveness. He told CNN: ""It took 20 years to reform the East (Germany) and get it to a level which is almost equal to the West (Germany), it took a lot of money and it needed a vision that was possible.""","Of 27 EU nations, 12 are more competitive in 2013 than 2012, while 12 are are less competitive with three unchanged .

"Editor's note: This review may contain spoilers. (EW.com) -- You could sit through a year's worth of Hollywood comedies and still not see anything that's genuinely knock-your-socks-off audacious. But ""This Is the End"" (opening today) truly is. It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time, and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired, and the snort-out-loud funniest. The movie opens with Seth Rogen at an airport, where a passerby says, ''Hey, Seth Rogen, what up, man?'' So you immediately know that he's going to be playing a version of himself. In fact, everyone in the film is playing a version of him-or herself. Rogen picks up his buddy Jay Baruchel (who's less of a star than anyone here — a running gag), and after getting stoned, they head to a party at James Franco's house. Everyone from Jonah Hill to Emma Watson is there, and what transpires looks so much like what you'd expect a party with hip young actors and comedians to look like that it's as if we'd wandered into the ultimate episode of Entourage. The jockeying of movie-star egos, the drugs and sex (Michael Cera is the group's libertine nerd), Rogen and Franco brainstorming a sequel to Pineapple Express — it's all cheekily plausible. Then Rogen and Baruchel venture out to a convenience store to feed their munchies, and they hear a crack, and blue light pours down from the heavens. It's not just an earthquake — it's the Rapture. The world is coming to an end! The two hustle back to the party, where most of the guests flee (or try to), and before long there are only five of them left in that house: Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Hill, and Craig Robinson. For a moment, I feared that ""This Is the End"" might be a stunt that wears out its welcome in 10 minutes. But Rogen, who co-wrote and codirected the film with Evan Goldberg, does something incredibly sly. The movie doesn't play the end of days for laughs. It's an honest-to-God metaphysical disaster movie, a fusion of ""Earthquake,"" ""2012,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and ""The Exorcist."" With the apocalypse played straight, the comedy can take off from it in a way that's all the more explosive, as it was in the fantastic ""Shaun of the Dead."" Sinkholes are sucking people into infernos, but inside Franco's house, the movie-star self-absorption gets raised to an insane new pitch of competitive backbiting. The interplay is so fast and obscene that you feel like you're eavesdropping on the sorts of things comedians say to each other when they're off camera. Then Danny McBride shows up, tossing insults like cherry bombs, and the hilarity just grows more scandalous. ""This Is the End"" pushes the envelope — a severed head becomes a soccer ball, and Franco and McBride turn a fight about masturbation into a confessional laugh riot. Yet through it all, the movie is wonderfully deadpan about the ''reality'' it's showing us. Is Jonah Hill really a narcissist who wears his nice-guy facade like the diamond stud in his ear? Is Rogen really a guilty sellout? ""This Is the End"" has great fun tweaking their public images, even as it's truly asking: Do people like this deserve to go to heaven or hell? The answer will crack you up and lift you up high. Grade: A . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Summer has not yet officially arrived, but the country's midsection is burning up. Denver broke a heat record Monday -- and Tuesday promises more sweltering heat. Farther east in Baltimore, a storm threw down a tornado Monday, destroying houses and causing flash flooding. And on the Gulf Coast, rip currents have killed at least four. Heat wave . On Monday, Denver broke its all-time heat record, when the temperature climbed to 99 degrees Fahrenheit, and the sun is expected to bake the Colorado capital again on Tuesday. That's nearly a cool spell for residents in parts of northern Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, where temperatures are expected to break 100 degrees. Many parts of all four states are suffering from extreme drought, and the National Weather Service has issued numerous fire weather warnings. The service warns that winds will be high, and any fires that start in the parched landscape could spread with extreme speed. Gulf drownings . Treacherous currents took at least four lives on the Alabama Gulf Coast and led Florida officials to shut down a popular beach. Dawn Wood had a friendly chat with two vacationers sitting on the beach next her in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Minutes later, she watched as one of them, a 62-year-old man, drowned, after a rip current pulled him away from the beach, CNN affiliate WPMI reported. His 13-year-old granddaughter, who was swept out with him, tried to drag him from the waves, Wood said. She didn't have the strength. Rescuers in boats rushed to save them, but ""it was just a little too late for him, unfortunately,"" Wood told WPMI. He was one of at least four who died in the currents off the Alabama coast since Sunday. In spite of the drownings and red flag warnings on the beach, people continued to swim, including small children. Two deputies from the sheriff's office in Bay County, Florida, struggled to save a swimmer who became exhausted fighting the current, after being whisked out by the waves. The county was inundated with ""water related calls"" for help Monday, eventually posting double red flag warnings on Panama City Beach, closing it to swimmers to protect them from the currents. Beachgoers entering the water in spite of the warning risk arrest. Eastern tornadoes . Thunderstorms spawned a handful of twisters in Maryland and Kentucky, destroying homes. A funnel cloud in Baltimore was caught on video and made a formidable impression on YouTube. Aside from tearing a hole in a roof of a warehouse in the city's port, it did little damage. A few miles to the west in Sykesville, the violent rumble of wind compelled Dennis Davison to have a look outside, he told CNN affiliate WBAL. He opened his front door to watch pieces of a garage ascend into the sky. ""There is no doubt in my mind that was a tornado,"" he told WBAL. The weather service confirmed two twisters in his area. Baltimore motorists gingerly cruised through streets filled with flood waters left by heavy rains, and more is in the forecast for Tuesday. Flood warnings extend from Washington, DC, up into Philadelphia and New Jersey. Racing away in his pickup truck, Steve Adair tried to outrun what may have been a tornado in southern Kentucky, according to CNN affiliate WTVF. The storm caught up with him. ""You just see a bunch of debris in the air and wind started blowing hard,"" he said, while standing in the ruins of his destroyed countryside home. ""It's just amazing to me how a little bit of wind can do all of this."" Kentucky tornado 'snuck up on us' Nearby, two elderly women hunkered down in a bathtub, while the storm destroyed their home. They survived.","Denver's new heat record pales in comparison with Oklahoma's 100 degree forecast .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations on Friday made its largest appeal ever -- for more than $5 billion -- for relief aid to Syrians across the country. ""Syria as a civilization is unraveling, with as many as half of its citizens in need of urgent help as a result of this savage conflict,"" said Antonio Guterres, the world body's high commissioner for refugees, who announced the goal in Geneva. ""The funds we are appealing for are a matter of survival for suffering Syrians, and they are essential for neighboring countries that are hosting refugees."" More than 1.6 million Syrians have fled the country since the conflict began in March 2011; another 4.25 million are estimated to have been displaced inside it. UNHCR noted that it had appealed in December for $1 billion, but increased the figure after the number of refugees exceeded predictions. The announcement came as the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs predicted that 3.45 million inside Syria could have crossed its borders by the end of the year and another 6.8 million people remaining inside Syria will need aid. That's nearly half of the nation, which has a population of 22.5 million. On Thursday, the European Union said it would contribute as much as $530 million to aid Syrians by year's end. Two days after Syrian government forces seized control of the strategically important city of Qusayr from rebel forces it describes as ""terrorists,"" the army sought to restore security and stability to surrounding villages, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Friday. ""An official source told SANA reporter that units of our armed forces are continuing their missions in pursuing the terrorists' remnants and inspecting operations,"" it said. The U.N. Security Council urged on Friday that Syrian authorities protect civilians and allow humanitarian access to the town. UNHCR said this week that it had received reports that up to 1,500 wounded civilians were trapped in the town. At least 52 people -- including three women and four children and one under torture -- were killed Friday nationwide, the rebel Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. In addition, two French journalists working for Europe1 are missing in Syria, the French radio station said Friday, prompting fears that they may have been kidnapped. Reporter Didier Francois and photographer Edouard Elias were on their way to the northwestern city of Aleppo when they went missing, the radio station said. Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that one person was killed and several were wounded in clashes in Tripoli. Deteriorating security conditions near the Golan Heights headquarters for U.N. peacekeepers in the region prompted Austria to say Thursday that it will pull out its 370 troops, more than a third of the force assigned to help keep Israel and Syria at bay. The announcement came amid fighting over the Quneitra crossing, Syria's only access point to the Golan Heights. Rebel forces first captured but then lost control of the crossing in heavy fighting. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was prepared to replace them, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported. The developments come amid longstanding concerns that the conflict could expand to other parts of the region. U.N. spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said Filipino and Indian peacekeepers will remain in the region to enforce the peace deal between Israel and Syria reached in 1974, nearly seven years after Israel first captured Quneitra in the Six-Day War. Syria retook it in 1973. Quneitra is important to the Syrian regime because it represents former President Hafez al-Assad's attempt to liberate Israeli-occupied territory. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","The world body announces its largest appeal ever: $5 billion .

"(CNN) -- The hosts of an Atlanta sports talk radio show were fired Monday after mocking a former football player who's battling Lou Gehrig's disease during their morning show. Steak Shapiro, Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini aired a spoof of former New Orleans Saints defensive back Steve Gleason, who is battling the neuromuscular disease formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The segment on their ""Mayhem in the AM"" show featured an imitation of Gleason, who speaks with the aid of an electronic voice synthesizer, telling knock-knock jokes with punchlines like ""Smother me, do me a favor."" The AM station 790 The Zone ""suspended the three individuals involved immediately following their comments and have since terminated their employment,"" Rick Mack, the station's general manager, said in a statement posted online. ""790 The Zone, our owners, sponsors and partners in no way endorse or support this kind of content. We sincerely apologize to Mr. Gleason, his family and all those touched by ALS,"" Mack wrote. There was no immediate reaction from Dimino, Shapiro or Gleason, who had just written a column for Sports Illustrated that recounted his life with ALS. But via Twitter, Cellini said he had apologized to Gleason's wife, Michel, and called the segment ""a stupid attempt at humor that backfired. Emphasis on stupid."" ""I was ignorant and it was the right thing to do. Got what I deserved,"" he wrote.","Atlanta radio station sacks ""Mayhem in the AM"" hosts .
