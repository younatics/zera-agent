My mother and my father. 'Although I am heartbroken that they will never see me graduate college, will never be there to see me get married or to be grandparents for my children, I can still have my inner peace knowing that they are now stress free in a much better place.' She said she trusted that it was all part of a bigger plan. Referring to her two teenage brothers, . she wrote: 'Now it's just me, my brothers, and betsy, and we will be just . fine with our angels watching over us...

"By . Helen Pow . A Michigan father whose wife is awaiting trial for attempting to kill herself and their autistic daughter has filed for divorce, claiming he'll never forgive her for what she did. Speaking out for the first time since the incident 10 months ago, Matt Stapleton, from Elberta, said that raising their 15-year-old Issy was hard and at one point brought the couple to 'a cracking point,' but that no parent of an autistic child should ever take such extreme measures. 'Kelli did something unspeakable,' he told People magazine of his estranged partner, Kelli Stapleton, who faces a maximum life sentence for attempted murder, with her trial beginning July 16. Can't forgive: Issy's father Matt Stapleton, right, has opened up about his wife's actions last September . 'I still love her but I'll never forgive her.' Mrs Stapleton told police that after years of physical abuse directed at her and other family members, she 'thought this would be the best solution... if Issy and her went to heaven.' She has pleaded not guilty. Mr Stapleton wrestles with his role in what happened. 'Maybe I could have done more - maybe I should have seen the signs,' he said. Issy was diagnosed as autistic at 2, and barely slept until age 8 when she began taking medication that gave her focus and allowed her parents to rest. However, when she became violent towards her classmates her parents were forced to pull her out of school, 'just for the safety of the other kids,' Mr Stapleton said. But the attacks continued at home. Mrs Stapelton was twice left unconscious by Issy's fits and her younger sister Ainsley, 13, hid in her room to avoid outbursts. Awaiting trial: Kelli Stapleton, seen in her mug shot, told police that after years of physical abuse directed at her and other family members, she 'thought this would be the best solution... if Issy and her went to heaven' Mother and child: Kelli Stapleton, left, was found alongside her daughter Isabelle, right, just hours after her husband reported them missing and they were both unconscious . The father said the family was at a complete loss as to what to do next. 'If . somebody would have called me (then) and said this horrible thing had . happened, I would not have been okay with it, but I would have . understood it,' he told People. But they finally got Issy into a residential autism treatment center in January 2013, which really helped. She was calmer and was learning how to control her fiery temper. She was at the Great Lake Center for Autism Treatment in Potage for seven months. Mrs Stapleton acted just days after Issy was released. She allegedly told her daughter they were going on a camping trip and then lit two charcoal grills in the van they were in with the windows up. Both survived after being found unconscious. 'This is not an okay act for any parent of an autistic child,' Mr Stapleton said. Doing better: Isabelle Issy Stapleton (pictured left) is now breathing, walking and talking again on her own after her mother . Kelli (right) allegedly tried to kill her . After 17 years of marriage, Mr Stapleton filed for divorce after the alleged crime, partly to show a welfare agency how he's determined to protect his children. Thankfully, both Issy and her mom recovered. Issy took some time to relearn all the things she struggled with. But both parents believe they are lucky Issy is alive. 'Kelli feels like it's a miracle that Issy's alive and that she's alive. And she is thankful,' Mr Stapleton said. As for himself, he said: 'I'm never going to complain about anything for the rest of my life.' But, now faced with caring for Issy and their other two children alone, he does want to raise awareness of the lack of support there is for autistic kids and their parents. 'We need more research, more support and more therapies to help families manage both the challenges of autism and their own stress,' he said.","Matt Stapleton, from Elberta, Michigan, said that raising their 15-year-old Issy was hard but that no parent of an autistic child should ever take such extreme measures .

"By . Helen Pow . A New York-based woman has survived being run over by three Manhattan subway trains after drunkenly falling onto the tracks. Mary Downey, 22, who lives in Woodlawn in the Bronx, escaped with nothing more than a fractured shoulder after her dance with death Sunday morning. The bleary-eyed Irish immigrant tumbled onto the tracks at the 49th Street station near Times Square at around 6 a.m. as she was making her way home from a night out. Miracle: Mary Downey, 22, pictured leaving hospital, who lives in Woodlawn in the Bronx, escaped with nothing more than a fractured shoulder after her dance with death Sunday morning . She lost her balance as she waited on the platform, breaking her shoulder on the way down moments before a northbound N train pulled in, according to The New York Post. Her injury meant Downey was unable to lift herself off the rails. But instead, in a split second, she managed to squeeze herself between the rails as the train barreled over her, avoiding being crushed to death. She may have even positioned herself between the track and the platform at one point, NYPD sources told The Post. 'She was lucky enough to have, it looks like to us, rolled to the platform and was in between the platform and the train when the train came into the station,' FDNY Battalion Chief Mike Meyers said. Authorities said she was conscious at . the bottom of the empty station as the first, second, and then third . train rolled over her oblivious. Scene: Downey was at the Times Square N train station, pictured . Drunken fall: The bleary-eyed Irish immigrant tumbled onto the tracks at the 49th Street station near Times Square at around 6 a.m. as she was making her way home from a night out . Downey was finally discovered when the third train's operator saw her hand waving for help. After initially thinking it was a piece of trash on the tracks, the subway operator ground the train to a halt but not before the third car was above her. Subway staff called 911 and emergency crews arrived to pull Downey out from under the train, police said. Covered in soot, the young woman was rushed by ambulance to hospital. But a friend of Downey's told The Post at the hospital that the busted shoulder was miraculously her only injury. 'She's doing really well,' the friend said. Downey was released just hours later in a wheelchair with her arm in a sling. She was supported by a group of friends into a cab as she wiped away tears, The Post reported.","Mary Downey, 22, who lives in Woodlawn in the Bronx, escaped with nothing more than a fractured shoulder after the incident Sunday morning .

"By . Helen Pow . A former paramedic who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman in his ambulance in Connecticut has been sentenced to 3-and-a-half years in prison. Mark Powell, 52, of North Haven was sentenced Wednesday in New Haven Superior Court. The married father agreed to the prison time and lifetime sex offender registration when he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault in April. He will also serve 10 years' probation after his release. His victim, who was 22 at the time of the assault, said in court that Powell was a 'monster' who sexually pleased himself at her expense, according to The New Haven Register. Sentenced: Mark Powell, 52, pictured, of North Haven was sentenced Wednesday in New Haven Superior Court to 3-and-a-half years in jail for the sexual assault . Prosecutors say Powell and another paramedic responded to a Hamden party early Christmas morning in 2011 to treat an unconscious and intoxicated attendee who fell and hit her head while dancing. The woman said she woke up in the ambulance and Powell was touching her in a sexual way. 'This was extreme, perverted behavior,' Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Clifford said as he imposed the sentence. Powell told police he had made 'a very bad judgment call' when he touched the woman's breasts and genitals and initially said he did so in an effort to 'elicit a response or wake the female.' He previously denied touching her at all the admitted to pinching her nipple and digitally penetrating her. On Wednesday, the victim read from a statement in court, where she was accompanied by her mother, sister and boyfriend, stating that the incident haunted her every day and had ruined Christmas for her forever. According to the Register, she called Powell 'a coward in a professional position he used to his sexual advantage.' Ambulance: Prosecutors said Powell's co-worker, a female EMT, was driving the ambulance and was unaware of what was happening in the back. The pair worked for American Medical Response, whose ambulances are pictured . On April 1, Powell pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault rather than  risk a much longer sentence if he was convicted at trial. Prosecutors said Powell's co-worker, a female EMT, was driving the ambulance and was unaware of what was happening in the back. The pair worked for American Medical Response. The driver, however, was greatly disturbed to find out about it later. The victim reported the attack three days afterward after her mother encouraged her to do so. She told police she woke during the ride when she felt her breast being rubbed and her vagina touched, according to the Register. She said she remembered screaming for Powell to stop. Clifford called the case 'baffling.' 'You're in a professional position of trust,' he told Powell. 'Your job is to treat, not sexually assault somebody.' Powell didn't get a longer sentence, he said, because the EMT had no prior criminal record and cooperated with police. Powell's lawyer, Norm Pattis, said his client's statement made the state's case and he was confused why he confessed to police.","Mark Powell, 52, a married father from North Haven, Connecticut, agreed to 3-and-a-half years prison time and lifetime sex offender registration .

"By . Richard Shears . A child rapist in Bali who repeatedly attacked a 14-year-old girl, leaving her pregnant, has had his sentence reduced... because he offered to marry his victim. Komang Aditya Pratama, 19, was jailed for just 18 months in Denpasar today despite being convicted of a crime that usually carries a prison term of up to 15 years. He was arrested in February after the family of the girl, who is now seven months pregnant, reported him to police for raping her on several . occasions last year. Anger: The decision to jail Komang Aditya Pratama for just 18 months rather than 15 years has angered women and child protection groups in Bali (pictured: a separate anti-rape protest on the island) But today judge Dewa Puspa Adnyana handed down the lenient sentence on account of his 'goodwill offer'  to marry the victim and 'be responsible for the baby' - a proposition that the girl's family has rejected. The judge also took into account the fact that he had no criminal record and had 'promised not to repeat the offense.' Adding . to further commotion in the court, a brother of the victim walked up to . the judge's table and questioned the leniency of the sentence. There . were further angry scenes when Aditya was mobbed by members of the . victim's family when he was escorted from the court to complete his . prison sentence. Lenient: The Kerobokan jail (pictured) in Denpasar is one of Indonesia's most notorious prisons. Aditya will only serve a tenth of the term Indonesian law prescribes for rapists . Women and child protection groups are outraged at the 'completely inappropriate' sentence, and have accused the judge for failing to uphold the spirit of the child protection laws. 'This is not right at all and completely inappropriate,' Siti Sapura, an activist from the Denpasar Child Protection Institute, or LPA, who has followed the case from the beginning, told the Jakarta Globe . What has stunned the activists further is the decision by the judge to break the law by allowing journalists to sit in on the case when it should have been heard behind closed doors. Before the hearing in the island's capital, Denpasar, the judge told reporters who had asked if they could cover the case: 'OK, you can stay - but don't crowd the place.' Prosecutors said they will not mount an appeal for a longer sentence.","Komang Aditya Pratama, 19, was jailed for just 18 months in Denpasar .

Officers arrived at Daniels' apartment complex around 9 a.m. Saturday responding to a call about property damage. When they were there, neighbors alerted them to Daniels' body.

"By . Helen Pow . A South Carolina widow has managed to save a piece of sidewalk that her late husband used to declared his love for her more than 52 years ago. David Hewitt scrawled an affectionate message to his wife Sissy - then Josephine Hope - on a piece of freshly poured concrete along Murray Boulevard in Charleston when they were just 12 years old. David sadly died in 2008, but his love note was recently rescued amid road work and lives on in Sissy's backyard as a symbol of the couple's enduring love. Sissy said there was an instant connection when she first met David, who lived just two doors down, at a friend's 'boy-girl party.' Saved: Sissy Hewitt looks up as she kneels next to a section of sidewalk in which David Hewitt wrote 'David + Sissy' more than 50 years ago, at her home June 2, 2014, in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. His eventual wife--and now widow--recently received the section of the sidewalk . 'I can't say it was love. I was 12,' she told Post and Courier, 'but I was totally infatuated with him.' David felt the same way, and expressed his love by writing 'David + Sissy' in the sidewalk near Limehouse Street soon after. When David left for military school in Georgia, the couple kept in touch and rekindled their romance during holidays and summer breaks. They were reunited when both attended the University of South Carolina and they married soon after graduating. Sissy and David had a baby before returning to Charleston and buying a house on Limehouse Street, just a block away from David's message. When their family grew to two children and four grandchildren, the sentimental sidewalk remained, becoming a go-to place for family pictures. Their daughter, Angie Hewitt Chakeris, told the Post Courier the story of the sidewalk is one of her earliest childhood memories. 'I remember thinking, ""Oh my gosh, you were dating when you were 12?"" That's a little crazy, isn't it?' she told the newspaper . When David Hewitt died in early 2008 after a battle with myeloma, the sidewalk took on even greater importance to the family. So when Angie drove past it recently and saw orange tape surrounding the site, her heart sank. She returned straight after work and found the sidewalk was broken but the message intact. She then contacted City Hall to see if the family could have it, and officials said 'sure' - but only if the family could move it. So Angie's brother Pitts Hewitt arranged to have a 5-inch thick chunk cut and transported to his mother's house. A grateful Sissy placed the stone between her home and garage, where she sees it every day. She told the newspaper that while she misses her husband everyday, she considers herself blessed.'How many people go their whole lives looking for someone to love? And I had that love from age 12.'","David Hewitt scrawled 'David + Sissy' on a piece of freshly poured concrete along Murray Boulevard in Charleston for a young Josephine Hope .

"By . Richard Shears . and Abu Taher . Anne Marie Drozdz, 49, was found dead in her rented villa on the holiday island of Bali on Thursday . A British woman has been discovered murdered in a Bali villa. Detectives said 49-year-old Anne-Marie Drozdz was found on the floor of a bedroom in a village near the hillside town of Ubud, a popular tourist destination . There were signs of a forced entry and a graze on the woman's neck and bruises on her mouth suggested she had been strangled. Reports from the Indonesian island suggest a construction worker has been arrested in connection with the death. She is believed to have travelled around the world teaching at international schools and, according to her LinkedIn profile, last worked in Hanoi, Vietnam. Local police chief Senior Commander Komang Arsana said a housekeeper found Miss Drozdz in the villa in Juniungan village. Detectives, he said, had taken away a piece of fabric which might have been used to strangle her. 'We can't say with any certainty that she was murdered, but it is definitely looking that way,' said Cmdr Komang. 'An initial external examination points to murder but we will know for certain after an autopsy has been carried out.' Miss Drozdz's body was taken to the Sanglah General Hospital in the Balinese capital, Denpasar, for a post mortem examination. Coroner Ida Bagus Putu Alit told the Jakarta Globe that the conclusions were that the Briton had been murdered. 'The forensics team has found a graze on the victim's neck from stranulation and there were bruises on her mouth.' Miss Drozdz, a drama graduate from Bristol University, had been in the rented villa since early May, the Jakarta Post reported, pointing out that her body had been found by an American, William Hening, the husband of the villa's owner. He had called there to deliver fresh towels to Ms Drozdz when he saw that the door appeared to have been forced open. He found Miss Drozdz lying on the floor with a black cloth covering her face, said the Post. Miss Drodz's body was discovered in a rented villa near the Junjungan village of Ubud, a popular tourist destination . Anne-Marie Drodz had been living alone in the villa since May. There were signs the property had been broken into . As well as what appeared to be strangulation marks on her neck, she was also said to have suffered multiple injuries to her body. Her death has shocked the quiet neighbourhood of upmarket villas, which are surrounded by a large expanse of rice fields. Local residents had just celebrated the religious festival of Galungan on Thursday when the news began to spread of her apparent murder. Ubud is known as Bali's cultural centre and is rarely the scene of serious crime. Detectives said the body of the woman, which was discovered by her cleaner, had strangulation marks . Forensic officers, pictured sweeping the flat, are said to have found a black cloth which may have been used to strangle her . Ubud, the nearest village to the villa, is known as Bali's cultural centre and is rarely the scene of serious crime . It was where Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall went through a ceremonial marriage in 1990 - and it was also where the 'call girl in the Commons', Pamela Bordes, went into hiding when she fled Britain in the late 1980s. A local construction worker was last night reported to have been arrested over the killing. Bali police chief Benny Mokalu speaks to journalists in the aftermath of the death, which has shocked the local community .","Anne-Marie Drozdz, 49, was discovered in the bedroom by her cleaner .

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . Shelly Sterling demanded the official lifetime title of 'Clippers'  Number 1 Fan' before she agreed to sell the basketball team, it emerged today. The bizarre clause was revealed by TMZ Sports, which got hold of the $2 billion contract between Shelly and Donald Sterling and Steve Ballmer, the team's hopeful new owner. The contract also promises Mrs Sterling 12 tickets to every Clippers home game for life. 'Buyer shall also give Shelly Sterling the title of ""Owner Emeritus"" and ""Clippers' Number 1 Fan,"" which titles she shall retain for the duration of her lifetime,' the contract reads. Making deals: Shelly Sterling demanded the title of 'Clippers' Number 1 Fan' The news comes after the Sterlings faced off as official foes for the first time today when their lawyers appeared in court as the fate of their NBA team and a landmark $2billion deal hangs in the balance. An attorney asked a probate court judge in Los Angeles to confirm Shelly Sterling's authority to sell the Clippers against the will of her husband, according to a person familiar with the matter not authorized to speak publicly and speaking on the condition of anonymity. Donald Sterling said in a statement Tuesday that he's not just fighting for the Clippers but taking a stand against the NBA, which he called 'a band of hypocrites and bullies' and 'despicable monsters' who want 'to take away our privacy rights and freedom of speech.' 'Strange estrangement': Donald and Shelly Sterling, seen together on April 19, have been separated for years but are not legally divorced and are co-owners of the LA Clippers NBA team . Donald Sterling is suing the league for $1billion. The league has sought to ban him for life since racist remarks emerged in a recording in April. Shelly Sterling brokered what would be a record-breaking $2billion deal with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to sell the team less than two weeks ago. She contends she is the sole trustee of The Sterling Family Trust, which owns the team. Donald Sterling was stripped as co-trustee after two neurologists last month determined he has dementia and is 'mentally incapacitated' under the trust's conditions, according to a person who is familiar with the trust and the medical evaluations but could not speak publicly. The relationship between Donald and Shelly is a strange one, as the long-separated married couple had a relatively peaceful partnership running the Los Angeles Clippers for years before the release of his racist recording.  One person close to them as 'a strange estrangement’. Fading: Donald Sterling's alleged mistress V. Stiviano (pictured Thursday) was the one heard on the racist recording that prompted the expected sale of the team . The aim of Shelly Sterling's court bid is to have a judge confirm provisions of the family trust to ensure the Ballmer sale moves forward without a hitch. Donald Sterling has the right to present his side at any hearing and appeal any decision. His attorney Maxwell Blecher said a representative for Donald Sterling will be at the hearing, and that the main issue to be decided is whether Donald Sterling is mentally competent. 'There isn't the slightest evidence he's incapable of managing his affairs,' Blecher said. He said the next step is to have other doctors evaluate Sterling. 'I have no doubt at the end of the day the court is not going to say he's incompetent. That's a very high burden in the probate court - otherwise people would get their sisters and wife and brother-in-laws and everybody declared incompetent.' Though both Sterlings will have their own attorneys at the hearing Wednesday and they live apart, the couple remain 'chummy,' Blecher said. 'It's what I describe to people as a strange estrangement, they don't seem at all hostile to each other, and he's very solicitous of her,' Blecher said. 'They've been married 58 years. Each threatens the other one they're going to get a divorce but they never did and never have.'","Shelly Sterling demanded the official lifetime title of 'Clippers'  Number 1 Fan' before she agreed to sell the basketball team, it emerged today .

According to state police Trooper Toby Baker, Christen Deon-Sterling Moore's throw on Sunday came up short with the football landing between two fences and not in the yard where prisoners exercise. An officer at the G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility saw the man throw the football, and he was taken into custody. No touch down: Detroit man Christen Deon-Sterling Moore, pictured, tried to throw a football loaded with heroin, marijuana, tobacco and multiple cellphones into the yard of a state prison, Michigan authorities say . The Detroit Free Press reports the ball contained heroin, marijuana, tobacco along with three cellphones and chargers. The suspect is facing possession of illegal drugs with intent to deliver, smuggling and trespassing on prison property charges. 'After observing the passenger exit the vehicle and throw the football, our officer ran towards the vehicle and drew his Taser and told the driver to stop, which he did,' said Russ Marlan, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections. Moore is charged with crimes related to delivery of heroin and marijuana and smuggling cell phones to prisoners. Each is a five-year felony. Moore has been arraigned but it was not clear whether he is free on bond. Oops: The suspect's throw on Sunday came up short with the football, pictured, landing between two fences and not in the yard where prisoners exercise . Prison: An officer at the G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility, pictured, saw the man throw the football, and he was taken into custody . 'We take very seriously the security of our prisons and will prosecute any violations of contraband that occur,' Jackson County Prosecutor Jerry Jarzynka told the Free Press. According to the newspaper corrections officers have complained that stopping manning gun towers and regular perimeter patrols at state prisons has made it easier to throw contraband over prison fences. But prison officials say random patrols are more effective when teamed with better lighting and video surveillance. 'The idea to staff these randomly came from our wardens,' Marlan said, adding that there wasn't the return on investment for continuous manning of these posts.'","Christen Deon-Sterling Moore's throw at the G.

"By . Helen Pow . A children's ministry in Alabama is under fire after it bizarrely chose to feature a quote from Adolf Hitler on a billboard. The giant billboard at the Village Mall in Auburn features five smiling children beneath a quote from Hitler that reads: 'He alone, who owns the youth, gains the future.'

Hitler's quote traces back to his controversial speeches of the 1930s, and has historically been linked to the Nazi youth programs. Mr Anderegg admitted to The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer that former U.S. President Herbert Hoover's quote about children being society's most valuable resource would have been a better choice.

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . Charged: Charles Wilkinson, pictured, 69, a retired police officer, killed his wife, 65-year-old Kathleen Wilkinson, inside their upstate New York home last week, authorities said Monday . A 69-year-old retired police officer killed his wife inside their upstate New York home last week, then spent several days with the body, authorities said Monday. A sheriff's deputy looking into the welfare of 65-year-old Kathleen Wilkinson found her body Sunday on a bedroom floor in her home in Malta, 20 miles north of Albany, Saratoga County District Attorney James Murphy III said. She was choked during a domestic dispute last week with her husband of 46 years, Charles Wilkinson, a retired officer in Long Island's Nassau County, a felony complaint states. The man spent the weekend in the house with the body before letting the deputy in after police received calls from her acquaintances saying they hadn't heard from her for several days, the prosecutor said. Friends of the woman had gone to the home, but Charles Wilkinson wouldn't let them in, Murphy said. Further details on the time and cause of death won't be determined until after an autopsy is conducted Monday afternoon, he said. However, a felony complaint filed with the town court and seen by the Daily Gazette indicates Wilkinson choked his wife to death at about 10 p.m. Friday. Sheriff's deputies were called to the house for a welfare check by the couple's adult son who lives ion the Boston area. 'The responding deputy was greeted at the door by Charles Wilkinson. After a period of discussion at the door Charles Wilkinson allowed the deputy to enter the residence at which time the deputy located the body of Kathleen Wilkinson deceased on the floor of a first-floor bedroom,' the sheriff's statement continued. They could see no obvious cause of death. Scene: Wilkinson spent the weekend in the house, pictured, with the body before letting the deputy in after police received calls from her acquaintances saying they hadn't heard from her for several days, prosecutors said . Wilkinson was charged with second-degree murder and was being held in the county jail without bail. Murphy said he didn't know whether Wilkinson had a lawyer. Authorities have yet to determine a motive for the slaying, despite lengthy interviews with Wilkinson. Wilkinson retired after 13 years with the Nassau County Police Department in 1984. He then worked as a painter and most recently as a part-time security guard at the nearby GlobalFoundries computer chip plant. The couple had lived in Malta for about 10 years and have two adult children who live in the Boston area, Murphy said. Kathleen Wilkinson worked as a teachers' aide on Long Island, but hadn't worked since the couple moved to Malta. The slaying occurred in a tidy suburban development a few miles south of Saratoga Springs. Neighbors spoke highly of the couple and said they weren't aware of any domestic issues, Murphy said. There was also no history of prior domestic violence calls to police from the home. 'We're very lucky to have very few murders,' he said. 'Certainly it's very disturbing to have it happen in a very quiet neighborhood.' Wilkinson is being held Saratoga County Jail in lieu of bail. Second degree murder carries a potential sentence of 25 years to life in prison.

"By . Helen Pow . A South Carolina family are on track to break the GoFundMe.com record after raising more than $801,000 to help find a cure for their 4-year-old daughter's rare, terminal disorder. In just a few short months, Glenn and Cara O'Neill's campaign has received enough donations to fully fund the medicine required for a clinical trial for their daughter Eliza's Sanfilippo syndrome that should hopefully take place later this year. The deadly genetic disorder means Eliza lacks an enzyme to break down heparin sulfate, which naturally occurs in cells, causing it to build up over time and resulting in a variety of medical problems. Scroll down for video .

While it's barely detectable in the little girl now, she will lose the ability to speak by her 5th birthday, and the O'Neills say she'll die before she reaches her 20s. Faced with this prospect, the caring parents took to social media to help their daughter, given funding for rare diseases is hard to come by. According to ABC News, researchers Doug McCarty and Haiyan Fu of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, have been working on a cure for the disorder that affects one in 70,000 babies. After about 16 years, they've found a gene therapy treatment that works in mice and are ready to test it in humans but they need $2 million in all to make the clinical trial happen. So close: The family are merely thousands away from breaking the GoFundMe record, which is currently at $808,845 for Boston Marathon bombing victim Jeff Bauman . Sick: The deadly genetic disorder means Eliza, pictured left, lacks an enzyme to break down heparin sulfate, which naturally occurs in cells, causing it to build up over time and resulting in a variety of medical problems . Desperate to make the most of this opportunity, Glenn O'Neill said he enlisted the help of filmmaker Benjamin Von Wong after he Googled 'how to make a viral video' and the pair shot a moving story about Eliza and her condition to launch their GoFundMe fundraiser. Now, thanks to thousands of generous strangers the world over, they have raised enough for the drugs necessary to test the treatment on Eliza and other Sanfilippo sufferers. 'The first major step towards saving our daughter is complete,' the O'Neills said in a statement yesterday. 'The medicine will be ready in December and Eliza and others like her will have the chance to get the treatment they so desperately need.' Degenerative: While it's barely detectable in the little girl now, she will lose the ability to speak by her 5th birthday, and the O'Neills say she'll die before she reaches her 20s .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Helen Pow . Police in New York City on Wednesday apprehended a man suspected of stabbing to death a 6-year-old boy and injuring his 7-year-old cousin in a savage knife attack inside a housing project elevator in Brooklyn. Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was held Wednesday night in connection with the death of Prince Joshua 'PJ' Avitto and the injuring of Mikayla Capers. Chicago Bulls power forward Taj Gibson says Prince was his cousin. Police Commissioner William Bratton, shortly before the announcement of St. Hubert's arrest, had appealed for the public's help in catching him. 'Brooklyn butcher': Police have arrested 27-year-old Daniel St Hubert out on parole for assault in the stabbings of two children in a Brooklyn elevator . Tragic: 7-year-olds Prince Joshua Avitto (left) and Mikayla Capers (right) were stabbed Sunday by an unknown assailant. Avitto died from his injuries. Capers is in critical condition . ‘We need your assistance to apprehend this individual as soon as possible,’ he said. Before the Sunday evening attack, the boy and the girl had been playing outside the Boulevard Houses under adult supervision. Relatives and witnesses said they went inside alone when they were cornered by a heavyset man in his 20s. The man used a steak knife to stab each child multiple times, police said. He fled on foot, leaving the knife outside the building, they said. Prince was found in the elevator lying in a pool of blood, Mikayla just outside the building. Police said they were investigating whether the attacker may have fatally stabbed an 18-year-old Tanaya Grant Copeland days earlier a few blocks away. A similar knife was recovered at the scene of that slaying. The 5-foot-9, 210-pound St Hubert was taken into custody just after 8pm near 145th Street and 133rd Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, less than an hour after he was publicly identified as a suspect. 'Thank you NYPD, thank you! God is good,' PJ's mother, Aricka McClinton, told DNAInfo Wednesday night. 'Prince said they were going to catch him. Last night, my angel came to me and said, ""Hold on mommy, they're going to get him, just hold on.""' St Hubert has an extensive criminal record that lists nine arrests, including for attacks on a correctional officer and a cop. Most recently, the 27-year-old was released on parole May 23 in connection to a domestic assault. Swift action: St Hubert was apprehended less than an hour after Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce spoke about the case during a news conference Wednesday . Wanted: St Hubert, pictured on NYPD posters, has been arrested at least nine times, including for attacking a police officer . The grisly knife attack cast a spotlight on the issue of surveillance cameras because none was in place to capture any images of the attacker despite funds set aside by the New York City Housing Authority to pay for them. 'We got to find this man. We all have to find this man. My baby is gone,' little Prince Joshua 'P.J.' Avitto's mother Erica sobbed Tuesday.

"By . Leesa Smith . Bali Nine convict Scott Rush will be questioned by authorities about photos that allegedly show him smoking crack cocaine behind bars in Kerobokan prison. The prison's governor Farid Junaidi says he will study the photos published by News Corp on Monday and question Rush, who is serving life for the 2005 attempt to bring 8kg of heroin from Bali into Australia. The report quotes an unnamed source who says despite the 28-year-old's claims to be clean, he regularly took meth, heroin and cocaine in the jail, which was 'like a supermarket' for drugs. Mr Junaidi claimed to be leading a crackdown on contraband drugs, but admitted it was possible that some slipped through the cracks. Scroll down for video . Photographs allegedly show Bali Nine drug trafficker Scott Rush using drugs in prison . The pictures allegedly show Rush holding and inhaling from drug paraphernalia and were taken in January . Kerobokan prison governor Farid Junaidi says he will study the photos of Rush allegedly smoking crack cocaine behind bars and question the 28 year-old over the images . 'Since the very beginning that I've been in charge here, I've started a war on drugs,' he said. 'Prisons have been bombarded by drug smuggling and it's in big quantities, but we have managed to crack down on most of it. 'Certainly it's possible that some still get away with it.' The photos were allegedly taken in January, under the governor's watch. Rush - whose death sentence was commuted to a life sentence in 2011 - moved to Karangasem jail, in Bali's east, in February. He had been requesting the move for a long time, in order to be closer to a local 'foster family' who were looking out for him. An unnamed source told the Herald Sun that the 28-year-old was smoking crack cocaine, and added he would often take drugs during late-night parties. 'He has been telling people he has been clean of drugs for ages and that just isn't true,' the source said. In June, Rush proposed to his successful London banker girlfriend who said she would only marry him if he turns his life around and is not doing any drugs. An unnamed source told the Herald Sun the 28-year-old was smoking crack cocaine, and added he would often take drugs during late-night parties . During a prison visit Rush dropped to one knee and asked 38-year-old mother-of-two Nikki Butler to marry him, more than nine years after they met for just a few hours before he was stopped with 1.3kg of heroin strapped to his body. Ms Butler had lost touch with the 28-year-old drug smuggler during his years of incarceration, but reunited with him in April after she recognised an image of him on British TV which referenced the Bali Nine. Earlier this year he became the second of the Bali nine drug couriers to be moved out of Kerobokan Prison, moving to Karangasem in Bali's far east. 'Rush was moved in February this year because he was getting beaten up and getting some serious threats over a drug debt of about $5000,' the source told the Herald Sun. Kerobokan prison is awash with drugs, particularly crystal methamphetamine and heroin, with the trade controlled by local gangs. At just 19 years of age Rush was committed to stand trial and sentenced to life in prison after his  arrest at a Denpasar airport with 1.8 kg of heroin concealed on his body. After an appeal he was given the death penalty - which was later overturned back to a life in 2011. The couple hope that sentence will be reduced to between 15 and 20 years. Earlier this year, pictures of another Bali Nine inmate, Renae Lawrence, 37, were also investigated. In the video footage, Lawrence claimed her former cell mate, Schapelle Corby, knowingly smuggled marijuana into Indonesia. Bali officials determined the video couldn't be used as evidence against Corby, who is now out on parole.

"By . Helen Pow . and Ryan Parry In Boise, Idaho . The parents of freed American POW Bowe Bergdahl have told their son they love him at a press conference in Idaho, as they reveal they haven't talked to him directly since his release because he is being debriefed by military psychologists in Germany. Bob and Jani Bergdahl teared up as they spoke of their love for the 28-year-old soldier who was held captive by the Taliban for five years as America's only POW of the war in Afghanistan. 'I love you Bowe,' his mother said Sunday afternoon in Boise. 'I'm so very proud of you and of course your large family also loves you and is proud of you. We have been working very very hard for your release these past five years, never losing hope in you or for you. 'I'm so looking forward to seeing your face and giving you a great big bear hug and holding you in my arms again never wanting to let you go,' she added. 'I will see you soon my beloved son.' Emotional: Bob and Jani Bergdahl wept as they spoke of their love for their son in another press conference . Too many to thank: Bob Bergdahl thanks the POW/MIA bikers in the back row while speaking to the media during a press conference at Gowen Field in Boise, Idaho, on Sunday . Bob Bergdahl compared Bowe to a diver coming up slowly from the depths with respect to the recovery and reintegration planned following his years spent in captivity. 'We haven't talked to Bowe yet, we haven't called him on the phone... there's a reason for that,' the father, who grew a beard and learned the Pashtun language to show solidarity to his son, said at the Boise conference. 'Bowe has been gone so long that it's going to be difficult to come back. It's like a diver who goes on a dive, if he comes back too fast it could kill him. He needs time to decompress.' Mr and Mrs Bergdahl praised the administration's handling of Bowe's release. 'The ethos no one left behind is true. You were not left behind, I told you you wouldn't be left behind but it wasn't easy you'll never know how complicated it was. We will never meet most of the people who made this happen,' Mr Bergdahl said. 'It's so big and includes so many people so there's no way we can thank them all.' The father then slipped between English and Pashtun as he addressed his son, tears welling in his eyes. Swap: Sgt Bergdahl, 28, was handed over to U.S. special forces in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees . 'Bowe I love you. I'm your father. I have written to you over and over. Can you speak English still? I hope when you hear this, and you will hear this, I hope your English is coming back. I love you, I'm so proud of you, your character, your patience, and perseverance, your cultural abilities to adapt, your language, your desire and your action to serve this country in a long and difficult war. 'But most of all, I'm so proud of your wanting to help the Afghan people. For how far you were willing to go to help them and you have succeeded. It is an amazing testimony of human endurance and gives hope for the loved ones who still have captive loved ones over the world.' The parents landed back home in Boise earlier on Sunday to make preparations for the long awaited return of their son.

A few hours after the release of American's only prisoner of war, who had been held in captivity for five years, his parents joined President Obama at the White House. The President had telephoned Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl's parents early Saturday to tell them their son was headed home. The news Saturday of Bowe's release from captivity spread quickly in his hometown of Hailey in southern Idaho, and residents immediately began making plans for a welcome-home celebration.

"That photo which led to the sacking of Cronulla Shark Tod Carney on Sunday . Sacked NRL star Todd Carney could only muster the courage to text his disappointed mother, Leanne, following his now infamous 'bubbler' incident and explain how sorry he was about that lewd image which led to his sacking at the Cronulla Sharks. Speaking with Fairfax Media, Carney said he was so upset about the impact the incident has had on his mother, that he couldn't stomach the courage to speak to her about it and instead the pair traded text messages. But it is now understood the pair have spoken for the first time since Carney's sacking on Sunday, and said he said his mother is doing 'OK.' 'I know I hurt mum, I know I hurt plenty of people, the kids who support me. I let them down,' the 29-year-old told Fairfax Media. Scroll down for video . Todd and his mother Leanne have spoken for the first time since his sacking on Sunday and his said, despite her disappointment, she is doing 'OK.' One week on from his sacking, Carney is still in training unsure of what his future holds in rugby league. His mother said he is yet to make a decision on his future, or whether he would look to pursue a career in the UK or elsewhere. But she told The Sunday Telegraph it was unlikely he would go down that path. 'No, I don't think so, but he hasn't really made any decisions regarding his future yet,' she said. Carney's contract was ripped up and his pride shot to pieces when the image of him standing at a urinal inside a Cronulla nightspot went viral on Twitter last Saturday. He was dismissed by the Sharks on Sunday after the photo of him urinating into his own mouth leaked onto social media. The 29-year-old is at a crossroads in his career and is unsure of whether he wishes to ignite a new start overseas . Write caption here . On Monday Carney spoke out about the shocking photo, explaining he didn't know it was 'out there' and hopes it doesn't end his football career. 'It’s just disappointing for something that I didn't know was out there, something that’s surfaced like this,' he told Nine News. He explained he 'felt sick' when he found out the photo, which he said was just a 'prank', was being shared across the internet. 'To receive the message on Saturday night, it’s just gut-wrenching, it made me feel sick straight away,' he said on Monday. Carney revealed he feels he's been 'betrayed' by his club after he asked for the chance to talk to his teammates and the board but was sacked before being given the opportunity to explain. Carney spoke for the first time on Channel Nine this week after coming to terms with the image that could potentially have ended his career . Todd and his mother Leanne have spoken for the first time since the 29-year-old was sacked on Sunday . Carney was a Canberra Raider and Sydney Rooster before he signed a contract with the Cronulla Sharks but all clubs terminated his tenure due to continued off-field indirections . And while news of Carney's sacking keeps reverberating off the field, on it, his former club have rallied in an inspiring come from behind win against the Sydney Roosters on Saturday night. The Sharks pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in the club's 47-year history after a hellish week that claimed their star player. The embattled side ended the week with a win against the premiers coming from 24-0 with only half an hour on the clock to triumph over the Sydney Roosters 30-28 in the boil over of the season at Sydney's Allianz Stadium on Saturday. It came not only after Carney's sensational departure, but the resignation of their coach Peter Sharp who resigned two days after. Stand-in Sharks captain Wade Graham said after the win: 'I saw some odds in the paper. What were we - 50 to one or something? It was ridiculous. No one gave us a hope.' 'The funny thing about rugby league players is that most of them have a little bit of attitude and, if you write them off, they like to step up to the mark and say I told you so. 'It was just a super effort from the boys.' Cronulla end a tumultuous week on a high with a 30-28 win over the Sydney Roosters at Allianz Stadium on Saturday .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . Pop singer Jennifer Lopez may be . thinking life is funny after some scientists gave her name to a water . mite species they discovered near Puerto Rico. Biologist Vladimir Pesic of the University of Montenegro said in an email on Wednesday that the group was entertained during its research by the music of the Bronx, New York-born artist who has Puerto Rican roots. Pesic calls it a small token of gratitude for the singer of hits such as 'I Luh Ya Papi,' 'All I Have,' and 'Ain't It Funny.' Scientists decided to name a newly discovered mite after Jennifer Lopez because they were listening to her songs while writing their scientific journal . See the resemblance? The Litarachna Lopezae has been named after Jennifer Lopez because the scientists who discovered it enjoy her music . Pesic is the corresponding author of the study published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed online journal ZooKeys. The Journal humorously states their reasoning for naming the mite after the popular Latin pop star. 'The reason behind the unusual choice of name for the new species that J.Lo's songs and videos kept the team in a continuous good mood when writing the manuscript and watching World Cup Soccer 2014,'said the lead author Vladimir Pešić, Department of Biology, University of Montenegro. He and other scientists collected the newly baptized Litarachna Lopezae water mite from a coral reef in Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Science Daily reports that nothing is known about the life cycle of the animals. The new J.Lo species was collected nearly 70 m deep. It is the greatest depth from which Pontarachnid mites have been found until now. The Science Daily reports that the Mesophotic coral ecosystems are a biodiversity hotspot for marine life--especially those named after Latin pop stars.

"By . Ruth Styles . From super-sized pastel silk to huge sprays of peacock feathers, the hats worn by racegoers arriving for the second day of racing at Glorious Goodwood were elaborate enough to impress even the choosiest of hat connoisseurs. Day two of the famous race meeting dawned sunny and bright, with racing fans rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of the Sussex Stakes which this afternoon saw Irish Guineas and St James's Palace . Stakes winner Kingman beat the hotly tipped Toronado. But even the prospect of the 'Duel on the Downs' wasn't enough to stop the ladies from vying to be noticed, with yesterday's demure fascinators giving way to huge wide-brimmed hats and ornately decorated cocktail styles.

Looking good: A lady arrives for a second day of racing in a chic green hat, while another plumps for a lavishly be-plumed black fascinator . Others plumped for more classic headwear with wide-brimmed hats in elegant pastel and caramel hues proving particularly popular, as did heavily feathered options. Although not quite hitting the sartorial heights of Ascot, Glorious Goodwood is catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the opportunity to dress up for the occasion. Like its Berkshire counterpart, Goodwood also operates a strict dress code that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress. Instead, the style guide suggests 'jackets and either ties, cravats or polo neck sweaters' for gentlemen and 'smart casual' for ladies, adding that 'due to the terrain and areas of decking at Goodwood, flat shoes are recommended'.

Racegoers certainly appeared to be taking those strictures to heart, with no sign of the wacky hats, skintight frocks and skyscraper heels that characterise other meets, most notably Aintree, although some did brave a day out in high heels. On the course, racing action got underway with the Goodwood Stakes which was taken by Irish bred gelding Teak, with Irish four-year-old Ray Ward in second place and Long Shadow in third. Race number two, the Neptune Investment Management Gordon Stakes saw Saudi Arabia's Prince Khalid ibn Abdullah return to winning ways courtesy of three-year-old colt, Snow Sky. With Kingman, another Prince Khalid steed, taking the 'Duel on the Downs' home this afternoon, today has so far proved to a red letter day for the racing obsessed royal. Another royal who could also be looking at a win today is the Queen, whose two-year-old filly Touchline is among those lining up for the Markel Insurance Maiden Fillies' Stakes. Later this week, her Gold Cup winning mare Estimate will also return to the track, just weeks after being caught up in a doping scandal traced to a bag of feed contaminated with morphine.

Nevertheless, the meeting isn't short of glamour with plenty of the big, bold, be-plumed hats of the sort seen at Berkshire's Royal Ascot and neat, nipped-in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock. As at Ascot, racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart-casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . The mysterious patient who was quarantined in New York City with symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus has been revealed to be a 27-year-old humanitarian aid worker from Brooklyn who had just returned from Sierra Leone. In an exclusive interview, Eric Silverman recounted to the New York Daily News the story of the three feverish days he spent at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital with diarrhea, a sore throat and headaches — plus the frightening feeling that he could have the untreatable and highly-infectious disease. 'It was surreal,' Silverman told the newspaper. 'Even my friends didn’t believe me when I told them I was the mystery patient. They thought I was joking.' Scare: Eric Silverman, 27, is the patient whose Ebola-like symptoms worried New York City health officials over a possible outbreak of the deadly disease here . Silverman (right) had been to Africa several times before, including a three-year Peace Corps. trip to Sierra Leone . Silverman, of Prospect Heights, was on a four-month humanitarian trip in Sierra Leona earlier this year, doing agriculture and construction work in a village not too far from where Ebola began to spread. He traveled back to New York on July 17 for his mother's birthday. Then last Sunday, just two weeks later, the symptoms began. Silverman was on the Upper West side with friends when he started shivering. 'I turned up the heat in the car to 90 degrees and drove back to Brooklyn — then I got out of the car and I was freezing again,' he told the Daily News. 'My mother took my . temperature and it was 104. When she called our family doctor, she said . to get me to the emergency room at Mount Sinai.' Silverman's mother, Sandra Schpoont, put him into a cab and they rushed to the Manhattan hospital, where they were greeted by emergency room staff wearing protective gear. At first, Silverman thought his symptoms could be a recurrence of malaria, which he contracted in February. But then on Monday, the first real scare came in. 'We have good news,' one doctor told him, according to the Daily News. 'The tests came back negative for malaria.' Silverman knew that could only mean one thing. A health worker in Sierra Leone, where Silverman feared he'd contracted Ebola, carries equipment to decontaminate clothing and equipment . Health workers in Sierra Leone screen locals for the deadly Ebola virus . 'I saw people wearing these space suits and I realized they couldn’t . rule out Ebola,' said Silverman, who next month will join Columbia University as a graduate student in international affairs, to the Daily News. 'They needed to quarantine me until . they could confirm it wasn’t.' Silverman's terrified family blocked off his room back home, just in case he'd left anything contaminated behind. 'It was a long wait — I felt really bad for Eric,' Schpoont told the Daily News. 'He was in isolation hooked up to all these monitors. Two days before he was riding his bike 40 miles around New York.” Silverman's nurse, Margaret Kraus, compared the next 72 years to the night the hospital went on overdrive to house extra patients forced to evacuate another hospital during Hurricane Sandy. 'If he had the Ebola virus, we all knew how it could impact so many people’s lives,' she told the Daily News. Then on Wednesday, the good news finally came in from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Silverman was going to be fine. 'We all had a huge sense of relief, for him and the staff,' Dr. Charles Powell, who treated Silverman, told the Daily News. 'It is a scary situation for so many reasons,' the doctor added. 'There’s a lot we don’t know, but we do know how deadly this can be. We were all worried that Ebola had arrived in New York City.'

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A pet store owner from Richland, Washington who wants to promote healthy eating for pets and their owners has vowed to only eat animal food for an entire month. Dorothy Hunter, the owner of Paws Natural Pet Emporium, didn't have time to get a snack one day while she was stocking shelves so she nibbled on a treat meant for dogs and it wasn't too shabby. 'I didn't have time to go get a snack,' she told NBC. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dorothy Hunter, co-owner of Paw's Natural Pet Emporium, shares a chicken jerky dog treat with her furry friend after vowing to eat pet food for an entire month . Dorothy Hunter claims that the treats she sells in her store meant for dogs are healthier than the average breakfast bar designed for humans . 'so I grabbed a bag of treats off the counter, and I was like, wow, you know, these read better than normal people treats. So I started eating the treats and I was like, you know, I could do this for 30 days,' she said. Hunter's been eating salmon flakes and freeze dried chicken meant for cats and dogs for a week now and she can see herself following her strictly pet-food diet for three more weeks. Dorothy says she isn't eating dog food because she prefers the taste, rather she is trying to promote health for animals and people alike. When comparing the ingredients in a breakfast bar meant for a human versus a breakfast bar meant for a pet she found that the animal treat was healthier than its human counterpart and that the ingredients were much easier to understand. She says the health benefits of eating pet food were immediately noticeable. She reported losing weight and not feeling as tired at the end of the day as she usually does. Dorothy Hunter was restocking the shelves in her store one day when she didn't have time to grab a snack so she opted for dog treats instead . Dorothy has been sharing the food with her co-workers who say that while the taste is a little dry that it's not so bad . 'My feet aren't swelling as much as they usually do after I've been on a 10 hour day,' said Dorothy. 'I have lost 2.5 pounds, which i'm not going to complain about that, but I'm not doing this to promote dog food, or to loose weight... But at the same token I want to show that I believe in our products.' She also says she doesn't mind the taste of salmon flakes and freeze dried chicken. She's even developed some favorite pet food choices. 'I've also been doing our oven baked blueberry treats, as well as freeze dried green beans, carrots,' she told NBC. 'I'm even doing some canned cat food, one is a succulent chicken, and it actually tastes really good. So I'm really happy with that one. I don't do raw bones or meat products like that, or the frozen because i'm just not into raw.' Despite only eating pet food, Dorothy says she hasn't given up on coffee and that's for the benefit pf her employees so that she doesn't fall asleep on the job. Otherwise, she'd be in the dog house.","Dorothy Hunter claims that pet food at her store is healthier than some food for humans .

"By . Ruth Styles . 'I'm wearing a shirt by Marks and Spencer and a pair of Calvin Klein jeans,' beams Eric Foreson, a trader from Ghana's capital, Accra. 'It happens like that sometimes.' But Mr Foreson's designer threads didn't come from a boutique. Instead they arrived in a batch of second-hand clothes sourced from a British charity shop. Rather than being donated to the world's poorest people, as a new BBC documentary makes clear, cast-off clothing has become a multimillion pound business - and the poor are paying. Big business: A trader in Kejeta Market in the northern town of Kumasi shows off her pile of cast-off clothes . The UK spends £60bn a year on new clothes and much of what is discarded ends up in high street charity shops. Clothes that aren't sold to shoppers go to recycling plants and from there, to Africa. Although the majority of African countries import cast-off clothing, Ghana gets the most with 30,000 tonnes arriving in capital Accra each year. Locally, it's known as 'oboni wawu' or 'dead white man clothing.' 'Oboni Wawu goes fast because it's a little bit . cheaper for the masses to afford,' explains Foreson, who owns one of the biggest wholesale businesses in Accra. 'If you have 50 Ghana Cedi (approximately £8), you can go to . the market and buy a lot of shirts,' he explains. 'If you go to the shop, you buy only one . or two shirts. People prefer to go to the market and buy the used ones.' Big business: Ghana imports 30,000 tonnes of second hand clothes each year, much of which arrives in Accra . Lucrative: Wholesalers importing second hand clothes from the UK can make up to £25,000 a day . Much of what they do buy comes from the UK. 'We used to get from Manchester,' adds Mr Foreson. 'Now we go to Leeds. We go . to Coventry. This,' he says, gesturing at a bale of clothes, 'is from Birmingham. In terms of second hand clothing, . UK stuff is the best. Many people import it more than the other stuff.' According to Ase Adu, the owner of a boutique selling upmarket second hand clothes to Accra's elite, the reason for buying British comes down to two things: size and quality. 'We prefer the smaller sizes,' he explains. 'That's why we prefer the UK over the US clothes. People like the quality. 'You can get Paul Boateng, Next, River Island Marks and Spencer, Ben Sherman. So many, many, things. Clothing is graded with buyers like Adu taking the best pieces, while second and third grade clothes are sold on - the tattiest ending up in the hands of the very poorest who buy them for as little as 25p. But while Ghana's second hand clothing boom is making some people rich, for indigenous textile producers, it has been nothing short of disastrous. Tatty: The poorest quality cast-offs end up in village markets where Ghana's least well-off buy them . Report: The BBC's Ade Adepitan met some of the traders making money from selling on charity shop clothes . End of the road: Second hand clothes trader Diana sells clothes to the poorest for as little as 25p . 'In 2009, we were producing two million . metres of cloth a month, and over that period, it's gone down by 75 per cent,' explains Steve Dutton, the Manchester-born overseer at the Akasombo Textiles factory near Lake Volta, which employs 2000 people. 'It's quite an urgent situation and we're on the brink of saying, we . can't go on.' And it's not just local textile producers that are suffering. 'Second hand . clothing brought in from the UK and America is cheaper, far cheaper,' adds Ode Bonsu, a local historian. 'We were trained, even when I was young, to believe that everything . western was civilised. Our belief and respect for our own things has . faded to the point where if we are not very careful, some day somewhere, . we will not see our own things any more. 'These . days, everybody is keeping an English name in addition to his own name. And they prefer being called their western name to their own name. 'That . alone should tell you. The food that we eat has changed. We now eat . western food as much as our own food. It is killing our culture.' Not that the traders making a killing off the back of British charitable donations care. 'It's a big and very lucrative business,' says one. 'You can make money every day. On a good day, you can make, lets say, . 100,000 Ghana cedis (£25,000). I'm telling you, this business is . very lucrative business.'

"By . Ruth Styles . Her husband might be fending off corruption allegations but even that couldn't prevent Carla Bruni from raising a smile as she joined Jared Leto and Poppy Delevigne for a cocktail party in Paris. The former French first lady was on glamorous form in a chic dark green dress and diamond necklace as she arrived for the event, thrown by jewellers Bulgari at upmarket restaurant, Apicius. There, she happily posed with Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin before settling down for a martini with Babette Djian, editor-in-chief of French fashion magazine Numéro, and actress turned princess, Clotilde Coureau. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Carla Bruni poses with Clotilde Coureau (left) and Numero editor-in-chief Babette Dijian (right) Bruni, a former model turned chanteuse, is the current face of Bulgari and has appeared in several campaigns for the jewellery brand. Despite her modelling commitments, most of Bruni's energy is currently being directed at her singing career and a world tour that has already stopped off in Vienna, Berlin, Aix-en-Provence, New York, Quebec and Los Angeles. The 46-year-old has also been spending more time with her daughter Giulia, three, who was born while her husband Nicholas Sarkozy was still president of France. Although her career is going from strength to strength, her personal life is embroiled in turmoil thanks to corruption charges filed against her husband.

Corruption . charges: Nicolas Sarkozy is driven to the financial investigation unit in Paris in a police car . Happier times: Carla Bruni and Nicholas Sarkozy pictured in Egypt in 2007 during their first months together . Mr Sarkozy, 59, was arrested and questioned for 12 hours last Thursday before being charged and released on police bail. While Mr Sarkozy's family spoke of their anger at the charges, the former supermodel remained conspicuously silent, leaving her mother Marisa Bruni Tedeschi to speak up for her diminutive husband. Ms Bruni Tedeschi said judges had ‘cut the legs’ off Mr Sarkozy, adding: ‘The real scandal is the theatrical flourish – the means and the moment chosen to bring the accusations against Nicolas.’ She added: ‘Strange that the enquiry is happening now – it’s the moment chosen which suggests a vendetta…Those who are close to him are scandalised.’ Worse still, Ms Bruni has also had to contend with front page stories claiming she and her husband are on the verge of separating, with the glossy ‘Ici Paris’ (Here, Paris) magazine running the story as a front page splash. Silent: The usually high profile Carla was once of the few members of Sarkozy's family to remain silent . Stylish company: Actor Jared Leto and model Poppy Delevigne were also at the Bulgari event in Paris . ‘Carla and Nicolas: the end of a great story’ read the headline, which was accompanied by gloomy looking pictures of the couple. An angry Mr Sarkozy has also accused judges of ‘humiliating me’ after being charged with 'active corruption', 'influence peddling', and 'violating the professional secrecy of an active judicial enquiry'. Now facing up to 10 years in prison and a £400,000 fine, he said France should not have to put up with left-wing judges who wanted to scupper his possible return to power. That, however, appears to have passed his wife by, with Ms Bruni seemingly putting her personal troubles behind her as she laughed and joked with A-listers, among them Jared Leto and Poppy Delevigne, at last night's party.

"By . Will Stewart . The controversy over the death of Boris Berezovsky took a bizarre new twist today as the president of Belarus appeared to claim the tycoon might still be alive. Asked if he believed the Russian mogul, a prominent enemy of Vladimir Putin, was dead, Alexander Lukashenko replied: 'Absolutely not. Ab-so-lu-te-ly not'. Exile Berezovsky's inquest in Berkshire last month found that he had died in March 2013 aged 67 after suffering a ligature wound to his neck in a bathroom at his ex-wife's luxury property in Ascot. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko appeared to question the death of Boris Berezovsky on television . While evidence pointed towards suicide by hanging, the coroner Peter Bedford returned an open verdict arguing he could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the colourful former billionaire either took his own life or was unlawfully killed. In a new interview with a Russian TV channel, Lukashenko - who personally knew Berezovsky - said: 'He so much loved to live, he loved life. 'And not only a good life - he was ready to live anywhere, in a cave, in a den, as long as he could live.' He appeared to dismiss suggestions that 'someone' was involved in his death or that 'he hanged himself, as people say now'. Told by interviewer Ksenia Sobchak - a family friend of Putin's - that 'a lot' of people do not believe in Berezovsky's death, Lukashenko said succintly: 'I am one of them.' Revealing that Berezovsky had made secret visits to Belarus apparently with Russia's knowledge - despite Moscow seeking his extradition from his safe haven in London - the Belarus leader, dubbed Europe's 'last dictator' said: 'He could not commit suicide.' The body of Boris Berezovsky was found in a bathroom at his ex-wife's property in Ascot . The home of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky in Ascot last year when it was under police guard following his unexplained sudden death . Berezovsky was said to be a 'broken man' after losing a £3 billion London court battle with fellow Russian moneyman Roman Abramovich (pictured) in 2012 . He stressed: 'I am absolutely sure. No-one can change my mind about it, because I know it. 'I know this man, every cell of him. He was not the kind of man who could have done it.' Intriguingly, the normally reclusive Lukashenko suggested he knew more but refused to give details on camera, though he discounted claims that Russian secret services were involved in Berezovsky's fate. Speculation has swirled around suggestions that Berezovsky could have been murdered by a Russian hit squad, while the Moscow media has claimed MI6 could have made him disappear. Berezovsky was a prominent enemy of Vladimir Putin (pictured) Lukashenko said that when they met he assured Berezovsky he would not hand him over to the Kremlin, though isolated Belarus is economically dependent on Russia. 'I will certainly not surrender a Jew who has come to our country,' said the president, who claimed the tycoon liked to travel to Belarus to 'embrace the white birch tree' he associated with his Russian homeland which he could no longer visit. On one trip, believed to be in 2008, he said Berezovsky had come to Minsk with his British friend Lord Bell, former political confidante and PR guru to Margaret Thatcher. Coroner Mr Bedford told the Windsor inquest: 'I am not saying Mr Berezovsky took his own life, I am not saying Mr Berezovsky was unlawfully killed. 'What I am saying is that the burden of proof sets such a high standard it is impossible for me to say.' The tycoon was said to be a 'broken man' after losing a £3 billion London court battle with fellow Russian moneyman Roman Abramovich in 2012. A key Kremlin insider under Boris Yeltsin, Berezovsky fled Russia after being a key player in Putin's rise to the presidency. He inquest heard Berezovsky - who had survived two assassination attempts - fell into a deep depression after the court case. The coroner said: 'It is clear to me and the witnesses I have heard that it had a significant effect not only on his finances but also on his mental health.' Police did not find any evidence of foul play. Forensics experts declared he died at his own hands but a professor called by the family to give evidence claimed his wounds meant he could have been strangled.","Belarus president appeared to question death of Boris Berezovsky .

"By . Associated Press . and Michael Zennie . A raging wildfire in central Washington has wiped nearly half of a small town off the map - destroying 100 homes as it whips out of control across 260 square miles of dry forest. The Carlton Complex fire grew by nearly ten times today as four fires merged into one and exploded into a horrific frenzy. Firefighters dumped tankers full of fire retardant and tried to slow the fast-moving blaze, but were mostly helpless to protect home that got in the way of the flames. 'Mother Nature is winning here,' said Okanogan County Fire District Chief Don Waller told the Wenatchee World. 'I don’t like to lose structures. It truly bothers me. But there is nothing we can do about this.' At least 95 houses were destroyed in and around Pateros, Washington, a small community of 650 people and 279 homes. Authorities had ordered an evacuation of the town as the wildfire neared, fearing that it would destroyed. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: Firefighters say 95 homes in tiny Pateros, Washington, were destroyed by the Carlton Complex fire that whipped through the town on Friday. There are only 276 homes in the entire community . Before: This is how the neighborhood looked before the wildfire blew through and leveled dozens of houses on Friday . Heartbreaking: Emma Franco, center, is consoled after she lost her mobile home in Pateros, Washington, on Friday. Nearly half the town was destroyed by the wildfire . A couple survey the burned out wreckage of what once was their home. Now, only the chimney remains. Entire blocked were leveled by the blaze . A losing battle: Despite the valiant efforts of firefighters, the blaze whipped out of control and remained zero percent contained on Friday . An aerial photo of the town shows entire blocks leveled - reduced to charred ash. Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers said late Thursday he's heard of no injuries from the Carlton Complex of wildfires. The sheriff issued his highest evacuation notice Thursday for Pateros, a town along the Columbia River.  Residents drove south to Chelan. A hospital in nearby Brewster was evacuated as a precaution, with the patients sent to Omak. 'The whole town was evacuated,' Rogers said in a telephone interview as he drove the eight-mile stretch between Brewster and Pateros. 'It was a chaotic mess but we got everybody on the highway.' 'There's nobody in Pateros' except a few 'stragglers' who stayed, he said, adding the fire was burning in the town, although the small business district was believed intact. Rogers said perhaps 15 to 20 homes have burned in Pateros and another 20 homes in the Twisp-Winthrop area. He had no estimate of how many homes have burned in the entire county of about 40,000 people. The situation in Brewster, population about 2,400, was 'pretty good,' Rogers said. 'It looks like Brewster's OK.' A law enforcement officer in the county for 30 years, and sheriff for 12, Rogers said this fire is the worst he's seen. All of his officers are working and help is coming from nearby Chelan and Douglas counties. Four wildfires converged into a single, massive blaze on Friday and immediately grew nearly ten times bigger - engulfing 260 square miles . Firefighters tried to suppress the spread of the blaze with air-drops of flame retardant - but to little avail . Nearly all 650 residents of the town were evacuated ahead of the fire. So far no casualties have been reported . With Lake Chelan, Washington, in the foreground, a large plume of smoke and steam rises from just south of Pateros Friday morning from the Carlton Complex Fire . 'Hold on,' he said as he drove, 'I've gotta go through a little bit of fire.' He said the fire had jumped U.S. Highway 97 between Brewster and Pateros and was burning along the Columbia.  Sections of several highways were closed in the county. Early Friday, the Okanogan County Sheriff's dispatch office said the roughly 300 residents of the Chiliwist Valley, about 15 miles north of Pateros, evacuated late Thursday night. Two major power lines, one feeding Pateros and one feeding Winthrop and Twisp, have burned, causing a widespread power outage in the county, said Scott Miller, the county's emergency manager. The Carlton Complex of fires has burned across at least 28 square miles of the scenic Methow Valley.  Fire spokesmen were not able to provide updated acreage Thursday night. There is zero containment on the complex, one of two major wildfires burning in central Washington. 'Our personnel have been so busy they're not able to get back to us quickly,' fire spokesman Tim Perciful said from an incident command post where the electricity was out due to the fire. For Friday's fire fight, 'We're trying to get more state resources,' Perciful said. About 100 miles to the south, the Chiwaukum Creek Fire chased people from nearly 900 homes as it burned near the Bavarian-themed village of Leavenworth. That fire sent a light dusting of ash over Leavenworth, where the German-style motif provides a backdrop to Oktoberfest and a Christmas tree lighting festival. The fire's smoke plume rose 25,000 feet into the air. The blaze closed 15 miles of U.S. Highway 2 in the area. 'There's a huge cloud of smoke above us,' Don Hurst, a retired firefighter who lives just outside of Leavenworth, said Thursday morning. 'The winds started to pick up a little. It's just like snowfall here with the ash coming down. It's fine ash. We're getting all this ash fall.' The fire destroyed a church - along with nearly 100 houses .

Another 800 homes were less seriously threatened. Authorities said Thursday that the Chiwaukum Creek Fire has grown to more than 10 square miles. It was first detected Tuesday. 'The weather and winds are not in our favor,' said fire spokeswoman Mary Bean. Temperatures have been in the triple digits with winds gusting as high as 30 mph. She said the cause of the fire is under investigation. About 1,000 firefighters were fighting blazes around the state that included the Mills Canyon Fire, the state's largest at 35 square miles. Worsening wildfire activity has prompted the governor's offices in both Washington and Oregon to declare states of emergency, a move that allows state officials to call up the National Guard. Elsewhere across the West: . OREGON: Two different lightning-sparked wildfires grew quickly in hot and dry conditions in central Oregon on Thursday, prompting evacuation alerts. Authorities said the Bridge 99 fire in the Cascade Range 20 miles north of Sisters tripled in size and threatened rural homes along the Metolius River. A top-level evacuation advisory urged residents to leave their homes immediately. In the Ochoco Mountains about 20 miles east of Prineville, the Bailey Butte Fire grew after getting into heavy timber in a wilderness area, prompting the Crook County Sheriff's office to advise residents of 27 homes to leave. The evacuation area included the Mount Bachelor Academy, which was shut down by the state in 2009 amid allegations it mistreated troubled teens. U.S. Highway 26 remained closed at the Ochoco Summit near Mitchell. They were among 13 large fires burning across Oregon. UTAH: A wildfire encroaching on homes in the Tooele County town of Stockton had burned about 200 acres. Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands spokesman Jason Curry said the fire burned part of a water tower but it's believed no homes have been destroyed. A 27-year-old Tooele man has been arrested on charges that he ignited the fire with matches. Police said the suspect, Timothy West, was a volunteer firefighter for the town several years ago, Curry told The Salt Lake Tribune. IDAHO: In central Idaho, the lightning-caused Preacher Fire has scorched more than 50 square miles, burning quickly through grass and brush. More than 300 personnel have been called in to suppress a wildfire inside the Boise National Forest that tripled in size overnight and is steadily spreading.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Four Syrian men were publicly executed by jihadist militants in an Iraqi town for allegedly spying for President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Rebels fighting for the Islamic State (ISIS) brought the men to a main street in Al-Qaim, near Iraq's border with Syria, in a convoy of trucks on Sunday, witnesses said. One militant then announced that they were spies for Assad's regime, which ISIS is fighting in Syria, and the men, with their hands bound, were shot dead one by one. A Kurdish Peshmerga fighter stands guard as new equipment arrives at the Kalak refinery in Irbil, Iraq, as the Kurds try to ease a fuel shortage after ISIS militants laid siege to Iraq's largest oil refinery in the city of Beiji . Their bodies were taken away by ambulance and Dr Mustafa Shawqi from the Al-Qaim hospital confirmed the deaths, according to the AFP news agency. The report came as the Iraqi army launched a fresh assault today to try to retake the militant-held northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, according to an officer and a soldier involved in the attack. The executions are the latest reportedly carried out in Iraq and Syria by ISIS militants who have gleefully documented their killings online with grisly photos of their victims, including some who have been beheaded. Militants seized control of Al-Qaim last month during a major jihadist-led offensive that has overrun swathes of five provinces north and west of Baghdad. A Shi'ite volunteer from brigades loyal to radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr keeps guard as he mans a machine gun during a military advance against ISIS on the outskirts of Samarra . According to the UN refugee agency, there are more than 4,500 Syrian refugees in Iraq's Anbar province, many of them at a camp near Al-Qaim. The new assault by Iraq's army on Tikrit is the latest attempt to re-capture the city, which fell on June 12 to Sunni insurgents led by the extremist Islamic State group. The army has been saying for two weeks that its forces are on the outskirts of the city. Tikrit lies 160km (100 miles) north of Baghdad. It is a stronghold of loyalists of toppled dictator Saddam Hussein and ex-army officers who joined forces with Islamic State to take over large parts of north and west Iraq last month. Baghdad municipality workers clean the site of a car bomb in the Allawi neighborhood. Shi'ite militias are now fighting ISIS alongside the Iraqi army, but there have been few notable victories for the government . An officer and a soldier said the military attacked from the village of Awja, some 8km south of the city. The army retook Awja, the birthplace of Saddam, on the night of July 3, and has been trying to push north since. Heavy fighting broke out in the Shishin district of southern Tikrit, they said. Government forces retreated when Sunni insurgents overran Mosul on June 10 and swept south to seize Tikrit two days later. Shi'ite militias are now fighting alongside soldiers and police, but there have been few notable victories for government forces since they began a campaign late last month to seize back territory.","ISIS militants shot men in street in rebel-held town on Syrian border .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Wisconsin couple has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against a popular caregiver website they had used to hire a nanny accused of killing their infant daughter. A lawsuit filed by Nathan and Reggan Koopmeiners in Kenosha County Circuit Court names both the company, Care.com, and nanny Sarah Gumm as defendants. Gumm, 35, is jailed in Lake County, Illinois, where she is charged with first-degree murder in the 2012 death of 3-month-old Rylan Koopmeiners. Caregiver: Nanny Sarah Gumm, 35 (left), has been named in a wrongful death lawsuit while awaiting trial on a first-degree murder charge in the 2012 beating death of 3-month-old Rylan Koopmeiners (right) Finger of blame: The parents' lawsuit alleges that  Care.com failed to reveal that Gumm had a record, including two citations for drunken driving and a battery incident . The woman stands accused of causing a head injury that resulted in the baby's death at her home in Waukegan, Illinois. The Koopmeiners allege Care.com, based out of Waltham, Massachusetts, failed to reveal that Gumm had a court record, including two citations for drunken driving and a battery incident - even though they paid for the highest level of background check available on the site. Care.com issued a statement in response to a request for comment. ‘While we remain deeply saddened by these events, we cannot comment on matters of ongoing litigation,’ the company said. However, a representative of the online business has challenged the Koopmeinerses' claim that they had ordered a background check on Gumm, telling HLN-TV that the couple did not take advantage of the service. The wrongful death lawsuit alleges Gumm was drunk when the baby's head injury occurred. The child suffered a skull fracture and cranial hemorrhaging and died July 27, 2012, from blunt force trauma, according to an autopsy. Crime scene: Gumm was looking after the three-month-old girl at her home in the 1100 block of O'Farrell Lane in Waukegan on July 27, 2012 . Kenosha News reported that the family are seeking monetary damages for medical and funeral expenses, pain and suffering, and loss of companionship, claiming that they would not have hired Gumm had it not been for the alleged negligence of Care.com. Gumm's attorney Jed Stone said he understands why the Koopmeiners would ‘thrash about’ looking for justice, but said Gumm did not intentionally cause the baby's death. ‘The loss of a child is unimaginable. The loss of an infant child is heartbreakingly unimaginable,’ Stone said Friday. But that doesn't mean Gumm is a killer, he added. Defense: Gumm's lawyer has insisted that his 'loving and caring' client had no intention of harming baby Rylan . In August 2012, Gumm was charged with killing baby Rylan by slamming her head down on a wooden table when the child started squirming around while being changed. Nathan and Reggan Koopmeiners dropped their daughter off at Gumm’s home in the 1100 block of O'Farrell Lane in Waukegan at about 6.45am on July 27, 2012. At about 4.30pm, the baby sitter called police and reported that the little girl was not breathing. She was rushed to Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, where she was pronounced dead shortly after 5pm, according to prosecutors. Gumm had initially told police that the three-month-old had been sleeping when she heard a ‘gurgling noise’ and noticed that the baby seemed to be in distress, prompting the caregiver to call 911. During an interview with police in August of that year, Ms Gumm allegedly admitted to causing Rylan's injuries because the little girl was getting fussy and the woman became frustrated with her. The baby’s parents, who have three other children, hired Gumm six weeks prior to the tragic incident after seeing an advertisement for her services on Care.com. The nanny's lawyer said this week that he is in ongoing discussions to resolve the criminal case short of a trial in September. In a statement, Jed Stone called his client a 'loving and caring person' who had no intention of hurting Rylan in any way.","Sarah Gumm, 35, charged with first-degree murder in the 2012 death of three-month-old Rylan Koopermeiners .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ed Miliband was under fire today after his shadow cabinet colleague Ed Balls admitted he shared the 'frustration' of Labour's policy chief Jon Cruddas - who was caught attacking the 'dead hand' controlling the party from the centre. Mr Cruddas, who is leading a review of Labour's policies ahead of the next election, was recorded attacking the party's leadership for blocking reforms and warned that the 'clock's ticking' before voters go to the polls in May. Speaking this morning, Mr Balls - Labour's shadow chancellor - said he 'understood' Mr Cruddas's concerns. Ed Miliband's policy chief Jon Cruddas (left) has been caught criticising Labour's 'cynical' policy announcements. This morning, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he 'understood' his remarks . But the shadow cabinet heavyweight insisted Mr Cruddas was frustrated with the way Labour's policies were reported in the media - rather than with Labour's leadership. In comments leaked to the Sunday Times, Mr Cruddas told left-wing pressure group Compass: 'We set up independent review to rethink social policy, economic policy, democracy, local government - they come up with ideas and they're just parked, parked. Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure after a secret recording of his chief policy advisor were leaked today . 'There is all sorts of creativity alongside a profound dead hand at the centre. I'd love to say why we don't just appropriate this idea or that idea - but honestly it ain't going to happen at the moment, even though the clock's ticking, with a profoundly important general election.' He said ideas were being replaced with 'cynical nuggets of policy to chime with our focus groups and press strategy'. This morning Mr Balls appeared to back Mr Cruddas's remarks. He said: 'I understand Jon Cruddas' frustration about a newspaper headline. 'We've all been in a situation where a big report or a big speech is reduced down to just one policy.' He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'Jon Cruddas, with me and Ed and others, has been working for months, years, on big reforms. They are going to come out in the next few months, people will see the policy review he has led has been a big deal. 'One aspect of that is saying if we're going to have growth and jobs, not just in London and the south east - four fifths of the new jobs have been in London since 2010 - we've got to have more devolution of power to our cities and our county regions.' Mr Balls added: 'He is part of the Labour centre and we are all working together on these big reforms,"" adding: ""I talked to Jon a couple of days ago. He's not frustrated, he is excited about his policy agenda.' Tory party chairman Grant Shapps Mr Cruddas's remarks showed that Mr Miliband was 'a weak leader of a divided party'. Mr Shapps said: 'He's just not up to it. Labour are not serious about fixing the welfare system. 'Even Ed Miliband's own policy chief attacks Labour as having ""no interesting ideas"". It shows Ed Miliband has no plan to secure our country's future.' The dominance of Labour's leading families needs to be challenged, the party's policy chief has claimed. Jon Cruddas said power needed to be taken away from Westminster and its 'power elites'. He pointed to the families which 'control' the Labour party and help their sons and daughters into Parliament. The remarks are seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the party's 'Red Princes' - including Neil and Glenys Kinnock’s son, Stephen, and Jack Straw’s son, Will, who are both fighting seats at the next election. Tony Blair's son Euan and Lord Prescott's son David are also thought to considering bids for Parliament. Frontbenchers Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper are married - as well as Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman and the shadow policing minister Jack Dromey. Mr Cruddas said: 'There’s a story about this week about certain families reproducing their control over the Labour party through inheritance of seats.' He called for Labour to devolve power to local people. 'That means dispersal out of Westminster, and out of the centrifugal power elites that run it.'","Labour MP Jon Cruddas leading review of Labour's policies ahead of election .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The NHS could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase health spending, senior MPs have warned. Former Conservative Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell called on David Cameron to boost the NHS budget as the economy recovered to avoid a crisis. He was joined by the new chair of the Health Select Committee, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who warned that it was 'hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service'  if spending was not increased. Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, meanwhile said that the NHS needed an extra £15 billion  over the next five years 'if you don't want the system to collapse during the course of the next parliament'. Conservative former Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell and the new Health Select Committee chair Sarah Wollaston have called for an increase in spending on the NHS . The warnings come amid growing concern in the Government over the pressure on A&E departments. The NHS says 299,031 patients arrived at A&E departments last week – the highest number on record. Emergency waiting time targets were missed for the 49th consecutive week and a record number of beds were filled last month by patients who could not be released from hospital, often because community or social care services were not in place. The NHS must receive a real terms increase in spending over the next five years if it is to function properly, the three senior MPs claimed. For the past four years, the government has ringfenced the health service budget from cuts and raised its funding only in line with inflation. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said David Cameron's decision to introduce far-reaching reforms of the NHS had been his 'biggest mistake by far' But amid growing demand for treatment and a growing elderly population, the health service has been forced to find £30 billion in 'efficiency savings'. Mr Dorrell, who claimed that the challenge to make £30 billion worth of efficiency savings had failed, said he would be ashamed if the NHS budget did not receive a boost in income at a time when the economy was growing. He said: 'I am in favour of the government not denying what 5,000 years of history tells us is true, which is that every time a society gets richer it spends a rising share of its income on looking after the sick and the vulnerable. Mrs Wollaston, a GP for 20 years before becoming an MP in 2010, said: 'If there is not an increase, it is hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service given the rising demand. 'The NHS budget has been protected in line with background inflation but that does not keep pace with inflation in health costs from rising demand and demographic changes. 'I don't want to see any reduction in services; I would like to see further improvements and that will require an increase in funding.' Chris Ham, chief executive of the health thinktank, the King's Fund, and a former Downing Street adviser, warned of another NHS disaster on the scale of the Mid Staffordshire scandal if more money is not found. He said: 'The well-publicised failures of care at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation were caused by precisely this kind of cost cutting, with tragic consequences for the families concerned."" The NHS is looking likely to be a key battleground at the general election. This week a private member's bill will be introduced to repeal the Coalition's controversial health and social care act, which ushered in greater private sector involvement in the NHS. The bill, which will be put forward by Clive Efford MP and debated in November, would scrap the rules which force companies to compete to provide health services. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed the vote on the bill would 'without doubt be the defining moment of what remains of this parliament'. He added: 'Cameron's biggest mistake by far is his decision to break the coalition agreement promise of ""no top-down reorganisation of the NHS"".'","Lib Dem former health minister Paul Burstow said NHS needs extra £15bn .

"By . David Williams . and Ian Drury . Two British servicemen have been withdrawn from the frontline while military chiefs investigate apparently damning photographs showing airmen posing beside the bloodstained body of a Taliban fighter. In one graphic picture a grinning serviceman crouches beside the body lying in the sand and dirt while giving the thumbs up - trails of blood apparently from the man's wounds beside him. Other disturbing photographs show the bodies of other Taliban fighters and there were concerns last night that the images could be used for recruitment and propaganda by the Taliban in the months leading up to the withdrawal of UK forces from Afghanistan later this year. Shocking: The images, uploaded to the LiveLeak website, purportedly show a member of the RAF posing over a dead Taliban fighter . 'Serious breach': It is against RAF rules to treat the bodies of enemies with disrespect. It is not clear whether the soldier pictured is the same as in the previous frame . Last night an Afghan veteran described . them as 'grotesque' and said the apparent 'stupidity' of the servicemen . had handed the Taliban 'a tool to beat us with.' 'This may have been taken as a ""souvenir"" but it is contrary to all instructions, it will go round the world on the internet and twisted so it comes back to haunt the reputation of the military after all the good we have done in Afghanistan.' The photographs were taken in the aftermath of a daring Taliban attack on the main British base at Camp Bastion in September 2012 while Prince Harry was deployed in Afghanistan to fly Apache attack helicopters. A group of 15 Taliban fighters wearing stolen US military uniforms crept towards Camp Bastion which was ringed by a 30ft wire fence. They cut through the wire and destroyed planes, vehicles and equipment. A three-hour gun battle raged involving 50 British troops, some of whom won medals for bravery. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops - eight US and eight British - injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield, setting off explosions which destroyed six Harrier jump jets and three vehicles. As well as the coalition casualties, 14 Taliban were killed. The surviving gunman was captured. It is two of these Taliban bodies and the subsequent actions of two members of the RAF Regiment - the ground fighting force of the Royal Air Force - tasked with guarding bases that is now at the centre of the hugely sensitive inquiry. The images, which also show an US Marine Corps Harrier burnt and destroyed in a gutted hanger, first appeared on website LiveLeak. The Ministry of Defence said they came to its attention last month and military police were investigating. Two of the photographs appear to show British airmen giving the thumbs up but it is unclear whether it is the same man. Corpses: The graphic footage shows the Taliban fighters dead on the ground. It is thought they were involved in a 2012 attack on Camp Bastion . Probe: Military police are investigating the incident. Two RAF members have been withdrawn from frontline duties . Defence officials said last night there is no excuse for such behaviour, which appears to break military rules. An RAF spokesman said it had a 'zero-tolerance policy on the mistreatment of deceased enemy personnel' and this case was being treated 'extremely seriously'. 'We can confirm that the incident is currently subject to an ongoing RAF Police investigation and therefore, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,' he added. The photographs emerged just months after Sergeant Alexander Blackman was convicted of executing a seriously-wounded Taliban prisoner when video footage taken on a colleague's head camera. The 39-year-old - known as Marine A at his trial - blasted the captive in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol in a 'moment of madness' on the battlefield. Controversially, he is serving a minimum of 10 years in prison after becoming the first UK serviceman to be found guilty of murder in a warzone since at least the Second World War. Blackman, from Taunton, Somerset, killed the injured insurgent following a fierce firefight on September 15, 2011. The captive had been hurt by cannon fire from an Apache helicopter after an attack on a British base in Helmand. Recordings from a helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade captured the moments when Blackman shot the prisoner and told him: 'Shuffle off this mortal coil, you ****.' Last month a damning report by MPs said blunders by British commanders were 'devastatingly exploited' by the Taliban to allow them to carry out the raid at Bastion. Attack: The footage, uploaded to the LiveLeak video site, also shows a destroyed United States Marine Corps Harrier fighter jet in its hangar . Wreckage: The footage seems to relate to the September 2012 attack . It found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years. The latest scandal comes amid concerns that the pull out of British troops could spark a series of legal claims for compensation by the families of Afghans who claim to have been mistreated by UK forces. Human rights lawyers are representing more than 1,500 Iraqis who claim they are the victims of British abuse following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. The vast majority of claims are being brought by two UK law firms - Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day - who are paid huge sums of taxpayers' money. Public Interest Lawyers, founded by Birmingham-based lawyer Phil Shiner, fought a legal challenge which led to the then Labour government setting up the Al Sweady Inquiry in 2009. The inquiry is examining allegations that British troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others at Camp Abu Naji near Basra in May 2004. It followed a ferocious firefight with insurgents dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, named after a checkpoint. But after a year-long hearing costing taxpayers £23million, the case sensationally fell apart last month APR when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in a central claim - that insurgents were murdered. It was claimed that Iraqis had conspired to claim that British troops executed and tortured prisoners to secure huge compensation pay outs.","Images seem to show aftermath of attack on Camp Bastion, Afghanistan .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Toy makers were today urged to make chemistry and building sets more appealing to girls in a drive to get more women into science. Women's minister Jenny Willott met with toy shop bosses and manufacturers as part of a drive to boost those number of girls taking physics and maths qualifications. Ministers claim the focus on girls-only toys risks deterring young women from breaking into male-dominated - and lucrative - professions including science, mathematics and engineering. Labour MP Chi Onwurah fears the focus on so-called 'girls toys' will deter a generation of you g women from perusing a career in science and engineering . The way toys are packaged and marketed towards boys will be looked at following today's meeting, the Government said. Ms Willott said: 'Today was an important first step in looking at how well made well marketed toys can encourage girls to take an interest in science and engineering - traditionally male dominated territory. 'Today we agreed to work together to look at customers' attitudes to toys and the choices they make in buying them.' Toy shops and manufacturers have faced criticism for dictating which products are aimed at girls and boys. Examples include a Science Museum toy kit labelled for boys while Sports Direct faced a backlash for selling  miniature dustpans and brushes branded ‘girls stuff’. Labour MP Chi Onwurah said: ‘This aggressive gender segregation is a consequence of big company marketing tactics.’ She accused manufacturers of pushing blue toys at boys and pink for girls to charge a ‘premium’ for things like Princess saddles and Action Man handlebars on bicycles. It also makes it more difficult for toys, bikes and clothes to be passed on to friends and relatives if they are gender-specific. Responding to the debate in February this year, Ms Willott said the focus on pink-only toys means 'we don't encourage girls to believe in their own potential'. She added: 'The way we play as children informs the skills we develop and girls and boys take the assumptions they have when playing into the classroom.'Boys who are confidence about designing and building things with Lego are more likely to pursue jobs in architecture, physics and maths, she said. 'Girls feel less confidence and it is a small step to assuming they are less skilled in those subjects.' Education minister Elizabeth Truss has said companies marketing chemistry sets only at boys was the ‘antithesis of what we want to promote’ in the state school system. Business Minister Jenny Willott warned pink toys make girls think they are not good at subjects which involve designing and building while Labour MP Chi Onwurah said firms used pink and blue to increase profits . Avalanche of pink: A comparison by campaign group Let Toys Be Toys shows how in the Seventies, left, toys were in a variety of colours while today girls are pushed to embrace one shade .

"By . David Williams . and Ian Drury . Captured: A solider, his face obscured for legal reasons, guards an Iraqi . Taxpayers face a bill of more than £31million for the public inquiry focused on false allegations that British troops murdered Iraqi prisoners of war and mutilated their bodies. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond yesterday disclosed the enlarged estimate of the cost of the controversial Al-Sweady inquiry. It came seven weeks after lawyers representing Iraqi families withdrew their central claim that soldiers had killed unarmed civilians. At that stage, the cost was given officially at £23million, but Mr Hammond said in a Parliamentary answer that it was now expected to reach £31.1million – more than four times the figure for the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war itself. Almost a quarter of the overall figure is for barristers’ and other legal fees, with £2.8million going to Birmingham solicitor Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers. The firm represented Iraqi detainees and their families, some of whose evidence was discredited and said to have been ‘fabricated’. Last night Iraq veteran Colonel Tim Collins, whose Royal Irish troops played a pivotal role in capturing Basra, condemned the action. ‘It is right and proper that the British Army is held to high standards, but the allegations that have been brought are tenuous at best,’ he said. ‘It is an abuse of the system. The only losers are justice and the taxpayer.’ The collapse of the central claims at the inquiry will focus new scrutiny on the cases of more than 1,500 Iraqis who claim they are the victims of British abuse and who are being represented by PIL. Many of the cases are understood to be paid for by the taxpayer. No breakdown of the latest estimate given by Mr Hammond is available, but figures released at the end of April showed the cost was £23,149,476, with the largest bill – £7,077,422 – being for investigative and other expert services. Investigators, including 12 former Scotland Yard detectives, were paid as much as £1,000 a day to probe the unfounded allegations. Iraq veteran Colonel Tim Collins, pictured, whose Royal Irish troops played a pivotal role in capturing Basra, condemned the action and said 'the only losers are justice and the taxpayer' They travelled on business class flights, staying in five-star hotels in the Middle East, so they could interview potential witnesses. Barristers’ and other legal costs were £5,131,108. It is ten years today since the firefight – known as the Battle of Danny Boy after a British checkpoint near Majar al-Kabir, north of Basra – that sparked the allegations at the centre of the Al-Sweady inquiry. It took its name from Hameed Al-Sweady, 19, an Iraqi allegedly killed by British troops. Around 100 insurgents ambushed a patrol of British soldiers and during a three-hour battle 28 Iraqis were said to have been killed and several soldiers injured, none fatally. It led to claims that 20 or more Iraqis taken prisoner during the battle were murdered and their bodies mutilated, and that nine others were tortured. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured, has disclosed the enlarged estimate of the cost of the controversial Al-Sweady inquiry . But the case made to the inquiry sensationally fell apart when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in the central claim – that insurgents were murdered and their bodies mutilated. It provoked outrage that British troops were accused of the most serious crimes by publicly-funded lawyers. Lawyers for the troops and Ministry of Defence said accusations of war crimes were ‘manifestly untrue’. Iraqi witnesses ‘dishonestly’ fabricated claims because of an ‘ulterior motive in the form of financial compensation’, they claimed. But lawyers for the Iraqis said there were still numerous ‘grave’ claims of abuse to consider. The inquiry is also looking at allegations of abuse, torture and mistreatment of the nine Iraqis by UK forces. After sitting for more than 42 weeks it has finished hearing evidence and is expected to report by the end of the year. A spokesman for the inquiry said it is ‘focused on obtaining value for money’. She added: ‘It was the investigators doing such an extensive job that led to these claims being withdrawn.’","£31m bill for inquiry on false allegations troops murdered Iraqi prisoners .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . This is the moment helmet-clad robbers on mopeds raided one of the UK's most exclusive hotels before escaping with a six-figure haul of jewellery. Three men are seen entering the Dorchester Hotel's revolving doors in Park Lane just after 1.30am yesterday morning, in CCTV images released by the Metropolitan Police today. The trio used sledgehammers to smash five glass display cases, stealing high-value watches and jewellery, while three accomplices are seen on the footage waiting outside on mopeds. Heist: Helmet-clad robbers carrying sledgehammers are seen on CCTV making their way through the revolving doors of the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair as they carry out a smash-and-grab raid at 1.33am . In and out in a flash: A third robber follows close behind before joining the other two in smashing display cabinets and stealing jewellery and watches worth tens of thousands of pounds from the foyer . Getaway gang: In one of three images made public by the police, the other three men are seen waiting outside as their accomplices plunder the display cabinets inside . In the wake of the heist, which police . said was well-planned and lasted just minutes, the thieves managed to . shake off pursuing officers just over a mile away in Shaftesbury Avenue. One of the bikes hit a . 25-year-old woman in Cambridge Circus as the gang fled, leaving her with . leg injuries that required hospital treatment. The glass presentation cabinets were in the main lobby, just beyond the reception and next to lifts to some of the hotel rooms. One of them contained Brequet and Hublot watches which are worth anything between £6,500 and £31,700 a piece. The . gang also broke into one cabinet that contained jewellery by high-end . American designer Harry Winston who has a flagship store on London's New . Bond Street. Raid: Six robbers on mopeds have stolen watches and jewellery worth thousands from the five-star Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair (above) after smashing display cabinets with sledgehammers in an early-hours heist . Other jewellery in several untouched cabinets were pieces made by Faberge. Detective Constable Alex Flanagan said police are hopeful that releasing the images will help move the investigation forward. 'We are in the early stages of our investigation and I would like to hear from anyone who was on Park Lane or nearby who may have seen the robbery or the men making their escape,' said Dc Flanagan. 'Likewise I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident that took place in Cambridge Circus. 'This was a well planned and thought through robbery and there may be people who know who is responsible and I am keen for those with any information no matter how small to come forward and assist us with our investigation.' High-value targets: One of display cabinets smashed contained Harry Winston jewellery like this (file picture) A guest, who declined to be named, yesterday told how all traces of the raid had been swept out of view by the time he went for breakfast mid-morning. He said: 'They must have dealt with it pretty swiftly to keep us all happy, it's quite a shock. 'They've usually got some very expensive jewellery and watches just 20 metres in but that's all covered at the moment. 'There are a load of cabinets draped with sheeting, but it's discrete and unless you knew what was behind there you'd walk right past it without knowing. 'If the gang managed to get away with anything they'd be laughing, there are Brequet and Hublot watches in those cabinets - and they cost thousands.' Scene: The route the robbers took through central London before shaking off the police . The usual complement of luxury cars . were parked outside the entrance, including an orange McLaren, a black . Ferrari and a purple Bentley coupe glinting in the sun. The . hotel's security and risk manager, Andy Sloan, stood reassuringly at . the entrance, although those arriving would be hard-pressed to spot any . signs of the violent robbery as they walked into the cool atrium. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Dorchester said: 'We can confirm that there was an incident at the hotel last night in which showcases were damaged. The hotel security team were quick to respond and the matter is now in the hands of the police. 'As ever, the comfort and security of our guests and employees remains our top priority.' This follows a number of similar robberies that have taken place in London’s West End, where thieves have arrived on bikes and tried to smash their way in to jewellery stores. Masked raiders struck at the Dorchester in 2002 stealing £1million worth of jewellery in a similar robbery.","CCTV images show trio entering five-star hotel's revolving doors at 1.30am .

"By . David Williams . and Ian Drury . Hundreds of British troops are set to be sent to Nigeria to help local forces in their war with Al Qaeda-linked terrorists holding nearly 300 schoolgirls hostage. Details of the planned deployment emerged as Nigerian officials claimed they now know where the girls are being held but warned any rescue attempt could lead to them being killed by the fanatical Islamist Boko Haram. Air Marshal Alex Badeh, Nigeria's Chief of Defence Staff, said : 'The good news for the parents of the girls is that we know where they are…but where they are held, can we go there with force? We can't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back.' A still taken from a video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network shows the missing girls. A top Nigerian military official says the authorities know where the girls are, but cannot move in over fears for their safety . He refused to elaborate but negotiation has been continuing through third parties and it emerged yesterday a swap deal had been set-up to free around 50 of the hostages last week in exchange for 100 Boko Haram prisoners but this was blocked at the last minute by President Goodwill Jonathan. With Nigeria's military said to be demoralised and outgunned in the face of Boko Haram, plans have been drawn-up for UK soldiers to be flown to West Africa to provide specialist training to Nigerian forces as part of a package of assistance provided by the British government to tackle the threat posed by the increasingly bold militia. Both ministers and military chiefs in London have yet to sanction the plans being put forward by senior officers attached to the specialist UK team sent to Nigerian capital Abuja following the kidnap by the Islamist gunmen of the schoolgirls in April from a school in the north of the country. Officials stress the troops would not be involved directly in the hunt for the girls or take an active role in any military action against Boko Haram which has carried out a series of devastating bombings across Nigeria. Boko Haram  leader Abubakar Shekau offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners, which was declined by the Nigerian government . The UK government is said to be anxious to give the Nigerian administration of President Jonathan help in providing security against the terrorists without committing any UK troops to 'high risk' deployments such as the hunt for the girls or placing them in a position where they could be drawn in to fighting the well-armed Boko Haram gunmen. Britain, France and the United States already have Special Forces, anti-terror experts and specialists in hostage negotiation in Nigeria helping to pinpoint where the girls - abducted at gunpoint from their school at Chibok in Borno province on April 14 – are being held. Pressure: Goodluck Jonathan at the Paris Summit for Security in Nigeria . Britain, the US and France have been using aerial surveillance, satellite intercepts and evesdropping on telephone calls made between suspected representatives of the kidnappers and their supporters to track the movements of Boko Haram gunmen. The girls, who were mainly Christian, are thought to be held in the vast Sambisa forest reserve, which is three times the size of Wales, close to the border with Chad and Cameroon. Their plight has led to an international social media campaign to free them spearheaded by Michelle Obama and backed by politicians and celebrities, including David Cameron, Angelina Jolie and Leona Lewis. Mr Cameron along with the US and France have all made a priority of helping to improve security in the region - Chad, Niger, Benin and Cameroon have all experienced problems from Islamist extremists. It is to help with security that Britain is considering sending a 'Short Term Training Team' to Nigeria where troops have complained of being 'no match' for Boko Haram, who have threatened to sell the girls into slavery in neighbouring countries. Soldiers in the north say they have been issued with just 60 bullets and are said to be demoralised following a number of attacks by the extremists with dozens defecting to the terrorist's own ranks. Nigerian troops have complained they are not properly paid, are dumped in dangerous bush with no supplies and that the Boko Haram extremists holding the girls are better equipped than they are. Some soldiers have said officers enriching themselves off the defence budget have no interest in halting the five-year-old uprising that has killed thousands. The military also is accused of killing thousands of detainees held illegally in their barracks, some by shooting, some by torture and many starved to death or asphyxiated in overcrowded cells. The role of a British force would be to help restore morale and train elements of the Nigerian army in how to track and fight Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is forbidden' in the local Hausa language. Until recently Britain had a training facility in West Africa in Ghana where UK military instructors trained west African countries in readiness for their deployments with the African Union on a project called Exercise African Winds. A Royal Marine Training team from 45 Commando deployed earlier this year in Nigeria and Cameroon. Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, said: 'There is no doubt that the Nigerian forces can benefit from training and advice provided by the British Army, who are unrivalled in their expertise at countering Islamist terrorism. 'There are close ties between Nigeria and Britain dating back to the days when the country was a British colony, and both armies have long enjoyed mutual respect. 'As well as supporting a close friend in Africa, this task is also in our national security interests as there is considerable cooperation between national and regional Islamist terrorist groups and Al Qaeda, which sometimes increase the threat to our country and other Western nations.' Last year the French spearheaded an operation against extremists in northern Mali and they are expected to head any military operation against Boko Haram with UK and American special forces personnel directing Nigerian troops. A Boko Haram video has shown some of the kidnapped girls reciting Quranic verses in Arabic and two of them explaining why they had converted from Christianity to Islam in captivity. Unverified reports have indicated two may have died of snake bites, that some have been forced to marry their abductors and that some may have been taken across borders into Chad and Cameroon.","Top Nigerian military official says they cannot attempt a rescue operation .

"By . David Williams . A lethal new weapon that can fire a shell at seven times the speed of sound has been successfully tested on land. Described as ‘Star Wars technology’ by researchers, such a device has belonged solely to the world of science fiction for decades. But now it is close to a reality with sea trials on a US warship planned in two years. Scroll down for video . Using electromagnetic energy, the gun can fire a shell weighing 10kg at up to 5,400mph over 100 miles – with such force and accuracy it penetrates three concrete walls or six half-inch thick steel plates. Two prototypes of the weapon have been developed for the US Navy – one by British arms manufacturer BAE Systems and the second by a US firm. Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, head of US Naval Research, said the futuristic electromagnetic railgun – so called because it fires from two parallel rails – had already undergone extensive testing on land. Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, head of US . Naval Research, said the futuristic electromagnetic railgun – so called . because it fires from two parallel rails – had already undergone . extensive testing on land . It will be mounted on high-speed vessel the USNS Millinocket for sea trials in 2016. ‘It’s now reality and it’s not science fiction,’ Admiral Klunder said. ‘It’s firing. An electromagnetic railgun is a gun that uses just electricity – no gun powder – and … can shoot a projectile well over 100 miles at Mach 7. Energetic weapons, such as EM railguns, are the future of naval combat.’ Electromagnetic launchers were one of the areas researched by Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defence Initiative, nicknamed ‘Star Wars’ after the science fiction film franchise. Admiral Klunder added: ‘It will help us in air defence, it will help us in cruise missile defence, it will help us in ballistic missile defence … we’re also talking about a gun that’s going to shoot a projectile that’s about one one-hundredth of the cost of an existing missile system today. ‘It … will give our adversaries a huge moment of pause to go, “Do I even want to go engage a naval ship?”.’ The weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with the menacing Latin motto 'I, who am speed, eradicate' Warships can carry dozens of conventional missiles, which cost around £600,000 each, but could be loaded with hundreds of railgun projectiles, at only £15,000 each. The weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with the menacing Latin motto ‘I, who am speed, eradicate’. Using an electromagnetic force known as the Lorenz Force, the gun accelerates a projectile between two rails that conduct electricity, before launching it at ferocious speed. This means the railgun can fire further than conventional guns and maintain enough kinetic energy to inflict tremendous damage. Railguns were first conceived of nearly a century ago and patented by French inventor Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplee. Nazi Germany took up the research during the Second World War to adapt its anti-aircraft guns. The first sea trials of the new railguns will take place in 2016 aboard high-speed vessel the USNS Millinocket (artist's impression above)","Technology is close to reality with sea trials on US warship planned in two years .

"By . Tim Shipman . and David Williams . The European Union was accused of ‘appeasement’ last night as Crimea opted to join Russia – and the EU failed to get tough with Vladimir Putin. David Cameron persuaded fellow leaders to agree a three stage regime of punishments for Moscow – but it fell far short of the ‘serious consequences’ promised this week. The EU will immediately suspend talks on a new visa regime with Russia, abandon plans for the G8 summit and ditch plans for a new partnership deal between Russia and the EU – but none of them hurts President Putin now and all three had been floated in advance. Appeasement: EU leaders have been accused of being too soft on Russia as it ramps up war games over the Ukraine crisis. Pictured: Ukrainian riot police block pro-Russian activists in Donetsk, Ukraine, yesterday . Scuffles: Pro-Russians tackle Ukrainian police yesterday. Russian TV has claimed Crimea is part of its country . Anger: Topless activists demonstrate against Russian intervention in Ukraine yesterday in New York . Action: The U.S., with Secretary of State John Kerry, has sent fighter jets to protect the Baltic states . And last night the US sent fighter jets to protect the Baltic republics after warnings from former Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili - whose country was invaded in 2005 – that Putin would strike there next. He said: ‘It will not stop here. If Mr Putin succeeds he will go after the Baltic countries next. The EU and Nato need to act now. They should consider the full range of options, from economic sanctions to military deterrence.’ Serious: Cameron has held emergency talks with Barack Obama, but this 'selfie' was widely mocked . The American government yesterday announced asset freezes and travel bans against Putin’s henchmen who led the invasion. But EU leaders said they would only move to those tactics if Russia refuses talks with Ukrainian leaders – and then failed to impose a deadline, saying economic sanctions and a crackdown on Russian financiers would only happen if Putin seizes the rest of Eastern Ukraine. British officials credited Mr Cameron and Polish premier Donald Tusk with persuading a reluctant German Chancellor Angela Merkel to consider asset freezes and travel bans in the future. But even Mr Cameron admitted: ‘It is not as much as some people would want but we have made some progress.’ His own officials were withering about the EU’s timidity. A senior official in London compared the EU’s failure to act to the appeasement of Hitler at Munich in 1938 and the reluctance to upset Russia in the Yalta summit at the end of the Second World which gave the Soviet Union a free rein in Eastern Europe. The source told the Mail: ‘Brussels – now twinned with Yalta and Munich.’ The EU leaders appeared to have been caught on the hop as the Crimea’s puppet Parliament voted unanimously for the province to leave Ukraine and join Russia. President Putin is now backing a referendum in Crimea on March 16 - tantamount to annexing the province. Maps on at least one Russian TV station yesterday showed the peninsula as being part of Russian territory, not of Ukraine. A senior official said that if the referendum goes ahead, all state property would be ‘nationalised’, the Russian rouble could be adopted and Ukrainian troops would be treated as occupiers and forced to surrender or leave.

"By . David Williams . and Martin Jay . in Beirut . An extremist cleric linked to Al Qaeda bomb plots in London was on the run in Lebanon last night. Omar Bakri Mohammad, who is barred from Britain, is wanted over sectarian violence that has cost at least 30 lives. The Syrian-born radical is suspected of masterminding a series of car bombings and violent clashes in Tripoli on the Lebanese coast. On the run: Hate preacher Omar Bakri has fled his home in Tripoli, northern Lebanon, after it was raided by authorities looking to arrest him in connection with terrorism . British intelligence officers are said . to be helping the hunt for the 55-year-old, who once described the . London suicide bombers of 2005 as the ‘fantastic four’. Michael Adebolajo, the fanatical killer of soldier Lee Rigby at Woolwich, is an associate from his 20 years living in London. Bakri . founded the radical al-Muhajiroun group in Tottenham, North London, . which is said to have inspired and helped prepare attacks in the UK. He . moved to Lebanon in 2005 when anti-terrorist officers began . investigating his activities. Although he denies any connection to . atrocities in Britain, he recently admitted that a UK fighter in Syria, . who blew himself up in a suicide truck bombing, had been his driver . here. The Lebanese . authorities said Bakri, who holds Syrian and Lebanese nationality, was . wanted on charges relating to endangering national security. Security . forces in Tripoli are cracking down on those involved in the clashes . between the Sunni majority and minority Alawite community in the . northern city. Lebanese army soldiers patrol the streets of the Sunni neighbourhood of Bab Tabbaneh and the neighbouring Jabal Mohsen, which is mostly populated by followers of the Alawite sect, in the northern port city of Tripoli . The two communities are deeply divided over the war in . neighbouring Syria, where they back different sides. Syria’s president . Bashar al-Assad is an Alawite and members of the Shia sect occupy key . positions in the government and security forces. The . Lebanese army said it arrested 75 people during yesterday’s operation . in Tripoli, which saw troops moving into the main conflict areas – the . Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbana and the neighbouring Alawite district . of Jabal Muhsin. But when the soldiers stormed Bakri’s three-bedroomed . home in the city centre, they found that he had already fled. The . house was said to have been under surveillance for months and Bakri is . suspected of being tipped off that he was about to be arrested. He . has strongly denied any links to the unrest in Lebanon and claims he . derives a living from selling CDs of his Islamic sermons on holy war.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Town Halls could be legally forced to empty black bins every week, under plans being considered by the Tories. The move follows revelations that more than five million families have lost weekly bin collections since the Government came to power - despite a pledge to stop the slide to fortnightly pick ups. Under proposals being considered by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles councils will be required to meet a 'minimum service standard' when it comes to waste collection. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has called weekly bin collections a 'funadamental right' - because it stops rubbish building up like this in Liverpool . Ministers have decided to act after a series of measures designed to stop councils axing weekly collections failed. Half of councils have switched to fortnightly collections - rejecting a £250million Government bribe introduced in 2012 to encourage them to maintain their weekly service. And earlier this year Mr Pickles issued a 'bin bible' to try to stop councils from axing weekly rubbish collections. The Tory Communities Secretary said the guidance - issued to all local authorities - exposed the false claims made by council 'bin barons' to justify scaling back services. And two years ago, Mr Pickles even claimed that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘fundamental right'. But cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch. At least 60 councils have introduced a fortnightly waste collection since May 2010. By the time of the election next year, 18.5million families will have lost weekly bin rounds. Mr Pickles has now decided to force councils to change their policy by making it a legal requirement to collect people's black bins every week, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The Local Government Secretary said: 'The UK Government will continue to standing up for hard working people who deserve a decent bin service. 'One option being considered by the Conservatives is the introduction of a minimum service standard, which would reinstate the previous legal requirement for councils to collect rubbish weekly.' Doretta Cocks, the founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collection, said: 'This news is most welcome and our Campaign members will be delighted. 'As councils are now seeking to reduce general refuse collections to once every three or four weeks, legislation is obviously necessary to prevent them from doing so. Weekly collections are essential, especially in summer months.' But Labour's shadow local government secretary Hilary Benn said: 'Eric Pickles has already announced that he wants to bring back weekly collections and he has totally failed to do so while wasting a quarter of a billion pounds of taxpayers money in the process. 'He should let local councils work out what works best for their residents and stop trying to tell them what to do, especially when it would be more expensive for council tax payers.' A spokesman for the Local Government Association added: 'Our own polling shows the vast majority - about 80 per cent - of people are happy with the way their bins are collected. 'Satisfaction rates are broadly the same regardless of whether people have weekly or alternate weekly collections.'

Police say the father and his long-time girlfriend, who share custody of the boy, began fighting in the early hours of Monday morning. The 10-year-old grew concerned about his mother's safety and found a 9mm handgun inside the house about 3:30am. 'He stated that he picked up a gun and it accidentally went off at that time,"" said Captain Nick Kyriacou, of the Detroit PD, according to WJBK.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . The slow growth in wages in Britain may be the result of people being reluctant to leave their secure jobs, The Bank of England is expected to report this week. Economists believe workers are not seeing the benefits of higher starting wages as they are too scared to abandon employment they see as being safe. It comes after a survey revealed British firms expect average wage rises to track inflation and remain weak for at least another year. The Bank of England is expected to report that the slow growth in wages in Britain may be the result of people being too afraid to leave their secure jobs . Research by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) suggested the Bank of England may be forced to hold off on any interest rate rise until as late as next summer. Official data showed regular pay for employees grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months to May, according to the Office for National Statistics. That was less than half the rate of inflation and the slowest growth in regular pay since records began in 2001. According to The Daily Telegraph, in the last three months of 2013, just 0.75 per cent of those in work resigned to move jobs – half the figure recorded in December 2007. Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the Ernst & Young, told the newspaper: ‘The improving economy should give employees more confidence to look for better job opportunities, rather than sticking with the status quo. Bank of England governor Mark Carney, pictured, has warned that average wages rises will be a significant factor in any decision to start raising interest rates from their current historic low . ‘This may trigger some upward movement in pay growth as employers seek to discourage experienced staff from moving by offering them more money.’ The CIPD undertook a survey of personnel managers which found most private sector employers expect average wage rises in the year to June 2015 to be in the region of two per cent. That represents a slight fall from the previous year, when average wages were expected to rise by 2.5 per cent, it said. The Bank of England is concerned about raising rates while pay struggles to keep up with inflation. It would also mean that average wage rises were only just keeping pace with consumer price inflation, which economists expect to be a touch below the Bank of England’s two per cent target rate until the middle of next year, meaning that in real terms wages are likely to have barely increased at all. The latest UK labour market report will be released on Wednesday, at the same time as the Bank of England publishes its latest quarterly inflation outlook for the UK economy. The Bank's wage inflation forecasts are likely to be the main focus for attention as they are likely to give the best indication of when interest rates may begin to rise. Bank governor Mark Carney has warned that average wages rises will be a significant factor in any decision to start raising interest rates from their current historic low of 0.5 per cent.","Workers' fear over leaving secure jobs could be behind slow wage growth .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Women with a spare tyre around the middle are three times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, say experts. And men with bulging waistlines are in bigger trouble – with a fivefold increase in risk. The danger zones are above 40 inches for men or 34.7 for women. Scroll down for video . Women with a spare tyre around the middle are three times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, say experts . The importance of keeping middle-age spread in check to avoid the health hazards of diabetes is highlighted in a report from Public Health England. Nine out of ten adults with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese and rates of both obesity and diabetes are on the increase. Around 100 Britons each week have a limb amputated as a result of diabetes, and diabetic eye disease is one of the main causes of preventable blindness among adults. According to the report, women with a waist between 31 and a half inches and 34 and a half are at higher risk of diabetes than those below the lower threshold. At more than 34.7inches (88cm), they are at very high risk and three times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Men who have a waist circumference of 37 inches to 40 inches (94cm to 102cm) are at higher risk, which rises to five times the risk above 40 inches. The report underlines how abdominal fat – extra weight carried around the middle – is particularly risky to health. It is thought that fat packed around the organs in the abdomen is more dangerous than fat on the hips because it is ‘metabolically active’, releasing more of the inflammatory, toxic chemicals that raise the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Surveys have found that only one in eight people know the correct method of calculating waist size, which involves measuring at the midpoint between their ribs and the top of the hips. Eating nuts may help to combat type 2 diabetes . Eating nuts may help to combat type 2 diabetes. Two servings of tree nuts a day appears to lower and stabilise blood sugar levels in people with the disease, according to evidence collected from 12 clinical trials. Tree nuts cover most types including walnuts, cashews, hazelnuts and pecans, but exclude peanuts. A single serving was defined as 30 grams. The best results from analysing data on 450 trial participants were seen when nuts replaced refined carbohydrates rather than saturated fats. Dr John Sievenpiper from St Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who led the study, said: ‘Tree nuts are another way people can maintain healthy blood sugar levels in the context of a healthy dietary pattern.’ While nuts are high in fat, it is of the healthier unsaturated variety. Although nuts can be high in calories, trial participants did not gain weight. There are 3.8million people in the UK with all types of diabetes. By 2030 the total of adults affected is projected to rise to 4.6million, or 9.5 per cent of the adult population. The disease costs the NHS £10billion per year. Barbara Young, chief executive at Diabetes UK, said the report highlights ‘how the increasing numbers of us who are overweight is fuelling an epidemic of type 2 diabetes’. She added: ‘This is an epidemic that looks likely to get even worse and if this happens then the impact on the nation’s health would be devastating. ‘We need the Government to focus much more on preventing type 2 diabetes. It needs to ensure the NHS Health Check is properly rolled out and that those it identifies as being at high risk of type 2 are given support to make lifestyle changes. ‘It also needs to urgently consider making healthy food more accessible through taxation, other financial measures and more robust regulation of the food industry.’ Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ‘The key to reducing diabetes is losing weight which can be achieved through a healthy diet and being more active.’ A guide on how to measure your waist is at: www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/849.aspx .","Women with spare tyre around middle more likely to develop type 2 diabetes .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Fertility scientists have found a new way to identify embryos that will implant in the womb which could boost IVF success rates by up to 50 per cent. The presence of high levels of DNA from energy-producing cells in the embryo is a signal that it will fail to implant and produce a pregnancy, according to researchers from Oxford University. They found a threshold, or cut-off point, below which embryos could be guaranteed to implant, and above which some failed to do so. The Oxford group investigated whether the amount of mitochondrial DNA found in early-stage embryos analysed in the laboratory affected the chances of it implanting after transfer to the womb . Each year in Britain, clinics carry out about 60,000 IVF treatments but many couples remain childless, often because the embryo fails to implant in the womb. This can occur if the embryo is carrying genetic defects, or even if it appears to be healthy. It is thought the new finding may explain around one in three implantation failures. Research scientist Dr Elpida Fragouli, of the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Oxford, and Reprogenetics UK, a specialist group of fertility scientists, said the discovery meant it could be a ‘new independent biomarker of embryo viability’, helping doctors to choose the embryos most likely to result in pregnancy. She said most IVF clinics had success rates of 20-30 per cent of women having a baby after  treatment. Each year in Britain, clinics carry out about 60,000 IVF treatments but many couples remain childless, often because the embryo fails to implant in the womb (file photo) This figure could rise to 40 per cent after pre-implantation genetic screening of the egg or embryo for chromosome abnormalities that are a major cause of miscarriages and conditions such as Down syndrome. She said ‘We believe that adding this biomarker to the process will increase those rates to 50 or 60 per cent. ‘It’s very easy to do, it only takes a couple of hours, and although we haven’t worked out a price yet it will be very cheap, just a few pounds.’ She said four or five clinics in the UK and Spain were already using the technique free as part of their screening in return for data that could lead to commercial development of a test. Studies into the technique have not yet been published in a scientific journal but were presented for the first time at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Munich. The Oxford group investigated whether the amount of mitochondrial DNA found in early-stage embryos analysed in the laboratory affected the chances of it implanting after transfer to the womb. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is genetic material found in the tiny power packs of the cells, or mitochondria, which is contributed by the woman. The team of international experts led by Dr Fragouli took biopsies from 392 embryos at the five day stage of development when mtDNA levels start rising, generated by couples at eight clinics. They also looked at 87 women aged around 38 where the embryo was transferred to the womb, resulting in 44 pregnancies and 48 failures to implant. The findings showed high levels of mtDNA in embryos carrying genetic defects and those from older women, especially those over 40. The team found healthy embryos capable of implanting in the womb tended to have lower levels of mtDNA than those failing to implant. Most importantly, they could establish a threshold of mtDNA quantity below which implantation was certain. Altogether 30 per cent of healthy embryos that failed to implant had quantities of mtDNA above this threshold, while 100 per cent of healthy embryos that produced a pregnancy had levels below it. Dr Fragouli said it was not clear why high levels of mtDNA should affect implantation, although they are a sign that the embryo may be under stress. ‘It suggests there may be a problem, not necessarily in the chromosomes, and extra energy is needed to correct the problem, but it is not really fixable’ said Dr Fragouli.","Each year in Britain, clinics carry out about 60,000 IVF treatments .

Junior doctors will be encouraged to work longer hours by opting out of the European Working Time Directive, the Government has said (file picture) Junior doctors will be encouraged to work longer hours by opting out of the European Working Time Directive, the Government has announced. It says greater flexibility is needed to boost training time for young doctors – some of whom spend almost six fewer working weeks in training than in the past. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he accepted recommendations from an independent taskforce which found European restrictions on the working week have led to cancelled operations and clinics. Patients often see four or five different doctors a day because of shift patterns, while juniors are getting less hands on experience than in the past. EU law limits doctors to a 48-hour week in order to stop long working weeks of 70 or 80 hours or more in the NHS. More than 90 per cent of juniors now work shifts, usually 12 hours in length, but they must have rest periods to make up for being on call overnight, even if they are asleep. As a result, clinics and outpatient appointments are regularly cancelled as there are not enough doctors to take them. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) found junior surgeons today will have lost out on 128 days of training by the time they qualify. The taskforce, overseen by RCS president Professor Norman Williams, recommended in April that doctors should be encouraged to opt out of restricted hours and given extra training away from wards. Junior doctors are allowed to opt out of the directive, fully implemented in 2011, but many trusts discourage the practice because they are reluctant to pay overtime. Trainees say they feel forced to break the rules in order to become good consultants or falsify time sheets. The Department of Health says it will . explore ways to encourage more widespread use of the individual opt-out . ‘where it is safe to do so’. Health Secretary: Jeremy Hunt (pictured) said he accepted recommendations from an independent taskforce which found European restrictions on the working week have led to cancelled operations and clinics . Mr Hunt said ‘We will never go back to the past with tired doctors working long hours, but it is clear that the Directive does have a negative impact on the training of doctors in some specialities. ‘We will now look at how training and working time could be separately identified so we can give doctors the flexibility they need.’ However, Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association Council, said ‘No one wants a return to the days where doctors were working dangerously long hours, and it’s important that the government has recognised the Working Time Directive has been key in bringing doctors’ hours down to safe levels. ‘We have to remember that the work and training of junior doctors are inseparable. This leads to unique pressures that can’t be resolved just by increasing working hours. ‘Having the right degree of flexibility in the system is important, but we must not create a culture in which doctors feel pressured into opting out of the 48 hour weekly limit that protects patients.’","Junior doctors encouraged to opt out of European Working Time Directive .

An NHS hospital was forced to pay £1,800 for a nurse to cover a Bank Holiday shift, a shock investigation has revealed (stock image) An NHS hospital was forced to pay £1,800 for a nurse to cover a Bank Holiday shift, a shock investigation has revealed. Another trust paid an astonishing £2,500 to an agency for a locum doctor to work the same day. The statistics, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, come at a time when the NHS is under increasing financial pressure. They reveal the extent to which short-staffed hospitals are relying on locums to get through public holidays. Many cost up to £150 an hour – as in the case of the nurse hired for £1,800. In one hospital, half of the doctors who worked on May 5 were locums, according to the investigation by Sky News. Almost a third of the nursing staff at another trust were supplied by a private agency. Experts warn that using locums who are not familiar with the hospitals they are working in can put patients at risk. They are demanding a review of the rates of pay given to private agencies. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘These figures are truly shocking. Many (of the nurses) will never have been to that ward before and will probably never be there again. ‘It says nothing about continuity of care. Even finding your way around the ward, the geography, it makes life really difficult. 'Agency nurses do not provide good value for money…and the employers who use these extraordinary levels should be held to account for it.’ Hospitals turn to external agency workers at critical times, such as when A&E use peaks over bank holidays and when staff are off sick. But critics say better organised trusts which have higher staffing levels per patient are less reliant on them. The 48-hour working week restrictions introduced under European law in August 2009 also pushed up annual spending on locum doctors, especially in hospitals providing 24-hour acute care. Dr Carter said hospitals were being ‘held over a barrel’ by locum agencies. ‘This is public money that is not being well spent,’ he added. ‘This is something that should be looked at with the utmost urgency.’ Eighty of the 150 NHS trusts in England contacted by Sky News supplied information on how many locums they employed and at what rates on May 5. University Hospitals Bristol, which runs Bristol Royal Infirmary (pictured) paid £1,800 for a nurse on a shift of just over 12 hours, an investigation has revealed . At the Heart of England trust in the West Midlands, half of the doctors working that day were temporary, the figures show. At Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals almost a third of nurses were from a private agency. There was a similar proportion of agency nurses at Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals in Berkshire. The figures also show that hospitals are paying huge sums to cover key shifts. University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay paid an agency £2,500 for a locum doctor to work a single shift. Seven weeks later, it was rated as inadequate in an inspection by the Care Quality Commission and placed in special measures. University Hospitals Bristol paid £1,800 for a nurse on a shift of just over 12 hours – the equivalent of almost £150 an hour – and just under £1,800 for a shift by a locum doctor. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust paid almost as much – £1,798 – for a middle-grade nurse specialising in mental health. That is almost a month’s pay for the average nurse. The money is paid to the agencies, which keep some and then pass the rest to the nurses. Last month, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured, held talks with NHS bosses on how to fill a £2billion gap in its funding . The percentages they receive vary from case to case. In January, the Daily Mail revealed some understaffed A&E units were paying GPs £1,500 a shift to work evenings and weekends. Separate figures published in April suggested that the NHS has spent £2billion on agency staff since 2010/11. Last month, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt held talks with NHS bosses on how to fill a £2billion gap in its funding.

'The figures…are not a full picture of staffing in the NHS, but we encourage all trusts to maintain a tight grip on their staff costs and we will hold poor performers to account.’","One NHS hospital paid £1,800 for a nurse to cover a Bank Holiday shift .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Watching TV for three hours a day can be deadly – doubling your risk of dying early, warn researchers. A new study from Spain adds to evidence that time spent in front of the box is potentially life-threatening. Researchers believe too much sitting – as opposed to insufficient activity – may be a new risk factor for premature death and illness such as diabetes and heart disease. Warning: Watching TV for three hours a day can be deadly - doubling your risk of dying early, warn researchers . Professor Miguel Martinez-Gonzalez, chair of the Department of Public Health at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, who led the study, said ‘Television viewing is a major sedentary behaviour and there is an increasing trend toward all types of sedentary behaviours. ‘Our findings are consistent with a range of previous studies where time spent watching television was linked to mortality.’ Researchers assessed 13,284 young and healthy Spanish university graduates, average age 37, to investigate possible links between  three types of sedentary behaviour and risk of death: television viewing time, computer time and driving time. The participants were followed for around eight years, when there were 97 deaths, including 19 deaths from cardiovascular causes, 46 from cancer and 32 from other causes. The risk of premature death was twofold higher for those watching three or more hours of TV a day compared to those watching one hour or less. Telly addicts: Britons spend an average of four hours a day watching TV. Previous research has claimed that six hours can cut lifespans by five years and can lead to lower sperm count in men . This twofold higher risk was also apparent after accounting for many other variables related to a higher risk of death, says a report published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Researchers found no significant association between the time spent using a computer or driving and higher risk of premature death from all causes. Researchers said further studies are needed to determine the biological mechanisms that may be involved. Prof Martinez-Gonzalez  said ‘As the population ages, sedentary behaviours will become more prevalent, especially watching television, and this poses an additional burden on the increased health problems related to aging. ‘Our findings suggest adults may consider increasing their physical activity, avoid long sedentary periods, and reduce television watching to no longer than one to two hours each day’ he added. In the UK, the average amount of time spent watching TV is four hours a day compared with five hours in the US. Previous research found people who watch six hours of TV a day cut short their lifespan by five years compared with someone who watches no TV. People who sit for longer have bigger waist sizes, and higher levels of cholesterol, blood sugar and triglycerides. The average adult spends 90 per cent of their leisure time sitting down and less than half of adults meet World Health Organisation physical activity recommendations. In the UK, adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health. Other work suggests sedentary behaviour is linked to obesity, high levels of bad blood fats and other heart disease risk factors, and more opportunities for grazing on junk foods. US research earlier this year found young men who watch TV for just three hours a day have half the sperm count of men who rarely watch TV.","Sitting still, rather than insufficient activity, could be latest health factor linked to TV .

Research shows that having a hysteroscopy to check the womb before fertility treatment makes no difference to success rates. But some private clinics insist on the invasive procedure, which costs up to £3,000 a time, before giving IVF. Dr Tarek El-Toukhy, from Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital, London, who led the study, said: ‘Based on these findings, outpatient hysteroscopy before IVF doesn’t significantly improve IVF results and cannot be considered essential for women with recurrent IVF failure.’ Thousands of women trying for a baby through IVF are being given unnecessary and expensive procedures to examine the womb,  doctors have warned . There has been a long-running debate over whether to perform hysteroscopies on women who have failed to get pregnant after one or more IVF attempts. The procedure – often under general anaesthetic – uses a narrow tube with a camera at the end to send images to a computer, where they can be checked for problems such as scar tissue that may cause infertility. If any abnormal growths are detected they are subsequently removed using a repeat procedure. In a trial involving eight fertility centres in Europe, 700 women who had suffered an unsuccessful round of IVF treatment were randomly assigned either a hysteroscopy before a second attempt, or put straight through for IVF again. Abnormalities of the womb were found in one in 10 women having the procedure. But using the procedure and treating such problems made no significant difference to a woman’s chances of going on to have a baby, the researchers found. The take-home baby rate was 31 per cent in the hysteroscopy group and 29 per cent in women who had IVF alone. Dr El-Toukhy said the finding suggested the abnormalities discovered had ‘little clinical significance’ and were not interfering with the woman’s chances of getting pregnant. Research shows that having a hysteroscopy to check the womb before fertility treatment makes no difference to success rates. The test involves using a camera to check for scar tissue. Stock image shows a technician during part of the IVF process . Dr El-Toukhy said hysteroscopy was justified in women where an abnormality in the womb was found by ultrasound, but not as a routine procedure prior to IVF. The findings were reported yesterday at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Munich. Dr Yacoub Khalaf, a fertility expert from King’s College London, said: ‘In some clinics, the first thing they do is hysteroscopy before the patients get any IVF. ‘It’s standard in some clinics and could cost £2,000 to £3,000 under general anaesthetic. It’s an unpleasant experience and this study shows it does not add value.’ Using non-invasive ultrasound for most women would show if they needed treatment of polyps, or growths, in the womb, he added. Professor Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said hysteroscopy was often routinely used even in NHS fertility clinics, costing around £500-£600 a time. The money could be better spent on giving women more IVF treatment, he added.","New study found having a hysteroscopy to check the womb before IVF makes no difference to success rates .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Getting some sun on your skin not only improves your mood but could also reduce your blood pressure, say experts. A study found a strong link between low levels of vitamin D, absorbed by the body from sunlight, and higher levels of blood pressure. Researchers believe it is the first study of its kind to suggest that taking vitamin D supplements could be an alternative to drugs for tacking high blood pressure in some patients. Around 30 per cent of people in England have high blood pressure, known as hypertension, which is the single most important risk factor for early death. Antihypertensive drugs have common side effects such as coughing, dizziness, facial flushing and constipation, experts believe some people might benefit from vitamin D supplements instead . Lead researcher Professor Elina Hyppönen from the University of South Australia said ‘In view of the costs and side effects associated with anti-hypertensive drugs, the potential to prevent or reduce blood pressure and therefore the risk of hypertension with vitamin D is very attractive.’ Previously, a British study of more than one million patients found people with cancer diagnosed in summer and autumn lived longer than those diagnosed at other times of the year, probably because their vitamin D levels are topped up by sun exposure. The new findings come as debates rages over whether vitamin D plays a role in helping prevent disease, with conflicting scientific views. Although the vitamin is found in salmon, tuna and other oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream compared with sun exposure. In a new study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal researchers used genetic data from a database of 146,500 people across Europe and North America. They looked at particular genetic variants in the blood which affect levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood to establish the relationship with hypertension. The study found each ten per cent increase in vitamin D in the system was linked to lower blood pressure and an 8.1 per cent lower chance of suffering from hypertension. Because antihypertensive drugs have common side effects such as coughing, dizziness, facial flushing and constipation, experts believe some people might benefit from vitamin D supplements instead. Although the vitamin is found in salmon, tuna and other oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream compared with sun exposure . Figures show three quarters of Britons have vitamin D intakes which are below recommended levels, with children and older people are at particular risk. In the UK, the Food Standards Agency does not recommend a specific daily dose of vitamin D unless you are elderly, pregnant, Asian, get little sun exposure and eat no meat or oily fish when 10mcg is advised. It says daily supplements of 25mcg are unlikely to cause harm. The danger with taking excessive doses for long periods is that the body absorbs too much calcium, which could weaken bones and possibly damage liver and kidneys. Earlier this year a major review found cancer patients with more vitamin D in their blood tended to have better survival rates and were in remission longer than those who were deficient. The findings came from analysis of 25 separate studies looking at vitamin D and cancer death rates.","Around 30 per cent of people in England have high blood pressure .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Diabetes: Thousands could have the condition without knowing it (picture posed by model) Hundreds of thousands of people are living with diabetes without realising it, an online test has revealed. An estimated 630,000 have an undiagnosed type 2 form of the disease, which is linked to obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet, according to Diabetes UK. One in 16 people who were interviewed after taking the charity’s online risk assessment said they were later diagnosed with the condition. The test asks participants for details such as their age, ethnicity and weight and then calculates the person’s risk of type 2. Those identified as being at high risk are advised to see their GP. Diabetes UK said the online risk assessment had been taken by more than 400,000 people, and 1,000 were questioned for the follow-up research. Barbara Young, chief executive of the charity, said: ‘If left unchecked, type 2 diabetes can lead to devastating health complications such as amputation, blindness and stroke. It is so important that people with type 2 are diagnosed as quickly as possible so that they can start getting the education and healthcare they need to manage it.’ Around 3.8million Britons have diabetes – type 1 and type 2 – but this is expected to rise to 5million within ten years. Earlier this month it was revealed that one in seven hospital patients has the disease. It currently costs the NHS £10billion but this figure is expected to soar to £17billion by 2025. Mrs Young added: ‘At the moment, too many people with the condition are not being identified quickly enough and this is why half of people with type 2 already have signs of complications by the time they are diagnosed. ‘But the fact that a significant number of people taking our online Risk Score have undiagnosed type 2 suggests we are reaching the right people with it and those people diagnosed as a result are in a position to start getting the support to give them the best possible chance of a long and healthy life.’ Despite the prevalence of diabetes, campaigners say many hospital staff do not know how to properly administer insulin – one of the main treatments. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 40 per cent of diabetes patients have experienced medication errors. Simon O’Neill, of Diabetes UK, said one of the most common mistakes was giving insulin without food, causing blood sugar levels to fall dangerously low. ‘Hospitals are particularly bad at managing diabetes,’ he said. ‘There is a large number of medication errors. Patients are often given insulin without giving them food at the same time causing them to have a hypo – low blood sugar. ‘Staff don’t properly monitor them so we are aware of people developing foot ulcers whilst in hospital. They aren’t really tuned into their particular needs so we see really stupid things.’ More than 90 per cent of patients with diabetes have type 2, which is linked to obesity, old age and a family history of the condition. It occurs when the body loses its ability to process blood sugar, leading to high levels that can damage organs and nerve endings and cause blindness by harming the retinas. Patients are encouraged to eat healthily and exercise to keep blood sugar low. If this fails they are offered drugs such as insulin.

"By . David Williams . She is the 'Ice Princess' who has stolen the hearts of Russia - and melted the notoriously hard heart of Vladimir Putin to become the biggest star of the Sochi Olympics. And when 5ft 2in Yulia Lipnitskaya takes to the ice tonight in what is now the most eagerly anticipated contest of this Olympics more Russians are expected to tune-in to watch than for any other sporting event. For the 15 year-old skating sensation, who became the youngest skating gold medalist in 78 years when anchoring Russia to team gold on the ice, is set to have the biggest impact on an Olympics for Russia since the 'Little Sparrow,' Olga Korbut, came out of the Soviet Union to enchant the world and take gold as a 17 year-old at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Grace: When Yulia Lipnitskaya takes to the ice tonight, more Russians are expected to tune-in than for any other sporting event in the country's history .

New darling: Julia Lipnitskaia of Russia's figure skating team is greeted Russia's President Vladimir Putin . The Russian figure skating team steps onto the podium at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics . Mr Putin was in the audience last week to see Miss Lipnitskaya, who is so young she only qualified to take part here in Sochi by 23-days, skate brilliantly to clinch Russia's first gold of the Olympics and rewarded her with a rare smile - and a kiss. That dazzling performance of brilliant skating, technique and composure under pressure has made her the darling of Russia with a back story that has fascinated the rest of the world. It has been reported that Russian state officials have been ordered to trace her father, Slava, who never returned to his pregnant wife, Daniela, after being conscripted in the Army. Miss Lipnitskaya, who has never seen her father and carries her mother's surname, was born and raised in Russia's fourth city Yekaterinburg, in the Urals and on the edge of Siberia. A neighbour in Yekaterinburg, Valentina Popova recalled: 'When Yulia's mother Daniela became pregnant, her father Slava was conscripted into the army and did not return. 'It is said immediately after the army, he moved to another city. Daniela raised her daughter alone. She had to work at several jobs, even on the local market, to make ends meet. I remember Daniela returning home frozen after a day on the market in freezing temperatures. She worked so hard to provide and support Yulia. It was very tough.' Elena Legkovets, Yulia's former coach in Yekaterinburg, said: 'Her mother brought Yulia to our sport school 'Lokomotiv'. She was just four years old. 'I remember when I saw this girl at her casting. I was struck by her confident look, fearlessness, and thought, ""If only I can train her."" So I was lucky'. Vladimir Putin congratulates Julia Lipnitskaia after she skated to glory at the Winter Olympics . Incredible: Julia Lipnitskaia's spins mesmerised a partisan crowd . Bendy: Russia's Julia Lipnitskaia performs her amazing routine . Flexible: Julia Lipnitskaia put on an incredible show at the Iceberg Skating Palace . At the age of 10 years, Yulia and her mother moved to Moscow to continue training. 'Almost from the first day it became clear that she was not like the others. She stood out for her brightness, activity and extraordinary seriousness. 'Off the rink, she could joke, but when she stepped on the ice, there left no trace of laughter. Figure skating she always treated as to a job. I would say too seriously and responsibly. 'I have never seen her cry. She is a fighter. Even when she fell, she felt pain, but she took her courage into both hands, rose and ran on. 'Even my older children when they came to watch the kids training were amazed at Yulia's activity. I always told them, 'You should follow her example.' She was literally on fire with skating. She was always last from the ice rink. When I told her , ""Yulia, let's finish up, stop"", then each time heard in response: 'No, still one last time.'' Despite this dedication, the move to Moscow nearly didn't take place and Miss Lipnitskaya considered abandoning top skating. The now champion said: 'My mother asked: do we finish it all or we will try to ride on? I could now say that everything depended on my decision. Although at the moment I would not be upset, in ending the training for ever - even the thought that finishing with this sport would be great - but then I was suddenly struck: 'Stop! And why must I finish?' So I told to my mother: 'Let's go!' 'My mother gave up everything for me. In Yekaterinburg, she had a job and an apartment in the centre of the city, and her whole life. And in Moscow - nothing. We did not even know where we will live. It is now all normal.' The journey was across two time zones, and 1120 miles. Yulia Lipnitskaya is set to have the biggest impact on an Olympics for Russia since the 'Little Sparrow,' 17 year-old Olga Korbut at the Munich Olympics in 1972 . Julia Lipnitskaia leaves the ice after competing in the women's team free skate figure skating competition . Miss Lipnitskaya, who now lives in an apartment in Moscow, said: 'I remember that for two days we were travelling by car... I mostly looked out the window, how beautiful, how the landscape changed... We were not going for three days, but to change our life. With all our things in one car.' She added: 'My mother doesn't work now. So I am the only breadwinner in the family. We want to buy our own house very much. When you don't have a house, it's such a headache.' One of her greatest problems now, coach Etery Tutberidze says, is keeping her weight down: 'She struggles with it... in my work, I never faced such cases - she just cannot eat at all. And I'm very sorry that she had to endure so much, but I cannot help it.' 'It is great that she copes with it. When she needed to lose weight, she could eat only the powder 'Squeeze' - a fibre that gives energy. 'It is hard, and the weight goes down very slowly - from 100 grams per day. But she copes, thank God. 'Last season her weight changed and it caused her injury. Now Yulia holds her weight, self-controlled, although it is very difficult.' Elena Ilinykh, right, speaks with Julia Lipnitskaia as they stand on the podium during the flower ceremony . Miss Lipnitskaya admitted: 'I have to refuse everything, the things that I like most, I was forbidden. I do not put on high heels at all now. I understand that I need to protect my legs. I would not say that I get tired of restraining. I think of it that if something is impossible, I do not want this.' As with many Russian athletes, she does not go to school but is taught at home, lessons fitting in around training. In the team event, Miss Lipnitskaya performed to the music from Schindler's List, Stephen Speilberg's film of the Holocaust, while symbolically wearing a red coat. Schindler's List is shot almost entirely in black-and-white but in a couple of scenes a small girl is spotted in the middle distance wearing a red coat - first in the Jewish ghetto, then later on a pile of bodies. The sight signals a quiet turning point for the hero, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, and his mission to save his 'list' of prisoners from the gas chambers. It is not known what music she will perform to tonight when she faces world and Olympic champion Kim Yuna, of South Korea, dubbed the 'Ice Queen' at the start of a two-day showdown that all of Russia awaits.","Yulia Lipnitskaya, 15, has become the biggest star of the Sochi Olympics .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer are to receive a new drug after a double U-turn by the NHS rationing body. Enzalutamide extends life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options - with some surviving more than 18 months. It was initially recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for NHS funding without curbs last October. Thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer are to receive a new drug after a double U-turn by the NHS rationing body NICE . But then Nice issued revised draft guidance in January proposing restrictions affecting the vast majority of men with prostate cancer that has spread. It would have been banned for men in England and Wales previously treated with another new drug abiraterone - while men in Scotland can get both drugs. Cancer specialists were outraged, saying it was a perverse U-turn based on fears about the cost but using a technicality to argue there was insufficient evidence to allow the drug to be used. The outcry over the plan led to Prostate Cancer UK spearheading a campaign, with more than 13,500 people signing its petition alongside widespread support from high profile figures such as Sir Michael Parkinson and other organisations such as Tackle Prostate Cancer. Nice has now performed another U-turn in final draft guidance (to subs must retain), which seems to go back to its original position of recommending enzalutamide regardless of a patient’s previous treatment. Doctors say enzalutamide could help turn prostate cancer from a killer disease into a chronic illness by combining new and older agents together for longer survival. Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments. Trials show men taking enzalutamide survived for more than 18 months, with almost half having a better quality of life as a result, compared with 13.6 months for men receiving a placebo (dummy treatment). The drug Enzalutamide extends life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options for prostate cancer . Professor Carole Longson, centre for health technology evaluation director at Nice, acknowledged that clinicians and patients were among those protesting over the proposed changes. She said ‘During consultation on the draft recommendations for using enzalutamide, we received a number of responses, including data and comments from the manufacturer of the drug, professional organisations and patient groups. ‘Due to this additional information we now know that, at the moment, evidence on the effectiveness of enzalutamide when given after abiraterone is too uncertain to make a definitive evidence-based recommendation, so we have not done so. ‘We continue to recommend enzalutamide as a treatment for patients whose cancer has progressed after previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy.’ Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ‘We are very pleased that Nice has listened to the concerns we and others have raised, and dropped a controversial restriction on the use of enzalutamide from its draft guidance. ‘This restriction would have prevented men with advanced prostate cancer from accessing enzalutamide after receiving another life-extending drug, abiraterone, which was discovered and developed here at The Institute of Cancer Research. ‘This change will have an important effect on thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer by allowing them to access both abiraterone and enzalutamide after receiving chemotherapy, and therefore giving them several more precious months of life.’ Owen Sharp, chief executive at Prostate Cancer UK, said the charity cautiously welcomed the change of heart, but wanted assurances men who needed it would get the drug. He said ‘We are pleased that overall enzalutamide has been approved in England and Wales and that the long contested blanket restriction around use after abiraterone has been lifted. ‘However we are not currently clear as to what this ruling will truly mean in reality for the men across the country who have exhausted all other options and are grappling with the final stages of this cruel disease. ‘The bottom line is, will these men be given the potential of extra time with their loved ones or not? ‘We strongly expect that after eight long months of dithering NICE has done the right thing, and that men across England and Wales can access this vital drug now. ‘The priority is doing the right thing by those who are standing on the edge of the abyss today and we need to be sure that they are going to start being prescribed the treatment before we confirm our course of action. ‘If it transpires in reality that this is a de facto restriction thinly veiled by complex prose, we will be holding relevant parties to account and will continue our fight to ensure men are not denied enzalutamide after abiraterone.’ The drug, which is a pill taken at home, costs around £25,000 for an average course of treatment. But the manufacturer Astellas Pharma has reduced the price through a patient access scheme which makes it cost effective, according to Nice. A key trial of the drug, also known as Xtandi, was carried out by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Sandy Tyndale-Biscoe, Chairman of prostate cancer charity Tackle, said ‘Finally this drug is available to improve and prolong life for those who have been anxiously waiting for several months.’","Men with advanced prostate cancer to receive drug after NHS body's U-turn .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . End of life care is ‘unacceptable’ at too many NHS hospitals, a damning report warns, with the problem especially serious at weekends. Only a fifth of hospitals had specialist palliative care staff on duty on Saturdays and Sundays according to experts, despite official guidance demanding seven-day care ten years ago. Around three-quarters offer face-to-face palliative care on weekdays only. However, the report found one in four fail to provide a decent quality of service at any time. Anastasia and Jimmy holding a photo of their mother and father). They found their mother Helen lying dead in her hospital bed unnoticed by nurses . The report’s authors said it was unacceptable that so many patients were dying ‘badly’ when hospitals know how they should be cared for. The major audit recommends that  people who are dying in hospital should get access to palliative care from at least 9am to 5pm seven days a week. It found that NHS staff told fewer than half of patients in the final days of life that the end was near, with almost one in ten families kept in the dark. It also found a fifth of hospitals are failing to give any special training to staff caring for the dying. Important decisions about whether to withdraw artificial hydration or nutrition were seldom discussed with patients capable of doing so, with barely one in six (17 per cent) being involved. Although family members were included more often, the audit found almost two-thirds never got to talk to staff about these issues. The National Care of the Dying Audit for Hospitals, led by the Royal College of Physicians and the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute, found significant variations in provision, quality and training of end-of-life care. The audit of a sample of 6,580 people who died in 149 NHS hospitals in England was carried out last May. It also contained the views of 858 bereaved relatives or friends and an analysis of the organisation of palliative care in the selected hospitals. Helen Weldon on the day she married Thomas. She was found dead in bed in Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham by her visiting children . The report comes after the Liverpool Care Pathway – a ‘tick-box exercise’ used for care of the dying in hundreds of hospitals – was condemned in July by a national inquiry and Government ministers. Senior medical figures raised fears the system was being used to kill off unwanted patients, free hospital beds and save money. The new audit makes ten recommendations, including the need for palliative care from 9am to 5pm seven days a week and mandatory training in care of the dying for staff. Dr Kevin Stewart, the chairman of the audit steering group, said many staff fail to communicate properly with dying people or their loved ones and hospitals ‘do not recognise this as an important issue’. Professor John Ellershaw, director of the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool, said: ‘It is unacceptable in the current day and age that hospitals are failing patients, and their families, in the care they receive at the end of their life. Too many patients are dying badly in our hospitals when we know how to care for them well.’ Claire Henry, the chief executive of the National Council for Palliative Care, said: ‘There can be no excuse for hospitals failing to treat people with dignity, compassion and respect when they are dying, at the time that they most need this.’ An elderly patient was found dead by distraught relatives after going unnoticed by nurses at a troubled hospital for up to two hours. Neglected:  Helen Weldon, 85, was only due to be in Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham for a routine check-up after being admitted to A&E for choking on some water . Helen Weldon, 85, who had been admitted to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital after choking on some water, was found by her son and daughter when they visited over August bank holiday weekend in 2010. Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon spoke out after an inquest last week heard that a grandmother, Joan James, 85, had been dead for more than half an hour at the same hospital before her family discovered her. When Mrs Weldon’s children visited they  discovered her to be cold with food dried to her mouth. It took nurses a further 20 minutes to come over to check her pulse. Miss Weldon, 45, said: ‘As soon as I walked through the door and saw my mum I knew something wasn’t right. She was yellow and her skin was waxy. The starched water in the glass next to her bed had set like wallpaper paste, so she must have been lying there for at least two hours.’ And in a third case a grieving sister said she found her brother lying dead just moments after a ward sister claimed to have checked on him at Heartlands in June 2012. Linda Webb, 65, said the nurse claimed her brother Christopher was feeling ‘a bit better this morning’ – but she found him lying in bed with his face covered in blood as if he had been there  ‘for a while’. Heartlands Hospital yesterday apologised to the families but said it was not able to comment on whether an inquiry would be carried out into the incidents.","Government ignored on demands for seven-day specialist care .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Young adults taking high-dose antidepressants such as Prozac and Seroxat have double the risk of suicidal behaviour, warn researchers. A U.S. study of almost 162,000 found those aged 24 or younger were twice as likely to deliberately self-harm compared with youngsters taking standard doses of SSRI pills. Older adults were not at higher risk of suicidal behaviour after starting to take antidepressants. Teens who take high dose antidepressants are twice as likely to become suicidal as those taking low doses . The latest study investigating the effect of antidepressants known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors comes from experts at Harvard School of Public Health, Boston. Because the benefits of medication for youngsters suffering depression are 'modest', they claim, doctors should avoid giving them high doses and monitor them closely for several months. Suicide warnings are included on medication in the U.S. and the British drug safety watchdog advises doctors to 'carefully monitor' young adults during treatment for any worsening of symptoms of suicidal behaviour. Previous studies found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents, particularly in the early stages of treatment. A British Medical Journal study in 2009 found young adults taking antidepressants including SSRIs had double the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviour compared with those taking dummy pills. Doctors are advised not to prescribe the majority of SSRIs to under-18s and NHS guidelines recommend cognitive therapy, which teaches patients to change behaviour patterns, as first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression. Older adults are not at increased risk of becoming suicidal when taking high doses of the drugs . The latest study used data from 162,625 people between the ages of 10 to 64 years with depression who started treatment with SSRIs such as Prozac and Seroxat. They compared those on an average dose or at higher amounts from 1998 to 2010. The rate of suicidal behaviour among children and adults of 24 years or younger who started antidepressant therapy at high doses was about twice as high compared with a matched group of patients who received generally prescribed doses. The authors suggest this corresponds to about one additional act of deliberate self-harm for every 150 patients treated with high-dose therapy. For adults 25 to 64 years old, there was no difference in risk for suicidal behaviour, says a report in JAMA Internal Medicine. The study did not explain why higher doses might lead to higher suicide risk. Study leader Dr Matthew Miller said recent scientific reviews of antidepressant therapy found young patients only got modest benefits. 'Our findings offer clinicians an additional incentive to avoid initiating pharmacotherapy at high-therapeutic doses and to monitor all patients starting antidepressants, especially youth, for several months,' he said. Soaring levels of antidepressant use led to more than 50 million prescriptions being issued on the NHS in 2012. Of these more than half were for drugs such as Prozac and Seroxat. Dr Irene Petersen, Reader in Epidemiology, Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL, said it was likely that young people needing high dose medication had more severe problems. She said: 'Young people prescribed high dose antidepressants are likely to be different from those who were prescribed standard dose. The suicide risk in young people taking the drugs, which include Prozac, is particularly high during the first weeks of taking them . 'We cannot be sure that the observed increase in self-harm is solely due to high dose antidepressants. 'An alternative, but equally valid, interpretation is that high dose antidepressant is a mere marker of young people with acute severe psychiatric problems and thus it is the underlying condition not the treatment that is associated with increased risks of self-harm.' Professor David Nutt, speaking on behalf of the European College for Neuropsychopharmacology, said: 'We need to be clear that this is about starting antidepressant therapy at a high dose - the work shows that normal doses are not a significant problem. 'Nevertheless, this will help doctors optimise the doses in younger people, and clinicians should take note.'","Under 24s taking high doses of SSRIs are twice as likely to self-harm .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Where you live could  provide clues to your health and the influence the environment may have on it, say researchers. They have come up with a new online atlas mapping the geographical pattern of various diseases across England and Wales – and companion maps of environmental factors such as air pollution, sunshine and pesticides. This is the first time in the UK that researchers have produced such detailed maps. Scroll down for video . Health guide: A new online atlas mapping the geographical pattern of various diseases across England and Wales claims central London is among the healthiest areas . Destination: Brighton & Hove is also among the healthiest places to live, according to the online atlas . By putting in a postcode to the online version of the atlas, users can zoom into a neighbourhood of around 6,000 people. They can access the health and environment maps for a locality, which provide an indication of the health risk for the area relative to the average for England and Wales. However, researchers caution that simply comparing the health and environment maps will not enable people to conclude there is a causal link between a specific environmental factor and a health condition as there are likely to be a number of factors at play. For example, the atlas shows that skin cancer risk is greatest in southwest England even though sunshine duration is highest in southeast England. The geographical pattern of 14 diseases and conditions such as lung cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, leukaemia and low birth weight are highlighted using data from the Office of National Statistics . Precautions: The atlas shows that skin cancer risk is greatest in southwest England even though sunshine duration is highest in southeast England . This suggests that despite a lower level of sunlight in the southwest people may be more exposed, which could trigger research into behavioural differences between the areas to explain the variation. The healthiest places appear to be in central London, North Norfolk, parts of Suffolk, and Brighton & Hove. Riskier areas tend to be in the North West, parts of Yorkshire and South Wales. The geographical pattern of 14 diseases and conditions such as lung cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, leukaemia and low birth weight are highlighted using data from the Office of National Statistics and cancer registries for 1985 to 2009. It is the first to adjust for both age and deprivation which means the geographical patterns of health risk can’t be explained as the result of ageing populations or poverty. It was produced by the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU), part of the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment & Health based at Imperial College London. Pattern: Riskier areas tend to be in the North West, such as Liverpool (pictured) parts of Yorkshire and South Wales . Its website says: ‘The aim of the Atlas is to provide information to assist in the development of hypotheses about the role of environmental factors in chronic disease and to inform public health research and action.’ Lead author Dr Anna Hansell from SAHSU in Imperial College London’s School of Public Health, said the atlas was a ‘fantastic tool’. But Professor Paul Pharoah, Professor of Cancer Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, said multiple risk factors would have a greater effect on the chances of developing a major disease than environmental exposures. He said: ‘In other words, people should adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle as far as possible. ‘This atlas does not enable anyone to judge their individual absolute risk. People should definitely not use this atlas to decide where to live.’ Alongside health risk maps, the atlas – at www.envhealthatlas.co.uk – provides a series of maps of four environmental agents: air pollution, agricultural pesticides, disinfection by-products in drinking water and sunshine duration using data from 2000 or 2001.","Online atlas maps the geographical pattern of various diseases .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Mothers-to-be who are overweight are more likely to lose their babies than those who are a healthy weight . Pregnant women who are overweight are more likely to lose their baby, warn researchers. A new research review shows women with a higher body mass index (BMI) before or in early pregnancy have a higher risk of the baby dying in pregnancy or labour, including stillbirth, and shortly after birth. Severely obese women run the greatest risk - more than three times higher than women with the healthiest weight, say Imperial College London researchers. But the risk starts to rise even when women are slightly overweight, according to a review of 38 studies. Every day 17 babies in Britain die just before, during or soon after birth amounting to 6,500 babies a year. NHS figures show that each day there are 11 stillbirths where a baby is born dead after 24 weeks of pregnancy - making stillbirth 15 times more common than cot death. There are around 4,000 stillbirths every year in the UK and one in every 200 births ends in a stillbirth. Around 15 per cent of British mothers are obese when expecting a child - up from seven per cent 20 years ago, according to latest figures. Doctors have warned the obesity epidemic among pregnant women is an ever-growing burden on the NHS and could jeopardise the health of the next generation. Complications suffered by obese women in pregnancy range from diabetes to life-threatening pre-eclampsia, while babies born to fat women are at greater risk of diabetes and obesity themselves in later life. MP Anna Soubry, while public health minister last year, said it was 'absolutely bonkers' that midwives were no longer routinely weighing pregnant women. In the new review, lead researcher Dr Dagfinn Aune investigated the link between maternal weight and baby and infant deaths. Altogether 38 studies included more than 10,147 foetal deaths, more than 16,274 stillbirths, more than 4,311 perinatal deaths, 11,294 neonatal deaths, and 4,983 infant deaths. The highest risk is among women who are overweight before pregnancy and in the early stages of pregnancy . Doctors use Body Mass Index (BMI) to assess whether patients are overweight by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A BMI of 20 to 24.9 is healthy, while 25 to 29.9 is overweight and 30-plus is obese. BMI of 40 plus is super-obese. The researchers found even 'modest increases' in maternal BMI were associated with increased risk of the baby dying in pregnancy or labour, stillbirth, or death shortly after birth. Severely obese women are three times more likely to lose their babies than healthy weight women . The risk for super-obese women with a BMI of 40 was between two and 3.5-fold higher compared to women with a BMI of 20. But the rate of stillbirth per 10,000 pregnancies was 20 per cent higher for overweight women, and 50 per cent higher for obese women, says the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr Aune said: 'Weight management guidelines for women who plan pregnancies should take these findings into consideration to reduce the burden of foetal deaths, stillbirths, and infant deaths.' Experts said the findings show the importance of being 'fit for pregnancy' and healthy eating while pregnant, but stressed dieting was never recommended. In the UK, there are no specific recommendations for how much weight a woman should put on during pregnancy. Experts do not recommend weight loss in pregnancy, but advise bigger mums to keep their weight stable and aim to gain around 22lbs or 10kg only. A woman's weight is currently only recorded when she goes for her first antenatal check, with more regular checks abandoned in the 1990s. NHS guidance tells women that during the first six months of pregnancy energy needs do not change, so no extra food is needed, while only 200 calories more a day is needed in the later stages.","Pregnant women with a high BMI are more likely to have a stillbirth .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Trials to dissuade addiction by providing heroin addicts with 'rewards' for staying clean have been taking place all over the UK . Heroin addicts are to be given weekly £10 supermarket vouchers in a bid to help them give up their habit. The NHS will reward drug users with the vouchers for remaining clean during a 12-week treatment programme – meaning they could ‘earn’ up to £120 in total. The trial – which is taking place at 33 sites around Britain – follows a study by researchers who found that the number of heroin addicts who completed a course of three hepatitis B jabs soared when they were rewarded with shopping vouchers. The researchers said the financial incentive had been a ‘game-changer’ and could have a huge impact on drug treatment as well as other public health initiatives. The study was led by Professor John Strang from the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London, working with colleagues from Imperial College London and University College London. Almost half of those given graduated payments – £5 for the first jab, followed by subsequent payments of £10 and £15 – attended all three appointments, according to a report in The Lancet medical journal. Professor Strang said the ethics of giving financial incentives to drug addicts was a matter for ‘wider debate’ but added that it would be a ‘massive saving in terms of efficiency of the delivery’ of the vaccination programme. ‘Why would you not want to do a vaccination programme where you get 45 per cent uptake?’ he said. Professor John Strang, one of the country's top experts on drug dependence, has been leading the scheme, and argues that monetary incentives are a good way to ensure most are vaccinated . ‘I can understand the anxieties. Suggesting this at a time of austerity is difficult but are you really going to shirk from making a difficult decision which is cost-saving?’ The research team conceded it was possible that addicts might trade in the vouchers to feed their habit, but said that the evidence suggested otherwise. Almost 700 addicts are being recruited for the trial, all of whom want to stop taking drugs. Some will get reward vouchers if their urine tests are clean or they are taking their medication over a three-month period. Professor Strang said the success of the hepatitis B study suggests the approach should be rolled out nationwide to boost vaccine uptake, given that one in five of 250,000 injecting drug users in the UK has the virus. Around 700 heroin addicts have been recruited for the trial so far, all of whom want to stop taking drugs . The costs to the NHS of treating the disease were high, as was the human cost of potential transmission to their families, he added. He said there was scope for financial incentives to help in other ways, such as encouraging people to take statin drugs, or for the homeless to finish a course of TB treatment. However Joyce Robins, co-director of the campaign group Patient Concern, questioned whether addicts should be paid for changing their ways. ‘In a time of austerity this is not the best way of spending taxpayers’ money,’ she said. More must be done to help the rising tide of people who are injecting themselves with steroids, health experts have also warned. Reports suggest the number of people, including teenagers, who use steroids and other performance or image enhancing drugs is 'rapidly increasing', the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said. Outreach programmes should be set up in gyms to try to reach this group of drug users, Nice said. People who use these drugs do not see themselves as having a drug problem, a Nice spokesman said. In fact, they see themselves as 'fit and healthy' despite the fact that people who inject themselves with any type of drug are at a heightened risk of HIV and hepatitis. Nice warned that anabolic steroid use is 'relatively widespread' with an estimated 59,000 people aged 16 to 59 using the drug in England and Wales in the last year. But Nice said these estimates are 'conservative' and said that needle and syringe programmes have reported 'rapidly increasing' numbers of steroid users attending their services. David Rourke, harm reduction lead for Arundel Street Project - a needle and syringe programme in Sheffield, said: 'We run a weekly clinic for steroid users but we have people coming through the door on a daily basis, with at least seven new clients a week. 'We know there are many more people out there who are not using needle and syringe programmes because this group of users do not see themselves as drug users. Traditionally they are more sexually active than users of heroin or crack, so there is more potential for the spread of infections through sex. 'People who inject steroids are potentially using them without the correct education or the correct equipment and this can lead to more and more people injecting unsafely, which can put not just their own life, but the lives of those around them, at risk. 'Those who use steroids should be able to get the same support as anyone else who injects drugs. This guideline will make sure that services across the country are at the high standard they should be.'","Almost 700 addicts are being recruited for the trial, .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Arthritis sufferers had pain and stiffness relieved by more than 30 per cent using an extract from green lipped mussels, say researchers. The greatest rate of improvement came in the first two weeks, according to a new trial. But the benefits to hips and knees continued for three months while patients were taking the Regenovex capsules. The joint healing properties of green lipped mussels were first noticed more than 100 years ago by Maoris in New Zealand, where they are sustainably harvested . The joint healing properties of green lipped mussels were first noticed more than 100 years ago by Maoris in New Zealand, where they are sustainably harvested. The capsules also contain hyaluronic acid, which is naturally found in the fluid lubricating joints in the body and is also used by doctors to tackle joint pain. Around 10 million Britons suffer from joint problems every day, and it costs the UK £5.7billion a year. In the latest US study, 53 people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee or hip were recruited by community physicians working in Reading, Lancaster, New York City and Dallas. The patients asked to take Regenovex, a food supplement, for three months, and their symptoms were recorded at the start, monthly and two weeks after the trial was completed. Their pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving was reported using a well-established scale known as the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The total scores improved by more than 30 per cent during the trial, when compared with their initial scores. The biggest fall of 15 per cent occurred during the first two weeks of taking the capsules. The score for 'global functioning - the ability to move more easily - improved by 14.2 per cent over the three-month period. Only two weeks after stopping the capsules, total scores rose by 10 per cent. The study was managed by a clinical trial company and funded by the Mentholatum Company, which makes the product. Dr Emma Derbyshire a senior lecturer in Human Nutrition at Manchester Metropolitan University, said green lipped mussels are a potent source of an essential fatty acid known as eicosatetaenoic acid (ETA) and have a powerful anti-inflammatory action. She said people might be sceptical about supplements causing a marked improvement to joint pain, but there was scientific evidence supporting the use of green lipped mussels and other marine oils. Regenovex capsules: Omega oils have an anti-inflammatory effect and this supplement contains green-lipped mussel extract, which is particularly rich in them . Degeneration of the joints also related to the quantity and quality of hyaluronic acid present, she added. 'As a nation we eat too little fish but the reason for calling them essential fatty acids is because they are not produced in the body, they have to come from dietary sources or as supplements. 'There is now good evidence this kind of supplementation helps people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis, although it's unlikely to work for patients with severe joint problems. It's best to catch it early. 'More research is needed into optimal levels, but most people's diet is deficient as a result of our under-consumption of fish' she said. New Zealander Matthew Jamieson, who now lives near Glasgow where he works in marketing, eats green lipped mussels because of the health benefits. He said 'It's well known in New Zealand that green lipped mussels have health benefits, and they taste good, but they're not always easy to get hold of. 'I'm quite sporty, and being 37 in June feel I've got to take some preventive action to help my joints and it's easier to take capsules.' A spokesman for medical research charity Arthritis Research UK said: 'Although we don’t really understand how green-lipped mussel works, we do know that extracts contain omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, minerals and carbohydrates. 'Omega-3 fatty acids are important for maintaining cell structure and function, so this could explain how and why it works in some people. 'We recently reviewed the clinical trial data for green lipped mussel and found that there is some promising evidence to suggest that it works. 'As a result we awarded it an effectiveness score of three (out of five). Apart from causing nausea and flatulence in some people it appears to be reasonably well-tolerated.'","Healing properties of green lipped mussels noted more than 100 years ago .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Warning: Hay fever misery is set to strike thousands more older people who were never sufferers in the past, warn experts (file picture) Hay fever misery is set to strike thousands more older people who were never sufferers in the past, warn experts. The curse of late-onset hay fever affects people in their 30s, 40s, 50s and even older who become vulnerable for the first time. Up to 18 million Britons suffer hay fever, with their numbers increasing by almost one per cent a year. Triggers such as pollution, stress and even moving home can cause symptoms in people with a genetic predisposition to hay fever whose immune systems have reached a ‘tipping point’. Professor Jean Emberlin, scientific director of the charity Allergy UK, said: ‘They have to become sensitised and more people will reach this threshold because of the interaction between pollen and traffic pollution. ‘The allergens change because the nitrates from traffic pollution intensify the nitrates from the pollen.’ Prof Emberlin said late-onset hay fever was becoming more prevalent for a number of reasons. Air pollution was a key factor, along with exposure to allergens new to the individual. For example, someone moving from the countryside to the city would be exposed to more pollution that ‘charges’ the pollen released there. Similarly, moving from the city to rural areas exposes the individual to naturally higher pollen counts that trigger hay fever in susceptible people. Having a more stressful job can also be a cause, she said, because it changes the immune system. ‘I’ve spoken to people in their 60s who tell me it’s the first time they’ve had hay fever, but it’s possible,’ said Prof Emberlin. ‘They may have the classic profile but . not previously been exposed to sufficient pollen, or other . circumstances, to tip them into suffering symptoms.’ Late-onset: Triggers such as air pollution and a more stressful job can cause symptoms in people with a genetic predisposition to hay fever whose immune systems have reached a 'tipping point' (file picture) She advised hay fever sufferers to start taking antihistamine now – before the grass pollen season that begins in the last week of May, which may be worse than usual this year. ‘It looks as though there’s going to be smaller amounts of grass pollen around for longer,’ said the professor. ‘Taking precautions now will help prevent the immune  system from over-reacting. The more sensitised people become to pollen, the more likely they are to react to lower levels.’ Maureen Jenkins, director of clinical services at Allergy UK, said hay fever is associated with the development of asthma and urged sufferers to seek medical advice if their symptoms do not improve with medication.","Hay fever is set to strike people in 30s, 40s, 50s and older for first time .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Full of beans: Increasing coffee intake could cut the risk of diabetes, a study has found (file photo) Drinking more coffee may further reduce the risk of diabetes, say researchers. Increasing consumption by one and a half cups a day cuts the chances of developing type 2 diabetes by 11 per cent. Although previous research suggested . coffee drinkers benefit from a reduced risk of diabetes, it now appears . an individual’s risk can be further improved by stepping up consumption. Dr Frank Hu and Dr Shilpa Bhupathiraju, from the Department of Nutrition at Harvard University’s School of Public Health, looked at the link between changes in coffee consumption and diabetes risk. They used data from three US-based studies including the Nurses’ Health Study with participants ranging from 25 to 75 years. Detailed information on diet, . lifestyle, medical conditions, and other chronic diseases was collected . every two to four years for over 20 years. Participants whose coffee intake fell by one or two cups a day had a 17 per cent higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Changes in tea consumption were not associated with type 2 diabetes risk, but few people changed their drinking habits. Those with highest consumption of three cups of coffee a day or more had the lowest diabetes risk. It was a third lower than for those drinking one cup or fewer a day. The research was published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes). Fancy a cuppa? Those with highest consumption of three cups a day or more had the lowest diabetes risk . The authors said the higher risk of . type 2 diabetes from decreasing coffee intake may be a true change in . risk, or may reflect people giving it up because they develop medical . conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or cancer. However, even when cases of cardiovascular disease or cancer were excluded, the results were very similar. One researcher said there was 'novel evidence that changes in habits are related to diabetes risk' Although . there was a lower risk of diabetes among decaffeinated coffee drinkers, . increasing or decreasing consumption made no difference to the risk. Dr Hu said: ‘Changes in consumption habits appear to affect diabetes risk in a relatively short amount of time. Our findings…provide novel evidence that changes in habits are related to diabetes risk.’ Studies on decaffeinated coffee have made similar findings with the protective effect due to ‘direct biological effects’ such as antioxidants and magnesium. Because of the benefits from decaffeinated coffee, it is unlikely caffeine is solely responsible for the effect. A European investigation into the effects of diet and lifestyle on health last year found moderate coffee drinking lowered the risk of diabetes by around 30 per cent. Dr Richard Elliott, Research Communications Officer at Diabetes UK, said ‘While this study found evidence of a connection between how much coffee you drink and your risk of Type 2 diabetes, this does not mean that increasing your coffee intake will reduce your diabetes risk. ‘Even if people who drank more coffee did tend to have a lower risk of Type 2, it does not necessarily follow that coffee consumption was directly responsible. ‘Other factors that this study has not identified could also be involved and it is even possible that being at high risk of Type 2 diabetes encourages people to reduce their coffee intake. ‘What we do know is that the best way to reduce your risk of Type 2 diabetes is to maintain a healthy weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and by being regularly physically active.’","Researchers from Harvard University used data from more than 20 years .

A teenager has become the second person to die after apparently overdosing during a music festival in the U.S. Police say a 17-year-old boy from northern Virginia, has now died of a suspected overdose following Friday's 'Mad Decent Block Party' event at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. The youngster, who has not been identified, was one of about 20 people taken to hospital late on Friday. Many of them had drug-related symptoms. The crowd is pictured during the Mad Decent Block Party while it was on tour in Williamsburg Park, New York in 2013 . Another man, 20-year-old Tyler Fox Viscardi of Raleigh, North Carolina, was rushed to hospital and pronounced dead at a hospital that night. Officers are still not clear about what drugs were taken. Police, who say the men did not know each other, are awaiting toxicology results following the deaths. In a statement following Tyler Fox Viscardi's death, Concert promoter Seth Hurwitz, said: 'Our hearts go out to the family as they face the unimaginable. 'As a parent, it makes me horribly sad beyond words to think of a tragedy like this. We can spend every minute of the day making perfect sense to our children regarding the obvious perils of drugs, but sometimes it is impossible to convince them that this is relevant to their world.' American DJ Diplo took to Twitter after learning of the death of Tyler Fox Viscardi . According to Rollingstone.com, police arrested three people at the show. One for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, one for domestic assault and one for assaulting an officer. Around 50 citations were also handed out for under-age drinking.

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Pressure on family doctors to diagnose more patients with dementia could do substantial harm, a leading GP has warned. They may be ‘leaned on’ to overdiagnose and ‘get the numbers up’ because there are ‘vested interests’ that stand to gain, Dr Martin Brunet said. But this raises concerns the patient-doctor relationship is being undermined, he warned. Getting the numbers up: League tables for dementia diagnosis could encourage some doctors to overdiagnose, a leading GP has warned in the British Medical Journal (photo posed by models) Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has prioritised increasing dementia diagnosis rates in those patients who don’t have obvious symptoms. He believes GPs are reluctant to carry out tests because there is no effective cure. But this has raised fears that unnecessary diagnoses will be made for fear of losing funding. Mr Hunt has endorsed new  targets for diagnosis rates of Alzheimer’s and other forms of the disease. In November, he published a ‘dementia map’ of rates for different clinical commissioning groups (CCG). Targets: Jeremy Hunt is prioritising detection levels, but there could be unforeseen consequences . But Dr Brunet said the video accompanying the website features Mr Hunt ‘lambasting the laggards for poor performance’. As a result CCGs are piling on the pressure on GPs to raise dementia diagnosis rates ‘with financial strings attached’, while ‘leaning on you heavily to make any diagnosis to get the numbers up’, he claimed. At least one CCG has told its GPs the area will lose money if they don’t increase rates, Dr Brunet added. And he warned that ‘naming and shaming’ makes the worst performers desperate to get off the bottom of the league table and so may unnecessarily ‘upgrade’ the diagnosis to dementia. Dr Brunet, from Binscombe Medical Centre in Godalming, Surrey, is among growing medical opposition to the strategy. He said there was deep concern that the patient-doctor relationship was being undermined. The setting of target rates for the diagnosis of any condition is unprecedented, says Dr Brunet, in a personal view in the British Medical Journal. He said: ‘Dementia is big business and there are many vested interests that stand to benefit from a rise in the number of diagnoses.’ One in three older people has some form of minor cognitive impairment, which can be picked up in tests but may never lead to full-blown dementia. Meanwhile, figures used to estimate how many diagnoses each practice should make are often wrong and fail to take into account local circumstances, such as dementia care homes in the area, Dr Brunet added. And he warned: ‘Working towards targets can lead to perverse behaviours and outcomes, because the needs of patients are secondary to the requirement to fulfil quotas.’ In Hertfordshire, health services will miss out on extra money if they miss diagnosis targets (file photo) The UK National Screening Committee said in June 2010 that screening for Alzheimer’s Disease ‘should not be offered’ because there was insufficient evidence of the benefits. CCGs, which comprise groups of GPs collectively responsible for commissioning local services, can attract a quality premium payment as a reward for improving a range services. Hertfordshire CCG has chosen the dementia rate target as one of the qualifying measures. If they miss it they will lose out on extra money for the area. Dr Brunet said: ‘The idea that doctors should be motivated by self interest, such as personal or corporate gain, is abhorrent.’ The Health Department said in 2011 there were 250,000 dementia patients registered by GPs. It now exceeds 300,000. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘A timely diagnosis can make a significant difference to a person’s quality of life. 'We would always expect doctors to act in the best interests of their patients, to assess them appropriately when they show the signs of dementia, and refer them to a specialist for diagnosis.’","Leading GP Dr Martin Brunet, from Godalming, Surrey, voiced view in BMJ .

"By . Julian Robinson . Parents both working full time on minimum wage to support their family do not earn enough to live on, according to a new report (file picture) Parents both working full time on minimum wage to support their family do not earn enough to live on, according to a new report. The cost of living has shot up so much that couples earning the national minimum are 18 per cent short of the basic amount needed to provide a minimum standard of living. According to The Cost of a Child in 2014, published by Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), the shortfall for out-of-work families was even more stark - standing at 43 per cent. Its author Donald Hirsch said the evidence showed 'unequivocally' that families had found it progressively harder to make ends meet. Mr Hirsch, who is director of the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, said: 'The forecast increase in wages in the next few years should help, but may not reverse this trend for the worst-off working families. 'This is because the support they get from the state will continue to decline in real terms. So if items such as food, social housing and childcare continue to become more expensive, it is unlikely that these families' overall incomes will keep up.' The findings show - excluding childcare, rent and council tax costs - that the basic cost of raising a child for a couple is £88.84 per week, a 4.3 per cent rise since 2012. For a lone parent, the basic cost of raising a child is £103.53 a week, a 9.7 per cent rise since 2012. Including childcare, rent and council tax costs, the amount rises to £164.19 per week for a couple, a 7.7 per cent rise since 2012. For a lone parent, the figure is £184.50 per week, an increase of 11.4 per cent since 2012. According to the report, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the cost of childcare - the most expensive item purchased by many families with small children - jumped up by 42 per cent between 2008-2014, over twice the official inflation rate. It also found that families in which all parents work full time on the national minimum wage now have only 82 per cent, in the case of couples, or 87 per cent, in the case of lone parents, of the minimum income required to meet their needs. Families receiving out-of-work benefits face even greater shortfalls of income. They receive only 57 per cent, in the case of couples, or 60 per cent, in the case of lone parents, of the income required to meet basic needs. The cost of bringing up children has risen so much that families are struggling to make ends meet, the report's author has said . Alison Garnham, chief executive of CPAG, said the picture was one many hard-pressed parents would recognise. She added: 'Children cost. That is why families with children have a higher risk of poverty than those without. The most recent statistics show 27 per cent of children live in poverty in the UK, and with declining levels of support for families, child poverty can only increase. 'The cumulative impact of low pay and cuts to family support contribute to the remarkable finding that the combined wages and benefits of a family with both parents working full time on the minimum wage are still insufficient to meet the basic needs of that family. 'It is difficult to see how this can be justified or why no political party has set out policies to address this as a matter of urgency. 'We need a government prepared to work flat out to help parents if we are to protect children's childhoods and life chances from poverty.' Katie Schmuecker, policy and research manager at the foundation, added: 'We need to get to grips with the high cost of living and the low pay jobs market which traps parents in working poverty. 'Reforms under Universal Credit go some way to helping parents, but this needs to be part of a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy.' A spokesman for the Government said: 'The Government's long term economic plan to build a stronger economy and a fairer society is working, delivering the fastest growing economy in the G7 and more people in work than ever before. 'The only way to secure rising living standards is to fix the economy. The effects of the great recession are still being felt and so where possible we've acted to help including by lifting over 3million people out of paying income tax altogether, providing free school meals, and tax-free childcare to up to 1.9million families.'","Cost of living means parents on minimum wage struggle to support families .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Intense physio sessions to help car crash victims recover from whiplash injury offer no more relief than a one-off consultation, claim researchers. A new study shows a brief rehab programme can help patients just as much as 20 sessions of physio over three months. Intensive physio is often recommended for people with whiplash injuries, costing insurers millions of pounds each year. Intense physio sessions to help car crash victims recover from whiplash injury offer no more relief than a one-off consultation researchers from the University of Sydney have claimed . But the study shows a one-off meeting with a physio, information leaflet and follow-up telephone call were enough to help them cope with pain. Pain expert Dr Zoe Michaleff, of The University of Sydney in Australia, said 'Our study provides further evidence that prolonged expensive clinical interventions for chronic whiplash injury are no more effective than briefer treatment programs that teach the patient how to self-manage their pain.' Between September 2009 and February 2012 researchers randomly allocated 172 chronic whiplash patients to one of two types of recovery programme. There were still almost half a million whiplash compensation claims in 2012 and the Government is planning a crackdown on whiplash injury fraud . They had all been in a motor accident over three months before the trial began, but no more than five years had passed since being injured, says a report in The Lancet medical journal. One group received just a single half-hour consultation with a trained physiotherapist who went over a pamphlet that provided information on whiplash-related disorders, suggestions on how to self-manage pain, and a simple exercise routine. They could telephone the physio for advice if needed, but this was limited to two calls. A second group were given 20 one-hour, bespoke physiotherapy sessions during a 12-week programme. The sessions used posture re-education, stretching training and exercises, scapular training, aerobic exercise, and strength training to help recovery. Researchers found that for both groups pain was reduced at 14 weeks, six months, and 12 months after the first session and there were 'no clinically meaningful differences' between the two. Dr Michaleff said 'The need to identify effective and affordable strategies to prevent and treat musculoskeletal disorders should be an important health priority. 'This is especially true for those with chronic whiplash-associated disorders because most patients have tried and failed previous treatments, and their continuing symptoms mean they would be unlikely to pursue more of the same approaches.' There were still almost half a million whiplash compensation claims in 2012 and the Government is planning a crackdown on whiplash injury fraud. Insurers say these claims cost them more than £2billion in payouts and lead to an average premium increase of £90 for drivers.","Intense physio for whiplash is unnecessary, Australian researchers claim .

"By . Julian Robinson . Eurovision Song Contest winner turned politician Dana broke down in tears today as her brother walked free from court after he was cleared of historic sex abuse charges. John Brown, 60, was acquitted of five counts of indecent assault against two girls under the age of 13 and 16 at several locations in Northern Ireland and England during the 1970s. Mr Brown, of Bracknell, Berkshire, had denied all of the claims or that his 62-year-old sister helped him to cover up the allegations. John Brown, right, is pictured with his sister, Eurovision Song Contest winner and former Irish presidential candidate Dana Rosemary Scallon, and her husband Damien Scallon . The All Kinds Of Everything singer and former Irish Presidential candidate kept her eyes closed and then cried as the last verdict was delivered following a total of 11 hours and 54 minutes of deliberations at Harrow Crown Court. Later she hugged her brother and other members of their family who were in court. Dana said she could not comment on the outcome today because of ongoing defamation proceedings over claims she made in a 2011 television interview about the complaints against her brother. Later giving a statement on the steps of the courthouse, Mr Brown said that both he and his sister had been put on trial by the prosecution. And he claimed that the aim of the allegations had been to 'derail' her 2011 presidential election campaign. Flanked by his wife Patricia, his sister and her husband Damien, he also expressed his gratitude to the judge and the jury and praised the press for 'respecting the integrity of my family' during the trial. John Brown had denied all of the claims or that his 62-year-old sister helped him to cover up the allegations . John Brown is pictured outside Harrow Crown Court today with Damien and Dana Rosemary Scallon to the left with lawyer Martyn Bowyer. His wife Patricia Brown and their friend Helen are pictured to the right . Dana kept her eyes closed and then cried as the last verdict was delivered following a total of 11 hours and 54 minutes of deliberations at Harrow Crown Court . 'We are here today because of the initial reporting of this during my sister's campaign in the presidential elections of Ireland in 2011,' he added. 'The prosecution have put both myself and my sister on trial. Not only her but our beliefs, our integrity and our faith. 'The jury have delivered their verdict of no cover up. There is nothing to cover up - the accusations are unfounded. 'I came here an innocent man, I leave here an innocent man.' He paused and cried as he thanked his wife and family for 'their support in a horrific three years through many challenges'. 'Judge (Graham) Arran said I am a person of good character and what sustained me was my faith in God that through this darkness there was light.' Mr Brown was first acquitted by the jury of six men and six women before the lunch break on the charges relating to the girl under the age of 13. The abuse was alleged to have happened in London and in a seaside town in the south west of England when the girl was as young as between five and seven years old. John Brown is pictured right, with his sister Dana, centre, and brother Gerald, left . Now in her 40s, the woman claimed that on the first occasion Brown had got on top of her, put his hands in her underwear and thrust at her as if they were having sex. She alleged that he had abused her again in a town she thought could be Torquay in Devon when she was between eight and nine. Mr Brown was accused of asking her for a 'wee hug', rubbing his body against her and pushing her against a wall. After further deliberation the jury also cleared him of claims that he indecently assaulted a girl under the age of 16 in Northern Ireland and Romford in Essex. It was claimed that the girl was aged 10 or 11 at the time. Now in her 50s, she said that Brown had fondled her while she was sleeping. She also alleged that on another occasion he touched her privates and leg on the outside of her pyjamas. Prosecutor Claire Howell had told the jury that Mr Brown and his sister put on a 'slick presentation' during the three-week trial. But Martyn Bowyer, for the defence, described the prosecution's case as 'fuzzy' on the details and said his client had been 'consistent throughout'. And he also asked the jury not to be influenced by recent high-profile child abuse scandals. Dana first achieved fame after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1970 with All Kinds Of Everything. Born in London to a Northern Irish family, she went into politics in 1997, served as an MEP for Connacht-Ulster and twice stood as an independent candidate at presidential elections in the Republic.","John Brown cleared of five counts of indecent assault against two girls .

'In the last five metres I was thinking, 'No way am I winning this, I need to get my hand on the wall'. I am really happy and quite emotional.' Halsall's team-mate Amy Smith came home eighth, with Scotland's Sian Harkin one place better off. Fearless Adam Peaty took on his idol, Olympic champion Cameron van der Burgh, and beat him to land the Commonwealth 100 metres breaststroke title. He produced a storming last 25m, reeling the South African world-record holder Van der Burgh in the closing stages to touch in a Games record of 58.94 seconds, with home favourite Ross Murdoch taking the bronze.

Adam Peaty, pictued underwater during his winning race, took gold in a Games record time of 58.94 seconds . The Uttoxeter swimmer trailed Van der Burgh by 0.70 seconds at the turn, but had timed his race to perfection as he stormed past the South African to win by 0.34 seconds, becoming the first Briton to go under 59 seconds in the process. Peaty, who described the victory as a 'dream', said he had not been fazed by the prospect of taking on the might of Van der Burgh. Asked if he was nervous about facing the man he described as his 'idol' turned 'rival', he said: 'Not really, he has obviously got a lot of pressure on him. 'I just tried to swim my race. I knew he would go out fast, as I have studied his racing quite a few times, but I stuck to my guns and it paid off in the end. 'We are all human at the end of the day, we all have nerves and feelings and that is the way you have to approach it.' There was more medal success for England's women as the quartet of Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, Amelia Maughan, Ellie Faulkner and Becki Turner took bronze in the 4x200m freestyle. Wales' Georgia Davies claimed silver in the 100m backstroke, finishing in 59.58 as she was edged out by Australia's Emily Seebohm, while in the S14 200m freestyle 15-year-old Thomas Hamer took silver, with Wales' Jack Thomas getting the bronze.","Fran Halsall wins 50m freestyle gold to kick start golden night for England .

"By . Julian Robinson . Former boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who is now living as a woman, has said her transgender struggle led her to attempt suicide. The 61-year-old, now known as Kellie, guided boxer Lennox Lewis to lift the world heavyweight boxing title during a successful career. Maloney, who was last night backed by Lewis and other sporting personalities for telling her story, told how she could not cope with leading a double life. Scroll down for video . Boxing promoter Frank Maloney, now living as a woman called Kellie, said her transgender struggle led her to attempt suicide . 'It got to a point where I just couldn't cope any longer. I couldn't go on and I had to end it,' the father-of-three told the Mirror. 'I had always believed that suicide was the coward's way out but my life was being torn apart.' She explained that she went home at Christmas in 2012 in a last attempt to rescue her marriage. But it turned into an 'absolute disaster' and at one point, she said, she went out to walk the dogs and attempted suicide. The next day she broke down and told her daughter how she had lived her life feeling trapped in the wrong body. In a lengthy interview she had told the newspaper she is now undergoing gender reassignment therapy. Maloney, pictured as a man, is now undergoing gender reassignment therapy . She thanked the public for the positive reaction she received, including comments on social media from former footballer Stan Collymore and boxing commentator Steve Bunce. Reacting to the news Lewis said he respects Maloney's decision. Lewis said: 'I was just as shocked as anyone at the news about my former promoter and my initial thought was that it was a wind up. The great thing about life, and boxing, is that, day to day, you never know what to expect. 'This world we live in isn't always cut and dried or black and white, and coming from the boxing fraternity, I can only imagine what a difficult decision this must be for Kellie. Top of their game: Frank Maloney (in Union Flag suit), right, with WBC World Heavyweight Champ Lennox Lewis, left, in Atlantic City in October 1997 . 'However, having taken some time to read Kellie's statements, I understand better what she, and others in similar situations, are going through. I think that ALL people should be allowed to live their lives in a way that brings them harmony and inner peace. 'I respect Kellie's decision and say that if this is what brings about true happiness in her life, than so be it.' Maloney announced his intention to call time on his 30-year career with immediate effect last October. His decision brought an end to a colourful career which saw him guide Lewis to glory despite memorably being derided as a 'mental midget' by US promoter Don King. Lewis said on Twitter when Maloney retired: 'Big up 2 Frank Maloney on a massive career in the fight game. Gonna miss those Union Jack suits. All the best to u and urs.' Maloney's garish suits might have earned him fame as Lewis's sidekick, but his jovial image belied a shrewd boxing brain as he swerved King's obstacles to lead Lewis to the top. Maloney said when he retired: 'Boxing has given me some great times but it's not the same business I grew to love any more. 'The characters have gone and gradually over the last six months I have realised that I don't want to be involved in it any more.' By JANE FAE . Transgender writer and campaigner . While many might be shocked by Frank Maloney’s transition into Kellie, it comes as no surprise to me. There’s no rule which says that hairdressers are more likely to be transgender than sporting professionals. If anything, the opposite holds true. There is so much blame and shame about being transgender that many will do all they can to hide it – often taking up careers that exaggerate their birth gender. So men may be more macho and women more feminine. It can make the transition more of a shock to other people, but not to those who have been through it. For me, that was four years ago. Happily settled with my partner of seven years and two young children, I decided aged 52 that I could no longer live as a man and needed to become ‘Jane’. Support often arrives from unexpected directions. I was working as a science and technology writer, and the atmosphere in the office was laddish. I dreaded returning to work as Jane, but I was surprised and grateful for the nonchalant way my male colleagues reacted. One said of my painted nails ‘the colour doesn’t suit you’, while the rest just got on with work as usual. Friendships endured. Family members were supportive. My partner stood by me. And that’s how it should be. My heart goes out to Kellie. Transition opens the door to public abuse and discrimination – but for some people changing gender is necessary, and my own experience shows it can lead to happiness.","Lennox Lewis' former mentor, 61, now lives as a woman called Kellie .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A man in Glasgow was given an unwelcome surprise while cleaning his kitchen - when he found a huge tarantula lurking behind the oven. The hairy Chilean rose tarantula, which can have a leg span of up to six inches, was hidden behind the appliance before the man spotted it scuttling across the ground. But while the sight of the creeping intruder would send many running away screaming, the man remained calm and used a glass and a piece of cardboard to keep the creature cornered. Hairy and scary: The tarantula that crept out from behind the oven in Glasgow. The man who found the spider remained calm enough to corner the creature with a glass and piece of cardboard . He then phoned the Scottish Society for the Protection of Animals who arrived to remove the animal safely. The spider is now being looked after by staff at the Glasgow . Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre, where staff have named it Incy. Chilean rose tarantulas are popular pets and staff at the centre believe that it could have escaped from a nearby flat. They are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. [caption] . New home: The Chilean rose tarantula was found in a flat on High Street in Glasgow. Officers from the Scottish SPCA would like to return the tarantula to its owner. Pictured: Nearby Sauchiehall Street . 'It's possible the tarantula belongs to someone in a nearby flat and we'd really like to return him home if he has gone missing. 'If no-one comes forward we'll find him a new owner who understands his needs.' Anyone who recognises the tarantula is being asked to contact the Scottish SPCA centre in Glasgow on 03000 999 999. The Chilean rose tarantula, native to Northern Chile, is one of the most popular species to be kept as a pet. The spiders, which can have a leg span of up to about 5 or 6 inches, can be kept in an enclosure that is just 18 inches long. Though generally considered a docile species, the Chilean rose tarantula can be skittish and has been known to escape from enclosures or quickly creep out of sight when it senses danger. Those who keep them as pets are warned to keep their enclosures tightly shut. Chilean rose spiders have not been kept as pets long enough to accurately say how long they can live for, but it is thought that female spiders live between 15 and 20 years - with some living more than 20 years.","Identified as Chilean rose tarantula, which has leg span of up to six inches .

She blew vast sums of money then stole even more in a doomed attempt to claw back her losses by winning the jackpot, Jersey’s Royal Court heard. Patricia Lomas, pictured, blew vast sums of money then stole even more in a doomed attempt to claw back her losses by winning the jackpot, Jersey's Royal Court heard . Lomas spent a total of £759,625 on gaming websites in five years, of which £542,610 was taken from other people’s accounts. She admitted taking the money, telling the court she was a 'hostage' to her gambling habit - but was jailed for four years. Deputy Bailiff William Bailhache told her: 'You did have six members of staff under you. Although not at director level you have a position of responsibility inside the company. 'The court sentences you on this indictment to four years. It does so with regret because we understand that you are remorseful and you realise what you have done.' The court heard Lomas abused her position to manipulate reports and doctor statements while she was an investment support manager at Ashburton (Jersey) Limited. By the time the money was found missing in 2013 she had spent £10,000 on dental work, £3,400 on laser eye surgery and £12,795 on a car. But Crown Advocate David Hopwood told the court the vast majority of the money was spent on internet bingo and other gaming websites. Lomas spent £6,805 on her habit in 2008 but started to bet much bigger sums after she began raiding her clients’ accounts in January 2009. As she tried in vain to win back her losses, she spent more and more, frittering away £276,765 between January and November 2013 and betting an average of £228 each time she played. Patricia Lomas was jailed for four years at Jersey's Royal Courts, pictured, after admitting one count of larceny . Lomas, who moved from Manchester to the Channel Islands in 1983, wept as her crimes were described to Jersey’s Superior Number, which only sits for the island’s most serious cases. Advocate Alexander English, defending, said her gambling addiction was triggered by the 'stresses and strains' of her working environment. He said she was of previous good character, had cooperated fully with police and even told her employers about potential 'deficiencies' in their operating practices. Mr English said: 'She then became hostage to this ill-fated decision. 'She never won enough money to pay back the money she stole, leading her to steal more and more in the vain hope she would win the jackpot to win it back.' Lomas admitted one count of larceny at the earliest possible opportunity. But Deputy Bailiff Bailhache said he did not view a gambling addiction as a mitigating factor.","Patricia Lomas, 55, funnelled cash from investors into her own accounts .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Learning from others: Chimps learn how to peel and break into fruit from watching others, scientists found . It is not just humans who are fascinated by watching others cook – chimps also pick up tips on how to prepare food. A study found that just as people learn new cookery techniques by watching celebrity chefs, chimps learn how to crack and peel fruit by studying their companions. Researcher Bruce Rawlings said: ‘It is almost like they are watching the top chef and picking up information.’ Learning from others is an important part of building up cultural traditions – an ability thought of as being fundamentally human. However, the Portsmouth University research suggests that it may actually date back more than six million years, to the time when chimps and humans shared a common ancestor. The researchers videoed three groups of chimps as they were fed hard-shelled fruit in a Zambian wildlife orphanage. The creatures used six different techniques to access the fruit’s flesh, including cracking two fruits together, banging the fruit on the ground and taking a small bite to get the peeling process started. The favoured techniques differed across the groups. For instance, the banging two fruits together was used by two of the groups but not a third. Each group contained members from around Africa, meaning their behaviour couldn’ t be explained by genetics. And as the various groups couldn’t see each other and they weren’t taught how to eat the fruit by their keepers, it is thought that they were learning through observing others – a key part of establishing cultural traditions and differences. Mr Rawlings, a psychologist, said: ‘Culture is a hallmark of the human species. Watch and learn: Humans learn how to cook from watching celebrity chefs like Jamie Oliver, pictured. It seems the technique can also be observed in chimps linking the species . ‘As humans we might learn the best way to crack a nut or stone a peach form watching someone lese and it appears chimpanzees learn how to handle their food in similar ways.’ The study, published in the journal Animal Cognition, also revealed that some of the chimps stockpiled peeled fruit to eat later. The self-control and mental ‘time-travel’ involved in planning a future meal suggest the creatures are capable of complex thought.","Chimps learn about preparing fruit from watching friends, study shows .

Scientists say the wooden puppet could only have told 13 fibs before his nose became so long and heavy that his neck snapped. In a bit of fun research, Steffan Llewllyn, of Leicester University, began by estimating the dimensions and properties of Pinocchio’s head. The story of Pinocchio became a huge hit when it was made into a popular Disney film in 1940, but scientists say the puppet would not have been able to tell any more than 13 lies . He then estimated that carved from oak, it would have weighed just over 9lb, with a nose an inch in length. If the nose doubled in length which each lie, the thirteenth would have put such a strain on his neck that it would have broken. The researcher said he realised that the ability of Pinocchio's nose to grow was 'extraordinary'. He added: 'Nevertheless, this unique ability can be of great concern for the puppet, and lengthy, extensive lies are advised against, for the health and wellbeing of Pinocchio.' The analysis of the children’s favourite by Carlo Collodi is detailed in the Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics which showcases fun but accurate science done by students. Carlo Collodi, Pinocchio's creator, has had the science behind his famous character tested by scientists . The researcher's theory was not tested in the popular tale, as in the original story, written by the Italian author in 1883, the puppet only told three lies. The study is the latest report to examine the myths and science behind popular cartoons and fairytales. Last year, researchers claimed that the  legendary strengthening effect that eating spinach had on cartoon character Popeye was born out of a mathmatical mistake by a German scientist. In 1870, German chemist Erich von Wolf was researching the amount of iron in spinach and other green vegetables. When writing up his findings in a new notebook, he misplaced a decimal point, making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality. The story goes that cartoon creators were aware of the supposedly miraculous health properties of spinach spread by the erroneous research and had the idea that Popeye should eat spinach to increase his strength.","Scientists have tested how long the character's nose could have grown .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Seasoned traveller: This tiny red-necked phalarope clocked up a remarkable 16,000 miles in a round-trip from Shetland to Peru . He may not be much to look at but this little fellow is a record breaker. Despite weighing less than a bag of crisps, the red-necked phalarope clocked up a remarkable 16,000 miles in a round-trip from Shetland to Peru. The incredible journey is the longest recorded for a European breeding bird - and one of the world’s great migrations. Malcolm Smith of the RSPB said: ‘To think this bird, which is smaller than a starling, can undertake such an arduous journey and return safely to Shetland is truly extraordinary.’ The red-necked phalarope is one of Britain’s rarest birds, with as few as 15 nesting sites in the Shetlands and the Western Isles. It has been thought that after breeding in Scotland, they set off eastwards to winter in the Arabian sea. But a tiny tracking device weighing less than a paperclip and worn like a backpack revealed they go somewhere else entirely. Mr Smith said: ‘When this guy left Shetland, he headed west straight across the north Atlantic, via Iceland and Greenland. ‘He went down the eastern seaboard of North America into the Caribbean, crossed into the Pacific where he wintered in the warm waters of Ecuador and Peru before returning back by more or less the same route. ‘That’s one of the world’s great migrations.’ Mr Smith told BBC Scotland that he almost fell out of his chair when a tag on discovering the details and added: ‘We are freezing up here in Shetland and it’ s quite nice to think of our red-necked phalaropes bobbing about in the warm tropical waters of the Pacific. ‘It means that what we thought was a medium-distance migrant is a long-distance migrant. Incredible journey: The bird flew west from Shetland, across the north Atlantic and down the eastern seaboard of North America, before crossing the Pacific to reach Peru . Data: A tiny tracking device attached to the phalarope revealed how far the bird had travelled . Lightweight: The tracking device worn like a backpack on the bird is no bigger than a paperclip . ‘It is one of the world’s great migrations.’ One of Britain’s rarest birds, the red-necked phalarope is a wader that arrives in Scotland in mid to late May and mates and raises its young before setting off again in July or August. In a reversal of gender roles, the more brightly coloured female often leaves the male sitting on the eggs while she touts for new mates. Despite their marathon migration the red-necked phalarope does not hold the world record. The Arctic term travels a colossal 43,000 miles in a round trip between the two poles makes it the ultimate long-distance traveller.

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . and Katy Winter . Passing on juicy information about others might be dismissed as idle chatter, but gossip can be good for society, scientists claim. A study revealed the exchange of hearsay can shame bullies and cheats into changing their ways. Conventional wisdom holds that gossip and social exclusion are always malicious, undermining trust and morale in groups. But sharing this kind of 'reputational information' could have benefits for society, according to the new study. Talking about others can actually have positive consequences and serves a purpose within a group . Researchers . divided more 216 men and women into teams of four, asking them to play a game and make financial . choices that would benefit their respective groups. They were given tokens that could be donated to a fund for the good of the group, and the rules . of the game meant those who did not give anything ended up with more . money than those who paid into the central pot. Before . moving on to the next round with an entirely new group, people taking . part could gossip about their previous group members. Gossip can serve as a tool by which groups reform bullies, encourage cooperation and stop exploitation of 'nice people' Future . group members then received that information and could decide to . exclude - ostracise - a suspect participant from the group before . deciding to make their next financial choices. Players were allowed to . warn others about such freeloaders and exclude them from future rounds. Participants readily gossiped about each others’ reputations and . ostracised those who hoarded their cash. The study, in the journal Psychological Science, found those who were frozen out learned their lesson and were more generous when brought back into the fold. The . researchers found that when people learn about the behaviour of others . through gossip, they use this information to align with those deemed . co-operative. Dr . Matthew Feinberg, of Stanford University, said: ‘Groups that allow . their members to gossip sustain co-operation and deter selfishness . better than those who don’t.’ 'And groups do even better if they can gossip and ostracise untrustworthy members. While both of these behaviours can be misused, our findings suggest that they also serve very important functions for groups and society.' Co-author Doctor Robb Willer, an associate professor of sociology at Stanford, said: 'By removing defectors, more cooperative individuals can more freely invest in the public good without fear of exploitation.' However, there is hope for the . cast-offs. When people know that others may gossip about them - and . experience the resulting social exclusion - they tend to learn from the . experience and reform their behaviour by cooperating more in future . group settings. In contrast, . highly anonymous groups - such as many internet message boards - lack . accountability and thereby allow anti-social behaviour to thrive. Dr . Willer said: 'Those who do not reform their behaviour, behaving . selfishly despite the risk of gossip and ostracism, tended to be . targeted by other group members who took pains to tell future group . members about the person’s untrustworthy behaviour. Groups do even better if they can gossip and ostracise untrustworthy members, though the behaviour can can misused . 'These future groups could then detect and exclude more selfish individuals, ensuring they could avoid being taken advantage of.' He added: 'Despite negative connotations, the pairing of the capacity to gossip and to ostracise undesirable individuals from groups has a strong positive effect on co-operation levels in groups. 'I think it does speak to the mechanisms that keep people behaving honestly and generously in many settings and, where behaviour is entirely anonymous, helps explain when they don't.'","Groups fare better if permitted to gossip about untrustworthy members .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Warning: Researchers have suggested that Babies born by caesarean section are more likely to struggle with their weight as adults . Babies born by caesarean section are more likely to struggle with their weight as adults, experts warn. The biggest study of its kind found the odds of being overweight or obese were around 25 per cent higher for those born by C-section when compared with those delivered naturally. The analysis of data on more than 150,000 births from four continents suggests some of the seeds of obesity are sown the moment a child enters the world. The finding comes amid a record number of caesarean deliveries worldwide and the researchers, from Imperial College London, said mothers-to-be should be made aware of the link. Data from 15 studies carried out in ten different countries, including the UK, showed that the odds of being overweight are 26 per cent higher for babies born by C-section, while the odds of being obese are 22 per cent higher. These adults are also, on average, half a BMI point heavier than those delivered naturally. This equates to around 3lb of extra weight for a 5ft4in woman, or 4lb of extra weight for a  5ft10in man. The number of C-sections in England has doubled in 30 years, with around one in four babies now born this way. The figure is as high as 50 per cent in some private hospitals. The increase is blamed on a number of factors, from a society that is averse to pain, to older mothers enduring difficult births. Women who are ‘too posh to push’ – or request the surgery for non-medical reasons – account for about 7 per cent of the figure. Obesity is also on the rise, with only around a third of adults in England at a healthy weight. The study’s senior author, Professor Neena Modi, said: ‘There are good reasons why C-section may be the best option for many mothers and their babies, and C- sections can on occasion be life-saving. Findings: The biggest study of its kind found the odds of being overweight or obese were around 25 per cent higher for those born by C-section when compared with those delivered naturally . ‘However, we need to understand the long-term outcomes in order to provide the best advice to women who are considering caesarean delivery. This study shows that babies born by C-section are more likely to be overweight or obese later in life. ‘We now need to determine whether this is the result of the C-section, or if other reasons explain the association.’ The link between C-section delivery and obesity may be because bigger babies are more likely to be born by caesarean. Women who have the procedure are also less likely to breastfeed, which could raise the risk of their child piling on the pounds when it gets older. Researcher Dr Matthew Hyde suggested that missing out on a natural birth may have long-lasting effects on the baby’s metabolism. Link: Women who have the procedure are less likely to breastfeed, which could raise the risk of their child piling on the pounds when it gets older . For instance, the compression that occurs when a baby is born naturally leads to an increase in stress hormones, which switch on genes required for life outside  the womb. A natural birth also affects a child’s gut bacteria, which has an impact on metabolism and  fat storage. Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, the study authors said further research was needed ‘as a matter of urgency’. Mervi Jokinen, of the Royal College of Midwives, said the study adds to evidence about the dangers of C-sections and the decision to have one ‘should not be  taken lightly’. She added: ‘Whilst some caesarean sections are needed for medical reasons, many are not and we would encourage women to think carefully and weigh up the evidence before they decide to have a non-urgent caesarean.’","Data from more than 150,000 births from four continents studied by experts .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Mums have long advised their young daughters to ignore the antics of teenage boys because girls are far more sensible anyway. Now there’s research to back up their theory – after a study found that the brain matures earlier in girls than in boys. The Newcastle University researchers said this could help explain why teenage girls seem to grow up faster than their male classmates. A study of 121 people between the ages of four and 40 has found that the brain matures earlier in girls than in boys . The Newcastle University researchers said the speed at which the brain matures could help explain why teenage girls seem to grow up faster than their male classmates . As we get older, parts of the brain become smaller as unnecessary connections between cells are pruned away, leaving a more streamlined and efficient processing machine. The scientists used scans to peer deep inside the brains of 121 people aged between four and 40. This showed that the pruning process began at around the age of ten for girls – but not until around 20 for men. Explaining the brain’s streamlining process, researcher Dr Marcus Kaiser said: ‘This is part of the normal learning process. The brain as a whole is still expanding but it is losing connections. ‘It is like if you are at a party and everyone is talking and you can’t concentrate. But if some of the voices go, it is easier to hear. The pruning process began at around the age of ten for girls ¿ but not until around 20 for men . ‘It is similar in the brain. If some of the connections are not there, it is easier to do the work.’ The study, published in journal Cerebral Cortex, also showed that key, long-distance connections between brain regions are preserved. Researcher . Sol Lim said: ‘The loss of connectivity during brain development can . actually help to improve brain function by reorganizing the network more . efficiently. ‘Say . instead of talking to many people at random, asking a couple of people . who have lived in the area for a long time is the most efficient way to . know your way. ‘In a similar way, reducing some projections in the brain helps to focus on essential information.’","Newcastle University researchers found the brain matures earlier in girls .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . A British university is to abandon experiments on baboons in Africa after an undercover investigation exposed ‘terrible suffering and cruelty’. Harrowing pictures revealed by the Mail showed the intelligent and sociable monkeys peering out of their bare wire cages, babies clinging to each other for comfort and adults having pieces of their brain removed on the operating table. One particularly distressing image showed a newly-caught baby baboon suckling its mother as she was given an identification tattoo at the primate research centre in Kenya. Experiments: One of the distressing images of Baboons in Kenya revealed by the Mail following an undercover investigation . Experiments on baboons and other primates caught in the wild are banned in the UK due to concerns about the suffering involved in trapping and transporting them. But an investigation British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection revealed that Newcastle University scientists were flying thousands of miles to Kenya to do work on baboons captured on the African plains. The lead researcher, Professor Stuart Baker, made an impassioned defence of his quest to find vital new treatments for stroke patients. He also denied bypassing British law, saying the welfare concerns behind the ban did not apply to his work in Africa because the baboons are not endangered, are caught humanely and are only transported a short distance. Newcastle University has announced it is to pull the research in Kenya almost three weeks after the images came to light . He said that one of his reasons for going . to the Institute of Primate Research in Nairobi was to improve animal . welfare standards and conditions had improved greatly during his time . there. The use of bare, single cages is being phased out and large split-level compounds with tree ‘climbing frames’ are being built. But now, almost three weeks after the images came to light, the university has announced it is to pull the research in Kenya. Joanna Lumley was one of 22,000 people to sign a petition against the experiments . All other overseas projects will be reviewed. It is unclear what the U-turn will mean for the Professor Baker’s work on stroke. Professor Chris Brink, the vice-chancellor, said the baboon project began before the latest guidelines on overseas animal research were published. He added that Newcastle University is ‘committed to excellent standards of animal welfare’ and to reducing the use of animals in research. The climbdown follows growing public support of the BUAV’s campaign for the taxpayer-funded experiments to be scrapped. Two petitions attracted more than 22,000 experiments, Parliamentary questions were tabled and celebrities including actress Joanna Lumley, comedian Ricky Gervais and wildlife presenter Chris Packham joined the call for the work to be stopped. The BUAV said that concern from other Newcastle University researchers may also have played a role in the project being pulled. Sarah Kite, the charity’s director of special projects, said: ‘We welcome this move by Newcastle University to stop this controversial research in Kenya. ‘The BUAV investigation has caused a public outcry; people have been shocked and repulsed by our findings and it is only right that the University should respond in this way. ‘It makes a mockery of UK law if researchers can use public funds to go overseas to carry out horrific research on wild-caught primates that would not be allowed in the UK.’","Newcastle University scientists were flying to Kenya to work on baboons captured on the African plains .

Instead, they’d be happier to all be given the same thing. Research has shown  the problem of what to buy your family and friends this Christmas has been solved - buy them the same thing. File picture . Scientists say when we choose presents for lots of people we tend to focus too much on trying to get everyone a different thing. As a result, we don’t buy them the things they’d really like. In other words, by trying to be thoughtful, we choose the wrong present. The US researchers did six experiments in which they shoppers were asked to choose a gift or card for one person or for presents for two people with similar interests. When shopping for one, the volunteers tended to choose the most appealing gift. For instance, they would pick an Amazon gift voucher rather than one for the university bookshop. The study showed the more thoughtful shoppers tried to be, the more the gifts they bought were disliked. File picture . But when shopping for two, they tended to pass up the more appealing gift in favour of getting different presents for each person. A spokesman for the researchers said: ‘Consider someone giving a magazine subscription to two friends, both of whom are avid sports fans. ‘Instead of getting both friends a sports magazine, the giver might select a technology magazine for the first friend and a travel magazine for the second, even though both friends might have preferred a sports magazine and even though the giver might have given a sports magazine to either friend if he or she were the only recipient.’ The experiments, detailed in the Journal of Consumer Research, showed that the more thoughtful the shoppers tried to be, the more they choose less liked gifts. What is more, the shoppers persisted in buying different presents for people with the same interests, even when they were told they did not know each other and didn’t have any friends in common. The University of Cincinnati researchers said: ‘It may seem more thoughtful to give individual gifts that convey an understanding of each recipient’s unique identity than to give less personalised gifts, even if those less personalised gifts may be liked better overall. ‘Givers may feel that getting the same gift for multiple recipients is taking the easy way out. ‘Givers may lose sight of the fact that recipients would rather receive the item that they like best over an item that individuates them from another recipient who happens to simultaneously be on the fiver’s mind.’ If that wasn’t enough to persuade you to not waste too much time on your Christmas shopping, previous research has shown that recipients tend to underestimate the price of gifts. They also fail to fully appreciate the amount of thought put in.","Study in Journal of Consumer Research suggests we waste time choosing different gifts for our friends and family .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . The dream of creating ethically sound stem cells on a large scale to combat diseases from Alzheimer’s to cancer is closer to being realised. Scientists say they have found a way to produce stem cells that overcome the issues relating to the death of the embryos. And the method for cultivating large quantities of cells involves no animal products or human cells that could introduce contaminants, the Swedish researchers say in the journal Nature Communications. The dream of being able to use stem cells as a repair kit for diseases from Alzheimer's to cancer is now a step closer to being realised .

The method is already used in IVF and so it is known that the remainder of the embryo can still become a baby. Researcher . Karl Tryggvason said: ‘We know the embryo can survive the removal of a . single cell. This makes a huge ethical difference.’ Just . as importantly, the Swedes have also worked out how to make the lone . cell grow and multiply, using a lab-made version of a protein that is . found in the embryo.

Professor Trggvason said: ‘Using this technology, the supply of human embryonic stem cells is no longer a problem. ‘It will be possible to establish a bank where stem cells can be matched by tissue type, which is important for avoiding transplants being rejected.’ Another possibility is a single stem cell could be removed from an embryo before IVF treatment and then used to generate tailor-made treatments should that baby become ill later in life. British experts said the breakthrough . would be welcomed by those battling devastating diseases but cautioned . that the removal of even a single cell from a fledgling embryo is not . without risk. Scientists think their discovery could eventually lead to cures for diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease . Dagan Wells, an Oxford University IVF expert, said: ‘A method capable of providing a reliable supply of stem cells, without harming human embryos, could prove to be a wonderful advance. ‘The method is a promising development, although it probably won’t entirely eliminate ethical issues. ‘It is true that a single cell can be removed from very early embryos, but the procedure does carry a small risk that the embryos will not survive. ‘Despite these limitations, the research seems to be on the right track and will undoubtedly be welcomed by patients affected by a wide variety of crippling diseases.’","Swedish scientists say they have written the recipe for making ethically acceptable, highly versatile stem cells in large numbers .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . A protein that holds one of the secrets to creating life has been discovered by scientists in Britain giving hope to childless couples . A protein that holds one of the secrets to creating life has been discovered by British scientists. The breakthrough brings hope of better treatment for childless women and could also help in the development of contraceptives. The protein, given the name Juno after the Roman goddess of marriage and fertility, is thought to be studded on the surface of human eggs. It is essential for fertility as it ‘mates’ with a partner protein on the sperm at the moment of conception. Juno holds the key to fertility – without it the sperm and egg cannot fuse to create new life. Researcher Gavin Wright, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, said: ‘We have solved a long-standing mystery in biology by identifying the molecules displayed on all sperm and eggs that must bind to each other at the moment we were conceived. ‘Without this essential interaction, fertilisation just cannot happen. We may be able to use this discovery to improve fertility treatments and develop new contraceptives.’ Since 2005, when an essential protein was found on the head of sperm, the search has been on for its female counterpart. The Sanger Institute team created an artificial version of the sperm protein – called Izumo, after a marriage shrine in Japan – and  used it to hunt out its egg version. On finding Juno, they did a series of tests on mice that proved it to be necessary for fertilisation. Importantly, mice that were unable to make Juno seemed perfectly healthy but were infertile. Although they made eggs, sperm were unable to bind to them, the journal Nature reports. The experiments also revealed that Juno is quickly removed from the surface of an egg after fertilisation occurs. This ensures only one sperm binds with the egg and increases the odds of a successful pregnancy. It is thought that a similar protein is found on women’s eggs – and that flaws in it could explain why some couples cannot have children. If this is the case, women found to have a faulty Juno protein could be treated with ICSI, a special type of IVF in which the sperm is injected directly into the egg. This would bypass the flawed Juno . protein. Dr Wright said: ‘If this Juno protein is missing in infertile . women, what we can do is perform a very simple genetic screen test that . isn’t invasive. ‘This would allow is to guide the fertility treatment so that women can proceed directly to ICSI. A team at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge made the breakthrough - giving the protein the name Juno after the Roman goddess for fertility and marriage. Stock picture . ‘And that would save the trauma and expense of going through rounds of fertility treatment. ‘By identifying this interaction between Juno and Izumo, we now know the identity of the proteins  found on the surface of our father’s sperm and our mother’s egg that must interact at the moment at which we were conceived – the moment we were made.’ Researcher Dr Erin Bianchi said: ‘Infertility is becoming an increasing problem, especially in Western countries, and it is remarkable that 20 per cent of infertility cases have an unexplained cause. ‘We are now testing whether Juno is involved in these cases.’ Dr Allan Pacey, a Sheffield University fertility expert, said: ‘The identification of the Juno protein opens up many exciting prospects. Perhaps the most obvious  biomedical application of this  finding is whether screening for this protein could be used as a test of fertility.’ The discovery could also lead to new types of contraceptive not be based on hormones – and thus free from the unwelcome side-effects of existing drugs.","Breakthrough made by scientists at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Two-thirds of parents of overweight children are in denial – and some even think their youngsters are in need of fattening up, a study found. The researchers warned that parents need to recognise the problem if they are to tackle it. In England, 22 per cent of children are overweight or obese on starting school. By age 10 or 11, 33 per cent have a weight problem. Many parents do not realise their children are overweight but it can cause a lifetime of health problems . Although it is easy to dismiss chubbiness as puppy fat that will be grown out of, childhood obesity can create a lifelong legacy of health problems from heart disease to cancer and diabetes. It may also affect a child’s chances in life, with recent research finding obese schoolchildren get lower grades. In the latest study, the Swedish researchers weighed and measured more than 16,000 boys and girls aged between two and nine and from eight European countries. Parents were asked their perception of their child’s weight. This revealed that 63 per cent of parents of overweight children thought them to be a normal size. In some cases, parents of children who were so overweight that they were classed as obese believed them to be underweight. The International Congress on Obesity heard that perceptions were most skewed in southern European countries – where obesity rates are higher than in the north. The Gothenburg University researchers said this suggests that our idea of a healthy weight is based on what we see around us. So, if a child’s friends are overweight, we believe it is normal for our child to be a similar size. Parents may also dismiss dangerous levels of plumpness as ‘puppy fat’ that will be grown out of. Staffan Marild said: ‘But research doesn’t support that at all. ‘The vast majority of children that are obese aged four will remain obese for the rest of their lives.’ He added that the tendency of well-meaning grandparents and divorced parents to spoil children is also a ‘great problem’. Dr Marild added that regular weighing and measuring of children from a young age could help get the message across to parents. The threat of childhood obesity will be one of the main themes discussed at the Kuala Lumpur conference. Professor Walmir Coutinho, president-elect of the World Obesity Forum, which is running the event, said: ‘Once people become obese it is very hard for them to return to a normal body weight.’ The study didn’t include the UK. However, previous British research has come up with similar figures, with seven in ten parents of overweight children refusing to accept the problem. Plus, British adults are increasingly failing to recognise that their own weight is an issue.","By age 10 or 11, one third of children in England are overweight .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . English men might want to look away now. Italians came out on top in a ‘sex of the nations survey’. Some 64 per cent of the Italian men and women polled said they were satisfied with their love life. A poll found 64 per cent of Italians are satisfied with their love lives compared to 54 per cent of English people. The survey was conducted as part of a drive, supported by rugby players Sean Maitland of Scotland (left) and Danny Care of England (right), to encourage people to seek help for their sexual health problems . England only managed a below average 54 per cent – the lowest of the six nations surveyed. However, Scots shouldn’t be too smug. The survey of more than 6,000 people from Italy, France, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland found Scots to have the lowest expectations. Almost one in ten said they expect sex to last less than two minutes. The poll also revealed Scottish people have the lowest sexual expectations. Dan Biggar of Wales (pictured) has also been involved in the campaign . In contrast over a third of Italians think more than ten minutes to be the norm. The . research, commissioned to help highlight the prevalence of premature . ejaculation, the most common male sexual health problem, also found that . more than one fifth of people would like sex to last longer. However, few had aired their concerns with their doctor, with the English, Scots and Welsh being least likely to seek help. Martin Tod, chief executive of the Men’s Health Forum, said: ‘Premature ejaculation can lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment. ‘It can have a real negative impact on quality of life for men and their partners. ‘It is more common than people think and men should not feel embarrassed to do something about it. ‘Help is available from your GP.  There’s no need to suffer in silence.’ The research was done for drug company Menarini, which has teamed up with international rugby players, Danny Care, Sean Maitland and Dan Biggar, to encourage people to seek help for sexual problems.","64 per cent of Italian men and women are happy with their love lives .

"By . Aap . Slain: Dan 'Selina' Lin was killed by her mother-in-law Huajiao Zhuang who bashed her 33 times with a hammer. Zhuang was found guilty of the murder on Thursday in the Victorian Supreme Court . A Melbourne grandmother who killed her daughter-in-law by hitting her with a hammer more than 30 times has been jailed for 18 years. Huajiao Zhuang, 50, of Reservoir, must serve a 13-and-a-half year minimum for the murder.The Victorian Supreme Court heard Zhuang murdered her 21-year-old daughter-in-law Dan 'Selina' Lin by repeatedly striking her with a hammer in front of her young grandson at Ms Lin's Bundoora home on May 3, 2012. In sentencing, Justice Stephen Kaye said there had been a history of animosity between the pair over cultural issues and Zhuang's interference in the marriage, which boiled over into a violent outburst as Ms Lin was about to bathe her two-year-old son. Zhuang bashed her daughter-in-law to death so her son could marry someone else. In sentencing, Justice Stephen Kaye said there had been a history of animosity between the pair over cultural issues and Zhuang's interference in the marriage, which boiled over into a violent outburst as Ms Lin was about to bathe her two-year-old son. Justice Kaye said the relationship between the pair had deteriorated badly by the time the murder occurred. 'It is clear that Selina did not like you, and she resented your interference in her marriage. At times she was prepared to stand up to you and to refuse to comply with your wishes,' the judge said on Wednesday. 'On the other hand, I am well satisfied on the evidence that you developed a strong sense of hostility towards Selina. Guilty: Huajiao Zhuang, 50, had to be physically assisted from court after the jury handed down their verdict . 'On two previous occasions, that underlying feeling of animosity towards Selina was so intense that it erupted into acts of physical violence towards her.' Justice Kaye said immediately after the murder, Zhuang left her grandson alone as she placed Ms Lin's body in a nylon suitcase, cleaned up the scene, and put the suitcase with the body in a neighbour's wheelie bin. The judge said in the early hours of the next morning, Zhuang pushed the wheelie bin 800 metres down the road to a nearby creek. She tipped the bag down a steep bank into the creek, and hid the wheelie bin. Justice Kaye said later that morning, Zhuang told her daughter that she had to defend herself from Ms Lin, and then reported it to the police, wrongly claiming self-defence. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in striking the blows which caused the death of Selina, you did not act under the apprehension that Selina was, or might have been, posing any danger to yourself,' Justice Kaye said. 'Rather, you killed Selina in the course of an uncontrollable burst of anger arising out of the argument that had arisen between you and Selina.' Crime scene: Police inspect the house at the centre of Lin's horrific death . Grizzly discovery: Dan 'Selina' Lim's body is found by police in the Darebin creek . Zhuang claimed she acted in self-defence but in May a jury convicted her of the murder. Ms Lin's death was the culmination of a long-running feud with her mother-in-law, who claimed the 21-year-old didn't pay her enough respect. It is understood Zhuang felt she did not have enough contact with or influence on her son and expected to live under the same roof, which Lin did not allow. During the trial, Prosecutor Peter Kidd said Zhuang wanted her son Peter to divorce Ms Lin and marry a woman from China so he could earn ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars’ from the woman's family, thanks to his permanent Australian residency. A school friend of Ms Lin once heard Zhuang ask her grandson ‘how would you like to change your mother?,’ Kidd told court. Zhuang had earlier told police the fatal fight broke out after a dispute over her grandson's bath water, something rubbished by the prosecutor.","Huajiao Zhuang, 50, found guilty of murder in the Victorian Supreme Court .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . It is still coat and scarf weather outside but indoors we are enjoying the height of summer. Research shows that the average household thermostat is set at 23C (73F) – a degree or two warmer than a typical summer’s day in the south of England. Some 36 per cent of people keep the gas dial at 25C (77F) and one in 20 has it turned right up to 30C (86F). How turning up the thermostat raises your gas bill . This is hotter than many a summer day in Sydney and well above the recommended temperature for good health. Emergency repair firm HomeServe, which commissioned the poll, warned that such hothousing is hitting our pockets severely – with every degree adding 10 per cent to already crippling energy costs. This means that £65 will be added to the average annual heating bill for each degree Celsius that the thermostat is turned up, according to the Energy Saving Trust. More than 2,000 adults were asked what temperature their central heating thermostat is set at, which room it was in, and how long they kept their heating on for. Despite spiralling power prices, 18 per cent said they leave their heating on day and night. Those aged 18 to 24 were among the least likely to hit the off button, with 23 per cent leaving it running unchecked. This may be because they have recently moved out of home and  are unused to budgeting and paying energy bills. Pricey: £65 will be added to the average annual heating bill for each degree Celsius that the thermostat is turned up, according to the Energy Saving Trust . In contrast, 36 per cent of pensioners polled said they worry about finding the cash to pay for gas and electricity. The survey also revealed that men are more likely than women to know what temperature their thermostat is set at. It found that most thermostats are in halls or spare bedrooms rather than the main living areas. The devices use the temperature of the air around them to control when the heating fires up, so this makes it more difficult for householders to heat the main rooms to exactly the right temperature. As a result, many end up cranking up the thermostat to ensure the rooms they use the most are warm enough. Martin Bennett, CEO of HomeServe said: ‘Sixty-nine per cent of thermostats are located away from key family areas like the living room, which makes it hard to run your heating efficiently. ‘Households are effectively guessing how warm their hallway has to be to make their living room a pleasant temperature. Keeping in mind that homes are far better insulated today, it’s neither necessary nor cost-effective to  heat homes to sub-tropical temperatures. ‘Between 18C and 21C is ideal for health and wellbeing and will help to ease pressure on your finances in the long run.’ Government health advice is that living rooms should be heated to temperatures of 21C (70F) and the rest of the house to 18C (64F). Its Cold Weather Plan states: ‘If you can’t heat all the rooms you use, heat the living room throughout the day and your bedroom just before you go to bed. ‘Remember to close curtains and shut doors to keep heat in the rooms you use most.’ A separate Government-commissioned report put the winter temperature of the average home at 17.7C (63.8F) – four degrees warmer than in 1970. Greater insulation, new building regulations and better boilers have all been credited with helping to lock in heat.","One in 20 people has the thermostat turned up to 30C (86F)

Andi Dorfman looked very put together on Tuesday, the day after it was announced she chose former baseball player Josh Murray as her fiancé on ABC's hit reality series The Bachelorette. The 27-year-old lawyer glowed as she showed off her diamond Neil Lane engagement ring to Kelly Ripa on Live With Kelly & Michael. Her good spirits were impressive considering less than 12 hours earlier in Los Angeles, the brunette beauty suffered a major embarrassment when the runner up Nick Viall told the audience at the After The Final Rose ceremony that they had 'made love' in the Fantasy Suite. Scroll down for video . The happy couple working the morning shows: On Tuesday Andi Dorfman and fiancé Josh Murray glowed as they appeared on Live With Kelly & Michael . It's a stunner: The 27-year-old showed off her Neil Lane rock, which is three carats and set in platinum . Andi was quick to address the 33-year-old's loose lips during the segment, which aired after she was seen handing out the final rose. 'First of all, I think that's kind of . below the belt and something that should be kept private,' she offered. 'The things I told you were real. The way I . kissed you, those things were real.' Sales account executive Viall also claimed he was 'completely blindsided' by the attorney's rejection. 'It's hard to misread some [little things],' he said. 'A lot of that stuff off camera … [like] when you tell someone . you love them and they say ""I wish I could say things back"" – you're . not supposed to assume things, but there's not much room for . interpretation.' The looker . also addressed Viall's bold admission - he is the first contestant who . has shared on ATFR that he got between the sheets in the Fantasy Suite - . while on Good Morning America earlier in the day. Not a bad time in her life: The attorney said she was enjoying being engaged and being able to talk about it as she sat down with Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan . Andi, You lit me up. You made me feel those things that people go a lifetime to find, and I feel like I made you feel the same. I truly hoped we would have made it into the real world, where there would be no arbitrary deadline, where those stresses that came with that environment would have melted away, where we could have had the goofy, fun, exciting relationship that I know we could have. What we had was real to me, and it was amazing. I fully realize that in the end I could have been wrong about what we had. While it’s hard to accept, I totally realize that it's a possibility. With that being said, when I think about the relationship that we had, very few things in my life have felt more real… I think about that moment when you ended things and what you said to me. I believe you when you said something didn’t feel right with us when you woke up that morning, but I wonder if what didn’t feel right was really about us and our relationship. I wonder if it would have been different if that night you thought about us with your heart and not with your head. Let’s just call it what it was--our relationship was very much the road less traveled. I totally get that all the passion, intensity, and connections that we had were accompanied by fear and sometimes discomfort. There is a reason why very few are willing to take the road less traveled. It can be scary, challenging, and risky, but if you have the courage to take it, it usually ends up being amazing. 'That's always the tough part,' Dorfman . said. 'That's kind of the nature of the . beast with the show. I had to break up with 24 guys in order to get the . one I really wanted and needed. 'It's always a little uncomfortable when . you have to watch the breakups and talk about them.' Viall also wrote a letter to Dorfman which was posted on the Bachelorette Facebook page. He discussed how he hoped they 'would have made it into the real world' and said there may have been 'fear and discomfort' that came with their 'passion.' He added, 'What we had was real to me, and it was amazing.' Viall finished with, 'There is a reason why very few are . willing to take the road less traveled. It can be scary, challenging, . and risky, but if you have the courage to take it, it usually ends up . being amazing.' 'There's really not much to talk about,' Andi said on GMA. 'It's obviously something I read, but I'm very happy in . my relationship. It's like reopening the past that doesn't need to be . reopened. We moved past that.' But the reality princess - who held hands with her 29-year-old fiancé as they walked on the set of GMA - soon changed the subject back to her happy news. She told host Lara Spencer: 'I definitely knew there was that . chemistry and attraction with him,' Dorfman declared of her future husband. 'I'm definitely an overthinker, though, so it took me till the . very end. But there was something special with him.' She also discussed her wedding. 'We would like to do something in the spring,' she allowed. Not an easy talk: The brunette beauty on After The Final Rose on Monday with runner-up Nick Viall . In poor taste?: Viall shared that he had 'made love' to Andi in the Fantasy Suite; she was not happy with his comment . 'I . think for now, it's like, I finally got the engagement ring, I'm just . going to enjoy this for a little while… Just enjoy engagement life!' And what a ring it is. The Neil Lane creation has a center stone that consists of three carats with 154 round diamonds surrounding it. The setting is platinum. The jeweler told People on Monday, 'Josh wanted to get a pretty, feminine, soft-shaped ring, with a bit of glamor and wow effect. When Josh saw it, he knew this was the one. He said he could see it on Andi. He could see himself proposing with it.' He dropped to one knee: The Atlanta native proposed to the ABC star and she seemed shocked as she cupped her hands to her mouth . That's a yes: The TV star accepted the proposal and sealed the engagement with a kiss on the lips . Nice ice: Though the ring could be seen on Monday's episode of The Bachelorette, it didn't get its chance to sparkle until Andi showed it off the next day in New York City . Murray also opened his heart on the news show. 'I knew she was very intelligent, but she is so funny,' he said. 'She's beautiful. I was intimidated when I first got out of that limo, for sure.' The two have already gone to their social media accounts to gush about each other. Hand in hand: Andi wore a flirty gold skirt, black tank top and gold heels as she walked out of their Good Morning America taping on Tuesday . 'Finally able to shout it from the rooftops!!' Dorfman captioned an Instagram shot of herself with her love. 'Amazing season, amazing guy! One lucky girl. I love you more than you will ever know @joshmurray11 #thebachelorette.' 'Meet my beautiful fiancé and the love of my life @andi_dorfman,' Murray wrote. 'I've waited 29 years to find her and it's been well worth the wait! God is soooooo great! #VeryBlessed #ForeverKindOfLove.' On Tuesday Andi was seen in three different outfits for her post-Bachelorette press appearances. First she wore black and gold for GMA then switched into a beige dress for Live. Later she was seen in red as she went to an office building with Josh. Her third glam outfit of the day: Andi was also seen in a red romper and beige heels as she clung to her beau . They can't stop smiling: The pair seemed more than thrilled to be able to shared their affection in public as they were seen hand in hand leaving a building in Manhattan . Before their appearance: The future Mr and Mrs Murray wore casual clothing after they flew in from Los Angeles to make the rounds on the chat shows in New York City .","Andi Dorfman took fiancé Josh Murray on two morning shows in NYC on Tuesday .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . They are best known for designing some of the world’s most iconic sports cars. But now artists at Italian car design company Pininfarina have come up with a futuristic ‘writing instrument’ that is a hybrid between a pen and a pencil – with the desirable looks of one of its concept cars. The 4.EVER Pininfarina Cambiano writing instrument does not use ink but instead has a tip made of a special metal alloy. Scroll down for video . The 4.EVER Pininfarina Cambiano writing instrument (pictured) is made of aluminum and wood. It doesn't use ink but instead has a tip made of a special metal alloy called Ethergraf . Pininfarina is an independent Italian car design company and coach builder based in Cambiano, Italy, which was founded in 1930. It is perhaps most famous for creating most of Ferrari's iconic designs and has also designed cars for Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, Fiat, Lancia and Maserati. Since the 1980s it has also penned trains, buses and yachts and in 1986 began to consult on industrial and interior design as well as architecture. The company also creates prototype and custom cars for auto manufacturers and private clients - such as the Cambiano, which inspired the design for the firm's futuristic 'pen' collaboration. Called ethergraf, the alloy leaves a mark on paper much like the graphite tip of a pencil – only the writing or drawings are indelible. The instrument claims to be ‘everlasting’ as it does not need sharpening like a pencil and users will not need to invest in expensive pen cartridges. The 4.EVER Pininfarina Cambiano is the result of a collaboration between Italian stationery innovator Napkin - which came up with the alloy - and Pininfarina, which is best known for creating iconic designs for Ferrari as well as other car manufacturers. The design of the futuristic writing tool is inspired by the Cambiano concept car - a luxury sports saloon with a huge glass roof and plenty of luxurious wood panelling, conceived by the Italian design house . The pen is handmade by craftsmen in Italy and claims to have the ‘precise stroke like a pencil’ as well as the permanence of a pen. It combines an aluminium and wood body with the alloy tip and the design is inspired by the Cambiano concept car - a luxury sports saloon with a huge glass roof and plenty of luxurious wood panelling. ’Elegant and essential lines have been created thanks to the combination of innovative and classical material, as the aluminium and the wood confer a unique character to the object,’ Pininfarina said. The Italian car design firm has created most of Ferrari's best-loved designs, including this 599 GTB model, but it has also dabbled in industrial and interior design and architecture since 1986 . There is currently no news of how much it will cost, but it will 'soon be available on Pininfarina's website. A matching notebook will also be sold, which is made of stone paper. The material is made using stone powder so that it is stronger than traditional paper and is also water resistant. It will also contain original sketches of the Cambiano concept car.","The 4.EVER Pininfarina Cambiano writing instrument has an ethergraf tip that doesn't need sharpening, but no price has been released yet .

"By . Anna Edwards . A bid to build three luxury beach huts costing £1.1million along Britain's historic Jurassic Coast will 'blight' the beautiful shoreline, furious neighbours claim. Businessman Roy Parker plans to erect the timber chalets on a patch of grass next to his own £575,000 holiday home in West Bexington, Dorset. The three buildings would sit on the end of an iconic row of 14 similar chalets that have been in position since before the Second World War. The row of 14 other beach huts at West Bexington has a controversial history. Planning officials failed to realise a replacement building was nearly twice the size of the previous one . The three buildings would sit on the end of an iconic row of 14 similar chalets that have been in position since before the Second World War . The exclusive huts would each cost about £20,000 to build but would have a market value of £350,000 at today's prices. The 20ft x 20ft properties can be slept in overnight, will enjoy direct access to the beach and boast stunning views of the English Channel. Mr Parker, 75, a former director of Leicester City Football Club, has recently put his own a holiday home next door to the site on the market as neighbours say he rarely uses it. But they are furious that he may leave them with three huts that will ‘blight' the landscape and encourage speculative developers to build similar properties. Neighbours believe the three huts will 'blight' the landscape and encourage speculative developers to build similar properties . The three new beach chalets (not pictured) will be big enough to have bedroom accommodation but they can't be lived in year round . Sue Nichol, who owns a property in West Bexington, said: 'Now this area has been designated a World Heritage Site it is inevitable it will attract investors who wish to cash in on this opportunity. 'This would be the thin end of the wedge. If this application succeeds there will be further applications for huts. 'People will think ‘if these three huts went up then why can't I do the same?' 'Modern beach huts will be detrimental to the apparance of the coast and have an adverse impact on views to or from the site. 'Mr Parker has this plot of land just sat there and is chancing his arm by putting a planning application in. He lives in Leicestershire, he doesn't care what happens to the site.' The 20ft x 20ft properties can be slept in overnight, will enjoy direct access to the beach and boast stunning views of the English Channel . A report submitted with the application states that the new chalets will represent an 'enhancement and logical finishing of the line of beach chalets' Mr Parker said because it adjoins the existing row of chalets the new buildings would naturally fit in to the landscape . Officials from the local parish council have also objected to the application, stating it would be an overdevelopment on an area of outstanding natural beauty. The three new beach chalets will be big enough to have bedroom accommodation but they can't be lived in year round. It is thought Mr Parker would look to let them to holidaymakers rather than sell them. He claimed that chalets had been earmarked for the 100ft by 60ft parcel of land for years but nothing had ever been done. He said because it adjoins the existing row of chalets the new buildings would naturally fit in to the landscape. You'd be forgiven for thinking a one bedroom cabin costing £350,000 is a unique lot on the housing market. But, in parts of the UK, these tiny ‘properties’ come with massive price tags. Boasting ‘near by’ taps and shared showers, it’s amazing how much we will pay for some sand beneath our feet and a view of the sea. We take a look at three of the UK's most expensive beach huts... 1. A kitsch baby blue beach hut measuring just 23ft by 6ft in Shaldon, South Devon comes with breathtaking views of the village harbour and a whopping £245,000 price tag. This luxury cabin comes with under floor heating, a marble wet room and electric windows which automatically close when it rains. The quaint huts can be hired out to tourists for £90 a night. 2. A one-room former harbour master's hut (pictured below) was put on the market for the eye-watering asking price of £250,000. The hut at Rozel Bay Quay, Jersey, boasts views across the harbour of the fishing port and as far as France. 3. A bottle green beach hut in East Anglia went on the market for a whopping £70,000. Holidaymakers visiting Wells-next-the-Sea has steps down onto the beach, where scenes from the Hollywood blockbuster Shakespeare in Love, were filmed. The hut also boasts royal links, as footage of a young Prince Charles and his sister Anne playing on Holkham beach emerged last year. Despite its lofty connections,  the hut boasts a 'close-by' water tap and a lavatory block for the beach. A report submitted with the aplication by Mr Parker's planning agent states that the new chalets will represent an ‘enhancement and logical finishing of the line of beach chalets.' The row of 14 other beach huts at West Bexington has a controversial history. Four years ago the local planning authority, West Dorset District Council, mistakenly gave permission for one of the 14 chalets to be demolished to make way for a new one. The planning officials failed to realise the replacement building was nearly twice the size of the previous one until the work was nearly complete but by then it was too late.","Roy Parker plans to erect the timber chalets on the Dorset coast .

"By . Fred Redwood . Saints: The basement in the home of Richard Prosser, 65, and his wife Jean, 63, in Palestine, Hampshire is dedicated to his favourite club . Football-mad husbands can be trying. They monopolise the TV when matches are on, squander money on memorabilia and bore for Britain on subjects such as the transfer market. Yet all that pales into insignificance compared to what Jean Prosser has put up with to satisfy her husband Richard’s obsession with Southampton FC. Her tale of woe begins in 2001 when Richard was about to start building a new family house in the tiny hamlet of Palestine, in Hampshire. He heard that his beloved Saints, who were moving from their ground, The Dell, were auctioning off their fixtures and fittings and decided to go along, hoping to buy some cheap timber. While there, two far more interesting items caught Richard’s  eye – the deep touch-line dug-out used by managers and reserves, and an 1898 vintage turnstile. ‘I found myself bidding, and before  I knew it I’d paid £410 for the pair of them,’ says Richard, 65, who was a mechanical engineer. ‘When I got home and told  Jean, she said, “What the ’eck are you going to do with those – grow tomatoes in the dug-out and get people to pay to see them grow?” ’ In fact, Richard had already worked out a plan. He had previously intended the basement of his new house to be a store room. But he phoned his architects and told them to make something far more ambitious. With the dug-out as the centrepiece, he wanted the room to double as a shrine to the Saints and  a games room, complete with snooker and darts. It would be somewhere to party, watch matches on a big screen and spend time with his sons, Ben, 41, Simon, 37, and Richard, 36 – and his daughter, Amy, 27. By 2004 the house was built, with the dug-out and turnstile taking pride of place in the basement. A neighbour, author Jeremy Lewis, heard about it and arranged for his friend, legendary former Southampton manager Lawrie McMenemy, to give it a grand opening. To Richard’s amazement, his basement appeared on BBC South television news. Today it has the feel of a miniature museum, its walls lined with items such as the official team sheet from the day Southampton were promoted to the Premiership two years ago, signed photos of Saints stars past and present, signed shirts, and framed newspaper reports of big games. As we sit in the dug-out, I ask him what sparked this obsession. Pride and joy: The deep touch-line dug-out was used by Southampton FC managers and reserves at the club's old ground, The Dell . Vintage: Visitors enter the Saints shrine basement through a 1898 turnstile . ‘It all started in about 1960 when I was a lad and my father began taking me to see the Saints,’ recalls Richard. ‘We’d go to the games on the back of his motorbike and, one day, we passed this white Sunbeam Rapier with a red stripe on it and I thought it was absolutely fantastic. Then the driver wound down the window and shouted “Up the Saints” at us.  My dad said, “That’s Terry Paine, son – the Saints winger.” I was hooked for life.’ We walk around the wall with the big screen to the snooker room, then pass through the turnstile and head upstairs to the rest of the house. Score: Bramble Bank, in Palestine, Hampshire is on the market for £695,000 . Richard has done well from the property booms of the past 30 years. He and Jean, 63, lived in a three-bedroom semi in Sholing, Southampton, until 1987, when they upped sticks to Palestine to be near her parents. They bought a plot of land for £500 and built their own house, living in a caravan for a year. In 2003 they sold it for £375,000, bought the plot next door and built their present home. This house, Bramble Bank, has an American feel. Its wide living room has a bare brick fireplace, matched by a brick serving area in the open-plan kitchen/diner. High ceilings, windows and light oak balustrades in the hall create the feel of an atrium, and all the bedrooms are good-sized. And there are glorious views over Salisbury Plain. Now the children have left home, the house is too big for the Prossers. It is on the market for £695,000 and Richard plans to build another, smaller house nearby. What will become of his beloved dug-out? ‘I’m open to offers if someone wants to buy it,’ he says. Evansandpartridge.co.uk, 01264 810702 . The passion for moving to the country is having an unexpected effect on quiet village life. More than 100,000 people are leaving British cities for life in the countryside each year. And as many of them are well-off, can-do individuals, they are having quite an impact on the communities they move to – as sleepy village shows are ousted in favour of far more lively events. In Mylor Bridge near Falmouth, villagers have in the past two years put on shows featuring comedian Jack Dee, guitar virtuosos John Williams and John Etheridge, 1980s and 1990s stars Toyah Willcox and Beverley Craven and blues legend Albert Lee, to name but a few. The Mylor Sessions, as the shows are called, are largely down to Steve Hutt, an ‘incomer’ to the village who has worked in the entertainment industry for years. Chris Perkins, former chairman of the village hall committee, says: ‘The shows have brought the whole village together and inspired us to apply for and get a £500,000 lottery grant to restore the hall.’ The Mylor Sessions have also boosted the local housing market. ‘About 80 per cent of buyers come from outside Cornwall and can be nervous about moving to a small village,’ said Nigel Stubbs, the local estate agent with Jackson-Stops & Staff. ‘The Sessions are living proof that  this place is buzzing with life.’ The number of village impresarios such as Steve Hutt is growing. Typical of their number is former insurance broker Steve Dennis, who moved to Low Bradfield in the Peak District, four miles outside Sheffield, from Dorking, Surrey, in 2009. No sooner had Dennis settled into running the village stores than he set about organising folk-rock gigs by two of the country’s most highly regarded artists – Phil Beer and Steve Knightley. ‘We sold the 200 tickets for each show almost as soon as they were printed and they were very successful evenings,’ said Steve. Putting on top acts in the village hall originated in London’s commuter belt. In Goring-on-Thames, a successful jazz club has been running since 1999. It was set up by two local men, Bill Jackson and John Calvert, fed up with having to run for the last train home when they were enjoying a night at Ronnie Scott’s. They decided to arrange for musicians to come to them – and since then George Melly, Chris Barber, Digby Fairweather and Ian Shaw have all trodden the creaky boards at the village hall.","Southampton fan Richard Prosser's basement is a shrine to the Saints .

"By . Ian Drury . Hundreds of British troops are being prepared to deploy to North Africa to tackle al Qaeda-inspired extremists. Under secret plans being drawn up urgently by top brass, UK soldiers would be sent ‘within months’ to the region to help train the Libyan army. Political and military chiefs have acted amid mounting fears that Libya is rapidly becoming a safe haven for Islamist fanatics after Coloner Gadaffi was toppled in October 2011. Under secret plans being drawn up urgently by top brass, UK soldiers . would be sent 'within months' to the region to help train the Libyan . army . But critics have raised concerns that Britain could suffer ‘mission creep’ and be sucked into another bloody war just as fighting in Afghanistan - which has cost 444 UK lives - is drawing to a close. Military officers warned the proposed deployment would risk ‘overstretch’ as it takes place when the MoD is axing nearly 5,000 soldiers this year, controversially reducing the size of the Army from 102,000 to 82,000. One officer, who has served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, said: ‘The war in Afghanistan has not yet ended and already the government has committed the Army to another foreign operation. ‘Libya is a highly unstable country which is awash with weapons and has been infiltrated by al-Qaeda. ‘Thousands of British soldiers have just been made redundant and morale is at an all time low and there is a real possibility of mission creep in Libya - the timing of this operation could not have been worse.’ There are mounting fears that Libya is rapidly becoming a safe haven for Islamist fanatics after Coloner Gadaffi was toppled in October 2011 . Britain has already sent some 50 troops to West Africa to train the Malian Army which is battling an Islamist insurgency. Defence chiefs have ordered 4 Infantry Brigade, based in Catterick, North Yorkshire, to begin preparing for the Libyan mission. Prime Minister David Cameron is deeply concerned that Libyan could quickly become a failed state and a haven for al-Qaeda sympathisers. More than 2,000 Libyan infantrymen would be given lessons in basic soldiering skills to prevent militants securing a foothold in the war-ravaged country. A senior defence source said: ‘It is yet to be confirmed where the training will takes place. ‘It is a possibility that this could happen in Libya although the security situation could prevent this. ‘The training could take place in a third country or it could take place in the Uk but that would create significant problems.’ Britain will form part of an international task force whose aim will be to help bring stability to the country. UK troops will help train the Army on how to secure its huge borders and prevent the flow of illegal arms shipments to terrorist groups around the world. Up to 3,000 surface-to-air missiles have gone missing in Libya since the conflict -  and spy chiefs say the state has become the ‘Tesco’ of the world’s illegal arms trade. More than one million tonnes of weapons belonging to Colonel Gaddafi were looted from arms dumps after the dictator was toppled in October 2011. MI6 agents fear large numbers of weapons have been smuggled out of Libya to groups linked to Al Qaeda. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured at Camp Bastion, is deeply concerned that Libyan could quickly become a failed state and a haven for al-Qaeda sympathisers . The Libyan government remains in a precarious position, with large parts of the army dominated by local militias. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We need to help Libya secure its future. ‘As the Prime Minister said at the G8 conference, some countries have already offered to train more than 7,000 troops to help the Libyan government improve the stability of the country. ‘As part of this, the UK has offered to train up to 2,000 Libyan Armed Forces personnel in basic infantry skills. ‘This is part of a package of defence and security assistance to the Libyan government and the UK’s 4 Infantry Brigade has been identified to carry out this training which will be paid for by the Libyans.‘Detailed planning is ongoing, including consideration of where this training will take place.’","UK soldiers would be sent ‘within months’ to help train the Libyan army .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . The saga surrounding the body of radio DJ Casey Kasem appears to have taken another bizarre turn after reports emerged that his wife is making arrangements to have the body flown to Norway - against the wishes of his family. Kasem, host of America's Top 40 and voice of animated television characters like Scooby-Doo's sidekick Shaggy, passed away in June at the age of 82 following a battle with dementia and Lewy body disease. His declining health sparked a bitter family feud over his care and treatment. Jean, his second wife of 34 years, had already been embroiled in a bitter row with his three children from his first marriage. Scroll down for video . Radio personality Casey Kasem, who died in June  and his wife Jean Kasem in 2007. It has been reported that his body will be flown to Norway by Jean. Feud: Jean Kasem (left) with her husband, Casey Kasem is battling the radio icon's daughter, Kerri, (right) for control of his body . His daughter from a previous marriage Kerri and the rest of the Kasem family have no clue where Casey’s body has been taken. It’s believed it was moved from a funeral home in Washington to one in Montreal, Canada. Now TMZ, citing sources close to the family, reports Jean is planning to take the body abroad, possible to Oslo in Norway. On October 2013, Kasem’s children with his former wife, actress Linda Myers, as well as Kasem’s brother and a business associate, went public over their fears for his health. Casey Kasem (2nd from left) and his family arrive at the Golden Dads Awards ceremony at the Peterson Automotive Museum in June 2005 in Los Angeles, California . The group held a protest outside Kasem’s home, alleging Jean wouldn’t let any of them see Casey and had been rebuffed in their efforts for three months. In May 2014, Jean told a judge that Casey was no longer in the United States, however, he turned up several days later in Washington state. On June 6, a Washington state court recognized the legal rights of Casey’s eldest children to see their father and gave daughter Kerri full conservator control of his affairs. Haney & Young initially won a ruling on Jean’s behalf that same month, when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the legendary broadcaster to continue to be cared for at the Washington state hospital. That decision was reversed two days later when the judge authorised Kerri to remove her father from life support.","Reports emerge that widow Jean may fly broadcaster's body to Oslo .

Plastic surgery fan Hong Yuh Reum says it's done wonders for her career as an international model. She featured on a Japanese TV special about plastic surgery where she said Kerr was her inspiration for undergoing the procedures. Scroll down for video . South Korean model Hong Yuh Reum hit the jackpot in her quest to look like Australian model Miranda Kerr . On the show, called Alien Virus, she said: 'It really struck me when I first saw [Kerr] in a magazine. She has a baby face but she's very sexy. I knew I wanted to be like her!' The show focussed primarily on the dangers of cosmetic surgery, up to and including death from surgical complications. But Reum had nothing but praise for surgery, attributing going under the knife to much of her career success, report RocketNews24. The model from South Korea has had multiple cosmetic surgery procedures to look like her idol, including operations on her surgery on her eyes and nose. Before her surgeries people would tell her mother she looked like an 'adorable non-Korean child' She also wears blue contact lenses and dyes her hair a honey-brown shade, as well as wearing contouring makeup to make her look more like the Australian model, and copying her style. A Kerr superfan, she also covers her bedroom walls with pictures of the Australian star, according to femalemag.com. Hong said that even before her surgeries, people would tell her mother she looked like an 'adorable non-Korean child' She said: 'I didn't do my forehead. I only did my eyes and nose. Besides that, I haven't touched anything. I didn't put anything in my cheeks and it's all fat.'

'When I said I wanted to get surgery, everyone around me tried to dissuade me. In fact, people often asked if I had surgery even before I got it. I wanted to look like Miranda Kerr so I decided and went ahead with surgery.' Hong expressed her disappointment that the former Victoria's Secret Angel isn't more popular in South Korea and claimed she was imitating Kerr to help promote her on the Korean Peninsula. Miranda visited Seoul last June and has appeared in a sketch for SNL Korea. The popular KoreAm Journal says Kerr is 'a perfect combination of cute and sexy,' and embodies a 'look many East Asian young women wish to achieve.'

"By . Laura Clark . A minister yesterday admitted that the plan to serve free hot meals to all young children in primary schools from September was going to fail. David Laws, the Liberal Democrat second-in-command at the Department for Education, said some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot. He admitted not everything would be ‘perfect on day one’ as schools battle to implement Nick Clegg’s flagship plan to offer four to seven-year-olds free lunches from September. David Laws admitted not everything would be 'perfect on day one' as schools battle to implement Nick Clegg¿s flagship plan to offer four to seven-year-olds free lunches from September . It suggests some schools will take weeks or months, if not longer, to offer all eligible pupils hot meals. Mr Laws also disclosed that extra funding to help small schools implement the policy may need to continue for ‘years’. The Mail disclosed this week that tens of thousands of pupils will be served reheated meals or cold sandwiches from September because schools lack proper kitchens and cannot afford them. More than 3,000 primaries – about one in five – will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens. Dozens of others will offer only cold lunches, in some cases at pupils’ desks. But many of these are unlikely to meet rules on  nutritional content that schools must follow. Mr Law’s comments, in a speech to school caterers in Birmingham yesterday, represented the first time that the Government had admitted the scale of the problem. David Laws said that some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot . He said: ‘Some schools will provide a cold meal initially, until capital works are complete. In the medium term we expect all schools to be giving a hot food option – which is what is really necessary to meet the school food standards consistently.’ The Liberal Democrats insisted that ‘medium term’ meant weeks but research for the Mail suggests renovation works at some schools will take considerably longer. Mr Laws also said that many schools were ‘raising their sights’ above transporting in pre-prepared meals and wanted their  own kitchens. He said the Government intended to consider what it could do to ‘support schools further in creating the right facilities and environment to maximise the quality of food’. But he added: ‘It would be unrealistic to think that in just one year we could rebuild the entire school estate and reverse decades of neglect in some areas.’ And he insisted: ‘I was not willing to allow the search for perfection to get in the way of delivering a step change in healthy eating which is needed right now.’ Mr Clegg used his speech to last year’s Liberal Democrat conference to demand a ‘hot, healthy lunch’ for infant school pupils every day. Following warnings from head teachers, references to ‘hot’ were quietly dropped from legislation published earlier this year, which simply requires that food  be ‘nutritious’. The policy has provoked one of the fiercest bouts of in-fighting within the Coalition since power-sharing began in 2010. More than 3,000 primaries - about one in five - will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens .","David Laws admitted that not everything would be 'perfect on day one'

"By . Laura Clark . Universities are wooing bright students with ‘bribes’ such as £10,000 cash incentives, tablet computers and sports club memberships amid unprecedented competition to fill courses. Coalition reforms aimed at unleashing market forces in higher education are turning university admissions into a ‘buyers’ market’, it was claimed yesterday. Universities, most of them outside the traditional elite institutions, are adopting a range of tactics including offering cash scholarships and other perks to would-be students, regardless of their family income. Scroll down for video . Bright students are being wooed with 'bribes' such as cash incentives and tablet computers to fill courses . They have also made record numbers of unconditional offers to high-fliers who will be able to claim their places in September regardless of final grades. The scramble for students is expected to intensify next week with the release of A-level results on Thursday and official opening of ‘clearing’, which matches applicants to remaining course vacancies. Record numbers of places are expected to be filled this year, with acceptances likely to exceed 500,000 for the first time. It follows the partial relaxation of strict recruitment quotas and the creation of 30,000 extra university places this autumn. Research by the Mail ahead of results day reveals the incentives being offered to appeal to would-be students, mainly by universities outside the traditional elite. At the University of East London, new undergraduates will be offered a £1,200 ‘progress bursary’ which includes a Samsung tablet loaded with textbooks. Research by the Mail revealed the incentives were being offered ahead of A-Level results released next week . New undergraduates at the University of East London will be offered a £1,200 ‘progress bursary’ The bursary is paid to students in the form of credits at intervals during their degree, encouraging them to stay the course. It can be spent on anything from campus accommodation to laptops, Oyster card top-ups and sports club membership. Newman University in Birmingham is offering an academic scholarship worth £10,000 over three years to students who achieve BBB or ABC at A-level. Meanwhile Surrey is offering a ‘chancellor’s scholarship’ to those with A*AA grades or A*A*B grades – a £3,000 cash award in the first year and membership of the university sports club for the duration of the course. At City University, scholarships worth up to £9,000 over three years are available to certain high-fliers. But cash scholarships are mainly targeted at those who gain ABB in their A-levels. It follows the relaxation of controls to allow universities to recruit unlimited numbers with these grades. Greenwich, for example, is offering a ‘high achievement’ scholarship worth £2,500-a-year to students with ABB or better. The intense competition being introduced to higher education was described as ‘tough’ by one admissions boss yesterday. Lynsey Hopkins, head of admissions at Sheffield University, said: ‘It’s a shift, it’s a buyer’s market in a sense. Students have a lot more choice where they wouldn’t have done a few years ago.’ Mrs Hopkins also said that previously students might have expected to have received offers from three or four of the five choices they listed on their applications but ‘now it’s becoming much more common to get all five of their choices’. The research also showed that unconditional offers are being used by growing numbers of universities to encourage applicants with strong academic records to commit. These include Birmingham, Reading and Nottingham. Others operating smaller-scale schemes include Lancaster, Greenwich and Northumbria.","Universities are adopting a range of tactics to attract prospective students .

Claims that coalition reforms turned university places into a 'buyers market'"
"By . Laura Clark . and Sarah Harris . Tens of thousands of pupils in primary schools will be served reheated meals or cold sandwiches as a result of Nick Clegg’s controversial free lunches policy. Under the plan, all primaries will need to provide free lunches to all four- to seven-year-olds from September. But half say they are not ready and still need kitchen upgrades, serving or dining facilities in order to meet the pledge. Nick Clegg's plan to offer lunches to primary school children has hit fresh trouble after half of schools said they still are not ready to make the meals . Some renovations will over-run, forcing schools to use stop-gap measures such as bussed-in packed lunches, councils admit. And more than 3,100 primaries – one in five – say they will definitely be unable to offer traditional cooked lunches because they lack proper kitchens and cannot afford them. They will be forced to buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or heat them up – in some cases with a microwave – on site in mini-kitchens. Other schools say they will not even be able to do that – with dozens insisting they will be able to offer only a cold packed lunch. In some cases the pupils will have to eat sandwiches at a desk because there is not enough space for all the children to eat together. And some headteachers said they were going to have to start lunch breaks at 11.30am in order to push through large numbers. The figures – revealed in a Freedom of Information request by the Mail – show Mr Clegg’s free school meals policy is in chaos with just two months to go. One councillor – where ten primary schools have had to be renovated at a cost of £1.8million  – said she was ‘shaking with rage’. Melinda Tilley, Oxfordshire head of education, said the authority was receiving only £1.2million from the Government towards costs. She said the policy was dreamed up on the ‘back of a fag packet’ for Mr Clegg’s ‘moment in the limelight’, leaving many in education ‘running round like headless chickens’. ‘They are not providing us with enough money,’ she said. ‘We are about half a million short, which is going to come from the taxpayers.This money could be going to disadvantaged children. It makes me so angry. I shake with rage when I think about it.’ Mr Clegg said he would demand a ‘hot, healthy lunch’ for infant school pupils every day. But following warnings from headteachers that his policy was not properly funded, references to ‘hot’ were quietly dropped from legislation published earlier this year. Half of schools say they are still waiting for kitchen or service upgrades before they can give out the lunches, while 3,100 schools say they will definitely not be able to fulfil the pledge as they cannot afford the equipment . The figures were requested by the Mail from 150 education authorities. Seventy-one responded and supplied figures on the type of provision to be offered in their schools. This revealed that 1,350 out of 7,083 primaries plan to fulfil the duty by transporting in hot food. Further figures from 67 councils show that 3,051 out of 6,144 schools – 49.7 per cent – still need improvements to kitchen, dining or serving facilities to meet the deadline. This suggests that nearly 8,100 schools are carrying out urgent  upgrades. Schools struggling to implement reforms have been advised to consider kitchen ‘pods’ dropped in by crane. A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'We have contacted every local authority as well as hundreds of academies and based on their responses the overwhelming majority of schools are on track to deliver this policy in September and we are confident it will be delivered on time. 'Universal free school meals have already been shown to work in the pilot schemes run by the Department for Education and Department of Health between 2009 and 2011. Indeed, schools have had longer to prepare for the introduction of universal infant free school meals this September than schools in those pilot areas had. Some schools, as now, may choose to transport in food that has been prepared elsewhere. 'We are providing £150 million to improve kitchens and dining facilities, an additional £22.5 million to help smaller schools to provide these meals and a free support service staffed by food experts for schools.'If hot meals cannot be provided schools would be expected to work towards offering them ‘as soon as possible’.","Primary schools must offer free lunches next term under Clegg's plan .

"By . Sean Poulter . and Laura Clark . The Student Loans Company is a subsidiary of the Government and reports to Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills . The Student Loans Company yesterday admitted sending more than 300,000 graduates fake ‘Wonga-style’ legal letters over the past decade – as it suspended all use of the tactic. The disclosure came as Business Secretary Vince Cable blasted the Government-owned company for using ‘scare tactics’ to harass graduates who are behind on repayments. The Daily Mail detailed yesterday how the Student Loans Company had been using a trick deployed by controversial payday loan giant Wonga to harass people into paying up. Last week, City watchdogs announced that Wonga would have to pay £2.6million in compensation to 45,000 people after it sent out letters from two debt recovery firms it invented for the purpose of frightening them into paying up. It subsequently emerged that the SLC has been using a similar tactic for many years and invented the firm Smith Lawson & Company Recovery Services to chase payments. Letters sent by Smith Lawson to graduates carried a banner in red stating ‘Do Not Ignore This Letter’ backed up with a demand for payment within seven days and a warning of legal action. The letters gave the impression that Smith Lawson was a separate company and opened with the line: ‘We are instructed by our client, in connection with the sum outstanding shown above.’ Last night the SLC admitted that about 309,000 customers had been sent letters with Smith Lawson branding over the past nine years. It also emerged that the Office for Fair Trading had ordered changes to the letters earlier this year, including increasing the size of small print pointing out that Smith Lawson was part of the SLC. But the SLC said last night it had now ‘suspended all use of Smith Lawson branded correspondence’. Mr Cable blamed the last Labour government for allowing the SLC to use the suspect tactics. Last week City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed Wonga would have to pay £2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms (file picture) ‘The Student Loans Company has now stopped sending these misleading letters to borrowers, which were approved under the previous administration,’ he said. ‘We will also keep an eye on any others who may be tempted to use misleading communications of this kind.’ The City of London Police are looking at Wonga to see whether the company and its bosses have been guilty of any criminal acts, including fraud and demanding money with menaces. Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘These revelations are very troubling and the police must fully investigate this matter as they are doing with Wonga. Parliament will also need to investigate.’","Business Secretary Vince Cable blasted the Government-owned company .

"By . Laura Clark . A Muslim girls’ state school which recruits only female staff has been criticised by Ofsted inspectors for a lack of male influence on pupils. Feversham College in Bradford has been told to introduce male role models to its ‘all-female environment’. The 664-pupil school was visited by inspectors last month as Ofsted’s ‘Trojan Horse’ probe into attempts to impose a strict religious agenda on schools was extended beyond Birmingham. The watchdog found that music was not taught as a separate subject to 11 to 14-year-olds and some teachers were given performance targets to develop the school’s ‘Islamic ethos’. Inspectors also reported that the school operated an ‘all-female learning environment’ which extended to male governors ‘not interact[ing] with students’. Feversham College, in Bradford, was visited by inspectors last month as Ofsted's 'Trojan Horse' probe into attempts to impose a strict religious agenda on schools was extended beyond Birmingham . Ofsted urged the school to ‘increase opportunities for the broadest range of positive role models, including men and male governors, to be part of students’ learning’. The college was also told to ‘continue to review the breadth and balance of the curriculum’, although it currently met legal requirements. The school’s recruitment policies are already being investigated by the Department for Education amid concerns they may be unlawful. DfE officials intervened earlier this year after the school ran job adverts specifying women teaching staff. Now the department’s Education Funding Agency (EFA) says it is ‘working with’ the college to ensure recruitment procedures are ‘fully compliant’ with equality law. Feversham – motto ‘In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful’ – aims to educate girls aged 11 to 18 ‘in the context of the Islamic Sunni faith as a way of life’. The designated faith school was judged ‘outstanding’ at its last full Ofsted inspection and is regularly among the highest-performing state comprehensives in the country. Ofsted . placed five schools in Birmingham special measures earlier this month . after investigating allegations of a concerted attempt to introduce a . strict Islamic agenda in state schools. It . uncovered an ’organised campaign’ to impose a ‘narrow faith-based . ideology’ on schools which was resulting in pupils being poorly prepared . for life in modern Britain. Education Secretary Michael Gove has ordered a report into the 'Trojan Horse' scandal in Birmingham . The watchdog made a snap inspection at Feversham last month because the ‘chief inspector was concerned about the effectiveness of safeguarding and leadership and management at the academy’. In their report, inspectors praised many aspects of the school – which became an academy with extra freedoms in 2011 - and noted that students were ‘prepared for life in modern Britain’. The school is ‘aware of the risk of extremism and radicalisation’ and implements the Government’s ‘Prevent’ strategy aimed at combating it, the report said. ‘An annual “health check” by the local counter-terrorism unit ensures the academy is following best practice,’ it added. Ofsted said Feversham College was aware of the risk of extremism and implemented a strategy to help prevent it . The report said music was not taught as a separate subject to younger pupils but noted that pupils were exposed to music in classes such as drama and allowed to stage performances. It added: ‘Some teachers’ targets are linked to the development of the academy’ s Islamic ethos but these are in the minority’. The report said governors ‘express a range of different views on the rationale for the retention of an all-female learning environment’. It added: ‘Male governors are not role models within the academy because they do not interact with students in this all-female environment.’ Ofsted warned that if the school’s recruitment policy is found not to comply with Government requirements, future Ofsted ratings for the head and governors could be affected. The school’s two ‘priorities for further improvement’ were to increase pupils’ exposure to male role models and ensure the curriculum ‘continues to extend students’ range of experience’. Defending its job adverts specifying women staff, the school’s head, Clare Skelding, said earlier this year the policy had been accepted by the Government when the school – previously a private school - entered the state education system. ‘Feversham College was established in 1984 for 11 to 18-year-old Muslim girls, in response to parental demand for single-sex education based on religious beliefs’ she said. ‘When applying for voluntary-aided status in 2001, it was made very clear to the DfE (DfEE as was) and the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council (LEA) that the school’s intention was to continue to operate with female-only staff, based upon two legal opinions obtained at the time by the school. ‘This position was accepted by the DfEE and LEA at the time. The school has recently taken further legal advice from a leading QC, who has confirmed that the school’s policy of a female-only teaching environment is not unlawful and complies with the terms of the Equality Act 2010.’ But Pavan Dhaliwal, of the British Humanist Association, claimed the school’s actions were ‘plainly unlawful’. The outcome of the Department for Education investigation could have implications for other Muslim faith schools employing single-sex staff. A DfE spokesman said: ‘All schools must comply with equality law. ‘The Education Funding Agency is working with Feversham College to make sure their recruitment processes are fully compliant.’","Muslim girls' state school rebuked for lack of male influence on pupils .

"By . Laura Clark . New sex education packs produced by Family Planning Association warn girls not to send 'sexy and pouting' photos using their phones (file picture) Children as young as nine could be taught in school about the dangers of sexting. New sex education packs produced by a charity warn girls not to send ‘sexy and pouting’ pictures using their mobile phones. They suggest telling children of seven not to email photos of themselves in  swimming costumes in case they fall into the hands of paedophiles. The lesson plans have been compiled by the Family Planning Association, which said they are necessary in the light of the Operation Yewtree police investigation into historical sex abuse claims. Other lessons focus on cyberbullying and the dangers of giving away personal information or talking to strangers online. But family campaigners said the packs – titled Growing up with Yasmine and Tom – risk breeding ‘unhealthy distrust’. In an activity for seven to nine-year-olds, pupils are told Yasmine wants to send photos to her aunt in Australia. They are shown five pictures and asked to say which are ‘OK to send and which are not OK’. Teachers are advised a photo of Yasmine in swimwear is ‘not OK’ as ‘some people like looking at pictures of children in their underwear/swimwear/naked’. Pupils should ‘think about where photos posted online can be seen’. In a second activity, for nine to 11-year-olds, pupils are told Yasmine takes a ‘sexy and pouting’ photo on a phone and posts it online. It is seen by a male friend. She ‘realises how far the photo has spread and looks horrified’. The lessons are part of a pack, launched last week, that schools can download for £299 a year. Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said it was ‘symptomatic of a mindset that thinks young children should take responsibility for their own safety, when in reality it is the job of parents to protect them’. He added: ‘To address such issues in the classroom runs the risk of introducing ideas and thoughts that many children are not ready for. In some cases [it] is likely to breed an unhealthy distrust and suspicion of adults.’ The FPA is among groups campaigning for compulsory sex education in primary schools. Currently, . primaries teach reproduction as part of the science curriculum, and the . Government recommends they also teach sex education tailored to pupils’ age. The lesson plans have been compiled by the Family Planning Association, which said they are necessary in the light of the Operation Yewtree police investigation into historical sex abuse claims (file picture) The Government has resisted calls for compulsory primary sex education. Audrey Simpson, of the FPA, said she hoped to sell the packs to a ‘significant percentage’ of Britain’s 22,000 primary schools. She said the need for the resource was ‘a sign of the times’, adding: ‘Look at what’s happening with the whole Yewtree thing. Children need to be aware… It’s about treading a fine line between raising awareness but not frightening children.’ Dr Simpson insisted it was not intended to remove parental responsibility, but to involve parents and encourage pupils to seek permission before sending pictures. The lesson plans were tested on a panel of teachers including Sarah Beach, deputy head of a primary in Northamptonshire, who told the FPA it was a ‘great starting point for discussions’ and would help new teachers to tackle difficult issues.","New sex education packs produced by the Family Planning Association .

"By . Laura Clark . White teenagers are the least likely group to apply to university after being overtaken by black pupils, figures revealed yesterday. Rising numbers from all ethnic groups are setting their sights on a degree but white teenagers are less likely to apply than black, Asian or Chinese pupils. The statistics also show that pupils on free school meals due to family poverty are half as likely to seek a place as their more privileged peers. Just one in seven schoolboys on free meals is aiming for university. Rising numbers from all ethnic groups are setting their sights on a degree but white teenagers are less likely to apply than black, Asian or Chinese pupils, according to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service . The analysis from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service examined applications from 18-year-olds at England’s state schools to start university this autumn. It shows that 31 per cent of white teenagers applied – compared with 61 per cent of Chinese, 45 per cent of Asian and 39 per cent of black. The report compares the figures with those from 2006 and finds that demand among black teenagers has overtaken the proportion of white pupils applying. While the application rate of white teenagers rose from 25 to 31 per cent, black pupils increased their applications more rapidly, from 24 per cent to 39 per cent. ‘Application rates for all groups are higher in 2014 than in 2006 with the largest increase being for the black ethnic group,’ the report said. The findings will focus fresh attention on under-achievement among white working-class pupils, who are fast falling to the bottom of the educational heap. An inquiry by the Commons Education Select Committee last month called for radical measures to help reverse the ‘real and persistent’ under-performance of poorer white pupils, including longer school days to help children complete their homework. It called for further research on the role of poor parenting and the ‘effects of historical funding and strategies’. UCAS revealed that this year has seen the second highest total number of university applications submitted on record. The figure suggests demand for higher education is recovering following a sudden drop in applications sparked by the introduction of higher fees in 2012. But the latest analysis shows wide variation between groups. Record numbers of pupils on free school meals are aiming for university but they are still half as likely to apply than peers whose parents can afford to pay for their lunches. Some 18 per cent of pupils eligible for free meals applied this year – compared with 37 per cent of more privileged youngsters. Among poorer pupils, girls were 50 per cent more likely to apply than boys. Pupils from a Chinese background were nearly twice as likely to apply than pupils from white families . UCAS warned earlier this year that weak demand among male pupils was becoming a more pressing issue than under-representation of youngsters from poor homes. UCAS chief Mary Curnock Cook said: ‘There remains a stubborn gap between male and female applicants which, on current trends, could eclipse the gap between rich and poor within a decade.’ Separate research earlier this week – based on university applications in 2008 – found that although ethnic minority groups were over-represented on campus, applicants from these groups were less likely to receive offers of places than white pupils with the same academic record. The study, from the London School of Economics, also found that boys were losing out to girls in the university race even when they have the same A-level grades. Pupils from comprehensives and those from working-class backgrounds were also at a disadvantage. Researchers suggested the quality of personal statements on university application forms may help explain the findings. Speaking about the latest figures, Professor Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: ‘The upwards application trends are good news, but stark gaps remain between application rates from young people from different backgrounds. ‘That means many talented, intelligent young people are missing out on the economic and social mobility that higher education helps to support, and the country is missing out on a pool of potentially excellent graduates who could be enriching our economy and society.’ A Department for Business spokesman said: ‘This data confirms that the proportion of 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university has reached its highest level ever. The Government is committed to providing access to all students irrespective of background.’","Students from a Chinese background are most likely to want to study .

"By . Laura Clark . New science graduates are half as likely to be in stop-gap jobs stacking shelves and cleaning windows as those who studied most other university disciplines, figures have revealed. Posed by model . New science graduates are half as likely to be in stop-gap jobs stacking shelves and cleaning windows as those who studied most other university disciplines, new figures have revealed. They are more likely to have landed professional jobs within six months of finishing their studies than graduates in fields such as history, philosophy, creative arts and even law. Just five per cent of working science graduates have stop-gap jobs such as shelf-stacking, road-sweeping or operating factory machinery that fail to justify the effort and expense of doing a degree. Yet 11.7 per cent of graduates in media studies, 10.6 per cent in the creative arts, 10 per cent in history or philosophy and 8.9 per cent in languages are languishing in these roles. Science graduates – including those who studied physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, computer science and medicine – are also less likely to be unemployed six months after finishing university. Across all disciplines, almost 20,000 graduates – eight per cent - were out of work six months after leaving university. The figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency came the day after eminent scientists warned that Britain was failing to produce enough scientists and mathematicians. The Royal Society called for all schoolchildren to study maths and science until the age of 18 to help the country tackle ‘great global challenges’ such as ensuring future food and energy supplies. A-levels should be axed in the process, said the society, to be replaced by a broader-based baccalaureate-style qualification. Latest figures for full-time graduates who left university last year show that overall, 69 per cent were in jobs, 5 per cent were both working and studying, 14 per cent were in further study and 4 per cent were travelling. Some 8 per cent – down from 9 per cent in 2012 – were unemployed. Men were more likely than women to be jobless but their starting salaries were higher - £20,000 on average for female graduates but £22,500 for male.  The statistics showed that graduates’ chances of being jobless varied widely by the subject they studied. Out of graduates in work, 66 per cent were in jobs classed as ‘professional employment’ such as teachers, solicitors, vets, dentists, pharmacists or engineers – up from 64 per cent in 2012. Just 5 per cent of working science graduates have stop-gap jobs such as shelf-stacking, road-sweeping or operating factory machinery that fail to justify the effort and expense of doing a degree . But 34 per cent – 59,600 - were in ‘non-professional’ roles that are unlikely to justify the £9,000-a-year cost of degree tuition. These include working in factories and ‘elementary occupations’ such as office juniors, hospital porters, waiters, road sweepers, window cleaners and shelf stackers. Other non-professional posts include skilled trades, service and caring industries, sales, customer services and secretarial work. Just 24.7 per cent of science graduates were in non-graduate jobs six months after leaving – against 49.1 per cent of history and philosophy graduates, 47.5 per cent in languages, 46.8 in media studies and 44.6 per cent in creative arts. Even in law, 46.1 per cent of graduates were not yet in professional roles. Among science subjects, graduates in biology bucked the trend, with 50.8 per cent classed as being in non-professional jobs. Overall science graduates were less likely to unemployed, with 7 per cent jobless compared with 9 per cent who read social studies, business studies or creative arts and 11 per cent who took media studies. Computer science graduates bucked this trend, with 13 per cent out-of-work after six months. In a major new report published yesterday, the Royal Society warned that a million more experts in science, technology and engineering would be needed by 2020. Launching the report, Sir Martin Taylor, a mathematician and chair of the Royal Society’s ‘vision committee’ said: ‘The current education system will not meet the needs of the UK over the next 15 to 20 years, so we need to start building a stable education system that produces scientifically literate citizens now, before it is too late. ‘We all know that we have significant problems with the demand for science, mathematics and engineering skills and their supply. Employers tell us this. We know that only one in eight 16-year-olds goes on to do A-level mathematics. That’s just not enough for a vibrant knowledge economy. ‘We should bear in mind for instance that one million new science, engineering and technology professionals are going to be needed by 2020 and at the current rate we’re falling 40,000 shy of this each year. ‘The UK will provide a leading role in providing solutions to some of the great global challenges that the world is now facing - things like climate change, food and energy security and the ageing population issue.’ The report proposes a series of radical reforms to the education system including the replacement of A-levels with a baccalaureate system where all pupils would study maths and science at some level until age 18.","Just 5 per cent of working science .

"By . Laura Clark . Rude and disruptive pupils are wrecking four in every ten lessons that take place in English secondary schools, a major international survey has revealed. Students were also found to have verbally abused and intimidated teachers more often than nearly all other countries in the study. Standards of behaviour were found to be ‘notably better’ in private schools than the state system, with a third of state school heads telling researchers they needed tougher powers to tackle poor behaviour effectively. Survey laid bare the extent to which poor discipline disrupts learning. Teachers in England spend an average of seven minutes in every hour-long lesson keeping order, instead of teaching. Picture posed by models. The study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development questioned more than 100,000 teachers across 34 countries on aspects of their work including working hours, job satisfaction, pay and classroom environment. Heads reported that serious offences such as physical attacks, drug and alcohol abuse, vandalism and theft happened only ‘rarely’. But the survey laid bare the extent to which poor discipline disrupts learning, with an in-depth report on the findings by the Institute of Education concluding that the classroom environment was ‘far from ideal’ in a ‘substantial minority’ of lessons. Teachers in England spend an average of seven minutes in every hour-long lesson keeping order, instead of teaching. Overall 11.4 per cent of lesson time was lost due to bad behaviour. In Poland, the figure was only 8.5 per cent. Separately the research showed that ‘intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers’ was widespread in England, with 6.5 per cent of heads reporting it was a weekly occurrence. This was twice the international average and the fifth highest in the world. In other findings, teachers in England taught the most children classed as having special educational needs, with 66.5 per cent reporting more than one in ten of their pupils had some form of additional need. The figure is significantly higher than the international average of 25.5 per cent. Teachers are more likely to take sick days in England than most other countries, the survey by the OECD found. Some 11 per cent of heads complained of weekly instances of ‘unjustified absenteeism’ by their staff. Levels were the ninth highest in the world, and more than double the 4.7 per cent international average.In their defence, teachers might argue they work some of the longest hours in the world. A typical working week involves 48 to 52 hours’ work, with one in ten putting in 65 hours a week or more.Yet only about a third of this time is spent actually teaching pupils. Around 20 hours are spent in the classroom, with lesson preparation, marking and other admin taking up the rest of their time. Twenty-eight per cent of teachers said that at least one in ten of their pupils spoke English as a second language – above the international average of 21.3 per cent. However, teachers in England are among the least experienced in the world, with an average track record of just 12.4 years. And they believe they are ‘undervalued’ by the public despite working longer hours than their counterparts in most other countries. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We have taken decisive action to give teachers the powers they need to tackle poor behaviour and discipline, which have improved significantly in recent years. ‘We scrapped no touch rules that stopped teachers removing disruptive pupils from classrooms without fear of being sued and have given them powers to search pupils for banned items. ‘We have also brought back no-notice, same-day detentions and made clear that tough but proportionate sanctions such as writing lines, clearing up after meal times and litter picking are perfectly valid punishments.’","English students verbally abuse and intimidate teachers more often than nearly all other countries .

"By . Laura Clark . and Stephanie Linning . A mother today joked that her wedding photographs might be used in evidence against her - after she defied a ruling to take her son out of school so that he could attend the ceremony. Clare McLeary flouted the ruling by taking nine-year-old son Riley Bryant out of lessons so he could watch her tying the knot with fiance Andy McLeary, 37, on Lusty Gaze beach in Newquay, Cornwall. Mrs McLeary, 30, who works as a police call handler, wrote to Clive Church of England School in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, asking for permission to let Riley miss three days this week. Sealed with a kiss: Clare and Andy McLeary pose for photos after their beach ceremony in Newquay, Cornwall. The couple said that they refuse to pay any penalty notices imposed on her by Clive Church of England School . Family moment: Mr and Mrs McLeary with nine-year-old Riley. Speaking on her decision to take her son out of school, Mrs McLeary said: 'This is one of the happiest days of my life and I wanted Riley here beside me' But the school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as ‘exceptional circumstances’. The couple, who have been together for three years, are now facing a criminal prosecution and believe their wedding pictures might be used in court to prove Riley’s unauthorised absence from school. Speaking as the couple posed for photos after their ceremony, Clare said: 'These pictures might get me sent to prison but, frankly, I don’t care. 'This is one of the happiest days of my life and I wanted Riley here beside me.' Riley, who lives with his mother and step-father Mr McLeary added: 'I don’t like missing school but I wouldn’t miss seeing her get married for the world. 'I'm chuffed to bits to be part of my mum's big day. I enjoyed throwing the confetti on her and Andy. Day to remember: The couple, pictured at their wedding, are now facing a criminal prosecution and believe their own wedding pictures might be used in court to prove Riley's unauthorised absence from school . In love: Mr and Mrs McLeary have been together for three years. The school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as 'exceptional circumstances' 'I was quite upset when my mum told me the school weren’t giving me permission to go to the wedding but all that’s the last thing from my mind. I just wanted to support my mum.' Parents can put in requests for term-time . holidays, but they are granted or refused entirely at the head . teacher's discretion and are not a parental right. Although fines can be imposed for unauthorised absence, it is at the discretion of the local authority. Mrs McLeary insists that she will refuse to pay any penalty notices imposed on them by . Clive Church of England School near Shrewsbury and is prepared to face . prosecution. Defiant: Clare McLeary, 30, who married Andy McLeary, 37, today (pictured together, left) took her son Riley Bryant (right) out of school for the wedding, even though his teachers refused him permission to miss lessons . Sanctions that can be imposed on the parents of truanting children include a three-month jail sentence or a fine of £2,500. The row follows a crackdown on term-time absence which removed heads’ discretion to grant up to ten days’ holiday a year. Education . Secretary Michael Gove tightened the rules from last September to . prevent unnecessary disruption to children’s education. Denied: Police communications operator Mrs McLeary wrote to Clive Church of England School in Shrewsbury, Shropshire (pictured), asking for permission to let Riley miss three days of lessons this week . Venue: Mr and Mrs McLeary married on this beach in her hometown of Newquay, marking the spot by writing this loving message in the sand . He ordered heads . to stop granting permission for term-time holidays unless families . could show ‘exceptional circumstances’ such as a family bereavement. Speaking before she tied the knot, . Mrs McLeary, who had Riley in a previous relationship, said: ‘It’s . absolutely bonkers that the school have banned my son from attending my . wedding. ‘If I had gone . along with the school’s ruling then there would be no wedding because I . can’t leave a nine-year-old home alone for three days.

Speaking before her wedding, she said: 'It's absolutely bonkers that the school have banned my son from attending my wedding' Risk: If parents fail to ensure their children attend school, they may be issued with penalty notices of £50 to £100. Parents who fail to pay the penalty notices face prosecution by the council . ‘Riley is an excellent pupil. The school isn’t even holding normal lessons this week anyway because it’s sports week.’ Schools . and local councils can issue £120 spot fines if pupils are absent . during term-time, although they are £60 if paid within 28 days. Parents . who fail to pay the penalty notices face prosecution by the council. Mrs McLeary, who like her husband works for West Mercia Police, added: ‘I . am fully prepared to go to court and I will refuse to pay any fine. If . it means going to prison then so be it.’ Mary Lucas, headteacher at Clive school, said: ‘The school will only authorise leave in exceptional circumstances. ‘On .

I would have been happy to talk to the parents about . this request if they had come to see me.’ Shropshire Council said the head teacher of individual schools decided whether any case was exceptional.","Mrs McLeary took her son Riley out of school for wedding to Andy McLeary .

"By . Laura Clark . European students who took out taxpayer-funded loans to study at English universities are defaulting on nearly £40million of repayments, official figures have shown. More than one in eight students from EU member states are failing to keep up with repayments after finishing their courses and leaving the UK. The amount owed by defaulting students has tripled in just two years, from £12.7million in 2012 to £38.2million this year. The figures from the Student Loans Company will renew concerns that British taxpayers will end up footing the bill for unpaid loans as EU students return home and disappear from the system. More than one in eight students from EU member states are failing to keep up with repayments after finishing their courses and leaving the UK. The amount owed by defaulting students has tripled in just two years . It is claimed that thousands could receive a ‘free’ university education which costs UK-based graduates up to £9,000-a-year. The statistics also showed that the total amount lent to EU students – including those who are currently studying - has rocketed by more than £200million in a year to £686.3million. Since 2006, students from EU member states have been eligible for the same special low-interest Government-backed loans as home students to cover tuition fees at English universities. Graduates based in Britain have their loan repayments automatically deducted from their payslips but there is no equivalent mechanism for those who move abroad. They are required to supply earnings information to the Government and set up a direct debit to make repayments, or remember to pay online. Officials insist that EU students leaving Britain and failing to repay will be pursued through the courts in their own countries. International ‘trace agents’ are deployed to ensure they pay up. But the latest figures reveal the scale of the task. They show that 49,100 EU students have become liable to start repaying loans since 2006. Only 2,000 EU graduates who left the UK are currently actively repaying their loans. 'This raises a big question mark over how sustainable this all is in the long term.It is a case of EU law not working the way that it should' - James Clappison MP . James Clappison, the Conservative MP for Hertsmere, said UK taxpayers should be ‘very concerned’. ‘Under EU law, we have to give students from the mainland the same terms as British students and this raises a big question mark over how sustainable this all is in the long term. It is a case of EU law not working the way that it should.’ The total amount owed by all students, both British and EU, has ballooned to £54.4billion in 2013/14 following the introduction of £9,000-a-year tuition fees in 2012, the SLC figures show. The amount has more than doubled in six years – from £21.95million in 2007/08. Of this £54.4billion, £686.3million has been taken out by EU students. Most has been lent to EU students still at university but £263.9million is classed as ‘liable for repayment’. But loan accounts in arrears amount to £38.2million – up from £21.1million last year and £12.7million the year before. A spokesman for the Student Loans Company said: ‘The SLC will continue to set up fixed payment schedules. We do have processes in place to trace those who move away and have systems in place to pursue borrowers for repayment regardless of their location. ‘Part of this collection process includes engagement with overseas collections agents to ensure all repayments owed are paid.’","More than one in eight students are failing to keep up with repayments .

"By . Laura Clark . Schoolgirls should be able to dry their hair after PE lessons and wear tracksuits instead of traditional short skirts to encourage them to take more exercise, a sports chief declared yesterday. Young British women are among the least active in Europe with only six per cent taking the recommended level of exercise, warned Jennie Price, chief executive of Sport England. Schools should consider making radical changes such as installing cubicles and hairdryers in changing rooms and allowing up to 15 minutes extra time for girls to ‘reconstruct’ themselves after PE. They should also consider scrapping short gym skirts and allowing girls to wear clothes they feel comfortable in. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirls should be encouraged to do exercise by schools installing hairdryers and changing cubicles, the head of Sport England has said. They should also get 15 minutes extra to 'reconstruct themselves' she added . Addressing heads of girls’ schools, Mrs Price said research for Sport England, the Government’s grassroots funding agency, suggested that girls felt self-conscious and unfeminine in school PE lessons. Many also wanted dance or keep fit classes such as Zumba instead of traditional team sports. Schools should introduce as wide a range of sports as possible – including niche sports such as fencing and rowing - to draw girls in, she said. Mrs Price told the annual conference of the Girls’ Day Schools Trust (GDST) that British women aged 15 to 24 were 19th out of 28 nations for the amount of exercise they did, according to European Commission figures. Just six per cent exercised or played sport at least five times a week – the official recommended level to bring a range of health benefits. In contrast, British men were third in Europe, with 34 per cent physically active five times a week. Among women, participation in Britain was behind countries often regarded as more ‘traditional’ such as Spain and Ireland, as well as those such as Sweden where equality was strongly promoted. ‘There is a significant issue in terms of girls’ participation,’ said Mrs Price. Barriers to taking part included girls being ‘really preoccupied about how they look’, particularly in a social media age. Jennie Price said barriers to girls taking part in sports included them being 'really preoccupied about how they look', particularly in a social media age . Girls ‘Tweet and Instagram constantly’, giving a feeling of ‘being on show’. But Mrs Price, the first female chief executive of Sport England, said it was important for girls to be able to ‘reconstruct’ themselves after taking part in physical activities at school. She said she had visited a mixed comprehensive in Hull where girls played the same amount of sport as boys – which was ‘almost unheard of’ in schools. It had put in hairdryers and plugs for hair tongs or other gadgets for girls to use after PE. ‘One of the ways they’ve done it is in the girls’ cloakroom, they asked them what they wanted and they said cubicles, hairdryers and plugs and 15 minutes after the session please so we can comb our hair and get ourselves looking how we looked when we went in,’ said Mrs Price. They wanted to ‘emerge from it how we feel comfortable’. ’It is so easy to pooh-pooh that, but they found that was one of the things that gave them parity, and really drew girls in.’ She added: ‘The ability for a girl in particular - and particularly if she’s 14, 15, 16 - to reconstruct herself after that flinging herself on the floor moment, thinking “thank god that’s over” or “I had a great time”, is incredibly important.’ Mrs Price added that short skirts could be replaced by jogging bottoms. ‘I don’t know anybody who really loves the short skirt but allowing them to wear things that they are comfortable in, talking to them about what they are comfortable in, is very, very important,’ she said. Helen Fraser, chief executive of GDST, which runs 24 private girls’ schools and two state academies, told the conference that a revival of ‘warrior women’ in popular culture was helping to inspire a new generation to become physically active. These included Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Xena Warrior Princess and more recently Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games or Tris Prior in the Divergent series. ‘It is heartening to see fictional heroines who can hold their own in a fight, who endure physical hardship and aren’t just waiting to be rescued by a hero on a white charger.’","Installing hairdryers in changing rooms would encourage girls to exercise .

"By . Laura Clark . Pupils are not learning to think for themselves because teachers are ‘playing safe’ and setting work that is too easy, an adviser to Prince Charles will warn today. Many youngsters are not being stretched at school because staff shy away from topics that are too theoretical, according to Bernice McCabe, a headmistress and co-director of the Prince’s Teaching Institute. Some teachers may be bowing to the ‘tyranny of league tables and targets’, fearing they will lose ground in the rankings if the material they cover is too challenging. 'Tyranny of league tables': Headmistress Bernice McCabe with Prince Charles in 2005. Mrs McCabe recently helped the Government shape its new, more rigorous national curriculum . In music, for example, many teachers fail to introduce pupils to crucial aspects of music theory such as time signatures and scales because they are trying to ensure lessons are accessible to all. This has led to Ofsted branding some classes ‘unchallenging, demotivating and sometimes dreary’. Mrs McCabe, head of North London Collegiate, a high-performing private girls’ school, will deliver the warning as she welcomes delegates to the Prince’s 18th course for teachers. In a keynote speech at Cambridge University, she will describe how the Prince set up the institute 12 years ago to allow teachers to improve subject knowledge. Mrs McCabe will tell teachers their role is to help children learn to make critical judgments of their own. But she will claim pupils ‘will be less likely to think for themselves if you are too accommodating’. She will warn teachers against ‘playing safe and submitting to the tyranny of league tables’, adding: ‘It is all too easy as a teacher to fall back into the familiar routines, opt for the safe topics, stay within your comfort zone. But what excitement is there in that? If it’s too easy, there is little gained. ‘Teaching is a matter of leading your pupils to higher ground, until they have the confidence to continue climbing by themselves. ‘It is the job of the teacher to motivate, to make difficult things accessible and enjoyable.’ Mrs McCabe recently helped the Government shape its new, more rigorous national curriculum for primary and secondary schools. Ofsted last year reviewed a three-year Government drive to raise standards of music education, following a damning report. It said that despite the programme, most of the schools inspected were still ‘unduly worried that pupils might not enjoy lessons that included music theory’. It added: ‘Sadly, the laudable wish for musical learning to be relevant, accessible and enjoyable too often ends in a curriculum that is unchallenging, demotivating and sometimes dreary.' Primary education is more important than secondary in helping poor children succeed, a study claims. Drives to improve primary learning in the 1990s have led to better GCSEs years later, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, while secondary policies have had less of an effect. Poor pupils in London were up to 50 per cent more likely to get five good GCSEs in 2012 than those elsewhere in England, says the study. It suggests literacy and numeracy hours – which were introduced in London primary schools first – are the main reason for this.","Teachers are ‘playing safe’ and setting work that is too easy .

"By . Laura Clark . While their male counterparts can often be found getting themselves into scrapes and scuffles outside, little girls are apparently at risk of becoming ill later in life – because they are treated ‘like princesses’ at home. Helen Fraser, chief executive of the Girls’ Day School Trust, has warned that girls are less active than boys by the age of eight, and only 12 per cent of 14-year-old girls are as physically active as they should be. ‘It may be cultural’, she said, adding: ‘Boys are encouraged into rough and tumble play whereas girls are often expected to be quiet and well-behaved like little princesses. ‘Actually we need to encourage them to get up and run around. It’s really important that girls take vigorous activity.’ Playtime princesses: Girls face potential health problems in later life because they are expected to act like 'little princesses' instead of enjoying rough and tumble play, according to a girls' school leader . Mrs Fraser, who oversees the education of 20,000 girls in England and Wales, went on to say that girls could be storing up future health problems such as type two diabetes and osteoporosis because they are failing to get into the habit of being regularly active as children. In a speech this week, she will point out that many influential women in politics and business enjoyed sporting success in their youth, such as the US politician Condoleezza Rice, who was a tennis player and figure skater. But Mrs Fraser, whose trust runs 24 independent schools and two state academies, will also insist that girls should not only be offered traditional competitive sports such as hockey and netball. Activities such as Zumba, trampolining and tai chi can encourage a lifelong enjoyment of physical exercise among reluctant schoolgirls, she will say. Speaking to the Mail ahead of the trust’s annual conference in London on Wednesday, which will discuss the role of sport in education, Mrs Fraser cited findings from the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation that girls are starting to be less active than boys by the age of eight or nine. Exercise can help protect against osteoporosis - by building bone strength - as well conditions such as type two diabetes and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, she said. Physical activity can also speed up blood flow to the brain, boosting brainpower. ‘Adolescence is quite a challenging period for boys and girls at every kind of school,’ she said. ‘We believe that sport really helps children get through that in great shape.’  She added: ‘Our approach is very much about there being a sport for everyone.’ Schools in the group offered a wide range of sports from traditional team games to Zumba and tai chi and mini-gyms for sixth-formers. ‘One of the things we want to do is ensure there’s a “sport for all” approach,’ she said. ‘Trampolining is fantastically popular. It’s really hard to be bad at trampolining.’ She said only around 20 per cent of girls would be good enough to compete seriously for their school, for example at county or national level. ‘We want to ensure the other 80 per cent have maximum opportunities to do different sports,’ she said. ‘There’s a sport for every girl – it may be netball, it may be Zumba.  If you build those habits of physical activity in childhood and adolescence, you are so much more likely to carry it on. ‘Men are much more likely than women to play sport at the age of 30 and that’s such a pity. We are hoping to build a lifelong habit of exercise and keeping fit.’ Fit for life: Exercise can help protect against osteoporosis - by building bone strength - as well conditions such as type two diabetes and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression . In her speech to the conference, Mrs Fraser will also highlight the role of sport in developing leadership skills. She will cite a US survey of female business executives which found that 80 per cent played organised sport when they were growing up and credited it with giving them a competitive edge in the workplace. Many successful women have a strong sporting track record, she will say, including the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who played volleyball and Christine Lagarde, the first female head of the International Monetary Fund, who was a member of the French national synchronised swimming team. Meanwhile Sports Minister Helen Grant represented her county at hockey, tennis, athletics and cross country. ‘There is quite a lot of evidence that sport builds leadership qualities,’ she said. ‘We are extremely keen on building confidence and girls’ ability to lead and sport has a huge amount to do with that.’ The GDST conference was also be addressed by Jennie Price, chief executive of Sport England.","Helen Fraser, chief of the Girls' Day Schools Trust, issues stark warning .

"By . Laura Clark . The growing use of the word ‘fit’ to describe attractiveness is putting girls off sport and exercise, according to a girls’ school leader. Children should stop using it to mean ‘fanciable’ because it can lead to girls feeling self-conscious about their appearance while exercising, says Helen Fraser. Girls should be able to get ‘pink in the face and tousled’ without worrying about whether they were having a ‘bad hair day’. Attractive young schoolgirls should not be called 'fit' to mean 'fanciable' as it puts them off physical education, a girls' education chief will say today (library image) Mrs Fraser, chief executive of the Girls’ Day School Trust (GDST), believes girls should be concerned about their running speed instead of worrying ‘does my bum look big in this?’. In a speech to the trust’s annual conference today, Mrs Fraser will say: ‘What on earth has happened to the word fit, which used to mean that you could run a few miles without collapsing but now just means “fanciable”? ‘I think sport and exercise is one of the ways in which women can reclaim their bodies from the kind of obsessions of the tabloid press and celebrity magazines. ‘It is not about being fat or thin, it is about being fit. It is not about how you look, but about what you do.’ She will add: ‘Really great inclusive sport takes girls away from all those unhelpful thoughts of bodily perfection and focuses them on the team and the goals. ‘I have been in our schools when a class of teenage girls is returning from a sports lesson, pink in the face, tousled, throwing themselves down on the floor – with never a moment of “am I having a bad hair day”, or “does my bum look big in this”.’ Helen Fraser will say girls shouldn't worry about 'getting pink in the face' or if their 'bum looks big' while exercising (library image) Mrs Fraser will also urge schools to impress upon girls the importance of sport ‘more forcefully’. By the age of eight or nine, girls are already less active than boys and by the time they are 14, only 12 per cent of girls are as active as they should be. Mrs Fraser will highlight a lack of ‘cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful, fast and strong’. She will also criticise different treatment of the sexes in professional sport, with sponsorship and media attention skewed in favour of men. ‘Women’s football and women’s cricket gets less funding, less media attention,’ she says. ‘A Premier League boss sends sexist emails. Newspapers print allegations that Jessica Ennis is fat (that was before she won her gold medal),’ she will say. She will point out that many successful women have a strong sporting past including Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, who was a member of the French national synchronised swimming team, and Condoleezza Rice, the former US Secretary of State, who is an accomplished golfer. ‘It is important to have cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful, and fast and strong,’ she says. The GDST – which runs 24 private and two state academies  – has attempted to create a culture of ‘sport for all’ with classes in Zumba and tai chi as well as traditional team games.","'Fit' being used to mean 'fanciable' is putting girls off PE, school chief says .

"By . Laura Clark . and Lucy Osborne . and Sarah Harris . A school at the centre of an alleged ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamist plot paid private detectives to snoop on staff emails, inspectors have found. Governors at Saltley School are accused in an Ofsted report of spending ‘substantial amounts of money with no obvious benefit’ including on consultants and lawyers. Some faculty members complained to inspectors they were ‘treated unequally because of their beliefs, religion or background’. The Birmingham school – where the head was allegedly forced out by conservative Muslim governors – is almost certain to be placed in special measures. Saltley School in Birmingham - which is at the centre of an alleged 'Trojan Horse' Islamist plot - is accused in an Ofsted report of spending 'substantial amounts of money with no obvious benefit' on consultants and lawyers . It is among six expected to be given Ofsted’s lowest possible rating next week when the watchdog publishes the findings of its investigations into 21 Birmingham schools.  Michael Gove is expected to remove heads or governors of schools where inspectors have identified concerns. The Education Secretary will address the Commons on Monday – after Ofsted has released the results of its three-month inquiry. Staff will be asked to take training programmes to help them combat radicalisation and extremism. The Ofsted reports are likely to disclose that some schools are narrowing the curriculum even to the extent that music is being banned. The mass inspections followed the emergence of a letter purporting to describe a five-step ‘Trojan Horse’ strategy for imposing a hardline Islamic agenda on state schools. While its authenticity is disputed, the claims themselves have been taken seriously and are being studied in depth. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, will highlight a series of concerns about practices in some of the schools, including unequal treatment of boys and girls, a narrow curriculum that denies pupils a rounded education and governors intent on changing the character of schools. Education Secretary Michael Gove is due to address the Commons on Monday after Ofsted has released the results of its three-month inquiry into the scandal . A separate Department for Education investigation found evidence of girls being forced to sit at the back and sides of classrooms and GCSE subjects being restricted ‘to comply with conservative Islamic teaching’. Ofsted’s report on Saltley School, which was leaked to BBC West Midlands, contains criticism of governors’ use of school funds, saying they ‘paid private investigators to interrogate [sic] the emails of senior staff’ and has ‘spent substantial amounts of money with no obvious benefit’. Governance of the school was judged inadequate. ‘Many of the governors refuse to accept that the school is in a state of crisis,’ it is claimed. Birmingham City Council, which is accused of being slow to respond to the school’s decline, refused to comment yesterday. Balwant Bains, the school’s non-Muslim head, resigned late last year. An Ofsted inspection shortly before he stepped down criticised a ‘dysfunctional relationship’ between him and the governors. The school has strongly denied any suggestion that Mr Bains was forced out. Birmingham council’s investigation into the Trojan Horse claims will be released next month along with a separate inquiry by Peter Clarke, Scotland Yard’s former counter-terrorism chief. Teenagers are being taught jihad at one of the schools implicated in the Trojan Horse scandal. Lessons at Park View School in Birmingham suggest it can be justifiable for Muslims to take up arms in a holy war and that jihadists suffer from negative stereotyping in the media. The school’s website describes how a lesson is devoted to jihad under a section on ‘Living The Muslim Life’. Pupils study topics such as ‘what is a just war?’, ‘when can Muslims take up arms?’ and ‘conditions of jihad’. Pupils are being taught jihad at Park View School in Birmingham, which is being investigated as part of allegations of a hardline Islamist takeover plot at a number of schools in the city . Park View claims to follow Edexcel’s religious studies GCSE syllabus but referring to stereotyping and just wars, an Edexcel spokesman said: ‘The content in question is not represented in our specification … Schools do have the choice to add to the defined syllabus.’ The researcher who alerted the Department of Education, and asked not to be named, said: ‘Muslim children aren’t being given a fair chance to become part of society with this.’ A Park View spokesman said teaching is supported by Edexcel resources, adding: ‘This includes understanding the concepts of greater and lesser jihad and media representation.’","Governors at Saltley School in Birmingham criticised in Ofsted report .

"By . Laura Clark . Education Secretary Michael Gove has branded the long summer holiday a relic of the 19th century, when children were needed to help on farms . The six-week school summer holiday could be scrapped because head teachers think it makes terms too long. Most are in favour of spreading holidays more evenly throughout the year to ease pressure on staff. Leaders of the National Association of Head Teachers said spacing breaks across the year – and adopting different patterns around the country – would also bring down family holiday prices, which soar in the peak summer season. A total of 55 per cent of NAHT members polled are in favour of overhauling term structures. The union, which represents 28,000 heads and deputies, will now conduct research into the impact of the long summer break on children’s learning before adopting the change as a policy. The move, discussed at the NAHT’s annual conference in Birmingham at the weekend, is the furthest any classroom union has gone towards endorsing a reduction in the six-week summer break. It is widely viewed as sacrosanct by teachers, but Education Secretary Michael Gove has branded it a relic of the 19th century, when children were needed to help on farms. He will allow all state schools to alter their term dates from next year. Schools that govern their own admissions, such as academies, can already do so, but only a few have made radical changes. One is Nottingham’s Djanogly City Academy, which has five terms of eight weeks separated by two-week holidays, and a four- or five-week summer break. Russell Hobby, the NAHT general secretary, admitted the proposal for shorter but more frequent holidays would be controversial in the teaching profession. However, he said American research suggested children suffered ‘learning loss’ during a long summer break. Mr Hobby added: ‘It seems like at the end of term everybody’s ready to drop. 'Not reducing the amount of holiday but distributing it more evenly across the year might be one solution to that.’ Having different times off around the country would also reduce the price premium added by travel companies as demand surges during school holidays. Mr Hobby said: ‘It would be good for the parents of children, it would be good for attendance because it would take away some of the excuses, and it would be good for teachers as well.’ However, some NAHT members oppose the move. Stephen Watkins, head of Mill Field Primary School in Leeds, said that, in effect, most teachers had only four weeks off over summer as they spent two weeks preparing for the new term. Schools that govern their own admissions, such as academies, can already do so, but only a few have made radical changes. One is Nottingham's Djanogly City Academy, which has five terms of eight weeks separated by two-week holidays, and a four or five-week summer break . He added that there should be a ‘time where children need to be children and have time to play’.An American review of 39 studies in 1996 found that some researchers estimated that pupils lost between one and three months of learning over the summer. The problem was more marked in maths than reading, with disadvantaged pupils affected more than others. Heads at the conference also pledged to press for Mr Gove’s reforms of GCSEs and A-levels to be overturned, saying they will wreak ‘incalculable’ damage on children’s education. They are furious that coursework is being axed in most subjects in favour of written exams after two-year courses. Alan Mottershead, head of Trinity School in Carlisle, said exams were at risk of becoming ‘a feat of memory recall’. Rob Campbell, head of Impington Village College in Cambridge, said: ‘I cannot believe parents will want their children assessed exclusively by terminal exam, a once-and-only sitting of an exam at the end of a course.’ Delegates unanimously passed a resolution calling for an urgent rethink of the changes, to be phased in from next year. The Department for Education rejected the criticisms, saying the reforms would ‘address the pernicious damage caused by grade inflation and dumbing down’.","55% of NAHT members polled are in favour of overhauling term structures .

"By . Kay Goddard . Problem erased: Ashley Cole, 23, underwent DermaEraze to get rid of stretch marks caused by weight loss . A tattoo gun-style treatment without the ink, combined with blasts of intensely bright light,  is offering a solution to people with stretch marks and sagging skin. The DermaEraze regime ‘sounds like torture’, according to Lorena Oberg, the cosmetic practitioner who launched it in the UK. But while she says it leaves the skin ‘red raw’, she adds: ‘It looks  far worse than it feels.’ Stretch marks appear when the skin’s collagen and elastin fibres are rapidly stretched beyond their limit, causing tiny tears and scarring. Rapid weight gain during pregnancy is a primary cause, but they can also be influenced by hormonal changes associated with puberty, muscle-building and general weight gain. Among sufferers is actress and mother-of-three Kate Winslet, 38, who has admitted that pregnancy left her with stretch marks. Until now a range of options – from lasers to gels and lotions – have been available to help reduce the appearance of stretch marks, but many have minimal or no effect. DermaEraze, however, is delivering consistent results in reducing their appearance by up to 90 per cent in some cases, as well as shrinking the width of scars in one single 60-minute session. First the patient has a rub-on anaesthetic cream applied to numb the skin. Then intense pulsed light (IPL) may be used to prepare the area – heat generated  by bright light is delivered directly on to the skin via a handpiece. The energy breaks down uneven pigmentation. The needling part of DermaEraze is carried out using a specially made device similar to a tattoo gun. The sharp end can have just one or up to eight very fine needles, bunched in a circle. These oscillate back and forth, like a sewing machine, hundreds of times  a second and can be accurately targeted at individual stretch marks. Lorena says this puncturing causes . cells called fibroblasts to make more collagen to repair the skin, which . in turn has a rejuvenating and tightening effect. The . entire session takes up to two hours, including about 30 minutes of . needling. And, according to Lorena, while there may be discomfort, ‘this . only lasts as long as the treatment’. Common cause: Pregnancy and weight fluctuations are the most common reasons why stretch marks to appear on the skin . She adds: ‘The treated areas look horrendous for  48 hours afterwards: bright red and sore looking – but it looks worse than it actually is.’ Fitness trainer Ashley Cole, 23, from Croydon, Surrey, developed stretch marks after losing five stone. Having tried other treatments, he underwent a session  of DermaEraze three months ago, followed by IPL a month later, and is delighted with his results. He says: ‘Some of the marks have totally disappeared while others have faded.’ Bryan Mayou, of the Cadogan Clinic in London, says it could be effective. ‘If your stretch marks concern you this might be worth trying,’ he says.

"By . Laura Clark . More than 24,000 children are skipping school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price hikes. Official figures reveal a sharp drop in the number of schools giving permission for term-time holidays following a crackdown by Education Secretary Michael Gove. But growing numbers of parents are taking children on ‘unauthorised’ family breaks, despite the threat of £120 fines and even court action. The Sutherland family: (left to right) Sian (13), mother Natasha, Keane (6), father Stewart and daughter Rhiannon (15) on holiday in Rhodes last September . So-called ‘middle-class truancy’ is linked to inflated prices imposed by travel companies during half-term, Christmas, Easter and summer school holidays. Prices can be double normal rates and savings on the holidays often outweigh the cost of any fines. Mr Gove tightened the rules from last September to prevent unnecessary disruption to children’s education. Heads were previously able to grant up to ten days holiday a year. But changes to the regulations remove references to the ten-day threshold and make clear heads ‘may not grant any leave of absence during term-time unless there are exceptional circumstances’, such as a family bereavement. Provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term last year despite the crackdown. About three-quarters of these had been taken out of school without the permission of the head.Parents who fail to gain the consent of the head teacher risk truancy fines of £120 – or £60 if paid within 28 days. The true figures for pupils missing lessons could be higher since the Department for Education realised late yesterday some schools had not been counted. A DfE spokesman said: ‘We do not expect the error to have a significant impact on the rates of absence.’ Provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term . DfE figures showed the percentage of school sessions missed due to family holidays dropped from 0.5 per cent in autumn 2012 to 0.4 per cent. It followed a decline in the number of schools authorising holidays. At primary level, approved family holidays were cut by around half. They accounted for 4.6 per cent of absence in autumn 2013 – down from 9.1 per cent the previous year. But unauthorised holidays made up 7.4 per cent of overall – up from 4.6 per cent for the same term last year. The overall truancy rate at primary level crept up from 0.7 per cent of sessions missed to 0.8 per cent. Similar, but less marked, trends were seen at secondary level, where parents tend to take fewer term-time holidays. In total, the equivalent of 258,700 pupils missed school every day between September and December last year through illness, holidays or truancy – some 4.3 per cent of lesson time. This marked a decline from 5.2 per cent – 323,600 pupils – over the same period in 2012. It meant school attendance levels have reached an eight-year high. At the same time, the number of children classed as ‘persistent absentees’ – those missing 15 per cent of lesson time or 18 months over a school career – also dropped, from 6.4 to 4.6 per cent. It meant 278,305 pupils were deemed persistent absentees, down from 396,450 in 2012.Schools are issuing record numbers of truancy fines, up more than a quarter last year to 52,370 but four in ten parents – more than 21,600 – failed to pay. Now Mr Gove is drawing up plans to claw back truancy fines directly from child benefit to ‘send a clear signal that children have to turn up to school and there’s a price to pay if they don’t’. Education minister Elizabeth Truss said: ‘There is still more to do and we are determined to further help schools reduce absence and improve behaviour.’","'Middle-class truancy’ linked to prices imposed by travel companies .

"By . Aap . A mother who took ‘confronting’ naked images of her young daughters was trying to further their dancing careers because she was obsessed with fame, a court has heard. The woman, who cannot be named, was charged with producing and disseminating child abuse material following an investigation into alleged sexual and indecent assaults on dance school students by their teacher Grant Davies. Davies ran a studio in Sydney's inner west and trained performers for hit productions, including Billy Elliot. Grant Davies was arrested in May last year and charged with more than 60 child abuse offences . Grant Davies was a co-director of a now defunct dance school based in Sydney's inner west . 'I was so caught up in this world,' the tearful mother told Sydney's Downing Centre District Court on Monday. 'I'm ashamed. I'm embarrassed. I regret the pain I have caused my family.' From the moment her two daughters started dancing at Davies' studio, the mother said they were constantly photographed and filmed performing. 'Then he (Davies) started saying, ""I don't want them to be concerned about their bodies"","" the mother told her sentence hearing. Although she knew it was wrong, the mother said she became 'obsessed and focused totally on the girls' and Davies' dance studio. Over the course of almost three years the mother admitted to taking numerous photos of her daughters, some of which depicted them naked and performing lewd acts. She would dress the girls up in specific costumes and then direct them to pose in particular ways. In one of a series of text message exchanges read out to the court, Davies is alleged to have asked the mother on November 8, 2011 'are the girls naked', to which she responded 'how about on the weekend they do you some more special G-shots?' When he replied 'why wait?', the mother sent sexually explicit photos half an hour later of her daughter. 'Now that has made me excited. I'm so lucky,' Davies allegedly wrote. The offences where allegedly committed against 10 of his dance students . Psychiatrist Dr Antony Milch said the mother had taken the images believing it would be 'the factor' that would promote her daughters' dance careers at the dance studio. She also exploited them in order to satisfy her own obsession with dancing and fame, he said. The court heard the 42-year-old's own dance dreams had faltered after she battled with anorexia. She then worked as a topless dancer in a strip club where it is alleged she was sexually assaulted. Judge Peter Zahra asked Dr Milch to view the images the mother took of her two daughters. 'I hadn't seen the images before,' Dr Milch said, adding 'they are extremely confronting and distressing'. 'I think it is difficult to understand how any mother could take such images and provide them to other parties to disseminate the material.' Dr Milch said he didn't believe the woman had an understanding of what she had done, nor has she expressed any guilt. Nevertheless, he said she should be reunited with her two daughters. The mother has pleaded guilty to two counts of using a child under the age of 14 for the production of child abuse material and two counts of disseminating child abuse material. Her hearing continues. Davies is facing more than 60 charges, including child sex and child pornography offences.

"By . Laura Clark . Dozens of underperforming schools could be removed from council control and handed to ‘super-heads’ in the wake of alleged Islamist takeover plots. Michael Gove is considering stripping Birmingham’s Labour-run council of the power to run many of its schools. The Education Secretary’s intervention comes amid claims radical Muslims tried to overthrow heads and governors and push through strict Islamic practices. Michael Gove is considering stripping the Labour-run council of its power to control Birmingham's schools . But the plan to remove failing schools from council control is said to extend beyond so-called Trojan Horse schools to include those that fared poorly in Ofsted inspections. Mr Gove is understood to fear that Birmingham, England’s second largest city, has failed to provide decent education at dozens of schools. About 15 successful head teachers are expected to be invited to take over at the failing schools. Those which already operate outside council control could also be reassigned to outstanding heads. The Park View School in Birmingham - which, according to whistleblowers, has allegedly been infiltrated by Islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people . There are suggestions that responsibility for some or all of Birmingham’s education and children’s services could be given to an independent trust. The approach has been used previously in areas of poor performance – such as Hackney in London. Birmingham heads were told at a recent council meeting to expect a ‘bloody firestorm’ after investigations into the Trojan Horse allegations are published. Ofsted had to abandon an inspection of a private primary school after pupils as young as nine were questioned about their attitudes to homosexuality. Parents were concerned after children told them inspectors had spoken privately to a group of nine and ten-year-olds at the Muslim school, asking them: ‘What does the word gay mean?’ and ‘Is it used in a bad way at school?’It is claimed the children were also asked about terrorism and whether it was discussed. Ofsted was forced to cut short its visit to Olive Tree Primary School in Luton after parents threatened to  withdraw their children. Ghulam Shah, 40, said his ten-year-old son came home complaining about being asked ‘scary and weird questions’. He said the inspector told his son not to be offended, adding: ‘It’s just a part of the law we have to ask you.’ Ofsted apologised for upsetting parents, but a spokesman said: ‘As part of any school inspection, inspectors will ask pupils about the effectiveness of the school’s actions to prevent and tackle discriminatory and derogatory language – including homophobic language.’ Mark Rogers, Birmingham’s chief executive, told his audience to prepare for ‘significant structural changes’ in the education department, leaked recordings reveal. Four investigations are being conducted into claims that orchestrated attempts were made to impose a hardline Islamic agenda on Birmingham state schools. These include a probe by Ofsted, which has carried out snap inspections at 21 schools and is preparing individual reports and an overview, due in early June. Leaks claim several of the schools will be put in special measures. Any schools removed from council control would be converted into academies run by outside trusts involving experienced heads. Liam Nolan, chief executive of Perry Beeches Trust, which oversees three schools in the city, is one of those expected to be approached for the role. He told the Sunday Times ministers had asked outstanding heads ‘to take responsibility for certain schools’ and that the move highlighted the council’s failure to take ‘responsibility for the education of young people’. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw last year described Birmingham’s children’s services as a ‘national disgrace’ and suggested the authority may need to be broken up. The authenticity of the letter which originally described ‘Operation Trojan Horse’ is open to question but the National Association of Head Teachers reported that its own casework had shown ‘concerted efforts’ to change the character of at least six schools. A Birmingham City Council spokesman said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to comment before Ofsted publishes its report.","Michael Gove 'stripping Labour-run council of power to run schools'

"By . Laura Clark . Schools are being forced to raid budgets earmarked for teaching and equipment to pay for Nick Clegg’s free meals pledge. Headteachers have rubbished claims that the policy is properly funded, saying they have had to dip into existing budgets to provide freezers, ovens and tables. One head is having to find £10,000 out of his existing budget to fund a fridge to store dozens of free sandwiches. Another is still waiting to hear if a £65,000 kitchen extension will be built. The government has pledged £2.30 per pupil for free lunches, but heads are complaining the money isn't enough, with one having to use £10,000 out of his existing budget to fund them . There have also been suggestions that schools could be forced to divert so-called ‘pupil premium’ funds – intended to support the poorest pupils – to help fund the scheme. Mr Clegg has insisted that ‘the resources are there’ for schools to provide free lunches for four to seven-year-olds from September. But headteachers are coming forward to warn they are having to make deep cuts elsewhere in their budgets to fulfil the duty. The free meals policy has provoked a fierce row in the Coalition, with Whitehall officials giving the plan a ‘red’ rating over implementation concerns. The legal requirement for the meals to be hot has also been quietly dropped – meaning that some schools could ditch providing hot meals altogether so they have time to prepare basic cold food for all their pupils. The warnings from heads will worry Education Secretary Michael Gove, who said in a leaked letter to the Treasury last year that learning budgets must not be used to pay for the policy. However one head disclosed that even funding cold meals for pupils will take £6,000 from his teaching budget, on top of a £4,000 council grant, to buy a fridge to keep the food cool. Clegg has insisted 'the resources are there' to provide free lunches for four to seven-year-olds from September . With £50,000 provided to fund the meals themselves, Duncan Churchill, of Mudeford Infants in Dorset, said the policy amounted to ‘£56,000 being spent to give children a sandwich’. He added: ‘Give me £56,000 to spend in other ways and I could transform the educational chances of children at this school.’ The Government will provide a flat rate of £2.30 for each meal. But Mr Churchill said the figures ‘do not add up’ for his school. ‘£2.30 would not cover a hot service. With the cold service we can just make it work,’ he said. The Coalition has announced £150million to help schools prepare their cooking facilities, on top of around £1billion to provide the meals themselves. But Stephen Watkins, head of Mill Field Primary, in Leeds, said he was only receiving 50 per cent of the money he needs to fund new freezers and ovens. ‘I don’t disagree with giving the meals. I do disagree with them saying it’s fully funded,’ he said. At St Mary Redcliffe Primary in Bristol, a £65,000 kitchen extension is needed but headteacher Emma Payne is still waiting to hear if it will be funded by the local authority. Two primary schools in Plymouth have also been forced to deny that they were planning to use pupil premium money to fund the meals service.","Clegg pledged free meals for four to seven-year-olds from September .

"By . Aap . The Australian Medical Association's Tony Bartone says alcohol advertising on receipts is sending the wrong message to young people . Australian doctors want to see the end of alcohol advertising on supermarket receipts because it sends the wrong message to young people. The Australian Medical Association says shopping dockets are an 'inappropriate' place to expose young people to alcohol. AMA Victorian president Dr Tony Bartone said it was now commonplace for receipts to have alcohol discounts printed on them, such as two-for-one wine offers. 'It is virtually impossible now to get a docket without that printed at the bottom,' Dr Bartone said on Wednesday. 'Supermarket docket receipts are an inappropriate place to be advertising alcohol, especially to young people going in to make non-alcohol-related purchases.' The alcohol ad ban is part of the AMA's wish list issued ahead of the November 29 Victorian election. The AMA also wants expanded health services in Melbourne's growth corridors, a ban on smoking in outdoor dining areas and licensing for tobacco retailers. It wants regular publishing of public hospital bed numbers and elective surgery waiting lists to improve transparency. The association also sees the need for better communication between hospitals and general practitioners as faxes were still widely used for sending medical records and test results. Both major parties should also clearly commit to matching any reduction in federal funding for health, the AMA said. He said it was commonplace for receipts to have alcohol discounts printed on them, such as two-for-one wine offers . The wish list comes after the state's Health Minister David Davis announced the government would ban smoking in outdoor eating areas in Victoria, but not before the next election. He said the government wanted to prevent smokers lighting up in alfresco dining venues, but needed to consult with the industry to determine the details of the ban. Mr Davis could not say when the changes would come into effect or what it would mean for outdoor drinking areas. The laws will not be changed before the November 29 election, but Mr Davis said legislation will 'certainly' be introduced in the next term of government. 'It will apply to areas where there's dining and the matters around drinking will be worked out steadily in this process,' Mr Davis told reporters on Monday.

"By . Laura Clark . and Andrew Levy . and Geraldine Hackett . The founder of a chain of academies who raised funds for the Archbishop of Canterbury has been investigated over ‘highly unusual’ payments. Officials highlighted a series of dubious financial practices at 16 schools set up by Sir Ewan Harper in the Education Fellowship Trust. These included £90,000 paid to himself and £28,000 to his wife Jane. Department for Education officials who investigated the group of 16 academies - the Education Fellowship Trust (EFT) - also criticised £45,000 expenses awarded in a year to just two governors, a £20,000 fact-finding trip to New York and excessive spending on hotels, meals and alcoholic drinks. Dubious: Payments from the Education Fellowship Trust included £28,000 in rent of office space in Titchmarsh, near Kettering, (pictured) to the wife of founder Sir Ewan Harper . Further concerns were raised over family members being given unadvertised jobs - including a director of communications on £70,000-a-year - while £1,000 was spent on Christmas cards and £630 on customised umbrellas. The EFT admitted that wine was purchased for a workshop with head teachers - as part of a training exercise designed to show that children, like grapes, can mature into ‘exceptional wines’ given the right nurturing or merely end up as ‘plonk’. Sir Ewan’s links both to education and the Church of England stretch back decades. He was tutored at Cambridge by Robert Runcie, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. In the 1980s, he helped set up the Lambeth Fund, which raises funds to support past and present Archbishops of Canterbury. Marlborough-educated Sir Ewan, 74, was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by another former Archbishop, George Carey. Commended: Sir Ewan Harper was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by former Archbishop, George Carey (pictured) Before founding the EFT, he led the United Learning Trust - one of the biggest backers of academy and independent schools in the country. A former businessman, he ran the family’s export firm, which he later sold. Sir Ewan became chairman of the Lambeth Fund in 2011 but retired in March. The EFT said he had also now retired from the trust. Officials from the DfE’s Education Funding Agency probed financial practices at the EFT after a review of 2012/13 accounts highlighted ‘highly unusual’ payments. These included nearly £28,000 in rent and insurance premiums to Lady Jane Harper, who is listed as owning cottages which the trust uses as an office. In a report, the agency said there was evidence ‘that the lease rental was a fair market price from an estate agent’ and that alternative premises were checked. ‘However there was no documented evidence provided to record the outcome of the inspections or the basis for the final decision to lease the current accommodation,’ it said. Checks by the Daily Mail revealed the two grade II listed stone cottages with thatched roofs under Lady Jane Harper’s name were leased to the EFT after failed attempts to find a private residential tenant. Official documents from East Northamptonshire Council show they were used by the United Learning Trust - the schools chain Sir Ewan previously headed - until it moved to larger premises. Internal changes were made to make it suitable for residential use and it was put on the market through a letting agent in September 2011. The council documents state: ‘As of 16th December no tenant had been found. ‘The applicant’s husband discovered the need to use the building as an office once again for his personal business.’ Another cottage in the same lane in the picture postcard village of Titchmarsh, near Kettering, is registered to Lady Jane Harper. All the properties are next to the couple’s home, which is in both their names and was valued at £1 million in 2010. It is hidden at the end of a long gravel driveway and is set in extensive landscaped grounds with a swimming pool. A woman who answered the door of the cottages said they were still being used by the EFT. The Government probe also raised concerns about £90,000 awarded to Sir Ewan as chairman of the trust - as well as ‘transactions with companies in which the chairman has a controlling interest’. The trust said £90,000 was paid to Sir Ewan because he was also chief executive at the time. But the investigation found that Sir Ewan was forbidden from holding both roles under trust rules. The trust, which has a turnover of £10million per year and lists 16 member schools on its website, was found to have committed ‘significant breaches of the Companies Act 2006, Charity Commission regulations and the Academies Financial Handbook’. A report on the findings, which is redacted in places, makes 26 separate recommendations. It highlights a series of questionable uses of public money including a £20,000 trip to New York by a group of heads. The report said it may not have been ‘the best use of public funds’. Expenses exposed: The Education Fellowship Trust runs a chain of 16 academies (stock image) Two governors ‘claimed £45,000 in expenses and other supplies and services’ while one academy in the group suffered a £38,000 fraud because IT security software was not up-to-date, enabling a transfer out of its bank account. The money is reportedly being reimbursed by the bank. The report also highlights that expenses policy allowed for ‘moderate consumption of alcohol’ - even though alcohol spending is considered an ‘improper use of public funds’. ‘A number of claims were made that included the purchase of alcohol,’ the report said. Meals and hotels were also claimed ‘in excess of the staff expenses policy’. Concern was also raised over unadvertised posts for family members. ‘We found that a number of the appointed head office staff were family members of either trustees or senior members of staff,’ said the report. There had been no ‘competition or advertising’ of the posts, which included a director of communication at a salary of £70,000 per year plus benefits. Meanwhile a finance manager had been appointed on £100 an hour with no formal tender for the work. It was ‘questionable’ whether this was value for money, said the report. More than half of secondary schools - and growing numbers of primaries - now have academy status which allows them to operate outside local council control. But there have been a series of financial scandals involving some of the groups which run academies, leading to calls for tighter controls. The agency issued the trust with a financial notice to improve. A spokesman for the EFT said: ‘The EFA are very clear that all issues found are from pre-September - before significant structural changes were made and Johnson Kane was appointed as CEO. ‘The Fellowship had already commenced on change of policies and governance in November 2013, before the review took place. ‘The EFA acknowledged to The Fellowship that it was under a different structure and clear evidence was showing that there was a positive change in the operation since September 2013.’ Sir Ewan wasn’t available to comment and his wife refused to comment when approached at their home. ‘I haven’t got time,’ she said. Lambeth Palace said Sir Ewan retired as chairman of the Lambeth Fund on March 31 as part of a ‘planned transition’. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘The EFA has undertaken a financial review on The Education Fellowship and is working with them to agree an action plan to address the issues raised. We have issued the Trust with a Financial Notice to Improve and if they do not take the necessary steps, we will not hesitate to take further action. ‘Academies operate under a strict system of oversight and accountability - more robust than in council-run schools - which means any issues are identified and that we can take swift action to address them.’","Education Fellowship Trust paid rent to founder Sir Ewan Harper's wife .

"By . Alex Lazcano For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Young people barred from taking the dole for the first six months they are unemployed would consider taking their own lives, outspoken Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has warned. The proposed changes would see under 30s stopped from getting unemployment benefits for six months to encourage them to try and find a job faster, but the Senator Lambie is concerned this would have implications on the mental health of the unemployed. 'They are losing their self-esteem and their self-respect and all it’s going to do is make these guys think about taking their own lives and [sic] won’t be responsible for that,' Ms Lambie told The Australian. Palmer United Senator Jacqui Lambie will not support the Coalition's proposed changes to the work for the dole scheme . The outspoken Senator says she will never support the Abbott government's controversial budget move, even if the waiting time for under-30s to get the dole was reduced to a month. 'I will never support this. This will hurt the youth,' she said. 'All it’s going to do is create more paperwork for Centrelink who are understaffed already. And what’s one month off the dole going to do?' 'These guys are already feeling like a bucket of s**t,'’ she told The Australian. 'They can’t get jobs, some of these guys, and they are going out there and giving it everything they can' Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the proposal is designed to motivate jobseekers to look for and find work quicker, with hopes it will change the unemployment culture to one where jobseekers are more proactive. 'Looking for work should be a full-time job if it's being done on the commonwealth taxpayer' he said. Outspoken Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie (Left) is ready to go into battle with Prime Minister Tony Abbott (above) over the proposed changes to the welfare scheme. Senator Lambie was briefed on the budget by Treasury officials on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Professor Raja Junankar, a A University of NSW industrial relations academic, also warned young people hit by the government's proposed work-for-the-dole changes will be forced into homelessness and crime. Professor Junankar says research from the University of NSW's business school shows youth unemployment is largely caused by a lack of job training and apprenticeship schemes. It could not be explained by high wages or over generous unemployment benefits, he said. Lashing out at the work-for-the-dole proposal, the academic questioned how unemployed young people would survive without social security. 'If they do not come from affluent families they will become homeless and either depend on charitable organisations or resort to petty crime,' he said. Senator Lambie's comments come just a few weeks after she made headlines for declaring she wants a 'well hung man' on a Tasmanian radio show. 'They must have heaps of cash and they've got to have a package between their legs, let's be honest,' said Mr Lambie. 'I don't need them to speak, they don't even need to speak.'

"By . Aap . and Emily Crane . Matthew Barclay, 14, vanished in rough seas during the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships on the Gold Coast on March 28, 2012 . A surf lifesaving race that claimed the life of a teenage competitor should have been postponed, a workplace health and safety inspector has told an inquest into the boy's death. Matthew Barclay, 14, vanished in rough seas during the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships at Kurrawa Beach on the Gold Coast on March 28, 2012. The inspector and lifesaver, Peter Hurrey, told the coronial inquest in Brisbane on Monday that Matthew's race should have been delayed because an inflatable rescue boat was not in the water at the time. Mr Hurrey had compiled a report that found adequate procedures were in place at the event. The inquest has previously heard the device was stranded on the beach because a new driver couldn't be found in time. Mr Hurrey said the decision to start the race was 'problematic' from a workplace health and safety perspective partly because there was a plunging wave with a shallow bank. 'The fact that you're dealing with kids who aren't as qualified in one sense and the fact that you didn't have the safety craft in position... I think it should probably have been either delayed until that was in place and moved... to where the break wasn't as bad,' he told the inquest. Mr Hurrey also criticised an iPad application used by officials to rate the conditions during competition. Inspector and lifesaver, Peter Hurrey, told the coronial inquest in Brisbane on Monday that Matthew's race should have been delayed because an inflatable rescue boat was not in the water at the time . The inquest previously heard the application described the under 15 boys as being 'at risk' but that conclusion was dismissed as 'user error' by Surf Life Saving Australia's coastal risk manager. Mr Hurrey said the application attempted to make a 'quantitative' assessment of conditions based on the user's subjective judgment, and the results could be misleading. 'It's worse than useless in one sense because it can give you a false sense of what you're doing is correct,' he told the court. The investigator agreed there was a breakdown in the system of communication that day, because lifeguards' concerns about the conditions weren't passed on to senior officials. Matthew Barclay's mother, Donna (right) and sister, Lauren (middle) left Brisbane Magistrate's Court on Monday following the coronial inquest into his death . His report also referred to a 'can do' attitude within SLSA, where there may be a reluctance to cancel events. 'Earlier in the day... we know that the boats were assessed as too risky and (officials) moved those events,' he said. 'Going back to Saxon Bird's inquest, too, the coroner there, Coroner Barnes, noted his concern when parties at that stage expressed a view that they shouldn't race and the officials were reluctant to cancel those events.' Saxon Bird was 19 when he died during a surf ski race at the same beach during the national titles in 2010. Matthew's father Stephen Barclay said he'd like to see firm recommendations about the way surf lifesaving carnivals were run to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring . Matthew's younger sister Lauren was visibly upset as she left the inquest following Mr Hurrey's evidence. Her father Stephen said he was relieved the hearing was drawing to a close. 'Some points are very difficult to listen to, certainly not like the first part of the trial where we heard from the pathologist,' he told reporters outside the building. 'Some of these things (today) are more perfunctory than anything, so my daughter was able to listen to a short amount of it before she left but I understand she's upset now.' Mr Barclay said he'd like to see firm recommendations about the way surf lifesaving carnivals were run to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring. The Barclay inquest continues.","Matthew Barclay died during a surf competition on the Gold Coast in 2012 .

"By . Aap . and Kate Lyons . and Frank Coletta . It will now be a crime for an Australian citizen to travel to a region considered by the government as a 'terrorist hostile area'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the dramatic new anti-terror laws today, which aim to stop the increasing number of Australians heading overseas to join terrorist fighters. It will also include the expansion of the definition of terrorism beyond 'terrorist activities' to threats on social media. The wide-spread changes to the definition of the terror come as the Abbott government announced they would also be backing down on changes to the Racial Discrimination Act, which would have scrapped a prohibition on offending, insulting or humiliating individuals based on race. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott will roll out the most dramatic changes to Australian security laws in more than a decade . 'These are provisions, that for a person who travels to a designated spot identified as a terrorist hostile area, will be a crime,' Mr Abbott said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that in Afghanistan, up to 30 Australians had been identified as fighting alongside extremists but 'five times that number are now of interest, fighting overseas or becoming involved'. The PM admitted the proposed changes to section 18C of the act had 'complicated' relations with ethnic groups. Tony Abbott confirmed that the new definition would encompass the behaviour of social media jihadists such as Mohamed Elomar, who has tweeted pictures of himself holding decapitated heads, and make them liable for prosecution. The announcement of the new laws and an extra $630 million in government spending on anti-terrorist measures, comes as Elomar, the 30-year-old former boxer fighting with terrorists in the Middle East, posted claims of how to access deadly explosives in Sydney. The 30-year-old invited jihadists in Sydney to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades. 'Anyone in Sydney who is after explosives (dynamite sticks, C4 sticks, orica mine sticks, grenades ) lots more. If interested DM me,' he tweeted. The new law is part of a suite of measures introduced by the government, under which Australians could be arrested for travelling to certain terrorist 'hot spots' without a valid humanitarian reason, causing fears that the onus of proof will rest on Australians who visit these areas to prove they did so innocently. One of the most controversial proposed measures would see the phone and internet records of all Australians held for two years. This would apply to metadata, rather than the content of calls and emails. Metadata is information kept by telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers, email addresses and the dates, times, locations and duration of phone calls. Under the new laws, the tweets of Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar could be classed as terrorism . Mohamed Elomar invited followers on Twitter to contact him about obtaining explosives in Sydney . Fighting in Syria: Mohamed Elomar is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria . During criminal or intelligence investigations this content can be accessed, though monitoring phone or internet use over a long period requires a warrant. Attorney-General George Brandis said last week that data collection and surveillance was necessary for dealing with the 'insidious threat' of home-grown terrorism. The laws have drawn criticism from Labor, the Greens and civil rights groups. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the changes had been forced on the Prime Minister and Attorney-General, claiming that ‘George Brandis has been humiliated by his colleagues’. ‘Today’s back down to allow bigots to be bigots, is a victory for ordinary people,’ Mr Shorten added. ‘His (Brandis’) priority as Attorney-General has allowed racists to be racist.’ Adam Bandt, acting leader of the Australian Greens acting leader said the test for any data retention or surveillance should be whether a person is 'reasonably suspected of having committed a crime'. 'To simply say everything you do online will be stored now and made available to government is over-reach,' Mr Bandt said. This is the second suite of anti-terror laws introduced by the government in recent months. In July the government introduced legislation that could allow Australian police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries and tender the evidence in Australian courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases. The laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against Australians who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), pictured marching in Syria . The law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war, like Syria, or ‘failed states’ like Somalia. Other changes include the power to suspend people's passports in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice and allowing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to pass on intelligence about Australians to its domestic counterpart, ASIO, under certain circumstances. The changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism. On the decision of the government to back down on Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, Mr Abbott reconfirmed the law needed to changed. 'But I want the communities of our country to be our friend, not our critic,' he said. 'I want to work with the communities of our country as `Team Australia' here. 'The government's perfectly reasonable attempt to amend Section 18C has become a complication we just don't need and we won't proceed with.'","There are up to 150 Australians fighting overseas alongside extremists or interested in joining them .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Aap . Treasurer Joe Hockey has called reports that the government was fully aware poorer households would be hardest hit by his budget 'misleading'. Fairfax newspapers published pre-budget Treasury numbers on Monday which backed private modelling that showed the tough May budget was unfair. According to the Treasury analysis, an average low income family loses $844 per year in disposable income, while middle income earners only forfeit $492. A high-income family is just $517 worse off. Mr Hockey has hit out at the report as 'deliberately misleading'. However, Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen accused the Treasurer of having a 'glass jaw' and ridiculed him for attacking the media over the report. Scroll down for video . Joe Hockey has hit out at a 'misleading' media report which showed his budget spending cuts have cost lower income families an average of $842 a year . Labor's Mr Bowen said Mr Hockey could not disown the figures. 'These are Treasury figures,' Mr Bowen told ABC radio. 'This is the direct impact of decisions in his budget.' Mr Hockey said high income earners paid more tax than those on lower incomes, while the analysis did not include benefits such as subsidised medicines. 'It doesn't take into account that higher income households pay half their income in tax,' an angry Mr Hockey told the Nine Network. Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen said Mr Hockey could not disown the figures about his budget . 'It also fails to take into account the massive number of concessional payments, such as discounted pharmaceuticals ... discounted transport, discounted childcare, that goes to lower income households.' Mr Hockey is struggling to sell his budget to the electorate and key crossbenchers in the Senate. Cuts to welfare, an increase in the fuel tax and the GP co-payment are among the most contentious measures. Parliamentary secretary to the treasurer Steve Ciobo said it was 'obvious' that those who received government benefits would be worse off because of the spending cuts. Higher income earners would pay more in taxes because of measures like the deficit levy, he said. '(But) obviously people who rely on more government support will feel those changes,' he told ABC radio. When the government handed down its widely criticised budget in May, they were aware cost cutting would hit poor families harder, according to a Freedom of Information request . The Fairfax media report said when the government handed down its widely criticised budget in May, they were aware cost cutting would hit poor families harder. The analysis was one of several provided to the government, but the Treasury failed to release more than one detailed model ahead of the budget. A spokeswoman for Treasurer Joe Hockey said average low-income households would still receive $12,604 in 2016-17 in cash transfers like family benefits. 'Our budget aims to make the welfare system sustainable and to reduce $123 billion in projected deficits and debt, heading towards $667 billion without remedial action,' she said. 'Our budget is focused around building a stronger economy so Australians can experience more and better jobs.' The submissions reportedly showed poorer families would suffers larger falls in disposable income rather than richer households, especially for those with children aged between six and 16.","Labor's Chris Bowen has accused treasurer of having a 'glass jaw'

"By . Aap . Sally Pearson’s renowned tunnel vision has delivered a scintillating run at the Commonwealth Games, a day after an explosive attack on her that led to Australia’s athletics coach being sent home. Eric Hollingsworth was booted from the Games after claiming Pearson had set a 'bad example' to teammates by skipping a pre-Games camp. The Olympic champion let her feet do the talking this morning, clocking 12.69 seconds to smash her rivals in her 100m hurdles heat. 'It was so good, I’ve been so stressed,' Pearson said afterwards. Victory: Sally Pearson won the Women's 100m Hurdles during the Commonwealth Games, in Glasgow, Scotland, after a turbulent few days . 'I haven’t had a great season, I hurt my hamstring and every single week has been a hard slog getting back here.' Pearson refused to directly address the furore surrounding Hollingsworth, but admitted it had been a 'huge distraction'. 'I’m in a good space at the moment and I just want to keep going,' she said. 'I know I have a reliable team. I’ve been supported since 2013... and I’m just so happy to deliver today.'

Porter is likely to be the main challenger to defending champion Pearson in the final on Friday (Saturday morning AEST). Canadian Angela Whyte won the slowest of the three heats in 13.33. Australian Commonwealth Games Association chef de mission Steve Moneghetti announced at a press conference on Thursday morning that Hollingsworth had been stripped of his accreditation and would travel back to Australia at the earliest opportunity. Moneghetti said: 'There was a breach in our team agreement with one of our members of the team, specifically the head coach of the athletics section.'We invited that person in to explain that breach in the contract and we decided that there was reason enough to impost some sanctions on the actions taken by Eric Hollingsworth and we then spoke to the section manager from athletics to decide on an appropriate sanction.'As a result of that Athletics Australia withdrew Eric's nomination as head coach of the athletics section of the Australia's Commonwealth Games team and this led to us revoking his accreditation. We've made arrangements for Eric to travel back to Australia at an appropriate time.'He is going home today, if we can get some flights arranged.

"By . Sarah Dean . and Aap . and Kate Lyons . Attorney-General George Brandis is under pressure after Prime Minister Tony Abbott decided to back down on plans to water down the Racial Discrimination Act without telling him. The controversial changes to the act, which were discussed for over six months, had been ridiculed by the opposition, ethnic leaders, the public and his own party. The Abbott government wanted to reform section 18C of the act after Andrew Bolt was found to have breached the act with a Herald Sun column. The amendments would have scrapped a prohibition on offending, insulting or humiliating individuals based on race. Attorney General George Brandis was told by Tony Abbott on Tuesday morning that his legislation to change the racial discrimination act had to be dropped . On his radio show on Tuesday, Bolt attacked former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell after the disgraced politician slammed his comments criticising Mr Abbott's decision not to repeal 18C. 'Hello to Barry...pour yourself another expensive red, one you might have forgotten you actually had there,' he said on Sydney's 2GB, prompting laughter from his co-host Steve Price. Bolt was referring to the scandal that brought down Mr O'Farrell, when he was forced to admit he gave inaccurate evidence to a corruption inquiry about receiving a bottle of Grange wine from a lobbyist. Mr O'Farrell had tweeted during the radio show, condemning Bolt's strong criticism of the government's decision, saying the comments were 'so irrational they're almost humorous'. In a newspaper column, called 'It's so hip to be black', Bolt wrote: 'Meet the white face of a new black race — the political Aborigine.' The News Corp columnist was allegedly briefed on the backdown and hour before the public were told of it, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. But on his radio show, he said: 'What he is saying is the very people, the very ethnic groups that would take exception to 18C are the same ones that are, in part, some of them, affected or take offence to the anti-terrorism legislation. 'To make them feel not picked on he'll retain laws against free speech,' Bolt said. Attorney-General Brandis has previously said Australians have a 'right to be bigots' when defending his changes. The repeal of 18C, an Abbott government election commitment, has been widely criticised as a watering down of protections against racism. Section 18C of the act makes it unlawful to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. More than 5500 submissions flooded into the Attorney-General's office following the release of draft laws in March. Only a handful have been released but the majority reportedly opposed the changes. A government source told the Sydney Morning Herald the changes were to keep 'the moderate Muslim community' onside. 'The purpose of the exposure draft was to get community feedback and the feedback has been ""don't change it"". As part of combating terrorism, we want the moderate Muslim community to be onside. One of the sticking points has been 18C,' they said. Andrew Bolt was one of the first to comment on the government's announcement on Tuesday, blaming the move on lobby groups who 'hate free speech' An April poll published by Fairfax Media showed 88 per cent of respondents believed it should be illegal to offend, insult or humiliate someone based on their race. The PM admitted the proposed changes to section 18C of the act had 'complicated' relations with ethnic groups. Coalition backbenchers joined the opposition, and Labor leader Bill Shorten says that's why the 'deeply unpopular' changes have been ditched. 'What is clear ... is that the Attorney-General has been rolled by his cabinet,' Mr Shorten told reporters. The government had been humiliated and embarrassed by the proposal, he said, which was flagged one year ago. 'This has been a dreadful waste of national energy,' the opposition leader said. The Australian Greens have repeatedly questioned the government's motive behind the changes, after political commentator Andrew Bolt fell foul to 18C for a column questioning the motives of lighter-skinned Aboriginal people. Mr Bolt was one of the first to comment on the government's announcement on Tuesday, blaming the move on lobby groups who ""hate free speech"". 'I suspect the country will be poorer for this,' he said. The government may have backed down on Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, but Mr Abbott reconfirmed the law needed to changed. 'But I want the communities of our country to be our friend, not our critic,' he said. 'I want to work with the communities of our country as 'Team Australia' here. 'The government's perfectly reasonable attempt to amend Section 18C has become a complication we just don't need and we won't proceed with,' he added. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott will roll out the most dramatic changes to Australian security laws in more than a decade . On Tuesday, Mr Abbott also revealed it will now be a crime for an Australian citizen to travel to a region considered by the government as a 'terrorist hostile area'. The PM announced dramatic new anti-terror laws, which aim to stop the increasing number of Australians heading overseas to join terrorist fighters. It will also include the expansion of the definition of terrorism beyond 'terrorist activities' to threats on social media. 'These are provisions, that for a person who travels to a designated spot identified as a terrorist hostile area, will be a crime,' Mr Abbott said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that in Afghanistan, up to 30 Australians had been identified as fighting alongside extremists but 'five times that number are now of interest, fighting overseas or becoming involved'. Tony Abbott confirmed that the new definition would encompass the behaviour of social media jihadists such as Mohamed Elomar, who has tweeted pictures of himself holding decapitated heads, and make them liable for prosecution. The announcement of the new laws and an extra $630 million in government spending on anti-terrorist measures, comes as Elomar, the 30-year-old former boxer fighting with terrorists in the Middle East, posted claims of how to access deadly explosives in Sydney. The 30-year-old invited jihadists in Sydney to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades. 'Anyone in Sydney who is after explosives (dynamite sticks, C4 sticks, orica mine sticks, grenades ) lots more. If interested DM me,' he tweeted. The new law is part of a suite of measures introduced by the government, under which Australians could be arrested for travelling to certain terrorist 'hot spots' without a valid humanitarian reason, causing fears that the onus of proof will rest on Australians who visit these areas to prove they did so innocently. One of the most controversial proposed measures would see the phone and internet records of all Australians held for two years. This would apply to metadata, rather than the content of calls and emails. Metadata is information kept by telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers, email addresses and the dates, times, locations and duration of phone calls. Under the new laws, the tweets of Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar could be classed as terrorism . Mohamed Elomar invited followers on Twitter to contact him about obtaining explosives in Sydney . Fighting in Syria: Mohamed Elomar is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria . During criminal or intelligence investigations this content can be accessed, though monitoring phone or internet use over a long period requires a warrant. Attorney-General George Brandis said last week that data collection and surveillance was necessary for dealing with the 'insidious threat' of home-grown terrorism. The laws have drawn criticism from Labor, the Greens and civil rights groups. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the changes had been forced on the Prime Minister and Attorney-General, claiming that ‘George Brandis has been humiliated by his colleagues’. ‘Today’s back down to allow bigots to be bigots, is a victory for ordinary people,’ Mr Shorten added. ‘His (Brandis’) priority as Attorney-General has allowed racists to be racist.’ Adam Bandt, acting leader of the Australian Greens acting leader said the test for any data retention or surveillance should be whether a person is 'reasonably suspected of having committed a crime'. 'To simply say everything you do online will be stored now and made available to government is over-reach,' Mr Bandt said. This is the second suite of anti-terror laws introduced by the government in recent months. In July the government introduced legislation that could allow Australian police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries and tender the evidence in Australian courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases. The laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against Australians who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), pictured marching in Syria . The law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war, like Syria, or ‘failed states’ like Somalia. Other changes include the power to suspend people's passports in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice and allowing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to pass on intelligence about Australians to its domestic counterpart, ASIO, under certain circumstances. The changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism.","PM scrapped proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act .

Friends and family of Roger and Jill Guard packed out a theatre in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, on Sunday to pay their respects. The couple, who left behind three adult children and two grandkids, had called Toowoomba home for 30 years. Friends and family of Roger and Jill Guard packed out a theatre in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, on Sunday to pay their respects . Roger had spent 25 years as the director of pathology at Toowoomba Base Hospital, providing evidence for many coronial inquests, while his wife of almost 42 years, Jill, was a GP. The Guards had run the Queensland city's Road Runners and helped Sudanese women adjust to new life in Australia. The farmer's son and Congregational minister's daughter were among 298 people, including up to 39 Australian citizens, who died when Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was shot down over the Ukraine more than a fortnight ago. The couple's son Paul told the memorial service he and his siblings were glad their parents were together on their final adventure .

But Labor is still the most popular party and rival Bill Shorten has also received a boost in support from voters for the bipartisanship he has shown in standing with the Prime Minister in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy. Prime Minister Abbott's 12-point jump in net voter satisfaction is his best result in three months, according to the latest Newspoll published by The Australian. Scroll down for video .

The recent news that animals were abused during wild late night parties at London Zoo is just the most recent example of why animal conservationists may need need to rethink their strategy on keeping animals in captivity. Zoos across the world vary widely in the standards of welfare they offer creatures, and indeed many people believe that keeping animals in enclosures at all is an outdated concept that should be scrapped. But now a group of Danish architects has come up with a zoo design that could allow people to safely watch animals, without the creatures ever feeling like they’re imprisoned. Scroll down for video . Even if you love going to the zoo, seeing an animal in captivity and out of their natural habitat can be upsetting.Now a group of Danish architects has come up with a zoo design (pictured) that could allow people to safely watch animals, without the creatures ever feeling like they’re imprisoned . In this Zootopia, the humans are hidden from animals in shelters and mirrored pods, while the animals roam around a huge 300 acre complex divided into continents. The Bjarke Ingels Group design, which is still in its very early stages, has been put forward for the 50-year-old Givskud Zoo in Denmark, according to a report by Becky Quintal in Arch Daily. These continents can be accessed by visitors using ramps, bridges, and tunnels hidden in the ground. They would then be able to hide inside shelters, pods and hollowed logs as the animals pass by. At the heart of the design is a huge swooping circular plaza that lets people climb up to look down on the parkland. This also allows visitors to get access to a trio of the zoo's three habitats: Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The entire zoo is ringed by an elevated walkway and a 2.5 mile-long hike connects all three continents. Particulars of the design are still to be confirmed and its unclear exactly how far the barriers between animals and visitors will be broken down. This image suggests the barriers will be minimal, allowing humans to come close to the animals, without the animals feeling like they are being watched .

It is touted as a wild night out. But parties at London Zoo are becoming a little too wild. Drunken revellers have been taunting and abusing the animals at Zoo Lates events, which are held on Friday nights over the summer. Incidents include a woman punching a bird, a male pouring beer on a tiger, a reveller stripping off before entering the penguin enclosure and butterflies squashed underfoot. There are also claims that a drunken woman tried to get into the lion enclosure.The animals are said to have been disturbed by loud noise and flash photography at the parties. To keep people safe, the architects believe visitors could travel by bike, which would have spherical mirrors attached to keep them hidden. Other ideas include having huge spheres hung from tension cables over bears, lions and or travelling by boat alongside elephants. ‘We must make sure that our cities offer a generous framework for different people – from different backgrounds, economy, gender, culture, education and age – so they can live together in harmony while taking into account individual needs as well as the common good,’ the company writes on its website. ‘Nowhere is this challenge more acrimonious than in a zoo. 'It is our dream – with Givskud – to create the best possible and freest possible environment for the animals' lives and relationships with each other and visitors.’ Others particulars of the design are still to be confirmed and its unclear exactly how far the barriers between animals and visitors will be broken down. The design is currently early initial master plan for an overhaul of the part that's scheduled to be completed by 2019.

This means if someone else has the app installed, users can remotely set up the shot and take the picture from that person's phone. 'The case and app were born out of a desire to be included in group photos of friends and family and to enhance the phone’s capacity for capturing hands-free pictures and videos,' the case's Kickstarter page says. The picture taken is upside down, as it’s an image of the reflection. The app automatically inverts it to appear the right way up. CaseCam was created by Seattle-based Garett Ochs, who is currently working on a new design that will allow the mirror to be stowed facing inwards, so that it doesn’t get scratched. The device is currently only compatible with the iPhone 5 and 5S. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, the case will sell for around £25 ($40), but early-bird backers can get their hands on one for £15 ($25). One of the stand out events of this year's Oscars ceremony was that ubiquitous selfie taken by Bradley Cooper on Ellen DeGeneres’ phone. The problem that many people highlighted was the fact that Cooper's arms weren’t quite long enough to fit everyone in - but now there’s a solution, dubbed the 'selfie stick.' A number of companies are now selling 'arm extenders' that not only hold the camera, but are also used to take the shot and even focus the image. The trend for cameras on sticks, also known as monopods, isn’t new and a number of sticks are already available for digital cameras from companies including Opteka and XShot. Monpods work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer, and using the front-facing camera. Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device. Depending on the model, some monopods will manually press the shutter button on the side of phone using an arm, or similar. Others connect remotely via Bluetooth and take the photo using software controls.

"By . Sally Lee . and Aap . If a picture is worth a thousand words, the messages in these disturbing drawings  are loud and clear. Asylum seeker and refugee children, aged four to 17, have shared their experiences of being confined within the walls of Australia's detention centres. The drawings were released ahead the Australian Human Rights Commission's third hearing into the inquiry of detained children, which heard there are 659 children in immigration detention. Scroll down for video . The third hearing into the Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry on asylum seeker and refugee children will be held in Sydney on Thursday . A drawing by a six year old depicting life behind bars in an Australian detention centre . The drawings by asylum seeker and refugee children were released by the Australian Human Rights Commission . This image shows how children desperately want to be released from Australian detention centres . One troubling image shows people 'crying in the jail' while a child's parents are pictured committing suicide at Christmas Island. Another shows a haunting image of a person holding what appears to be a knife dripping with blood with the message: 'I need to go out please. I no wat [sic] to sit in jail. I want to go to school'. Through these drawings, children are pleading to be released where one child wrote: 'Is there anybody in Australia who can help us? Please help us'. An inquiry in to the health, well-being and development of children held in Australian detention centres was launched by Commission President Gillian Triggs on February 3. The Australian Human Rights Commission launched an inquiry into the health, well-being and development of detained children in February . This pictures shows a disturbing image of a person holding a knife that's dripping with blood . A heartbreaking drawing by a 14-year-old of life in one of Australia's detention centres . The head of Immigration Department Secretary Martin Bowles is due to make his first appearance at the inquiry along with other Immigration and Border Protection staff on Thursday . Department of Immigration and Border Protection secretary Martin Bowles told the commission the number of children being held in detention centres in Australia and offshore was 659 in July, 2013. This was 1330 less than the peak of 1992. Mr Bowles said the number of children being held at the Christmas Island detention centre was now 153, down by more than 530 in the past year. Some of those children had been transferred to Nauru, where there were now 185 children being held. Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) president Gillian Triggs asked Mr Bowles if he was being 'straight forward with the Australian public' in stating numbers on Christmas Island were being reduced if children had simply been transferred to Nauru. Mr Bowles responded that there had been a 'significant and considerable decrease' in numbers of children being held. 'I reject the imputation that we are either misleading or lying to anybody in relation to the reduction of children in detention,' he told the inquiry in Sydney on Thursday. The commission heard there are about 37 children among the 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers recently transferred to the Curtin detention centre in Western Australia. 'Is there anybody in Australia who can help us,' one child writes underneath their drawing . Counsel assisting the inquiry Naomi Sharp asked Mr Bowles if he could confirm there were babies among those children. Mr Bowles that he could not confirm there were babies without having confirmed the ""biodata"" from assessment of the group, but said there were small children. In a statement to the inquiry Mr Bowles rejected claims made in the media about poor health care standards at the Christmas Island detention centre, saying the claims 'offend greatly' staff working at the centre. Mr Bowles said healthcare services on Christmas Island were 'commensurate with those available to the Australian community'. Mr Bowles said he would make no comments on Nauru as the scope of the commission extended only to onshore detention centres. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young says reports from Western Australia's Curtin Immigration Detention Centre reveals 'high levels of torture and trauma' among detainees . The AHRC national inquiry into the health and well-being of children in immigration detention continues. Prof Triggs announced that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison had agreed to appear before the inquiry. She said Mr Morrison had declined to appear on Thursday because of the current legal proceedings surrounding the 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers. No date has yet been set for the minister's appearance. A spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the government would cooperate with the inquiry. 'More importantly the government will continue to reduce the number of children in detention as we have been doing since the day we were elected,' she said. The number of children in detention had fallen by almost 35 per cent since the September election.

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Aap . Former House of Representatives Speaker Peter Slipper, pictured arriving at the Magistrates Court in Canberra last week, has been found guilty of dishonesty . Former parliamentary Speaker Peter Slipper has been found guilty of dishonestly using taxpayer-funded travel vouchers. Mr Slipper had admitted using commonwealth Cabcharge taxi vouchers to pay for trips to wineries outside Canberra in January 2010. But the former MP denied he acted dishonestly. The ACT Chief Magistrate Lorraine Walker thought otherwise after a week-long hearing, finding Mr Slipper guilty of three counts of dishonesty on Monday. An impassive Mr Slipper sipped from a glass of water as the verdict was delivered and he will be sentenced on September 22. Mr Slipper's lawyers indicated more evidence might be presented to the court prior to sentencing. During the trial Slipper's lawyer's told the magistrate that it wasn't unusual for him to keep a tab of daily travel and use manual dockets to pay for trips. The former Queensland Nationals and Liberal MP was charged with misusing about $900 worth of Cabcharge vouchers on three separate occasions in the first half of 2010. The prosecution had alleged Slipper manually filled out multiple vouchers for the journeys to hide the non-parliamentary nature of the trips - one of which involved several stops at wineries over 4.5 hours. His defence team claimed it wasn't unusual for Slipper to pay for trips at the end of daily travel and pay for them manually instead of electronically. After lengthy legal argument during his trial in the ACT Magistrate's Court last Wednesday, Slipper's defence was allowed to submit some new evidence to prove his tendency to do so but not all their evidence was allowed. Slipper admitted hiring the cars and paying with multiple, manual dockets. On at least one occasion Slipper had attended a parliamentary function as part of the travel, the court was told. Detective Sergeant Michael Turner - who was in charge of the investigation - told the court several other car trips were investigated but no charges were laid. In June, Slipper's lawyers argued the charges should be dismissed under the Mental Health Act due to his state of mind. The court was told that his life had spiralled into one of despair as a result of criminal allegations but it ruled the trial go ahead for the sake of public interest. MPs and senators are allowed only to use government funds to pay for official or parliamentary travel.","Former parliamentary Speaker Peter Slipper found guilty of dishonestly .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The Milky Way was recently believed to have a mass three trillion times bigger than that of our sun. But now scientists have discovered that our Milky Way is lighter than previously thought - with just 800 billion solar masses. This means it has about half the mass of one of its closest neighbours, the Andromeda galaxy, 2.5 million light years away. The Milky Way is seen here above the dome of the Danish 1.54-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Scientists have discovered that the Milky Way, the galaxy containing the sun and its family of planets, is lighter than was previously thought . Both are similar types of spiral galaxy and the largest in a clump of 54 galaxies known as the 'Local Group'. Scientists believe Andromeda's extra weight must be in the form of dark matter, an invisible substance thought to bind galaxies together with its gravity. The galaxy, which is about the same size as the Milky Way, is believed to contain twice as much dark matter as our galactic home. Previous studies were only able to measure the mass enclosed within the galaxies' inner regions. The new study included the mass of outer region invisible matter. Scientists believe Andromeda's extra weight must be in the form of dark matter, an invisible substance thought to bind galaxies together with its gravity. At approximately 2.5 million light-years away, the Andromeda galaxy, or M31, is our Milky Way's largest galactic neighbour . Data on the known distances between galaxies in the Local Group were used to calculate the total masses of Andromeda and the Milky Way. The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars. Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created. Based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the centre of the Milky Way could have a supermassive black hole. The findings, from a team led by Dr Jorge Penarrubia at the University of Edinburgh, appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Dr Penarrubia said: 'We always suspected that Andromeda is more massive than the Milky Way, but weighting both galaxies simultaneously proved to be extremely challenging. They researchers believe their work should help them learn more about how the outer regions of galaxies are structured. 'Our study combined recent measurements of the relative motion between our galaxy and Andromeda with the largest catalogue of nearby galaxies ever compiled to make this possible.' Although both galaxies appear to be of similar dimensions, until now scientists had been unable to prove which is larger. Dr Penarrubia told MailOnline: 'We don’t understand at all what dark matter might be and there are many theories. 'What are research could do is help explain more about how this elusive material behaves.' The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. Here it is pictured above Steephill Cove in Isle of Wight, England .","The Milky Way is 800 billion more massive than our sun, study claims .
This means it has half the mass of the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy .
The extra weight may be down to the existence of elusive dark matter .
Work could help reveal how the outer regions of galaxies are structured .
It could also shed light on the possible form and existence of dark matter ."
"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Fruit fly ovaries or a fungus garden don't automatically spring to mind when imagining objects of beauty. But to a scientist, seeing these strange and fascinating specimens in detail can reveal unexpected patterns of beauty. And now anyone can see the same stunning patterns as part of an annual exhibition held by Princeton University in New Jersey, which highlights the art in science. What does a fish see when it schools with others? In this GIF, the visual field is shown for one fish in a school. The field of view of the left eye is seen in red and the right in  blue. The areas of overlap are shown in purple. The video illustrates the fact that a fish can see far more than a few nearest neighbours . The exhibit consists of both still images and video of artistic merit created during the course of scientific research. The idea is to spur debate among artists about the nature of art and open scientists to new ways of 'seeing' their own research. It also hopes to open a window through which the general public can appreciate both art and science - two fields that for differing reasons can feel threatening to the non-expert. This image won first place and is the work of  Princeton postdoctoral researcher Sara Sadri. Named 'Watermarks,' the images traces the complex patterns created by water moving back and forth on New Jersey's Atlantic coast . Microtubules are hollow filaments that serve as the skeleton of the cell. They were thought to grow linearly, but this GIF shows that they can branch: microtubules (red with growing tips in green) grow off the wall of existing microtubules . 'Portrait of the Artist in the Air Shower' won third prize in the Art of Science competition. The image was taken during a 20-second blast of air that removes tiny pieces of debris when scientists enter the clean room . Shown here are fungus-growing ants and the fungus garden they cultivate in a colony from the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. The interaction between ant workers and the growing fungus creates dynamic living structure, seen here growing in a time-lapse video over the course of ten days . Sara Sadri, a postdoctoral student in Civil and Environmental Engineering came first with her image dubbed 'Watermarks'. The image traces the complex patterns created by water moving back and forth on New Jersey's Atlantic coast. Second place went to James Waters for his 'Fungus among us' The image shows a microscopic view of a fungus growing on debris within an ant colony. Yasmin Afsar, graduate student, Electrical Engineering came third with 'Portrait of the artist in the air shower'. The image was taken during a 20-second blast of air that removes tiny pieces of debris when scientists enter the clean room. ‘Art of Science imagery has universal appeal, across cultures, languages, and age groups,’ the organisers claim. ‘Powerful imaging tools can now capture our world in ways never before contemplated and unintentionally produce aesthetically interesting visual effects. ‘When viewed through the lens of art, these images can further man’s concept of what it means to be human, enhance our appreciation of the natural world, and enrich our cultural heritage.’ Forty-four still images and 12 videos were chosen from more than 30 submissions from undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, staff, and alumni. Zach Donnell, a graduate student in molecular biology and one of the 2014 organizers, explained that the exhibit highlights the interplay between art and science. 'While the scientific methods behind the exhibit strive for objectivity and consensus, everyone’s individual response to the images is subjective and highly personal,' he said. Sara Sadri, a postdoc in Civil and Environmental Engineering came first with her image dubbed 'Watermarks'. Second place went to James Waters, a student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology for his 'Fungus among us' The image shows a microscopic view of a fungus growing on debris within an ant colony. The image of a 'Fruit Fly Factory' shows cross sections of ten ovaries from a female fruit fly. Each ovary acts as an 'assembly line,' with each egg (yellow circles) being formed as it works its way to the larger end of the ovary. The image was created by Yogesh Goyal, Bomyi Lim, Miriam Osterfield, and Stas Shvartsman . 'Fungus Among Us' - pictured on the left is a microscopic view of a fungus growing on debris within an ant colony. The white areas transport nutrients between the reproductive spores (brown). On the right is an image of an ant hiding in one of the fittings designed to measure its respirometry system . This piece, titled 'Angel, shows a close up of the protective coatings of hydroxyapatite that are durable, but invisible. To control the growth of the mineral, researcehrs add a polymer (polyacrylic acid), which adsorbs on the growing crystal. In this image, the polyacrylic acid particles show exotic forms . The title of this image paraphrases Lewis Wolpert's declaration: 'It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation, which is truly the most important time in your life.' 'Gastrulation' is the process by which, through coordinated cell shape changes and movements, an embryo takes form. This image shows a transverse view through a gastrulating fruit fly embryo . Yasmin Afsar, graduate student, Electrical Engineering came third with 'Portrait of the artist in the air shower'. The image was taken during a 20-second blast of air that removes tiny pieces of debris when scientists enter the clean room. This is the seventh Princeton University Art of Science competition but the first to include a category of video. The top video award was a GoPro camera, awarded to Sabine Petry, assistant professor of molecular biology, for 'Microtubules branch out.' 'So much of science and engineering involves video or animation these days that it was inevitable we would include it in Art of Science,' said Dan Quinn, a graduate student in mechanical and aerospace engineering who is one of the 2014 exhibit organisers. 'Since a picture is worth a thousand words, video is worth approximately 30,000 words per second, so adding a video component to Art of Science was a no-brainer.' Those attending the opening reception for the physical gallery in May were also asked to fill out a paper 'People’s Choice' ballot. Of 185 ballots cast, 1st place for the still image went to 'Fruit fly factory' by Yogesh Goyal, Bomyi Lim, Miriam Osterfield, Stas Shvartsman, of Chemical and Biological Engineering. The People’s Choice award for video went to 'Plenty of Fish' by Colin Twomey and Haishan Wu of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. The physical gallery of the 2014 exhibit will be on view in the Friend Center on the Princeton University campus through the end of April 2015.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The world has wanted to develop holograms ever since Princess Leia used it to appear before Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. Now, more than three decades later, the hologram could be edging closer to reality with a gadget that allows you to view projected 3D images in space, from any vantage point. The technology, dubbed ‘Help Me Obi’, has been created by a pair of Scottish artists who claim to be able to project 3D objects as large as 30cm (12 inches). Scroll down for video . While holograms are increasingly being used in theatres and gigs, they are currently 2D and can only be viewed correctly from a certain angle. This technology, however, is different. It has been eight years in development and is the work of Carsluith-based artists Chris Helson and Sarah Jackets. Miss Jackets is quick to point out that the system is not actually a 3D hologram. Pictured is the Voyager 1 probe 3D image projected using the system (left) and a jellyfish shown on the right . 'Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope sparked our imaginations of what might be possible in the future by showing R2-D2 and Chewbacca playing a holographic chess-style game . The baby is the artist's son a few days old. The boy in the photos looking at the baby is the same boy now at five years old . ‘We use the term holographic to help to describe it because there is nothing else like it, it's a device that produces 360 degree video objects,’ she said. ‘It exploits persistence of vision, video projection and a number of engineering inventions. ‘Beyond that, we can't really tell you much more because it's going through a patent process.’ So far the system displays a number of moving objects which includes the couple’s baby son at a few days old, a jellyfish swimming in air and the Nasa Voyager 1 probe. 'Every element of making was a huge challenge,' they said. 'The first version we made was quite abstract and flickered heavily, it was a bit like the very first TV, not easy to see the image but enough to see the possibilities.' Referencing Princess Leia’s iconic appearance in Star Wars (left) as a 3D moving holographic message, Help me Obi (right) is an investigation of remote relationships, intimacy and dislocation . 'When you actually stand there with them floating in front of you they have a life that you connect to in a very different way than you would with a film or video, or even a 3D film.' 'This is what we mean by intimacy and dislocation, that your connection to voyager, the iconic messenger from earth, and the ideas it embodies become physical,' the artists added. But they hope their technology can also be used for practical applications, such as creating 3D drawings and computer designs. The system is currently in its prototype stage, although the designers said they may commercialise it in the future. Help Me Obi will be on display at the Alt-w exhibition, through which it won an award, at the Edinburgh Art Festival from until August 31. It may have taken 36 years but the iconic holographic chess game from 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope' just took a step closer to reality thanks to a pair of augmented and virtual reality specs. The castAR system uses a pair of glasses fitted with a micro-projector on each lens that beams images in 3D onto a specially-designed flat surface. These images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand. 'CastAR is a projected augmented reality system that displays holographic-like 3D projections right in front of you,' said the system's Washington-based maker Technical Illusions. CastAR's system is made of a pair of glasses and a surface. The frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye. Each projector beams a perspective view of a stereoscopic 3D image onto the retro-reflective surface. A tiny camera, fitted between the projectors, scans for infrared identification markers placed on this surface. The camera uses these markers to precisely track a player's head position and orientation in the physical world. The so-called Magic Wand can be used as a joystick and a '3D input device.' The handheld part of the wand has buttons, a trigger, and a thumb stick. The wand also tracks its own movement in 3D space, allowing players to interact with virtual environments. The castAR system uses a pair of glasses, pictured, fitted with a projector on each lens. Each micro-projector receives a video stream via a HDMI connection and beams these images in 3D onto retro-reflective sheeting. The images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand .","'Help Me Obi' gadget can project 3D objects as large as 30cm (12 inches)

Dubbed the Kholod Hypersonic rocket system, the machine is driven by a cryogenically cooled liquid hydrogen called scramjet and can reach speeds of up to 4,310mph (6900km/h). The rocket was the result of a £60 million ($101 million) project between Nasa and the Russian Institute for New Propellants and was completed in the early 1990s. Tge Kholod Hypersonic rocket system, which can reach speeds of up to 4,310mph (6900km/h), is up for auction . It had previously held the world record for outright atmospheric speed between 1991 and 2001 after reaching a staggering Mach 6.47 (4,310mph).

One thing has always been true about rockets: The farther and faster you want to go, the bigger your rocket needs to be. This is because rockets combine a liquid fuel with liquid oxygen to create thrust.  ake away the need for liquid oxygen and a spacecraft can be smaller or carry more payload. That's the idea behind a propulsion called 'scramjet,' or Supersonic Combustion Ramjet. The oxygen needed by the engine to combust is taken from the atmosphere passing through the vehicle, instead of from a tank onboard. The craft becomes smaller, lighter and faster. Scramjets work by gathering up air, forcing it into a combustion chamber where the fuel (usually hydrogen) is burned, generating thrust that keeps the craft going. Source: Nasa .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Violent conflicts, organised crime and child labour are being driven by declines in wildlife population. This is according to a recent report which highlights how losses of food and employment from wildlife are creating political instability. The research also suggests that falling animal populations could be connected to an increase in human trafficking as criminal groups rely on slave labour, often children, to meet the need for increased manpower. Study compared wildlife poaching to the drug trade, suggesting that huge profits from trafficking luxury wildlife goods, such as elephant tusks and rhino horns, have attracted guerilla groups and crime syndicates worldwide . ‘This paper is about recognising wildlife decline as a source of social conflict rather than a symptom,' said Justin Brashares, professor of ecology at University of California, Berkeley, who led the study. ‘Billions of people rely directly and indirectly on wild sources of meat for income and sustenance, and this resource is declining. ‘It's not surprising that the loss of this critical piece of human livelihoods has huge social consequences. ‘Yet, both conservation and political science have generally overlooked these fundamental connections.’ The group pointed to the Lord's Resistance Army, al-Shabab and Boko Haram as groups known to use wildlife poaching to fund terrorist attacks. Pictured is the leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Sheku . Fewer animals to hunt and less fish to catch generate increasingly greater effort to harvest, the report said. Labourers – many of whom are children – are often sold to fishing boats and forced to work 18-20 hour days at sea for years without pay, it said. The scientists claim that falling animal populations could be connected to an increase in human trafficking. They argue that criminal groups rely on slave labour, often children, to meet the need for increased manpower. They also connected the rise of piracy and maritime violence in Somalia to battles over fishing rights. They . believe what began as an effort to repel foreign vessels illegally . trawling through Somali waters escalated into hijacking fishing – and . then non-fishing – vessels for ransom. The . study compared wildlife poaching to the drug trade, suggesting . that huge profits from trafficking luxury wildlife goods have attracted . crime syndicates worldwide. ‘Impoverished families are relying upon these resources for their livelihoods, so we can't apply economic models that prescribe increases in prices or reduced demand as supplies become scarce,' said Professor Brashares. 'Instead, as more labour is needed to capture scarce wild animals and fish, hunters and fishers use children as a source of cheap labour. ‘Hundreds of thousands of impoverished families are selling their kids to work in harsh conditions.' The authors connected the rise of piracy and maritime violence in Somalia to battles over fishing rights. What began as an effort to repel foreign vessels illegally trawling through Somali waters escalated into hijacking fishing – and then non-fishing – vessels for ransom. 'Surprisingly few people recognise that competition for fish stocks led to the birth of Somali piracy,' said Professor Brashares. 'For Somali fishermen, and for hundreds of millions of others, fish and wildlife were their only source of livelihood, so when that was threatened by international fishing fleets, drastic measures were taken.' The study also compared wildlife poaching to the drug trade, suggesting that huge profits from trafficking luxury wildlife goods, such as elephant tusks and rhino horns, have attracted guerilla groups and crime syndicates worldwide. They pointed to the Lord's Resistance Army, al-Shabab and Boko Haram as groups known to use wildlife poaching to fund terrorist attacks. The authors connected the rise of piracy and maritime violence in Somalia to battles over fishing rights. Pictured is a 'skiff', a small boat frequently used by pirates, off the Somalia coast . 'The most important bit from this article, I think, is that we need to better understand the factors that underlie fish and wildlife declines from a local perspective, and that interdisciplinary approaches are likely the best option for facilitating this understanding,' said Meredith Gore, a Michigan State University associate professor of conservation criminology who was not part of the study. The authors give examples of local governments heading off social tension, such as the granting of exclusive rights to hunting and fishing grounds to locals in Fiji, and the control of management zones in Namibia to reduce poaching and improve the livelihoods of local populations. 'This prescribed re-visioning of why we should conserve wildlife helps make clearer what the stakes are in this game,' said UC Santa Barbara assistant professor Douglas McCauley. 'Losses of wildlife essentially pull the rug out from underneath societies that depend on these resources. We are not just losing species. ‘We are losing children, breaking apart communities, and fostering crime. This makes wildlife conservation a more important job than it ever has been.'","Study says wildlife loss is source of social conflict rather than a symptom .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Men with wide faces have been getting a bad reputation lately. Scientists had previously suggested large faces were prone to being more aggressive, untrustworthy and deceitful. But now there may be good news for the likes of Alan Sugar and Wayne Rooney. Researchers in the U.S. claim people with wide faces are more likely to get a bonus compared with their thin-faced rivals. There may be good news for the likes of Alan Sugar (left) and Wayne Rooney (right). Researchers in the U.S claim people with wide faces are more likely to get a bonus compared with thin-faced rivals . Fuller faced workers earn £1,300 more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus, the study found. However, researchers said this comes with a compromise. Wide faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations. And men who are more attractive are better collaborators compared to less attractive men, they said. Previous research based on the 'facial width-to-height ratio' found individuals behave more selfishly when interacting with men with wider faces. On average, fuller faced workers such as Simon Cowell on the left earn £1,300 more than those with narrow faces (such as that of David Tennet on the right) when asking for a bonus, the study found . This research claims that while men with wider faces are more likely to lie and cheat, they tend to lead more financially successful firms. It is an established fact that someone with a long face is probably feeling a bit sorry for themselves - but scientists say people with wide faces are untrustworthy. Research has shed new light on the motives of 'wide boys' who are more likely to lie and cheat than their thinner faced contemporaries. But the study also showed that those with larger faces, such as former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and disgraced former U.S. President Richard Nixon, were more cut-throat and therefore more likely to be successful, particularly in business or in politics. Psychologists from Canada gave 150 men an exercise to complete where they had to roll virtual dice on a screen and then manually write down their score. They were told that the number they recorded would correspond to the number of tickets they received in a lottery. The researcher then left the room while they completed the task. But software secretly recorded the real total allowing the psychologists to compare it with what the respondent had entered. About 20 per cent - or one in five - of the men who took part cheated, all of whom had wide face. 'We negotiate everyday whether we think about it or not,' said University of California's Professor Michael Haselhuhn. 'It’s not just the big things, like a car or a home. It’s what time your kid is going to go to bed or what you or your spouse are going to have for dinner. 'These studies show that being a man with a wider face can be both a blessing and a curse and awareness of this may be important for future business success.' The study by University of California’s Riverside’s School of Business Administration set up four experiments to reach their conclusion. The first involved bonus negotiations while the second found men with wider faces selling a chemical plant negotiated a higher sale price than men with a more narrow face. When those same wide-faced men were in the buyer role they negotiated a lower price than the narrow-faced men. In the third negotiating scenario, in which a creative solution was needed to bridge a gap on a property deal wider-faced men were less successful in the negotiation. In the final scenario the more attractive men were more successful in the negotiation in the property deal. The study was published online in the journal 'The Leadership Quarterly.'","Men with wider faces, such as Wayne Rooney, are more likely to get a bonus .

"By . Mark Prigg . Gorillas use their smell as a form of communication to other gorillas, researchers have found. Researchers say the animals use the unusual form of communication in thick African forests, where other methods are tough. They also believe that the silverback, dominant make of the group is particularly adept at using smells. Gorillas at London Zoo: Researchers say the animals use the unusual form of communication in thick African forests, where other methods are tough. Researchers  spent 12 months following a wild male silverback gorilla in the Central African Republic rainforest as the ape tended to his harem and fended off competitors. The gorilla, whom they named Makumba, was a dominant male whose babies had a high survival rate . Scientists analyzed odor strength in relation to arousal levels in the silverback. Scientists determined the factors that predicted extreme levels of odor emission from the silverback. According to the results, the male silverback may use odor as a modifiable form of social communication, where context-specific chemical-signals may moderate the social behaviors of other gorillas. The study published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE, was carried out by the University of Stirling. Researchers  spent 12 months following a wild male silverback gorilla in the Central African Republic rainforest as the ape tended to his harem and fended off competitors. The gorilla, whom they named Makumba, was a dominant male whose babies had a high survival rate . Makumba broadcasted his scent when he encountered other gorillas, as if to say, 'I am strong, powerful and here, protecting my females and babies,' researchers Phylis Lee told Live Science.Other times, when strange and potentially threatening silverbacks were near, Makumba abruptly shut off his scent.""We think he was then trying not to tell the other male where and who he was,"" Lee said. Mammals communicate socially through visual, auditory, and chemical signals. The chemical sense is in fact the oldest sense, shared by all organisms including bacteria, and mounting evidence suggests that humans also participate in social chemical signaling. 'Our results suggest that silverback odor strength can be ‘turned up’ or ‘turned down’ as well as ‘turned on’ or ‘turned off’ as a function of the context and relationship between the emitter and perceiver, and that varying odor intensities may communicate different context specific types of information, the researchers wrote. However, not much is known about this type of signaling in closely related hominoids, like wild apes. To better understand chemical -communication in apes, scientists in this study analyzed odor strength in relation to arousal levels in a wild group of western lowland gorillas in the Central African Republic, specifically focusing on the male silverback, or the mature leader of the group. Scientists determined the factors that predicted extreme levels of odor emission from the silverback. They hypothesized that if gorilla scent were being used as a social signal, instead of only a sign of arousal or stress, odor emission would depend on social context and would vary depending on the gorilla's relationship to other gorillas. According to the results, the male silverback may use odor as a modifiable form of social communication, where context-specific chemical-signals may moderate the social behaviors of other gorillas. Mark, a giant Silverback feeds on the Sabinio volcano.  Researchers believe that the silverback, the dominant male of the group, is particularly adept at using smells to communicate. The authors predicted extreme silverback odor, where the odor was the only element that could be smelled in the surrounding air, by the presence and intensity of interactions between different gorilla groups such as silverback anger, distress and long-calling auditory rates, and the absence of close proximity between the silverback and the mother of the youngest infant. The authors suggest that odor communication between apes may be especially useful in Central African forests, where limited visibility may necessitate increased reliance on other senses.Michelle Klailova added, 'No study has yet investigated the presence and extent to which chemo–communication may moderate behaviour in non-human great apes. 'We provide crucial ancestral links to human chemo-signaling, bridge the gap between Old World monkey and human chemo-communication, and offer compelling evidence that olfactory communication in hominoids is much more important than traditionally thought.'","Odor communication useful in Central African forests with limited visibility .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman has hailed her pet dog as a 'guardian angel' after it sniffed out a cancerous lump growing in her breast. Sharon Rawlinson only went to see her doctor because her Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Penny, had been pestering her for months, sniffing and nuzzling the area where the aggressive tumour was growing. The 43-year-old was sent to hospital for checks by her GP - where a scan picked up the fact she had breast cancer. She began a course of chemotherapy, and will have the tumour removed in an operation on Monday. Mrs Sharon Rawlinson said her dog pestered her for weeks before she went to the doctor . Mrs Rawlinson, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, said: 'Penny was pawing me for weeks. 'She would gently paw me as if she was trying to get something out of my left breast, but I ignored it. 'When she stood on me in the middle of the night and wouldn't get off, the pain was like a thousand bee stings and the next day I felt bruised. 'It was only when I checked the next morning that I noticed a lump but again I ignored it as I thought it was an injury.' Mrs Rawlinson, whose mother died from breast cancer nine years ago, plucked up the courage to have it checked in January. She was diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer and started chemotherapy. After she started treatment, Mrs Rawlinson said 18-month-old Penny never bothered her owner in the same way again. The mother-of-two, a school midday supervisor, said: 'Dogs are not just a man's best friend, they're a girl's best friend too. Who needs diamonds? 'She's my guardian angel. We bonded straight away when she was a puppy but this is just amazing. 'I feel she was sent here just for me and she never leaves my side. If it hadn't been for Penny's persistence, I wouldn't have gone for a check-up. 'But that's wrong, and I would encourage anyone who thought there was something amiss to immediately see their doctor.' Mrs Rawlinson is being treated at the Nottingham Breast Institute. She added: 'The next few months will be an emotional rollercoaster, but with the love and support of my family and friends I'll get through it.' Mrs Sharon Rawlinson said her dog was her guardian angel. Dogs are known to have an extremely sensitive sense of smell . Her husband, Brian, 45, who works for Newark and Sherwood District Council, described his wife as ""an inspiration"". He said: 'She has such a positive attitude and just gets on with things. Everybody loves her. 'It's lovely to see the bond that she has with Penny and, although we are going through an awful time, we know it could have been so much worse had the lump not been discovered.' Researchers in Germany last year found that specially-trained dogs could detect a tumour in 71 percent of patients. It is thought that tumours produce chemicals, including low concentrations of alkanes and aromatic compounds, which dogs - whose sense of smell is 100,000 times better than that of humans - can detect. However, there is little evidence of cases of untrained domestic dogs sniffing out cancers in their owners. Dr Jacqueline Boyd, course leader for animal biology at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'They are far more attuned to us than any other species. 'There is a lot of anecdotal evidence to say dogs have detected cancers and they are very responsive to things.  It doesn't surprise me this dog detected its owner's cancer. It's a lovely story and reinforces the overall value of animals and their companionship.'","Mrs Rawlinson discovered a lump after her dog kept nuzzling her breast .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Keeping track of polar bear populations in icy and treacherous conditions could be easier from space, according to research. Scientists have used satellite pictures to monitor the creatures off the coast of Canada, and claim the technology could be used to keep tabs on how the rapidly melting Arctic ice is affecting their numbers. The images are said to be so detailed, each shot uses around 2.5GB of computer space - 1,300 times more than the average iPhone photo. Keeping track of polar bear populations (stock image pictured) in icy and treacherous conditions could be easier from space, according to research. Scientists have used satellite pictures to monitor the creatures off the coast of Canada . High-tech satellites orbiting 480 . miles above Earth are being used for an unusual task - to keep tabs on . the movement of whales. Conservationists . from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have developed a way of using . the space technology to count how many of the mammals are currently . living in our seas. The . satellites, including the WorldView2, take photos of the sea, which are . then studied using state-of-the-art software to identify whales below . the surface. The researchers began by looking at images taken during late summer in 2012, and counted the number of bears on the island. The creatures could be distinguished from other light-coloured spots by comparing the satellite pictures with different images of the same island. An earlier survey suggested there were around 100 bears, and the satellite estimate confirmed this. Wildlife experts now believe that using satellite pictures could be useful in keeping track of the Arctic polar bear populations, as the speed at which Arctic ice is melting has increased. Development of efficient techniques for monitoring wildlife is a priority in the Arctic, where the impacts of climate change are acute and remoteness and logistical constraints hinder access. During analysis, clouds were found to be one of the factors that could make detecting the bears more difficult. The locations of the polar bears are circled on each image . An earlier survey suggested there were around 100 bears off the coast of Rowley Island, Canada (pictured), and the satellite estimate confirmed this. Wildlife experts now claim using satellites could be useful in keeping track of the Arctic polar bear populations, as the speed at which Arctic ice is melting has increased . Dr Seth Stapleton, from the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Centre in Anchorage said: ‘The loss of Arctic sea ice has accelerated during recent years, with minimum sea ice extent reaching a record low during September, 2012. ‘A nearly ice-free summer is now forecasted to occur as early as 2016. 'Such large-scale, precipitous environmental changes will be detrimental for many species dependent on sea ice habitats. ‘Despite potentially massive ecological impacts, regimes for monitoring wildlife remain deficient across large portions of the Arctic. This image reveals where the polar bears were spotted during the aerial survey (in blue). The yellow dots are the polar bears discovered using DigitalGlobe's satellite images . These images were taken during late summer in 2012. Polar bears are present in the circles in the target image (top) but absent in the reference image (bottom). Features that remain consistent between images, including rocks and substrate, are shown with red arrows . ‘We evaluated high resolution satellite imagery as a tool to track the distribution and abundance of polar bears. ‘Our findings suggest that satellite imagery is a promising tool for monitoring polar bears on land, with implications for use with other Arctic wildlife.’ The findings were published in the journal PLOS ONE.","Researchers tracked polar bears in Canada using high resolution satellites .

"By . Francesca Chambers . First ladies are not elected officeholders but they should still use their positions of power to effect positive change, Michelle Obama said on Wednesday. After all, they are smarter than their politician husbands, she claimed. Speaking at a symposium for spouses at the U.S.- Africa Leaders Summit, Obama noted that whether first ladies 'like it or not we are role models' for young women in their country and they have a 'responsibility to show them the way.' 'So we can’t waste this spotlight. It is temporary and life is short, and change is needed. And women are smarter than men,' she stated to laughter and applause from the mostly female audience. 'That just goes without saying,' the event's moderator, Cokie Roberts of NPR, lightheartedly responded. 'And the men can’t complain, because you’re outnumbered today,' Obama replied with a smile. Scroll down for video . Girls Rule, Boys Drool: First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday that 'women are smarter than men' Obama was joined by former First Lady Laura Bush for the conversation, which was co-sponsored by the George W. Bush Institute. The leading ladies held a similar symposium last summer in Tanzania. 'Last year you were still getting blowback about your bangs,' Roberts said at the start of Wednesday's program, teasing Obama. 'Yes, that’s over,' the first lady told her. 'That’s an important issue,' Bush said in jest. The three women went on to discuss a range of issues, from the first ladies' passion projects, to the important of treating young girls and women with respect. Referencing a speech she gave last week to young African leaders, Obama said she 'wanted to just implant that notion' that they 'have to approach their work with a whole new attitude.' 'And one of the things I asked the young men is that you have to be introspective and ask yourselves whether you truly believe that women can be your equal.' 'Until we . prioritize our girls and understand that they are as important and their . education is as important as the education of our sons, then we will . have lots of work to do,' Obama said. Obama later argued that women of the world have to 'fight for our . girls.' 'There should never be a girl in this world who has to fear . getting educated. That should be something that is intolerable to all . of us,' she said, referring to Malala Yousafzai, the young girl who was shot by the Taliban on her way to school in 2012. The first lady said that when she looks around the world at young women, she sees her daughters. And like her daughters, Obama said she wants those young women to have happy, healthy lives. 'But it's going to take leadership like us, women like us speaking up . in our countries and making sure that young girls are not subject to . abuse, and that they are loved and valued,' she said. 'And until we do that, we . will not solve these problems.' 'Investing in our women,' she said, 'is the most important work that we do.' 'Until we start to value women and girls, we will continue to struggle on this planet,' she added . Obama said she chose to focus her women's initiative on Africa because it is an 'under-valued, under-appreciated continent.' Drawing on recent remarks that 'blood of Africa' runs through her veins,' Obama explained that another motivating factor is her heritage. 'The importance of Africa is very personal to me because, as the President said last night in his toast, Africa is home for us,' she said. 'His family is there. We have relatives there. We have visited the continent on several occasions. We have taken our daughters back to his grandfather’s village and they have seen a part of themselves. 'So the partnership with this continent means a great deal to us,' she stressed. First lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush held a conversation on the need to invest in the futures of young girls and women at the U.S. - Africa Leaders Summit yesterday in Washington, D.C. The two women had a similar symposium in Tanzania last summer. On Wednesday they also discussed the importance of changing attitudes and behaviors toward women and girls, as well . The discussion was moderated by NPR's Cokie Roberts, right, who teased that the last time they all got together Obama was mired in a controversy over her new bangs . The first lady also used the symposium to talk about another issue she's been on the front lines of: childhood obesity. Roberts joked that Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, must tease their mother about the name of her Let's Move healthy eating and exercise initiative from time to time. 'I must say, with teenage daughters. . . I would suspect that sometimes they say to you, let’s move, mom.' 'Yes, you’ve been sitting at our dining room table, Cokie?' Obama said. 'Well, you know, every teenager has a little smart aleck in them, it’s true.' Turning serious, Obama said that she and her husband have found that their children really do listen to them. 'They take on these new messages even when we don’t think they’re paying attention.' 'And that’s one of the things that we try to tell parents,' she said, 'you don’t know that they’re listening, but I see how my children make different decisions about what they eat now as teenagers now that they have control because they have the information about how food affects their overall health and their ability to perform.' The event was part of a portion of the summit for spouses. After the conservation Michelle Obama dined with several first spouses of African countries, including the First lady of Tanzania Salma Kikwete, who sat to her left . Roberts noted that despite having the best of intentions, Obama has 'gotten some blowback' over her campaign. 'I know that you both get into these things and you’re doing them for the good of the country, and suddenly you get criticized for it. And it must just be such a shock in a way,' she said, addressing both Obama and Bush. 'Well, I was not that shocked,' Bush told her. After having watched her husband's parents' experience in the White House from afar, Bush said she was prepared 'to be characterized in a way that you aren’t, really.' 'And so I don’t think it was any big surprise to me,' she said. 'That doesn’t make it any less hurtful.' Obama backed her Republican counterpart up, saying her take on criticism directed at the first family is 'absolutely true.' 'And that’s really the role of leadership,' she said. ' It’s not about amassing power; it’s taking some of those hits and continuing to do the work, even when it’s painful and sometimes unappreciated.' That is why it's important for first ladies to stay focused on their 'vision,' she said. 'Because if you have your vision and you know what you’re passionate about, and you know what direction you’re going in, then all of the arrows and the spears and the criticisms . . they bounce off of you because you keep doing the work every day.' They might pinch a little bit,' Obama said. 'You might get shot in the eye. 'You just sort of go to the doctor, patch yourself up and get back in the game,' she said.","The first lady also questioned whether young African men  'truly believe that women can be your equal'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Penelopi sleeps in her own sparkly pink bedroom, has a wardrobe full of clothes and is proudly pushed around the shops in her buggy every day. It sounds like the typical life of a little girl - except Penelopi isn't a toddler, she's a pig. Her owner Mindi Reinbolt, 37, from Uniontown, Ohio, lavishes her with outfits and luxury gifts. And the 14-month-old porker will accompanying Mindi wherever she goes. Scroll down for video . Little princess: Mindi loves to spoil her pet pig Penelopi . Extensive wardrobe: The pig has a different outfit for every day . Not a pigsty: Penelopi even has her own bedroom, decorated in pink and filled with toys and clothes . While out shopping Mindi pushes Penelopi around in a child buggy - and when they stop for a drink only Starbucks will satisfy the pig's expensive taste. Despite having four trotters, Mindi believes her pig deserves to be treated like a human and loves the attention she gets. Mindi, a manager of a medical oncology physicians practice, said: 'I treat her like luxury because she acts just like a little girl. 'She is very human like and has the intelligence of a three-to-four-year old little girl. She loves to go out and about and just loves all the attention from everyone. Unusual family: Mindi and her husband, Brett, also have a pet dog - but he walks instead of using the buggy like Penelopi the pig . Company: Mindi takes her pet everywhere with her in her stroller . Sweet tooth: The pig loves to be treated to ice lollies and is partial to a frappuccino from Starbucks . 'She is my little princess and I love her.' Mindi adopted Penelopi, a mix between a Juliana and a Mini Pig, when she was 10 months old from Ledge Life Farms. The pig instantly settled in and became best friends with her new brother Bailey, a schnoodle dog. With the help of her husband Brett, Mindi adapted their home so Penelopi could have her own luxurious space. They transformed an upstairs room into Penelopi's very own pink bedroom complete with a fireplace, a full sized wardrobe, a play pen and lots of piggy accessories. Mindi said: 'Her bedroom is gorgeous and very pink - it is fit for a princess! She has her own dresser for all of her clothes. Indulged: Penelopi poses with just some of her clothes in her bedroom . Pampering: Penelopi enjoys a good bubble bath and has an outfit for every occasion . 'She deserves it': Mindi says her pig acts just like a little girl . No expense spared: Penelopis' wardrobe, left, while right she is seen enjoying a snack in her stroller . 'Every morning she gets a new outfit on and she has hundreds of matching bows and hats that she wears with each of them.' Mindi likes to show off her adorable pig as much as possible, and once dressed, takes her out on the town. She said: 'She is used to getting all glammed up and going out and meeting people. She just loves all the attention from everyone. She loves being in the spotlight and everyone loves her. 'Whenever we go out I push her in her very own stroller. She is trained to walk on a leash but its not really ideal because people swarm around her, she's safest in her buggy and she loves it.' Glammed up: The pig has her trotters painted with glittery nail varnish after getting clean in the bath . Centre of attention: Mindi said Penelopi always draws a crowd when she takes her out for walks in the stroller . Star: The pig even has her own Facebook and Instagram accounts . Mindi added: 'She loves to go shopping with me. She is mummy's little shopping buddy and even goes in the dressing room with me. 'She loves Starbucks and often drinks some of my frappuccino when we're out. She also loves to go get ice cream and she even knows how to eat off of a fork and spoon.' With a new outfit every day, it's not a surprise that Mindi has forked out thousands on the miniature pig. 'She is a little diva fashionista and she deserves it all,' her proud owner said . The pig even has her own Facebook page 'Penelopi the Pig Reinbolt' with 700 dedicated followers and over 600 followers on her 'Penelopipig' Instagram keeping up to date with her adventures.","Penelopi the pig is owned by Mindi Reinbolt, 37, from Ohio .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Secret Service agents were told to break protocol and let actor Bradley Cooper's unscreened vehicle into an off-limits area at a dinner honoring the president last year in Washington, D.C., a new book claims. An agent allegedly told author Ronald Kessler that Cooper was allowed to ride his vehicle up to the front door of the Washington Hilton on the night of the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2013 and bypass a regular sweep for explosives. All other vehicles - with the exception of Secret Service and their protectees - were required to approach the dinner site from drop-off point a block away. ' "" Agents were told not to sweep the car. Just let it in and don't give Cooper any problems,"" 'a Secret Service agent is quoted as saying of the incident in an excerpt of Kessler's forthcoming book, The First Family Detail, obtained by MailOnline. "" 'Bradley Cooper had a free pass to come through the main entrance and drive right up to the front of the hotel.' "" Author Ron Kessler says that the Secert Service allowed actor Bradley Cooper to be dropped off at the doors of the 2013 House Correspondents Dinner in the Ford Expedition in this photo. Every one else attending the dinner - with the exception of the president and other Secret Service protectees - had to be dropped off a block away from the dinner site for security reasons . 'Free pass': A Secret Service agent allegedly told Kessler that Cooper, pictured here at an after party for the dinner, was allowed to bypass normal protocol because a 'high-ranking agency official from New York' called in a personal favor . ' ""The agents were blown away when they were told to forget everything they were told to do,"" 'the Secret Service agent reportedly told Kessler.' ""And this was two weeks after the terrorist attack on our soil."" ' Usually, the agent said, all vehicles that come through a security checkpoint, including those that belong to the Secret Service, are inspected by a canine team. But Bradley Cooper's vehicle was not, putting the president and party guests at risk. ' ""Bradley Cooper was not subject to the same requirements that apply to me as an agent,"" ' he reportedly said. Kessler, a New York times bestselling author who has written 20 books, says the Secret Service agents were asked to give The Hangover star preferential treatment as a 'personal favor' to a 'high-ranking agency official in New York' and obliged out of fear of 'retribution from management.' 'The pressure not to rock the boat takes president over protecting the president' from potential assassins, Kessler writes in The First Family Detail. ' ""Agents were told just let Bradley through,"" ' the Secret Service agent allegedly told him. ' ""The agents did as they were told and let Cooper's vehicle through out of fear of repercussions. ' ""That's just one example of the arrogance of senior managers in the Secret Service. They think they're accountable to no one."" ' Cooper arrived at the hotel before the president, but his vehicle still presented a security threat, the agent told Kessler, because it could have remained in the driveway right up to the moment the president's motorcade showed up. A publicist for Cooper did not return a request for comment, Kessler says.

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama quietly sent a group of administration officials to the border on Tuesday to assess the need for a National Guard deployment. White House officials with knowledge of the trip told Reuters yesterday that a team of Homeland Security and Defense Department aides are on the three-day site visit to and will make recommendations to the president upon their return. While 'there's no foregone conclusion' to the president's plans, as one official said, the move signals that the Obama is taking Republicans' suggestions on how to handle the border crisis more seriously than the White House has previously let on. President Barack Obama is reportedly considering a National Guard deployment to border . House Speaker John Boehner and Texas . Governor Rick Perry have been asking the president to dispatch the . National Guard to the border for weeks. Perry tried to get Obama to commit to the measure during the president's trip to Texas earlier this month but couldn't get a straight answer from him. The Republican Governor sent a follow-up letter reiterating the need for troops but says he never received a response. On . Monday, Perry decided to act without the federal government and send as . many as 1,000 of Texas' reserve forces down to the border. There, they'll work hand in hand with the Texas Department of Public Safety to take down drug smugglers and cartels, his office said in a statement on the governor's announcement. The . additional National Guard members and other law enforcement resources . Perry directed toward the border will cost Texas taxpayers $5 million a . week, according to a leaked memo. National Guard forces alone will burn a $12 million a month whole in the state's budget. The funding for an enhanced National Guard presence on the border can only come from the . federal government if the Commander in Chief initiates the deployment. Until . then, Texans will be on the hook for the entire amount, causing . concern among Texas lawmakers, including Perry's allies. 'We are very grateful to the . Governor,' Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert said, 'but we need to see that Texas is ultimately reimbursed.' As . recently as Monday the White House was still dismissing a deployment as . 'temporary' solution to the crisis at the border. 'The President and this administration does not see it in any way as a . substitute for the kind of more enduring response that this . administration has sought both through the supplemental appropriations . request, but also through comprehensive immigration reform,' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 'It seems to me that a much more powerful symbol would be the bipartisan . passage of legislation that would actually make a historic investment . in border security and send an additional 20,000 personnel to the . border,' Earnest said. Earnest admitted that the president indicated to Perry that he was open to the idea of sending down the National Guard when they met in Texas and said the subject could come up in the president's meeting that afternoon with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. However, the White House spokesperson reiterated the administration would prefer Perry to 'take the kinds of steps that will be . constructive to solving the problem over the long term' and not just the kinds that attract attention. 'And to be . specific, that means that we hope that Governor Perry will support the . supplemental appropriations request that this administration put forward . a few weeks ago, and that Governor Perry will use his influence with . congressional Republicans in Congress and urge them to stop blocking . comprehensive bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives . that would make an historic commitment to border security and address so . many of the problems that are plaguing our broken immigration system,' he said. The president's comprehensive immigration reform legislation has been stalled in the Senate for the last year and is almost certain not to get a vote in the House of Representatives before the end of the legislative session. His $3.7 billion emergency immigration spending package could come to a vote by the end of next week, however. If Democrats and Republicans on the Hill can't come to a consensus on how much of Obama's request to fund, however, the request for additional resources will be shelved until after Congress gets back from recess in September. Senate Democrats, led by Appropriations chair Barbara Mikulski, have rallied around a $3.5 billion bill that includes funding for wildfires and aide for Israel on top of the $2.7 billion it puts toward agencies that handle illegal immigration. House Republicans are discussing a $1.5 billion version of Obama's original ask. Their legislation also includes a stipulation about the National Guard. Conservatives in Congress say the current bill is still too much money, though, and want to see an even more stripped down version. Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks told the Associated Press he wouldn't vote for the legislation if it came to the floor because the U.S. can't be the 'world's sugar daddy.' Boehner's office this afternoon that the Republican caucus would hold a rare Friday morning meeting to discuss the bill one more time before heading home for the weekend because members needed more time to debate the bill. President Barack Obama is currently in Los Angelas and will not return to Washington, D.C. until late this evening. He is pictured here greeting a patron at Canter's Deli in L.A. this afternoon . Also at issue in the process is a 2008 trafficking law that disallows the U.S. government from immediately deporting illegal immigrant children who are not from Mexico or Canada. Initially, the president told Congress he would like to see changes to the law that would give his administration ability to deport Central American children - who account for the majority of more than 57,000 minors who have arrived at the border since last October - in a more timely manner. The president has since backed off that request amid pressure from him party. In a letter to the president yesterday, Boehner asked Obama to recommit to the proposal. 'Frankly,' he said, 'it is difficult to see how we can make progress on this issue without strong, public support from the White House for much-needed reforms, including changes to the 2008 law.' Worse, in recent days, senior congressional leaders in your own . political party have backpedalled and voiced unswerving opposition to . any changes at all. Frankly, it is difficult to see how we can make progress on this . issue without strong, public support from the White House for . much-needed reforms, including changes to the 2008 law.

Frankly, it is difficult to see how we can make progress on this . issue without strong, public support from the White House for . much-needed reforms, including changes to the 2008 law. Today Boehner again challenged the president to step up to the plate. 'We've got a President that's AWOL,' Boehner told reporters. 'The President ought to get engaged in this if he actually wants something to happen.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also called on the president to reassert his authority over Democrats in Congress. McConnell said Obama put forward 'modest policy recommendations,' but 'unfortunately, the far Left objected, and he’s since wobbled. 'That’s led to top Democrats in Congress balking at even the most modest of reforms,' McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ' They now seem to prefer a blank check that would preserve the status quo instead. And the President will barely lift a finger to encourage his own party to support these simple reforms.' The top Republican lampooned Obama for his claims earlier this year that he going to use his 'pen and phone' to break through the gridlock in Washington. 'Use it,' McConnell said. 'Call the members of your party who object to what you said you wanted—and what we all know is needed.' The president has been out of town since Tuesday on a fundraising trip on the West Coast, and he will not return to Washington, D.C. until late this evening. Tomorrow he will meet with Central American leaders to discuss ways the U.S. can work with their countries to prevent children from ever leaving for the United States in the first place. Including tomorrow, the president has only six business days to come up with a plan that both political parties can swallow, or risk receiving no additional funding at all for border protection measures.","Republicans have been trying to get Obama to send the National Guard to the border for weeks .

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama on Sunday urged Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire' with Hamas. The White House says Obama expressed 'strong condemnation' of Hamas' attacks on Israel and again supported Israel's right to defend herself but implored Netanyahu to abide by a permanent ceasefire between his country and the terrorist group. Obama's call with the the world leader followed Israel's rejection on Friday of a new ceasefire agreement with Hamas negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Afterward, an Israeli news report quoted 'voices' from the latter leader's cabinet describing Kerry as 'completely capitulating' to Hamas and 'negligent,' and a top Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien - characterizations that had the Obama administration 'fuming' on Monday, according to the Associated Press. Scroll down for video . The White House is none too happy with deprecating comments made over the weekend by Israeli ministers about Secretary of State John Kerry's negotiating skills . In a post on liberal news publication Haaretz's website over the weekend, diplomatic correspondent Barack Ravid said Kerry did more to 'thwart the possibility of reaching a cease-fire in Gaza' than he did to promote one. He went on to say Kerry would be 'responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled' if his actions resulted in an escalation of Israeli military aggression. 'Kerry isn’t anti-Israeli; on the contrary, he’s a true friend to Israel,' Ravid wrote. 'But his conduct in recent days over the Gaza cease-fire raises serious doubts over his judgment and perception of regional events. 'It’s as if he isn’t the foreign minister of the world’s most powerful nation, but an alien, who just disembarked his spaceship in the Mideast.' Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Sunday morning as the clock ran out on a temporary ceasefire that put the nearly three weeks old armed conflict on hold for a half day. Appearing on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday morning, Netanyahu reaffirmed his country's refusal of Hamas' ultimatum and chastised his enemies' violation of previously agreed upon ceasefires. 'Israel is doing what any country would do, and certainly what the U.S. would do,' Netanyahu said. The White House says Obama called the Israeli Prime Minster that afternoon and told him 'ultimately' a long-term solution 'must ensure the disarmament . of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of Gaza.' However, the White House says Obama shared the administration's 'serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.' As of Sunday, more than a thousand Palestinians had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured, according to AP. Nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and three civilians and three civilians have also been killed. In excerpts of an interview with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal that aired on CBS on Sunday and Monday, Meshaal told Charlie Rose that  'the world has two choices' - to help Hamas 'peacefully' remove Israel from the West Bank and the Gaza strip or 'we will expel this occupation from our land.' 'We are not fanatics. We are not fundamentalists. We do not, actually, fight the Jews because they are Jews per se - we fight the occupiers,' he said. Hamas will keep fighting the 'occupiers,' he said, until it is victorious. 'I can die because of Israel. I cannot live under the occupation. The occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine,' he said. 'So every single Palestinian can die for the next generations to live in peace and freedom.' Mashaal danced around whether Hamas would 'coexist with the state of Israel' if Palestine had its own state before telling Rose, 'When we have a Palestinian state, then the Palestinian state will decide on its policies,' adding that the 'Palestinian people can have their say, when they have their own state, without occupation.' United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said today that both Netanyahu and Mashaal were 'morally wrong' for allowing the death and destruction to continue and the two men need to show 'compassionate leadership' by ending the armed conflict. He joined Obama and the U.N. Security Council in calling for 'an immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire,' saying that 'Gaza is in critical condition.' Ban also said Israel's retaliation against Hamas raises 'serious questions about proportionality.' His statement follows a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution last week approving an international investigation into Israel for potential war crimes in Gaza. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Sunday that he would 'condemn' the report because it places the blame for the conflict on Israel. 'The U.N. Human Rights report is a joke,' Graham said in comments reported by Politico. 'The U.N. is becoming anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic.' Will they ever forgive him?: One Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien after he failed to successfully negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last week . Throughout Israel it was Secretary Kerry who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary. Maariv columnist Ben Caspit called Kerry 'an ongoing embarrassment, with the characteristics of a snowball.' 'The further he rolls, the greater the embarrassment,' Caspit said. Israeli TV reporter Udi Segal ran a report citing government officials who framed Kerry as 'incapable of handling the most basic matters.' The Associated Press said Monday that Obama administration officials said on background that by ridiculing Kerry, Israeli ministers 'crossed a line' and relations between Israel and the U.S. may never be as close as it once was as a result. In on the record comments Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken came to Kerry's defense. 'Israel has no better friend, no stronger defender than John Kerry,' he told AP. The comments about Kerry are 'people leaking things that are either misinformed, or attempting to misinform,' he claimed.","Obama wants Israel to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire' with Hamas .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Outgoing Representative Michele Bachmann joined the flurry of former Republican presidential candidates tossing their name into the ring for 2016 on Tuesday. Bachmann told Real Clear Politics that the media has been wrong not to include her in 2016 speculation thus far because she may give the presidency another go. 'The only thing that the media has speculated on is that it’s going to be various men that are running,' she said after the poling website asked her if woman would enter the horse race. 'They haven’t speculated, for instance, that I’m going to run. 'What if I decide to run? And there’s a chance I could run,' she said. If Bachmann did run again, she would be one of . several 2012 presidential candidates seeking a do-over and one of as many as a dozen Republicans vying for her party's nomination. Party like its 2012: Rep. Michele Bachmann, pictured here at the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference in June, says there's a 'chance' she'll run for president again in 2016. If she does, she'll likely be one of several former candidates in the GOP primary . Mitt Romney claims he's not running again, but anything can happen in politics . Rick Perry said this weekend he's 'preparing for the possibility of a presidential run' Rick Santorum said Tuesday he's 'definitely considering' another run . Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum have both indicated that they are considering future campaigns, too. At a book signing in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, last night, Santorum said he was 'definitely considering' another campaign will make a decision 'sometime next year.' In the meantime, the 2012 candidate, said he's not 'doing anything inconsistent with running for president.' Santorum, whose been saying for the last year that he's 'open' to another presidential campaign, reportedly chalked up his busy travel schedule to the promotion of his book, Blue Collar Conservatism, which was released at the end of April. Pennsylvania news website Pennlive.com said Santorum also cited the book tour as his excuse for a visit to all-important presidential primary state Iowa in two weeks - his second in the last eight months. Perry has also made the mecca to Iowa recently, attending a church service and a local Republican Party gathering there over the weekend. While there, he admitted to the Washington Post that he's eying another presidential run. 'I try not to be perceived as being coy,' he said. 'I am preparing for the possibility of a presidential run.' 'Yes, I think . about it, and I know how to be prepared for it,' Perry said, noting that he's learned from the mistakes of the past. 'The biggest error in judgment I made [in 2011] was thinking that just because I’d been the governor in the state of Texas I was prepared to run for the presidency of the United States,' Perry told the post. 'It is very different in the sense of having a global grasp of what’s going on in the world.' Another name making a comeback in politics is Mitt Romney. Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has said he does not plan to run again, but he could yet change his mind. Romney adamantly claimed in 2008 he wouldn't subject himself to another presidential campaign and ran again anyway. A recent . poll of voters in First-in-the-Nation state New Hampshire found that . Romney would blow his potential competitors out of the water if he did seek an encore. Bachmann was not included in that poll, having just signaled this week that she's debating another run, but Perry and Santorum were, and both men barely registered on the poll, garnering one and two percent of the vote, respectively, in the hypothetical match-up. Mitt Romney emerged as the dominant force . in New Hampshire GOP politics last week, blowing away the competition in a . hypothetical 2016 presidential primary matchup . None of the former 2012 candidates looking for a second chance - or third, if Romney really does explore another campaign - have anything to lose. Neither Romney nor Santorum currently hold elected . offices, and Bachmman is not running for another term in Congress. After . January, she'll be free to join Santorum and Perry on the unofficial campaign . trail in early primary states. Likewise, . Perry has opted not to run for a fourth full term as Governor of Texas, . having already held the office for more than a decade. Even if none of the other 2012 contenders ran again, Bachmann would likely face a tough, and crowded, field of fellow candidates. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, House Budget Committee Chairman and 2012 Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan of Wisconsin are all said to be considering campaigns. That's in addition to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Bachmann told Real Clear Politics that if she did try again, her previous experience as a presidential candidate would 'certainly' be to her advantage. 'I haven’t made a decision one way or another if I’m going to run again, . but I think the organization is probably the key,' she said. 'To have . an organization and people who surround you who are loyal, who are . highly competent, who know how to be able to run the ball down the field . in state after state -- because now I think the primary process will be . very different this time. It will tighten up; it will be a much shorter . run than it was before.' Recent elections do show that Republican candidates who have prior experience as a presidential candidate do have a better chance at winning the nomination the second time around, and Bachmann was an early favorite in Iowa last time. Arizona Sen. John McCain was selected as Republicans' 2008 nominee after losing out the first time to Texas Governor George W. Bush. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the 2012 nomination getting beat out for the honor in 2012 by McCain. If tradition holds true, the Republican nominee will be Bachmann, Perry or Santorum, assuming any or all of them run. 'Like with anything else, practice makes . perfect,' Bachmann said. 'And I think if a person has . gone through the process -- for instance, I had gone through 15 . presidential debates -- it’s easy to see a person’s improvement going . through that.'","Rep.

"By . Francesca Chambers . and Mail Online Reporter . Republican Representative Eric Cantor announced this morning that he will resign his seat this month to make way for his successor ahead of the lame-duck session. The Virginia Representative, who stepped down as House majority leader yesterday, had . previously said he would serve his full term, which would have ended in . January. But the 51-year-old, seven-term House veteran now says he will step down on August 18 to make sure constituents have a 'clear and strong voice' during the 'consequential' session. Scroll down for video . Stepping down: Republican representative Eric Cantor has announced he will resign his seat on August 18, months earlier than expected . 'The issues that will be considered . during the lame-duck session this year will be crucial to the future of . our country,' he said. 'These debates will continue into the new Congress, and the . people of this district deserve to have their new voice representing . them and engaging on their behalf.' Cantor made the announcement overnight via a guest column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper. The outgoing Congressman said he has already asked Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to call a special . election for his district that coincides with the Nov. 4 general . election. That would enable his successor to take office immediately. That person is likely to be college professor Dave Brat, the Tea Party-backed political novice who Cantor lost the Republican primary to in June. The non-partisan Cook Political Report rates Cantor's seat as a solid Republican congressional district, and Brat is expected to win the general election  by as many as 10 points. In his guest column Cantor indicated that he had not yet made a decision about how he intends to use his new-found free time. 'I certainly look forward to doing what I did when I first became a . Republican: advocating, as a private citizen, for the conservative . solutions to the problems we face that will secure our nation’s . greatness and provide a better life for all American,' he noted. 'While my days as a congressman will soon be behind me, my days of fighting for those ideas as a citizen are ahead of me,' he said. 'I’d like to thank the voters, my neighbors, my friends, for giving me the extraordinary opportunity to serve, and I look forward to continuing to work for an America that works and an America that leads.' Cantor, centre, had previously said he would serve his full term, which would have ended in January but now says he will step down to make sure constituents have a voice during the 'consequential' lame-duck session . Before his defeat, Cantor had been seen as a potential rival — and likely successor — to House Speaker John Boehner. Though he had a conservative voting record, Cantor was distrusted by some Tea Party supporters who suspected he might be too eager to reach a compromise on immigration legislation. On his final day as No. 2 House GOP leader, Cantor gave a 10 minute speech thanking his colleagues and sharing his vision for America. At the time, the remarks came off as more of a long goodbye than a changing of the guard, but with several months left before the end of the current legislative session, spectators assumed Cantor was giving a Swan song as the Republican Majority Leader. During his remarks Cantor mentioned problems in the Middle East and tensions with Iran and Russia . and said the U.S. must 'make leadership abroad a priority.' Cantor also said Friday that improving educational opportunity for low-income children is 'the civil rights issue of our time.' After his speech, Cantor received a standing ovation from members of both parties and shared a hug with the No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who in turn gave a short speech praising his political foe as a good lawmaker. As it would turn out, Cantor's speech from the House floor yesterday was likely his last. Congress is due to adjourn for recess today until the second week in September.","Virginia Representative stepped down as House majority leader yesterday, .

"By . Francesca Chambers . The number of unaccompanied minors under the age of 12 coming to the U.S. has risen 117 percent in the last fiscal year, a new report shows. Data released by the Pew Research Center today reveals that the percentage of pre-teens crossing the border alone has nearly doubled since last fiscal year, rising from 9 percent to 16 percent. 'The big message here is that when looking at who is crossing the . U.S.-Mexico border and being apprehended, a growing number are young . children,' Pew’s director of Hispanic research, Mark Hugo Lopez, told . ABC News. Pew . obtained the previously unreported data from the U.S. Customs and Border . Protection agency through a Freedom of Information Act request. Scroll down for video . Guatemalan children caught in Mexico while trying to migrate illegally into the United States queue before climbing into a minibus at Aurora international airport in Guatemala City on July 14, 2014 after being deported from Mexico. New data shows that an increasingly larger share of unaccompanied minors coming to the U.S. are under the age of 12 . Children under the age of 12 make up a greater percentage of unaccompanied minors illegally immigrating to the U.S. than last fiscal year. The number has increased 117 percent since last fiscal year . The . data for this year only goes through the end of May, whereas the fiscal . year runs from October to the end of September. Meaning, the year over . year increase will be even higher when the final numbers come in this . fall. According to Pew, number of . pre-teens traveling without their parents were taken into custody at the . U.S. border with Mexico had reached 6,675 by the end of May compared to 3,162 who . were apprehended the fiscal year before. Children . coming from Honduras account for the largest percentage of the . increase, followed by El Salvador and Guatemala. The number of young, Mexican children trying to enter the country stayed the same. Only 3 percent of of Mexican children who are caught trying to cross the border are under the age of 12, while 27 percent are from Honduras - a 7 percent increase from last year. Another 22 percent are from El Salvador - a 5 percent increase from 2013 - and 10 percent are from Guatemala - a 5 percent increase. 'While this data does not tell us why [Honduras is sending more . youth], one possible reason, according to Department of Homeland . Security, is the growing level of violence in Honduras,' Lopez said. 'Today, Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate, and San Pedro . Sula, where the single largest contingent of kids from Honduras are . from, is the world’s murder capital.' Not coincidentally, El Salvador has the fourth highest homicide rate and Guatemala is immediately behind it, according to the United Nations. The three countries make up the largest influx of children illegally immigrating to the U.S. The largest influx of unaccompanied minors under the age of 12 has come from Honduras, which not coincidentally has the highest per person murder rate in the world . Desperate: A Central American mother and her children inside a cargo train try to cross the border this month . Patrols: Guards keep a close watch on the border in El Paso, Texas, observed by a Mexican boy . A total of 57,525 unaccompanied minors have been apprehended at the border as of last month, whereas 38,759 were taken into custody all of last fiscal year. The deluge of children has over inundated law enforcement officials at the border and has the president seeking $3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress for federal agencies who handle illegal immigration. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said 'preliminary data' from Border Patrol shows that the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border per day subsided in the last month, decreasing from 350 a day to 150 in the Rio Grande Valley area. 'Now, while the reasons for the reduction in the number of unaccompanied children and adults traveling with children apprehended by CBP cannot be attributed to any one factor,' Earnest said, 'we do believe that the administration’s response and efforts to work with Central American leaders to publicize the dangers of the journey and reinforce that apprehended migrants are ultimately returned to their home countries, in keeping with the law, as well as seasonal flows, have all played a part.' Even with the slow down in apprehensions, officials say the U.S. could still run out of money to process the influx of unaccompanied children and families arriving at the border before the end of year. The number of minors accompanied by a . parent entering the U.S. illegally has also risen at a sharp rate in the . last year, increasing by 160 percent. So for, 22,069 accompanied . children have been taken into custody, up from just 8,479 last fiscal year.

"By . Francesca Chambers . and David Martosko . The campaign arm of Congressional Democrats has raised more than $7.6 million since House Republicans announced a lawsuit against President Barack Obama last month. The Democratic Congressional Campaign committee says it raised $1 million in a single day after newly elected Republican Whip Steve Scalise repeatedly refused to tell Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday that the House wouldn't impeach the president. House Speaker John Boehner has said time and time again that the legal action the House intends to take against Obama is not a precursor to impeachment, but Democrats have continued to link the two together, causing headaches for Republican leaders. And if the DCCC's banner fundraising is any indication, the strategy is working. Still, Democrats have a huge hurdle to overcome ahead November's elections if they are to win the 17 seats needed to take control of the House. Scroll down for video . SCAM: Boehner said Democrats have cooked up baseless impeachment fears in order to raise money ahead of November's elections . DCCC Chairman Steve Israel said on Wednesday that his party's odds of taking back the legislative body have certainly been bolstered by Republicans' lawsuit and impeachment talk. Republicans' 'accusations of presidential overreach have . become a Republican overreach and that is motivating swing voters and . persuadable voters,' Israel told CNN today, arguing that Republicans 'stepped into a mess on this.' Israel said that as a result of Republicans' election year scheme to take on the president, Democrats are more fired up than ever. 'The phone calls, the emails, people signing up, wanting volunteer on . campaigns, has surged literally over the past several weeks,' he said. 'Now it . always surges as you get closer to an election, but I'm telling you the . August numbers are what the Octobers numbers should be.' The Washington Post reports the DCCC raised $2.1 million last weekend alone. Even before Boehner announced the House's intention to sue Obama, the DCCC was having a lucrative election cycle. As of the end of June, the DCCC has outraised its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, by roughly $23 million. The DCCC also has more money in the bank - $50.9 million - than the NRCC - $42.5 million. The House's lawsuit against Obama was meant to turn out volunteers and voters of its own. But so far, the strategy has backfired, giving Democrats the upper hand as they return to their home districts this weekend for Congress' month long recess. Israel told CNN the House's lawsuit would be a major part of Democrats' campaign strategies throughout the next month and the fall. 'You bet we're going to run on a Congress that is just obsessed with . lawsuits, suing the President, talking about impeaching him, instead of . solutions for the middle class, talking about jobs and infrastructure,' Israel noted. 'You bet that we're going to ask people to support us based on that . contrast.' Smoking gun: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee begged donors for money on Monday by floating the idea that Republicans could impeach the president . On . Monday the DCCC emailed its . largest donor list with a request for money based specifically on . impeachment fears. The . president, vice president and first lady, the solicitation read, 'need . your help, because it’s a critical moment. House Republicans will vote . THIS WEEK to sue the President. And the White House believes it could . lead to Barack Obama’s impeachment.' 'It’s . time to have the President’s back. With the most critical deadline . we’ve faced in just days, we’re still 75,000 donations short of our . goal.' Boehner lambasted the impeachment claims on Tuesday as 'a scam started by Democrats at the White House.' 'This . whole talk about impeachment is coming from the president's own staff, . and coming from Democrats on Capitol Hill,' Boehner told reporters. 'Why? Because they’re trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year's elections.' Adding fuel to Boehner's contention, a top White House aide used the 'I' word on Friday during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast event, tying the threat of impeachment to a lawsuit Boehner is pursuing against the Obama administration. The legal action, Dan Pfeiffer said, has 'opened the door' to a presidential impeachment. 'Impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent Republican vice presidential nominee and others in a very un-serious way,' said Pfeiffer, hat-tipping former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. 'We take it very seriously and I don't think it would be a good thing.' Palin said of Obama just days ago in Denver that 'if he's not impeachable, then no one is.' Boehner has said plainly that his lawsuit, which focuses on the White House's unilateral changes to the Obamacare law, is not a prelude to removing Obama from power. 'This is not about impeachment,' the House speaker said on July 9. 'This is about faithfully executing the laws of our country.' He added a more definitive statement on Tuesday, saying that the House leadership has 'no plans to impeach the president. We have no future plans.' Staying: Obama doesn't face an impeachment threat, Boehner said, preferring to take the president to federal court over his administration's changes to the Affordable Care Act . Impeachment refers to a formal process prescribed in the U.S. Constitution for throwing a president or a federal judge out of office. The House would first bring charges against Obama and vote to approve them. The Senate would then hold a trial on those charges and vote on whether to convict. The Constitution reserves impeachment as a remedy for 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' which the framers understood to be official crimes committed while in power. Boehner and other House leaders have tried to tamp down conservative Republicans' expectations in recent weeks. A senior House staffer told MailOnline that Tuesday's words would be welcome in establishment circles since Democrats' control of the Senate makes removing Obama from office a guaranteed non-starter. 'It shouldn't have taken this long for him to say it, but now that he's said it we can get back to things that won't backfire,' the aide said. A CNN/ORC International poll released on Friday found that one-third of Americans, 33 percent, believe Obama should be impeached and removed from office. Fully 65 percent disagreed. Republicans' measure to sue Obama passed the House 225-201 on Wednesday.","The Democratic Congressional Campaign .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Vice President Joe Biden claimed that he came face to face with Vladimir Putin during a visit to Moscow in 2011 and told him: ‘Mr. Prime Minister, I’m looking into your eyes, and I don’t think you have a soul’. Biden told the New Yorker he was touring then-Prime Minister Putin's office when he positioned himself several inches from the Russian politican's face and made the biting comment. 'And he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, ""We understand one another""', Biden told the publication. 'This is who this guy is!' Scroll down for video . 'We understand one another': Biden told the New Yorker that when he met with Putin in 2011 he looked him square in the eye and said he didn't think he had a soul . Biden also told him, through an interpreter, that his office was 'magnificent.' ‘It’s amazing what capitalism will do, won’t it?' he said, a remark that reportedly had Putin laughing. The Vice President sat down with the New Yorker as part of a profile piece it is running on him in its July 28 issue. As part of it's article on Biden, the magazine also spoke with President Barack Obama. Asked for his opinion on Biden running president for a third time in 2016, Obama said: 'I think Joe would be a superb President.' 'He . has seen the job up close, he knows what the job entails. He . understands how to separate what’s really important from what’s less . important. 'I . think he’s got great people skills. He enjoys politics, and he’s got . important relationships up on the Hill that would serve him well,' Obama . said. Biden may seem like an unlikely successor to Obama, given their significant differences in age and management style, but one of Biden's political advisers, John Marttila, told the New Yorker that the two men have developed a genuine friendship in the last five years. 'Joe and Barack were having lunch, and Obama said to Biden, ""You and I are becoming good friends! I find that very surprising,"" Marttila said. 'And Joe says, ""You’re f***ing surprised!""

"By . Francesca Chambers . A third of Americans think Congress should impeach President Barack Obama, polls released today show. Left-leaning publication the Huffington Post along with polling partner YouGov and right-leaning polling company Rasmussen Reports came up with roughly the same percent of Americans who think Congress should bring formal charges against the president in separate polls that were released this morning. The poll-takers also found that 68 and 58 percent of Republicans, respectively, think the president should be impeached. Give him the boot: A third of Americans think Congress should formally bring charges against President Barack Obama . A third of Americans who took the Huffpost/YouGov poll said Congress should impeach President Obama . Congressional leadership has no intention . of drawing up articles of impeachment for Obama, but a lawsuit the . House plans to bring against the president for 'making his own laws' has stirred up impeachment talk. House Speaker John Boehner has repeatedly said the lower chamber's lawsuit, which is centered on Obamacare, is about reigning in the president, not kicking him out of office. However, far-right Republicans - including former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, have argued that impeachment would send a clearer message to nation's executive. 'You don’t bring a lawsuit to a gunfight and there’s no room for lawyers on our front lines,' Palin told Fox News last Tuesday. 'Washington is broken. If people are about the future of this country . and defense of our republic, they will join this cause of articles of . impeachment against Obama because enough is enough,' she continued. Boehner and other congressional Republicans who have been asked about impeachment say the House's lawsuit is a better long-term strategy to preventing presidents moving forward - not just Obama -  from going around Congress to enact their own laws. 'The path that we're going is the right one to defend our institution against the encroachment from the Executive Branch and to preserve the Constitution of our country as it was written and as it was intended,' Boehner told reporters last Thursday. A total of 26 percent of respondents to the Huffpost/YouGov poll who said they were not Republicans said Congress should impeach the president . While the battle cry for impeachment is coming primarily from Republicans, some Democrats and more than a third of independents took the HuffPost/YouGov poll also think Obama has gone too far and needs be punished by Congress. Overall, 26 percent of people who do not self-identify as Republicans said Obama should be impeached. Rasmussen found that 87 percent of Democrats think Congress shouldn't bring charges against the president. Americans who didn't identify with either of the two major political parties were split, with 52 percent giving impeachment a thumbs down. The conservative polling company also found that respondents were divided on whether it would be bad for the country if some members of Congress tried to impeach the president, 52 percent, and that only a third of Republicans, 32 percent, thought it would be bad for their political party if it pursued impeachment.","Two separate polls released today found that a third of Americans think Congress should impeach the president .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Ex-Vermont Governor and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean castigated big banks and big businesses as anti-capitalist this afternoon during a forum at the progressive Netroots Nation conference. 'We don't have capitalism in this country,' he said at one point. 'We have an enormous . oligopoly that's strangling the innovation that happens with small . businesses, which is where the genes of America has really been.' Dean was in the midst of previewing the . Democratic Party's bench of potential presidential candidates when he . launched into a diatribe on the ramifications of allowing banks . to become too big to fail and the importance of Massachusetts Senator . Elizabeth Warren's efforts to more strictly regulate America's financial . institutions. Tell us how you really feel: Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean gave a scathing critique of America's economy during a forum today at a progressive conference . 'I don't hate the banks, but the truth of the matter is they are not . capitalist organizations. They are basically oligopolies,' Dean claimed during his tirade. 'The problem . . . is not that they're evil and horrible - although we can debate that,' he said.  'The problem is they're so big that if they . fail, they have to be bailed out. 'So it's not capitalism.' Dean has publicly criticized the banking industry before, but his remarks in Detroit, Michigan, today appear to be the first time the former Democratic National Committee chairman has characterized their practices as anti-free market. In past discussions Dean has stopped at saying lenders need to be better regulated and banks need to be downsized. Say, cheese: 11 years after his failed presidential bid, Howard Dean is still a favorite speaker of Netroots Nation-goers . While prognosticating on the 2016 presidential election, Dean said today that he didn't think Warren would run, but 'some of the stuff she's saying about the banks has absolutely gotta be said.' He later claimed that Warren 'is actually pro-capitalist because capitalism is hurt more by capitalists than it is by people who oppose capitalism.' 'And she articulates this better than anybody I've seen,' he said, concluding his remarks on the state of America's economy. 'So, I don't think she's gonna get in unless Hillary doesn't run,' he predicted, coming back to the original topic. And if that happens, 'I know you guys are going to do everything you can to make sure she gets in whether she likes it our not,' he said, eliciting laughter and clapping from audience members. 'She's very, very smart,' he added.","Dean's tirade on big banks and capitalism arose from a discussion on the 2016 presidential race .

"By . Francesca Chambers . The White House formally submitted an emergency request to Congress on Tuesday for $3.7 billion in additional funding for security measures and humanitarian efforts at the U.S. border with Mexico. Nearly half of the money the White House is asking for would go toward providing housing and medical services for illegal immigrant children. Another third would go toward the Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency. But only $116 million of the $1.1 billion set aside for ICE would be used to deport the unaccompanied minors at the center of the humanitarian crisis on the border. The bulk of that money the White House wants Congress to appropriate to ICE, $879 million, would go toward detaining and deporting adults who are accompanied by children when they cross the border. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama wants $1.1 billion for humanitarian services for illegal immigrant children but only a tenth as much for efforts for deportation costs . Today's request follows a letter from the president to congressional leaders last Monday outlining the challenges the administration is facing on the border. In that letter, the president indicated that he would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that the administration says is slowing down its deportation efforts and additional money appropriated to various agencies that handle illegal immigration. The president said would be reaching out to Congress when it returned from recess this week with a specific sum. White House . officials told the Associated Press that they planned to ask Congress for more than $2 billion on Tuesday. When the final language came back today, the president asked for nearly double that amount. Among the requests for emergency funding were: $45 million for an additional 40 teams of immigration judges, $295 million for Central American countries to address the root causes of  mass migration of children to the U.S. and $5 million for a campaign to discourage parents in Central America from sending their children with smugglers. Crisis: More than 47,000 unaccompanied children have entered the country illegally since Oct. 1, including 9,700 in the Month of May alone . Hot seat: Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said Sunday that 'we need to find more efficient, effective ways to turn this tide around' Missing . from the White House's petition were detailed changes to the 2008 law the administration has consistently blamed for the humanitarian . crisis on the border. That law, passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress, was meant to provide protection for children brought into the U.S. as part of human trafficking schemes, mostly related to the illicit sex trade. In the absence of a move on Capitol Hill, the federal government has no choice but to treat the deluge of illegal immigrant children arriving from Central American countries the same way. That process can take weeks or months and tie up resources – including U.S. Border Patrol agents – making the border even more porous. The White House's chief spokesman admitted Monday that most on the tens of . thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing the . U.S.-Mexico border are unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief . that would prevent them from being sent back from their home countries. However, the 2008 law requires that  illegal immigrant children who come to the U.S. from non-contiguous . countries are provided due process before they are sent back home. President . Barack Obama told congressional leaders in his letter last week that his . administration would seek an amendment to the law that would allow the . Department of Homeland Security more latitude to fast-track deportations of children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Guatemala. He did not include specific language his administration would like to see added to the law at that time, and all the president said on the matter in a . letter accompanying his budgetary request today is that the administration . would continue to work with Congress to make the previously recommended . legislative changes. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest . said this afternoon that senior White House administration officials and . and senior-level congressional leaders had been in talks since last . week about changes to the law but they had not yet come to an agreement. Earnest was unable to explain what changes to the law the administration would like to see Congress make, saying only that the White House is seeking additional authorization for greater discretion in enforcing that law. However he  did say the administration is not proposing to eliminate due process or medical screenings for illegal immigrant children. What steps the administration intends to have Congress cut out of the processing requirements for illegal immigrant children to be sent back home if not one of the main requirements is clear as mud. In a statement addressing the president's request for additional funding, Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told reporters: 'The Appropriations Committee and other Members, including the working group on the border crisis led by Rep. Kay Granger, will review the White House proposal. 'The Speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas - which this proposal does not address,' he said. Asked about both Boehner and Texas Governor Rick Perry's calls for the president to send the National Guard to Rio Grande river area in Texas, Earnest said, 'There already has been made a historic investment in border security, and we're seeing the benefits of that investment along the border.' Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - $1.1 billion$116 million would pay for transportation costs for unaccompanied minors.$109 million would support other immigration and customs enforcement efforts.$879 million would pay for detention and deportation of adults traveling with children who enter the United States illegally, including the expansion of alternatives to detention programs and prosecution capacity. Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection - $433 million$364 million would pay for operational costs$29 million would  be appropriated to CBP to expand its role in Border Enforcement Security Task Force programs.$39.4 million would go to increasing air surveillance of the border. Department of Justice - $64 million$45.4 million would go toward hiring approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams.$2.5 million would be used to expand a program that provides legal assistance to adults and guardians of children in the immigration court system$15 million would help fund legal representation for children in immigration proceedings$1.1 million would be used to hire additional immigration litigation attorneys . Department of State and Other International Programs - $300 million$295 million would go to Central American countries for repatriation and reintegration efforts, border security and programs that address the root causes of mass migration.$5 million would support media campaigns in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras explaining that unaccompanied minors will not receive amnesty in the U.S. This category of money would also support youth leadership development programs. Department of Health and Human Services - $1.8 billionAll of this money would go toward caring for illegal immigrant children who cross the border and includes money to fund additional housing facilities and medical treatment.

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama has accepted an invitation from Texas Governor Rick Perry yesterday to meet for a 'substantive' discussion about illegal immigration when the president comes to Texas tomorrow. The White . House had previously requested that the Republican Governor meet President . Obama on the tarmac for a handshake upon his arrival in Austin, but Perry refused and sent a letter to the White House proposing a lengthier meeting. 'I appreciate the offer to greet you at Austin-Bergstrom Airport, but . a quick handshake on the tarmac will not allow for a thoughtful . discussion regarding the humanitarian and national security crises . enveloping the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas,' Perry said. White House Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett sent Perry a response letter today telling him 'the president would welcome a meeting with you.' 'In addition, he asked me to invite you to join him for a . meeting to discuss the situation on the border with faith leaders and . local elected officials in Dallas on Wednesday,' Jarrett said. Texas Gov. Rick Perry talks to members of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security about the humanitarian and national security crises along the Texas-Mexico border on Thursday July 3, 2014 during a field hearing in McAllen, Texas . President Barack Obama, right, speaks with Texas Governor Rick Perry, left, after arriving on Air Force One at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas on May 9, 2013. Perry is refusing to meet Obama on the tarmac during his trip to Texas this year but the two now have plans to meet up to discuss illegal immigration . Perry’s Press Secretary, Lucy Nashed, told NBC News on Tuesday afternoon that 'Gov. Perry is pleased that President Obama has accepted his . invitation to discuss the humanitarian and national security crises . along our southern border, and he looks forward to meeting with the . president tomorrow.' The president's overture to Perry comes after weeks of passive aggressive back and forth in the media between the Republican Governor and the White House. Perry has repeatedly criticized the administration's response to the humanitarian crisis at the section of the border near the Rio Grande river, telling Fox News last month, 'The federal government is just absolutely failing. 'We either have an . incredibly inept administration, or they're in on this somehow or . another,' he said. 'I mean I hate to be conspiratorial, but I mean how do you move . that many people from Central America across Mexico and then into the . United States without there being a fairly coordinated effort?' Obama . is traveling to Texas tomorrow afternoon to appear at Democratic Party . fundraisers and meet with Americans who have written him letters. He is . not planning to visit the detention facilities housing illegal immigrant . children along the U.S. border with Mexico when he visits. 'If he doesn’t come to the border, I think it’s a real reflection of . his lack of concern of what’s really going on there,' Perry told Fox last week after the White House announce Obama's intentions not to tour immigration facilities during his trip. 'If the President of the United States is really . serious about securing that border, we can show him how to do that,' Perry said. 'But I haven’t even had a phone call from this president.' The White House has said multiple times that the president does not need to come to the border in person to witness the humanitarian crisis because high-level administration officials are keeping an eye on the situation and giving him regular updates. During his daily briefing last Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said 'the most important thing' people like Perry could do to fix the broken immigration system 'is not offer public . invitations but actually to lend their public support to comprehensive . immigration reform.' On Thursday, Earnest struck out at Perry again, telling reporters that many if not all of the people complaining about the president's decision not the visit the border would 'rather play politics than actually try to address some of these challenges.' 'If . they were committed to solving the problem, you know, for example in . the case of the Texas Governor, he could probably be pretty useful, I . hear he's a pretty persuasive fellow, that he could pick up the phone, . and call up some of those Republican members of Congress from Texas who . are standing foursquare against common sense immigration reform,' Earnest continued. 'If . the governor were genuinely concerned about solving so many of these . problems that exist on the border, the most impactful thing he could do . right now, is encourage those Republican members of the House of . Representatives to stop blocking common sense legislation from coming to . the floor of the House of Representatives.' The president's preferred immigration reform legislation passed in the Senate last summer, but House . Speaker John Boehner has long said he will not allow the bill to come to a vote in the lower chamber because it makes sweeping changes to the immigration system. Boehner and his Republican colleagues favor of a series of individual bills that would gradually reform laws pertaining to immigration. Appearing on ABC News' This Week on Sunday morning, Perry pointed the finger back at the president, saying his administration sent the White House a letter two years ago about the influx of unaccompanied minors, but the federal government did nothing. 'This is a failure of diplomacy. It is a . failure of leadership from the administration in Washington, D.C.' Perry said. The three-term Governor said Obama's pleas for Central American parents not to send their children to America are 'about five years too late' and reaffirmed his position that members of Obama's team are 'either are inept or don't care.' 'I have to believe that when you do not respond in any way, that you are . either inept, or you have some ulterior motive of which you are . functioning from,' he said. Perry said he petitioned the president to deploy 1,000 members of the National Guard to help secure the border in 2010 but Obama dismissed his request. Last week Perry again called on the president to send down the National Guard. The White House said today that it did not think that more personnel at the border would fix the problem. Perry also asked for compensation in the amount of $500 million to repay Texas taxpayers for footing the bill for border security efforts that ought to be funded by the federal government. The White House has not yet responded to that request, and it will likely be a topic of discussion during Obama and Perry's meeting tomorrow. Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, pictured here in September, expressed concern yesterday that president Obama's decision not visit the border will become his 'Katrina moment' Former president George W. Bush said in 2010 that this photo of him looking out the window of Air Force One on August 31, 2005, at the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina as he flew over New Orleans, Louisiana, on his way back to Washington was a 'huge mistake' The White House announced weeks ago that it would provide more than $250 million in new aid to Central American countries to help mitigate factors that would make children flea their home counties for the U.S. But it took until today to officially ask Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to confront the immigration crisis head on. 'With all due respect to the administration, they were one step . behind,' on the immigration crisis, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar told CNN on Sunday. 'They . should have seen this coming a long time ago.' 'We should have been ready for this surge,' Cuellar, a Democrat, said. 'The administration should have been ready.' In a follow-up interview with Fox News yesterday, Cuellar said Obama may live to regret ignoring calls for him to visit the border during his fundraising swing through the state. 'I’m sure that President Bush thought the same thing, that he could . just look at everything from up in the sky, and then he owned it after a . long time,' Cuellar said. In 2005 then-President George W. Bush made the mistake of not meeting with Louisiana's Governor or other elected officials immediately after Hurricane Katrina demolished New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast. To make matters worse, Bush was photographed looking down at the catastrophe from the window of Air Force One on his way back to the White House from his home in Texas, where he was on a working vacation when the storm hit. Reflecting on the incident in a 2010 interview with NBC, Bush said the photo was a 'huge mistake' and he should have went to see the disaster area first-hand at that time. Instead, he held a news conference when he returned to Washington and designated the hurricane as 'one of worst national disasters in our nation's history,' then spent another day in D.C. before making his way down to the affected area the following day to meet with locals. The President and his administration were widely criticized for their lack of preparedness for the crisis beforehand and their slow response afterward. Cuellar told Fox News yesterday that Obama was in danger of having succumbing to a similar fate. 'So I hope this doesn’t become the Katrina moment for President . Obama, saying that he doesn’t need to come to the border,' Cuellar told Fox News. 'He should come . down.' In an appearance on Fox News this morning radio show host Laura Ingraham speculated Obama is more worried about the blowback he would receive if he did tour illegal immigration facilities than if he doesn't. 'I think he’s worried about being seen in one of these detention facilities … because that could be a photo-op that would blow up in his face, and he’s worried about what that would look like, I believe,' Ingraham said. 'For the president to confront this face to face would be a startling picture. He doesn’t want that picture out there.' The White House denied this afternoon that concerns about a bad photo-op were keeping Obama away from the border.","Perry is upset that Obama won't visit detention facilities along the U.S. border with Mexico when he comes to Texas tomorrow .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Elected officials and rumored 2016 presidential candidates descended upon Detroit, Michigan, today to woo progressive activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference. But one high-profile, political figure is noticeably missing from the fray: Hillary Clinton. Clinton has not attended the gathering since 2007 when she was competing in the Democratic primary for president, and conference organizers said she declined an invitation to speak this year. The former Secretary of State opted to spend the week promoting her book, instead, holding book signings in New Jersey and Connecticut. This afternoon she sat down with Charlie Rose in his Manhattan office for an hour long interview that will air tonight on PBS. Hillary Clinton, pictured here on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on Tuesday, put promoting her book ahead of speaking to progressive activists at a gathering this week in Detroit . Republicans . lept to criticize Hillary's absence from the 3,000 person gathering as . further proof that the 2016 frontrunner is out of touch with her base. 'Hillary Clinton is just too busy on her book tour to take time out for the Netroots conference in Detroit but with all of the news about how the Clintons have struggled financially, we get it, money first, even as colleges dole out millions to hear her speak despite rising tuition costs,' Republican National Committee spokesman Raffi Williams said, touching on Hillary's recent gaffes. 'Sounds like she’ll have to find another occasion to try to placate the liberal left as Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden make their 2016 plays after seeing an opening with Hillary’s book tour stumbles and her 2016 moves echoing her failed 2008 campaign.' However, conference . attendees said they weren't offended she didn't make speaking to them a priority this year. 'I think she’s obviously a very busy woman,' said Christine Soliz, a organizer with Planned Parenthood in the Detroit area who described herself a Hillary supporter. 'It's her loss,' said another attendee, adding that it's too early in the election cycle to 'harangue' Clinton for skipping the gathering. Netroots Nation spokeswoman Mary Rickles told MailOnline she's 'not surprised' Hillary didn't attend again this year because 'she has not declared yet.' 'Most of the events that she’s doing are pretty benign . non-political events,' Rickles continued. The San Francisco resident pointed out that pro-Clinton PAC Ready for Hillary had a substantial presence at the conference as a sponsor of both the conference itself and both a Motown-themed party on Friday evening. It also provided attendees with coffee during a snack break this morning. ‘Her team knows that she has a presence here, and regardless . of whether or not it fits her schedule, she’s still got a presence here, ' Rickles said. 'The . Ready for Hillary folks know what they’re doing.’ Asked for a comment on it's chosen candidate's absence from the conference today, Ready for Hillary spokesman Seth Bringman told MailOnline in an email, 'We're just thrilled to be a part of Netroots Nation and thrilled to be a co-sponsor of this amazing gathering. 'Hillary's support from progressives across the country - who are the backbone of our more than 2.5 million supporters - has been absolutely inspiring,' he said. A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment on Clinton's decision to skip the conference. Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Rodham Clinton, left, and Barack, right, participate in the Yearly Kos Convention's Presidential Leadership Forum in Chicago in 2007. Clinton has not attended, Yearly Kos, now called Netroots Nation, since that debate . While Netroots attendees said they would still vote for Hillary if she were the Democratic nominee in 2016, it's no secret that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is most activists' candidate of choice. 'Her values . are consistent with what I believe and what a lot of people here believe,' said Paula Branter, Executive Director of . Workplace Fairness, a Washington, D.C. based organization that . advocates for the fair treatment of workers and provides legal advice on . worker’s rights. Warren spoke at the conference in 2012 in person as a candidate, and gave a video address as a lawmaker last year. This year she is slated to give the keynote speech on Friday morning. 'It’s really . good to have the affirmation of someone that high [up] in a position of power . who’s saying all the right things,' Branter gushed. 'I would love it,' she replied when asked how she felt about Warren's potential presidential run. As one attendee noted, Hillary has a 'troubled' relationship with the left wing of the Democratic Party. The former first lady and her husband are seen as too moderate for many progressives' taste and their willingness to accept large sums of money from the 'too big to fail' financial crowd is concerning to anti-Wall Street activists. 'From my perspective it’s problematic,' Pennsylvania resident Gerald Hoffman said, referring to the millions of dollars Bill and Hillary have received from the financial industry to speak at events. 'You have to wonder who a politician is beholden to if they’re getting all their money from people who are giving it in huge chunks,' Hoffman said. 'So I’m worried about that.' ‘If she gets elected, we’re going to have to continuously poke her to make sure that she stays to the left.' Branter said Hillary may be avoiding the conference because she thinks kissing up to progressive activists is a waste of her time. ‘I think . that she might say, ""Well look, I’m not gonna win over this crowd."" ' 'I can’t imagine being enough of an activist to want to come . to this conference and not having an opinion about Hillary,' Branter said. 'This is not a . persuadable audience.' Another attendee, Garth . Eisenhard, a Silver Spring, Maryland, resident who described himself as ‘left . of Karl Marx,’ said progressives are 'either going to vote for . her or not if she’s the candidate, regardless of what she says or does,' so Hillary may as well continue ignoring the party's base. 'I mean it doesn’t matter if she comes here or not for . 95 percent of the people,' he said. 'I will vote her with no reservations if she is the . Democratic candidate. I will vote for whoever is the Democratic candidate.' However, Jason . Parsely, Associate Publisher of South Florida Gay News, a website that covers . the gay community, said Hillary will need the grassroots activists who attend this conference to have her back if she wants to make it that far in the first place. ‘If you want to build a grassroots network for any Democratic primary, these are the people you definitely need to rely on,' he said. ‘I’m . disappointed that she’s not [here].' 'This is the largest, liberal, progressive . gathering of activists around the country, so you’d think she would’ve . made an attempt to be here.’ If Hillary runs for office and doesn't attend next year, however, Netroots-goers said they wouldn't let her off the hook so easily. 'If she’s running next year and even if she’s the frontrunner and seems to be the only one, she needs the progressive turnout,' said seven-year Netroots veteran Norman Buchwald. 'She should be here.'","Netroots Nation is the largest annual gathering of progressives .

Reaching for her phone, there was one person she needed to call: the dear friend who had been by her side throughout the pregnancy. Never mind that the next morning was Christmas Day, she knew her delighted friend would drop everything to race to the hospital to see the new arrival. As predicted, she swept in, threw her arms around her friend, and wept unashamedly with the new family. The friend was Ansam Al-Habib — who was Funke’s obstetrician at North Middlesex University Hospital, London. Miss Al-Habib knew more than anyone what this baby meant to Funke and her husband Charles, a lecturer at Greenwich University. Dr Al-Habib (right) has been nominated by Funke Oham (left) after Dr Al Habib helped her with her pregnancy and went the extra mile to support her . Ten months earlier, they had lost their daughter, Faith, after Funke miscarried at 23 weeks. A year before that, the couple’s son, Isaac, was stillborn at full term at another London hospital after Funke’s placenta detached and starved her unborn child of oxygen. ‘The shock of losing Isaac was like a physical blow,’ says Funke quietly. ‘I hit such a low, and after Faith, the grief threatened to swallow me up again. Losing her was so awful I couldn’t even face telling my parents what had happened, because I felt so sorry for them.’ As Funke struggled to come to terms with the ‘indescribable’ pain of Faith’s death, she discovered she was pregnant again. The news couldn’t have come at a more distressing time, for two days later she had to return to North Middlesex where Faith had been born to hear the results of the post-mortem on her daughter. ‘I tried to force myself to stay positive, but I was full of such emptiness and fear I could hardly dare imagine that this pregnancy would work.’ ‘She handed me her mobile phone number . and told me to ring her, day or night, promising, “I’m here for you . every step of the way”.’ Funke Oham . When she first met Miss Al-Habib, Funke, 36, who lives in Chingford, and runs a woman’s mentoring network, was overwrought with a mixture grief and hormones. ‘But this lovely doctor was so comforting, calm and determined that I instantly felt more at ease. I had seen many different doctors before, but I never felt that anyone personally cared about me and my babies. At best, they had been kind but remote. ‘Miss Al-Habib had been asked to go through the results of the post-mortem with me. She was so kind and caring that I blurted out: “I’m pregnant again and I am hoping I will be looked after by you”. I had this sudden, spontaneous feeling that she was the right doctor to help me become a mother. ‘She handed me her mobile phone number and told me to ring her, day or night, promising, “I’m here for you every step of the way”.’ The post-mortem showed no reason for Funke’s early labour, which only increased her anxiety. ‘But she said she would do her very best to make sure this pregnancy progressed well, and promised she would monitor me personally throughout. She was good to her word. Any time I felt a twinge — often in the evenings, when she was at home — I would text or ring. Without fail, she would ring straight back or text. ‘I contacted her countless times, and would always apologise for being silly. She would say: “There’s no such thing as a silly question.”’ Funke says: ‘It gave me confidence. By the last two months of pregnancy, I had a scan every two weeks to ensure the baby was growing as normal. A couple of times, the scans didn’t show the baby clearly enough, so Miss Al-Habib would stop what she was doing and scan me herself. ‘Nothing was ever too much trouble. I had the feeling it was as important to her as it was to me that this baby would make it.’ The birth of a child is a moment mothers treasure for ever (posed by models) Miss Al-Habib arranged for Funke to have a temporary stitch placed in the cervix to prevent premature labour — this carries a small risk of miscarriage, which was clearly worrying for Funke and Charles. ‘But Miss Al-Habib dealt with my endless questions and worries with a wonderful calmness.’ And it worked: baby Jeremiah was delivered at 37 weeks on Christmas Eve 2007. ‘When he was born, there was silence and I froze,’ recalls Funke. ‘I thought “Oh no, not again”. But then he gasped and cried and I just burst into tears. Feeling him squirming and moving in my arms is a moment I will treasure forever. ‘I always dreamed of hearing a little voice call me “Mummy”, and thanks to this wonderful doctor, that dream has come true.’ Funke Ohman . ‘I texted Miss Al-Habib, because I wanted her to know he was here and he was safe. She came in on her holiday just to see us. She hugged me and Charles and wept when she saw Jeremiah.’ But it’s not just Miss Al-Habib’s care and kindness that makes her so special, says another mother Alexia Alexandrou, it’s her willingness to go the extra mile for her patients and their babies. Alexia, 36, from Palmers Green, in North London was referred to Miss Al-Habib after she and her husband Kyriacos, a window cleaner, spent five years trying to conceive. As she explains: ‘I’d spent eight months on hormone treatment being monitored by nurses who wouldn’t even look me in the face. ‘When I met Miss Al-Habib, I just burst into tears. She just looked at me and said, “From this moment on, you are dealing with me personally. You will have a baby as soon as possible.” She gave me her mobile number, and she always answered any query — happily calling me back at weekends. ‘She tested my hormone and blood levels personally and frequently, and this extra attention to even the slightest change in my levels paid off. Nine months later, I became pregnant with twins.’ Medical workers like Miss Al-Habib help deliver hundred of new babies every day (picture posed by models) Alexia had undergone IUI (intrauterine insemination) where the sperm is placed directly into the uterus during ovulation — and the timing is crucial. ‘When I went into labour in May 2011, Miss Al-Habib came to see me at 8.30 in the morning,’ says Alexia. ‘She returned at 8pm that evening, and I asked: “When do you finish work?”. She’d finished nearly four hours earlier, but said, “I’ve worked hard for these babies and I’m going to deliver them myself — I can’t miss this.”’ Nearly two hours after that she delivered twins Chris and George. ‘Her total dedication goes far beyond anything I’ve ever seen before with any other doctor,’ says Alexia. For Funke and Charles, there’s no doubt that Miss Al-Habib was key to them finally becoming a family. Jeremiah is now six and Funke went on to have another little boy, Issiah, now three. ‘We were so desperate to become parents, and meeting Miss Al-Habib was like having a friend who shared the same dream for us.’ Issiah was born on March 31, 2011 — ‘and although Miss Al-Habib was working miles away at another hospital that day, she came back to see him the next day,’ says Funke. ‘I said: “It’s thanks to you I have these two boys.” ’ Miss Al-Habib sends me texts at Christmas and on my birthday. When it was her birthday, I took the boys into the hospital to see her, and she cried with joy. ‘I always dreamed of hearing a little voice call me “Mummy”, and thanks to this wonderful doctor, that dream has come true.’ For Funke and Alexia, Miss Al-Habib is a more than worthy nominee for the Daily Mail Health Hero awards. But like so many of our nominees, Miss Al-Habib is modest about her efforts. Asked about going to see Funke after Jeremiah’s birth, she says: ‘I had looked after this wonderful lady all through her journey to becoming a mother, so how could I fail to turn up to share her happiness? ‘I had dreamed of the day she would hold her baby in her arms, and it didn’t matter that it was Christmas Day. I wanted to be there to hug Funke and Charles and to see that happiness in their eyes. ‘It is far more than a job to me —it is a passion. You are starting a new chapter of life with amazing women, and many of them you will never forget.‘It’s not about being a good doctor — it’s about being a good person.’","Ansam Al-Habib helped Faye Oham through her third pregnancy .

"By . Amanda Cable . Nothing beats a boiled egg with soldiers for breakfast. But the morning rush means most bleary-eyed commuters don’t have time to prepare them. But now a high-tech saucepan, designed by Oxford University rocket scientist Dr Tom Povey, claims to cut the time it takes to boil an egg. Futuristic ridged ‘fins’ on the sides direct heat and are claimed to cut a minute off an egg’s boiling time — which could mean the difference between missing or catching a train. How do you like your eggs in the morning? A high-tech saucepan, designed by rocket scientist Dr Tom Povey, claims to cut the time it takes to boil an egg . It is also said to distribute heat more evenly, ensuring your egg is perfectly cooked throughout. But is it the fastest? Amanda Cable put Dr Povey’s Flare to the test, along with other pans, using her Aga hotplate. For the test, she placed two medium-sized eggs at room temperature into a pan of cold water, timing one for three minutes and another for five, once each pan began to boil. FLARE SAUCEPAN, £64.99,  lakeland.co.uk . Its space-age design means that high-performance fins channel heat across the bottom and up the sides of the pan, cooking food faster. BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Nine minutes 30 seconds — surprisingly slow, but it is designed mainly for use on gas hobs. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Hang on, this solid egg can’t have been cooking for only three minutes. It’s already hard-boiled. EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: Nicely done for those who prefer a firm egg. VERDICT: If you want your eggs cooked with the speed of a space rocket, look no further. SCORE: 10/10 . CERAMICA, £92.99, lakeland.co.uk . A set of four saucepans in Farrow & Ball-type shades made from cast aluminium that conducts heat efficiently, avoiding hot spots. Each has a clip-on handle, which means they stack inside each other neatly. BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Five minutes 12 seconds. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Watery and uneven, with the whites around the yolk still translucent. Perfect for my husband — but not for me. EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: This still had some setting to do — and the yolk gave way like a thick Creme Egg when I put my teaspoon in. Uneven. VERDICT: More style than substance as  the eggs weren’t  cooked well. SCORE: 6/10 . ROCCO, £20, simply-shops.net . A replica of the saucepans your mum used in the Seventies — with wooden handle, cream enamel and twee country print (above right). BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Nine minutes 41 seconds. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Evenly cooked with a nice consistency . EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: If your favourite childhood memory was dipping toast into a firm boiled egg, this gives perfect results. VERDICT: Good. SCORE: 7/10 . SIMPLY PERFECT BY RAYMOND BLANC, £52.50, johnlewis.com . This heavy anodised saucepan  is non-stick and dishwasher safe, with a long, curved handle. BOILING TIME FROM COLD: 16 minutes. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Both yolk and white were almost solid. EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: Yolk was solid and quite pale — all in all, a little like the rubber balls I throw for the dog. VERDICT: You’ll need to set your alarm early if you like eggs in the morning and use this pan. Probably better reserved for making a French stew. SCORE: 5/10 . SAINBURY’S CLASSIC, £11,  sainsburys.co.uk . No-frills non-stick pan with a plastic handle and glass lid. BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Four minutes 54 seconds. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Cooked unevenly, with some of the white still watery. Yolk was set in places and runny in others. EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: White was tough and rubbery. Yolk was hard, but moist and not chalky. VERDICT: This boiled faster than any other pan, but as the heat was concentrated at the bottom, parts of the egg cooked more rapidly than others. The plastic handle also became warm. For a student on a budget, though, this is a good option. SCORE: 3/10 . JAMIE OLIVER PROFESSIONAL SERIES BY TEFAL, £52,  johnlewis.com . Swish stainless steel with a measuring gauge. It has two lips for easy pouring and a long handle to avoid splashes. An aluminium base distributes heat evenly. BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Five minutes. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: A gleaming, soft yolk so inviting you want to dunk the nearest piece of bread straight inside. The soft white was nicely set. EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: Evenly cooked, but not dry and chalky. VERDICT: Fast boiling and cooks evenly. I’m impressed. SCORE: 9/10 . MAUVIEL M'HERITAGE  copper saucepan, £200, divertimenti.co.uk . At £200, this 18cm pan (below left) is a pricey option due to the fact that it’s made from copper, which conducts heat better than any other metal. BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Seven minutes 22 seconds. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Yolk had set in the middle, but was soft around the edges. White did not cook evenly — it remained runny around the yolk. EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: With the additional cooking time, the yolk had set hard, with the white nicely firm. VERDICT: The eggs weren’t evenly cooked — though my husband, who enjoys a runny consistency, said this was his favourite. SCORE: 6/10 . INGENIO, £85 FOR THREE, TEFAL . Stacking saucepan with a clip-on handle. Made from aluminium, the inside is coated with Intensium non-stick, which Tefal claims lasts twice as long as other coatings. BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Five minutes 38 seconds. EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Cooked very quickly and evenly, with some yolk oozing over the sides as I pushed my spoon in. EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: The white was pleasantly firm and the yolk perfectly cooked. VERDICT: A good all-rounder. SCORE: 7/10 .","Futuristic Flare saucepan is designed by rocket scientist Dr Tom Povey .

"By . Francesca Chambers . A Democratic Senator skipped his own fundraiser today to avoid being seen with President Barack Obama. Colorado Sen. Mark Udall was slated to appear at a luncheon benefiting his campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Denver this afternoon with the president. The fundraiser had been on the books for at least a month, and Udall, who is up for reelection this year, had touted the joint appearance to supporters. Udall's campaign suddenly announced this morning that the Senator had changed his mind and would stay in Washington today instead. The only high-ranking Democrat who would even be seen in pubic with the president during his trip to Colorado was Governor John Hickenlooper - and they ran into each other at the bar. Democratic politicians steered clear of President Barack Obama when he came to Colorado this week . None of the state's top Democrats joined the president today at Cheesman Park in Denver, where he gave a speech on the economy and spoke with locals . Udall, Hickenlooper and former Colorado state house speaker and current congressional candidate Andrew Romanoff had already said they would not attend a speech the president was giving on the economy this morning in Denver's Cheesman Park. Romanoff has been on bad terms with the White House since it tried to convince him to stay out of the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate in 2010 to make things easier for sitting Democratic Senator Michael Bennett. A spokeman for Hickenlooper told the Denver Post on Monday that the Governor was simply booked by the time Obama scheduled his remarks. 'The governor has been confirmed since late May to attend a veterans' event on Wednesday morning in Colorado Springs,' said the spokesman, Eric Brown, adding that the governor's office had only just learned of Obama's speech. 'This . has nothing to do with wanting to be with him or not. This is just . logistics,' Udall campaign spokesman Chris Harris told the Denver Post when he asked about his boss' plans. 'If the president is in town, and the president wants to be helpful, why . would anyone want to pass that up?' Udall campaign consultant Mike Stratton said. 'I don't think one visit . by the president is going to change anything in terms of the dynamics of . the campaign.' Ahead of the Democratic Senator's fundraiser featuring Obama today, Udall sent an email to supporters telling them how much he was looking forward to introducing them to the president. 'I'm grateful for President Obama's support in this U.S. Senate race, and I'm looking forward to bringing him out to Colorado for a campaign event,' Udall said, according to the Denver Post. 'But I'm especially excited to introduce him to you, friend,' he continued. Udall's campaign announced this morning, however, that the Senator would remain in D.C. today to vote for Obama's nominee to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Julian Castro. 'Mark is grateful for the president's support, and had hoped to welcome . him to Colorado in person, but his responsibilities to serve Colorado in . the Senate come first,' Harris said. But Castro was expected to be confirmed by the Senate with no extreme difficulty and ended up being approved for the post by nearly three quarters of the Senate. Sen. Mark Udall skipped his own fundraiser today and remained on Capitol Hill in Washington to avoid being seen with President Obama . Republicans . said it didn't come as a shock to them that none of the state's top Democrats . wanted to rub elbows with Obama - least of all Udall, whose race against . Republican Rep. Cory Gardner is ranked as a toss-up on polling site . Real Clear Politics. 'Actions speak louder than words,' a National Republican Senatorial Committee statement said today. 'It’s clear . that the President is beyond toxic, and Mark Udall’s campaign is running . scared.' 'It’s . hardly surprising that Gov. Hickenlooper and Sen. Udall are doing . everything they can to run away from the worst president since World War . II,' Colorado Republican . Committee Chairman Ryan Call said in a statement on Monday, referring to . a recent Quinnipiaic poll in which Obama was rated the least liked . president since 1945. Obama has a 38 percent approval . rating in Colorado, according to Quinnipiac University, and Gallup says he has a marginally higher 43 percent . approval rating nationally. 'I . don't think there are accidents when it comes to the president's . schedule, and I don't think there are accidents when it comes to . senators and members of Congress and their schedules,' Nathan Gonzales, . an analyst for the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report, told the . Denver Post earlier this week. The only current politician who was willing to hang out with Obama in pubic was Governor John Hickenlooper, right, who ran into the president at a bar . Hickenlooper used to own the bar, Wynkoop Brewing Company, and was hanging out there when Obama dropped by . The Colorado Governor then challenged the president to a game of pool. 'I took his lunch money,' Obama told a group of donors today . Hickenlooper ended up hanging out with Obama at a bar last night, but the meet-up doesn't appear to have been preplanned. Obama . said he was having a drink nearby with some locals and decided to . drop by Wynkoop Brewing Company, an establishment Hickenlooper used to . own. The . Colorado Governor just happened to be there at the time, and invited . the president to play a game of pool. Or at least that's how Obama made the encounter sound during his remarks . at this afternoon's fundraiser. 'You can ask him how that went,' Obama said of the pool game. 'I took his lunch money.' Obama . also mentioned Udall in his remarks, saying he 'is a serious person who . is trying to do the right thing and who has the values that we share.' 'He is not an ideologue. He doesn’t agree with me on everything,' Obama admitted. 'But . he believes in the core idea that I think should be what Democrats are . all about, this idea that if you work hard you should be able to make . it,' he said. 'And that’s worth supporting.' Udall's . absence from the fundraiser was made more noticeable by the fact that . he is the only candidate whom Obama has campaigned for directly this . year. The . proceeds for other events Obama has appeared at this year went directly . to the Democratic Party. Half of the donations from today's . event - which cost as much as $15,000 a couple to attend - will go directly to . Udall. Udall is not alone, however, in his attempts to avoid the unpopular president this election year. North Carolina Senator Kay Hagen, who is also caught up in a . touch reelection battle, stayed in Washington when Obama came to her . state, too. Alaska Sen. Mark Begich said in January that if the president ever came to Alaska he wouldn't campaign with him. 'I don’t need him campaigning for me — I need him to change some of his policies,' the endangered Democrat said. 'If he wants to come up there and learn about Alaska, bring it on — . I’ll drag him around, I’ll show him whatever he wants to see,' he said, but campaigning is a no-go. 'I’m not really interested in campaigning.'","Colorado Sen.

"By . Francesca Chambers . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie admitted today that he's avoiding questions about certain national issues because he's worried about giving 'ill-informed' answers that will bite him in the rear if he runs for president in 2016. Christie told CNBC's John Harwood that he won't 'pretend' to have an opinion on issues he hasn't studied such as the Export-Import Bank just because it's a hot topic and people want to know what he thinks. But 'if and when there's a time that comes that I . need to be telling people in this country what my view is on those . issues, I will,' he promised. 'If I run for president, you can be sure that I'll have an opinion,' Christie said in comments first reported by Business Insider. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said today he's purposefully withholding his opinion on salient national issues because he's 'ill-informed' 'But until that time I think it's quite frankly immature . to be expressing a lot of those opinions just because I'm sitting up . here in front of this room and you asked,' Christie said, taking a shot across the bow at his contemporaries. 'You can ask whatever you like, I don't have to answer,' he said, taking on a defensive tone. Harwood expressed disbelief that Christie's been 'ducking' questions about federal issues because he's ignorant, but Christie told him with a straight face that was truly the case. 'Believe me, you can't imagine how ill-informed I am,' Christie said, prompting laughter from the audience. 'If I don't think my answer is going to be smart and will stand the . test of time, you can be damned sure that I'm not going to answer, he said, 'because you'll have this tape and you'll use it.' Christie made the last remark with a grin, indicating that he was half-joking. While . the line was made partly in jest, the Republican Governor hit on a . serious point: comments he makes now on federal issues open him up to . future attacks by his opponents should he seek higher office. Changing . his position on major political issues before or after he announces his . intentions to run for president could be politically damaging, too. Christie told CNBC's John Harwood in an-onstage interview at the Delivering Alpha Conference in New York that he'll share his opinion on the issues if he decides to run for president, but he hasn't made a decision yet . During the interview Christie wouldn't commit to running for president, but the two-term governor confirmed that he's still considering it, despite political woes stemming from a government employee's decision to purposefully cause a traffic jam on a busy bridge last year. 'I've been pretty clear, you know, I . certainly am going to consider it, but whether I do it or not is . something that I honestly don't know yet,' he claimed after Harwood asked him about his intentions at the beginning of the interview. The father of four noted that his children, ages 11 through 20, are 'relatively' young, and that's something that continues to weigh on his mind. Christie said he honestly wasn't in a hurry to make any decisions about his political future and cautioned the audience against politicians who are, ribbing his potential opponents once again. 'The fact is that you should beware of people in . my opinion are overanxious to make that decision before they need to. 'That would seem to indicate to me . ambition over wisdom,' he said, 'and I don't think that's what you want in the . person sitting in the Oval Office.'","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is considered a likely 2016 Republican presidential candidate .

"By . Amanda Cable . The Daily Mail is proud to be . running the seventh Inspirational Women of the Year Awards, in . association with British Gas and homelessness charity Shelter. Over the . next weeks, we want you to nominate special women who deserve . recognition. Here is the story of one remarkable . nominee... Daphne Belt will do a triathlon every morning until she turns 75 . As she nears the age of 75, when most pensioners would look forward to putting their feet up and dunking a digestive into a nice cup of tea, Daphne Belt is lacing up her running shoes and preparing to celebrate her birthday in her own indomitable fashion. At just 5ft 2ins tall, this extraordinary human powerhouse is planning to undertake a triathlon on every single morning of the entire 75 days running up to her landmark birthday. This means each day for two-and-a-half months leading up to 14 August 2014, Daphne will swim 1,000 metres in her local pool, ride eight miles on her bike and 'wind down' with a run of almost two miles along the seafront in Littlehampton, West Sussex. Daphne's extraordinary challenge will raise money for her local children's hospice. 'I want to raise well over £1,000 for Chestnut Tree House - the only children's hospice in Sussex - and I'll nag everybody silly until I do,' she says with a twinkle in her eye. Taking the easy option has never been on Daphne's agenda. Her core of inner steel has powered her through more than 250 triathlons and 18 'extreme' fitness endurance tests known as Ironman challenges. Normally, such extreme challenges - undertaken in the searing heat of foreign shores and often amid perilous mountain terrain - are the reserve of 6ft-tall fitness instructors and soldiers from elite forces. But Daphne's neat grey crop, tiny frame and cheerful smile have become familiar fixtures on starting lines around the world. She tirelessly raises money for charity, and says: 'I first went to visit the local children's hospice several years ago. I saw such sadness and love there, it moved me to tears. I thought ""I've got to do everything I can for these brave children and their families."" ' Taking the easy option has never been on Daphne's agenda: her core of inner steel has powered her through more than 250 triathlons and 18 'extreme' fitness endurance tests known as Ironman challenges . If she's not raising money for the hospice, Daphne is helping other adults - many of whom have lost their way and their confidence. She tirelessly helps to teach women beginners to swim and hundreds of others to keep fit, and blazes a trail encouraging women and men over a certain age to get up from the sofa. Watching Daphne sprint down the road it's hard to believe that 24 years ago she was so unfit she could hardly climb the stairs without becoming breathless. Daphne, who lives with her antique dealer husband of 35 years, Stephen, says: 'I floated past my 40th birthday without being bothered at all. My daughter was grown up, and I enjoyed a quiet life with Stephen. Daphne tirelessly helps to teach women beginners to swim and hundreds of others to keep fit, and blazes a trail encouraging women and men over a certain age to get up from the sofa . 'But as I neared my 50th birthday, the impact of my age suddenly hit me. I thought 'Oh my goodness, it's half a century.' I imagined my life as a spiral staircase, with me sliding down. I remember thinking 'I've got to claw my way back up. 'My hobbies were reading, watching television and tinkering in the garden. I did no sport or keep-fit at all, and although I'm not tall, I weighed 11 stone. I joined a local gym and started to get a little fitter, but one day the manager came up and said 'I've never seen you on the treadmill.' 'I said firmly ""Oh, I don't do running."" But he persuaded me to jump on and run for the first time in my life. It was an extraordinary feeling. I felt as if my lungs were inflating for the first time.' Daphne's story might have ended with sedate workouts at the gym – but then a young friend mentioned a triathlon. Daphne's story might have ended with sedate workouts at the gym ¿ but then a young friend mentioned a triathlon . Daphne leapt at the challenge. She says: 'I thought ""that sounds rather jolly,"" so at the age of 51, I found myself taking part in my first triathlon, in Ringwood, Hampshire. I didn't think there was anything unusual about me taking part, but it caused a stir on the starting line, and I realised I was quite a bit older than the other ladies taking part. 'It simply made me all the more determined to prove myself. By the time I finished, I was hooked.' Eighteen months and several triathlons later, Daphne, 53 at the time, was ready for a more extreme event - the ultimate Ironman challenge of a 2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and finally a 26.2 mile run. Daphne almost completed the Ironman Lanzarote in 17 hours. but collapsed just five miles from the finishing line - and immediately decided to sign up for another the following year. She adds: 'They are tough, and at times I feel like my lungs are bursting. I suffer from asthma, so it can be a real challenge. When I feel I can't go on, I push one leg in front of the other - and overcome it. The feeling of exhilaration at the end is worth every moment of pain.' Daphne said: 'They are tough, and at times I feel like my lungs are bursting. I suffer from asthma, so it can be a real challenge. When I feel I can't go on, I push one leg in front of the other - and overcome it' She now tackles ten triathlons a year and runs for the British team. 'Someone said I should publicise my races, to encourage other women of my age group to get fit. I started doing little pieces for the local paper, and sure enough, more women began entering triathlons,' she says. 'Younger women often come up and say “I read about you and decided to try this for myself.” 'Just the other week, when I was competing in a triathlon, a man jogged past me and did a double take. He was red and sweating and he said 'You're the reason I'm suffering like this!' Apparently, he had seen a piece about me on the wall of his gym, and had thought 'If she can do that, so can I!' For 12 years, she has also run free keep-fit classes for women who are complete beginners - working with them for eight weeks to improve their fitness and self-esteem. Daphne says: 'I've helped more than 100 women of all ages improve their fitness and in some cases, it literally transforms their life. Daphne has also coached a swimming group which included disabled athletes, and helped one friend with cerebral palsy who could hardly walk to take her first tentative steps on a track. For 12 years, she has also run free keep-fit classes for women who are complete beginners - working with them for eight weeks to improve their fitness and self-esteem . Daphne says: 'Gradually, she took her first running steps and it was fabulous to watch. Eventually, she completed her own triathlon. To see her delight was worth every second.' In May this year, Daphne broke an arm, a foot and her hand in a fall in Italy. She says: 'I was so cross with myself. I was looking at Mount Etna in the distance when I put my foot in a hole in the ground and fell.' 'We had to hail a taxi and the driver took one look at me and said 'Hospital'. I said 'Oh no you don't!' I didn't want to be trapped in a hospital so far away from home.' So she endured the pain until she returned home three days later. I was so fed up because it meant I couldn't train. So I challenged myself to write a poem every day, to put in a book and sell to raise money for the hospice.' When the plaster came off, Daphne returned to her training and just one month later, represented Great Britain in the Triathlon world championships. Daphne said: 'We're in our 70s, but we're young at heart and we have steel in our soul. Everyone my age is capable of making their mark and helping this world be a far nicer place' Somehow Daphne also manages to care for her 93-year-old bed-bound mother-in-law. She says: 'I don't think that I am extraordinary, but I am part of an extraordinary generation - the absolute backbone of this country. 'We're in our 70s, but we're young at heart and we have steel in our soul. Everyone my age is capable of making their mark and helping this world be a far nicer place.' With a spring in her every step, Daphne is an inspiration to us all.","Dephne Belt from West Sussex will raise £1,000 for a children's hospice .

"By . Amanda Cable . Forget the plain old Easter egg — this season’s chocolate treats are more likely to be flat, soft-centred or pepper-flavoured. Mum-of-three Amanda Cable and her chocolate-loving son Charlie, 12, give their verdicts on some egg-straordinary Easter offerings. WHAT YOU GET: An Easter egg that looks like a fried egg, with a yellow yolk and ‘fried’ white, in a box with small milk chocolate, caramel-filled ‘chips’. AMANDA’S VERDICT: Bite into the white of your ‘fried’ egg and there’s delicious vanilla-flavoured white chocolate. Reach the yolk and the caramel truffle melts. The chips are filled with caramel. A treat that kept us all laughing. CHARLIE’S VERDICT: Funny and tasty and my favourite egg of them all! Normally I don’t eat egg yolk, but I ate this one. WHAT . YOU GET: There’s a real sense of drama as you lift the lid of this . elegant black box and the four cardboard walls open out to reveal a . beautiful dark chocolate velvet-effect egg on a stand. The . egg has been hand-sprayed with matte chocolate. Inside lie six . chocolate ganache-filled speckled eggs on a nest of vanilla-flavoured . edible shredded paper. AMANDA’S . VERDICT: When you crack open the egg (it’s very thick), the incredibly . life-like mini speckled eggs have the softest, most delicious filling . I’ve ever tried. CHARLIE’S VERDICT: This is a clever egg. The taste is more for grown-ups, but eating the straw was awesome! WHAT . YOU GET: A vintage-style box containing a medium milk chocolate egg . with sea salt, and a medium dark chocolate egg with chilli and black . pepper. AMANDA’S . VERDICT: I don’t like dark chocolate, but this egg is a delicious mix of . pepper and cocoa. The crunch of salty milk chocolate in the other egg . was even better. CHARLIE’S . VERDICT: The dark egg tasted too bitter and the pepper made me cough, . though my Dad loved it. The salty egg sounded like a bad idea but they . actually tasted really good together — like having salt on chips. WHAT YOU GET: A flat slab of chocolate in Cinnamon & Waffle or Cookies & Cream flavour. AMANDA’S . VERDICT: I found the flavour too sweet, but the children were quick to . devour theirs, and pointed out that sickly sweet tastes are what Easter . is all about. I think they missed the bit about Jesus. CHARLIE’S VERDICT: Because it was flat, it was easier to stuff loads of chocolate in your mouth at once. WHAT . YOU GET: A beautiful hen coop with pretty chicken wire and doors that . open to reveal milk and dark chocolate speckled eggs inside. So . beautiful you’ll never want to throw it away. AMANDA’S VERDICT: The chocolate melts in your mouth and even the edible ‘straw’ is delicious. A perfect gift for any age. CHARLIE’S . VERDICT: The little eggs are so rich I can tell they are really . expensive and I don’t think these are for kids. At least we had the hen . house to play with. WHAT . YOU GET: A pineapple so realistic that I dare anyone not to do a . double-take. There’s a subtle spray finish in gold and green, hand-made . score marks and a lush green crown made of solid (gorgeous) chocolate. AMANDA’S . VERDICT: When I attempted to break into this, it broke into about 20 . pieces — making me want to cry. This is more like a work of art than an . egg. Rich, tasty chocolate that melts in your mouth, and it comes with a . bag of mini eggs with exotic flavours such as Jamaican pepper and lime . coulis. CHARLIE’S VERDICT: I preferred this to normal pineapples. WHAT . YOU GET: A vintage box wrapped with ribbon, which opens to reveal an . egg wrapped in bright blue foil. Inside the milk chocolate shell . contains four praline quail eggs and four salted caramel seagull eggs — . for whatever mood your teenager wakes up in. AMANDA’S . VERDICT: I tested this on my grumpy 15-year-old daughter and she loved . the box. Inside, the sweet little eggs almost raised a teenage smile. RUBY’S . VERDICT: I think my Mum reckons she’s really funny giving me these . eggs. As if they are just for teenagers! I slammed my door I was so . cross, but actually the eggs are really tasty and the salty ones are . gorgeous. WHAT YOU GET: A stunning red presentation box tied with white and gold ribbon. Inside is a chocolate fish with pink and green decorated scales. AMANDA’S VERDICT: This was really delicious and I appreciated each smooth, rich mouthful — unlike the children. CHARLIE’S VERDICT: My brother and I rowed over who was going to eat which bit. In the end I had the tail, he had the eye and they both tasted really nice. Much nicer than real fish.","Mum-of-three Amanda Cable and her son Charlie, 12, both love chocolate .

"By . Amanda Cable . He's the master of molecular gastronomy — famed for exotic combinations such as snail porridge and bacon-and-egg ice cream. So what happened when Heston Blumenthal decided to cope with the age-old problem of baked beans exploding in a microwave oven? Describing it as ‘his least favourite problem of all microwave cooking’, Heston’s solution was to come up with his own £279.95 ‘intelligent’ microwave. Scroll down for video . Master of molecular gastronomy: What happened when Heston Blumenthal decided to tackle the microwave oven? He claims its sensors scan the food and alter cooking times accordingly, delivering perfection every time. His oven is like other microwaves in that the food heats up from the inside while the oven stays cool. But Heston points out: ‘Foods differ enormously in their water content. Vegetables, for example, are made up of between 85 and 95 per cent water. Meats are about 70 per cent, butter is less than 20, while most cooking chocolate is only 3 per cent water.’ Heston’s microwave — which has just seven buttons and an LCD panel — uses sensors to detect the moisture in each dish, then monitors humidity as it cooks, testing temperature constantly and altering the cycle and heat according to how each dish is reacting. So does it live up to the hype? AMANDA CABLE puts it through its paces. Heston claims the microwaves sensors scan the food and alter cooking times accordingly, delivering perfection every time . COOKING TIME: Three minutes for 120g, at a low temperature. EASE: Really simple. I tell the microwave I’m cooking baked beans, and it sets a low temperature and chooses the cooking time. All I do is press start. TASTE: I can cook dishes for exquisite dinner parties in my Aga — but I’ve always failed to properly heat baked beans in a microwave. They either dry out or explode. Apparently, this is because they’re a tricky combination of high-water-content sauce and lower-water-content bean.I open the door and find a bowl of heated beans that are perfectly, evenly cooked. No coagulation, no split beans and best of all, no exploding baked bean sauce all over the microwave. SCORE: 5/5 . The cooking process required by Heston's microwave is a bit too much of a faff, explains Amanda Cable . COOKING TIME: Four minutes for 50g, at a high then low temperature. EASE: For one portion I weigh the oats, measure 250ml of water (one-part-oats to five-parts-water) and place in a microwave-safe dish with a kitchen towel over it. I select ‘cook oats’, and press start. It cooks for two minutes then, halfway through, it beeps and a message flashes telling me to ‘stir/turn food’. I stir away, then press start again and wait until it finishes, before leaving to stand for three minutes before serving. TASTE: My results are OK, but I haven’t been exact enough with my measuring — the porridge is a little dry. It’s my mistake, but the whole process is a bit of a faff when compared to my usual method of just adding boiling water to oats and stirring on a hob. SCORE: 2/5 . COOKING TIME: Six minutes, 40 seconds for 250g, at a medium temperature. EASE: Heston advises me to cook chicken in a shallow, round, microwave-safe dish, with larger and thicker pieces around the outside. I select chicken, plug in the weight and press start. Halfway through, the oven beeps and the ‘stir/turn food’ light comes on. I turn the chicken, put the microwave-safe plastic wrap back on it, and press start again. TASTE: Any attempt I’ve ever made to cook meat in a microwave before has always ended badly. The cooking time of chicken in Heston’s microwave is calculated to allow for the fact that meat continues to cook for up to five minutes after it comes out of the microwave. And, hey presto! A dish full of moist and succulent chicken pieces — which could have come from my Aga — emerges from the microwave. SCORE: 4/5 . Heston's microwave delivered a jacket potato that Amanda said was the best she ever had . COOKING TIME: Four minutes, ten seconds for 250g, at high temperature. EASE: Pop the potato in the microwave and select ‘cook’, ‘potato’ and the weight. Even I can’t muck this up! TASTE: When the buzzer goes, I wrench the door open with Heston-style enthusiasm and find a soft-skinned potato inside. Is this a fail from Heston? I plunge in a fork expecting to be disappointed — and find perfect, fluffy white flesh. I’ve never ever tasted a jacket potato so good. The flesh inside is so meltingly delicious I can overlook the fact the skin isn’t crunchy. SCORE: 5/5 . COOKING TIME: 45 seconds for 100g, at a low temperature. EASE: For me, softening butter in a microwave has always ended up with a lake of butter. But this is easy. I put the butter in whole, press the ‘soften butter’ button in the door on the shortcuts panel, turn the dial to select weight, and press start. TASTE: Perfectly soft, spreadable butter in less than a minute. I’ve avoided a meltdown! SCORE: 5/5 . The first microwave oven was launched in 1947 - it was the size of a fridge and weighed nearly 750lb . COOKING TIME: Seven minutes, 30 seconds for 350g, at a medium temperature. EASE: I arrange white fish fillets in a shallow dish, fold over the thin fish tails as per Heston’s instructions (to stop them becoming dry) and cover with microwave-safe wrap. Halfway through cooking, the oven tells me to turn the fish. It’s a little fiddly, but I pop it back in the oven. Once cooked, a message on the screen tells me to leave the fish to stand for five minutes, as it continues to cook outside the oven. TASTE: Cooking fish in a microwave usually ends with a curled-up fillet or an unappealing lump of disintegrated fish. This time, one fillet tail has flipped out, and cooked dry as a result. But on the main fillets, the flesh flakes off in delicious pieces. My first happy fishy ending since I saw Finding Nemo. SCORE: 4/5 . COOKING TIME: Seven minutes, 30 seconds for 500g, at a medium-high temperature. EASE: I put the mince into a microwave-safe container, cover with kitchen towel and select ‘cook’ and ‘meat’, plugging in the weight. Halfway through, the ‘stir/turn food’ button flashes and beeps, and I have to stir it to break up the lumps, before finishing cooking. TASTE: Usually, my microwave transforms expensive mince into grey goo. But no — this is broken up, moist and tasty. A first for me! SCORE: 5/5 . Cooking broccoli in the microwave is a winner - as long as you follow Heston's rules . COOKING TIME: Three minutes for 250g, at high temperature. EASE: I cut it into florets, add a tablespoon of water per 100g, cover with kitchen towel, select ‘cook’, ‘soft vegetable’, the weight and hit start. Halfway through, the ‘stir/turn food’ alarm buzzes, and I give it a stir. Easier than a saucepan boiling over. TASTE: I’ve broken Heston’s cardinal rule — always chop veg into even slices. Some are mushy, others too crunchy. Sorry Heston, I’ll try harder next time! SCORE: 3/5 .

"By . Amanda Cable . Do you know a health hero? The Daily Mail, in partnership with Boots and ITV's This Morning, are asking you to nominate special people in the healthcare sector who've made a real difference to your life, or to a loved one. To nominate your health hero, click here. Below, AMANDA CABLE tells one nominee’s story. Fay Calvert treasures the memories of her son Craig's first Christmas in 2006 - the five-month-old gazing in wide-eyed wonder at the fairy lights, reaching past the presents for the scrunchy wrapping paper and laughing in deep throaty gurgles at the antics of his three-year-old brother Peter. It was a joyful, carefree day, and Fay often gets out the photographs and videos which capture the happiness and show Craig's bright blue eyes twinkling with excitement. Support: Dr Fiona Hampton, right, has become like family to Fay Calvert . It was to be their one and only family Christmas together. When he was three weeks old Craig was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a condition where a faulty gene causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with mucus, making it hard to breathe. He had been seriously ill in hospital before Christmas, but Fay had desperately wanted just one normal family day at home with her sons. 'I just fixed on the dream of him waking up in his cot on Christmas morning and showing him the lights on the tree,' she remembers. The magic of that Christmas Day was made possible by a doctor who befriended Fay, a young, single mother from Middlesbrough. Dr Fiona Hampton never left her to fend for herself - and even broke away from her own family celebrations to ring Fay on Christmas Day to check how Craig was coping. 'Dr Hampton knew how important that one day at home was to me, and instead of simply saying he had to stay in hospital - which would, frankly, have made her own life easier - she supported me in arranging for him to come home.' She responded immediately on Boxing Day too, when Fay, 29, was worried about Craig. 'He didn't look well, he turned grey and was struggling to breathe, and when I called Dr Hampton, she met us at the hospital to make sure he was comfortable. She wasn't even supposed to be working, but she came racing to my side. Gone too soon: Craig died in 2007 of Cystic Fibrosis . 'I did ask: ""Does your family mind?"" and she smiled and said ""my husband's a GP and he'd do the same for his patients.""' Dr Hampton had been treating Craig since he was diagnosed shortly after his birth in July 2006. He'd been referred for tests because he struggled to feed and didn't put on weight. He was transferred to the care of Dr Hampton, a respiratory specialist based the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. 'She kept me strong. I had to go home and tell Peter something was wrong with his baby brother, and he asked ""Why can't you just kiss it better?"" I felt as if my heart was breaking. But Dr Hampton made me feel like I could cope with anything. She kept saying: ""We'll try this"", or ""We'll make sure Craig is never in pain.""' The word ""We"" meant I never felt alone.' After his Christmas Day at home, Craig returned to Newcastle General Hospital where he remained until the end of January. In February, 2007, after he was hospitalised again following a series of infections and breathing problems, he became increasingly unwell and Fay was told nothing more could be done. She says: 'I could see it myself, a strange shadow seemed to have settled on Craig's face. He'd had enough of struggling. I rang Dr Hampton and she arranged for him to be transferred by ambulance back to Middlesbrough. 'We gave him a night to recover from the transfer, and at 6am on the Saturday morning, her day off, Dr Hampton walked in,' says Fay. 'She told me that Craig wouldn't feel any pain, and after they switched the ventilator off, I cuddled him. She sat with me and kept telling me he was peaceful. When he died in the early evening, she told me softly ""I'm sorry, Craig's gone,""' 'She hugged me and cried, too. She wasn't my doctor that day - she was my family. 'We bathed Craig and dressed him together, then finally, after no sleep or food for 24 hours, I had to go home to tell Peter his little brother was gone. I couldn't bear the thought of Craig being alone in a hospital mortuary and I begged Dr Hampton not to leave his side. 'She took my hands and promised she wouldn't leave him. I know she waited with Craig for over an hour before the undertaker arrived. The thought of her being by his side remains a real comfort to me. Precious memories: Fay with baby Craig pictured in 2006 . 'Dr Hampton helped my son die a dignified and painless death, then helped me live with the agony of losing him.' It is for this exceptional 24-hour devotion that Fay has nominated Dr Fiona Hampton, 57, for a Health Heroes award. But the doctor herself, who has no children and lives in Great Ayton with GP husband Chris Ankcorn, insists she is merely doing her job: . 'I simply set out to treat patients the way I would want my own family to be treated. Medicine really isn't a career for anyone who wants a nine-to-five job. I am about to retire, and there are so many children and families who stick in my mind and will stay in my memory always.' All in a day's work: The doctor said she tries to treat patients how she would want her family to be treated . But despite Dr Hampton's modest protestations that she is simply 'doing her job', other families agree that she has thrown them a lifeline, too. Nicola Simmons, 41, from Redcar, Cleveland, is mother to 15-year-old Hannah, who has been under Dr Hampton's care almost all her life. Nicola, is a single mother to Alice, 18, and Matilda, 14 weeks. Hannah, who has a rare neurological condition which affects the optic nerve and spinal cord, first became ill when she was five months old. 'I remember Dr Hampton coming into the room, picking her up and running into another ward to ventilate her. Then, she gave me a hug and told me exactly what was happening in a calm, reassuring way. From that moment on, she has given us constant care and attention which has gone way beyond anything I've ever known from any other doctor. 'In 2006, Hannah lost her sight and became completely paralysed as a result of the condition. She's also needed ventilation on and off throughout her life, and Dr Hampton just sits on her bed and chats to her, and comes to Hannah's birthday parties at our house. 'Hannah can't travel abroad, but whenever Dr Hampton has been on holiday she comes racing in and says: ""Guess what Han, I saw penguins..."" Hannah just adores her, and the stories become her stories to tell. She'll say: ""Guess what Mum, Fiona saw the penguins."" ""When I heard Dr Hampton is retiring, I actually burst into tears. There's been so many hugs, so many late-night phone calls, so much support over the years.' Fay will also miss the doctor, who kept in contact with her family after baby Craig died. 'When I had my youngest son, Archie, four years later, I was terrified he also had cystic fibrosis, even though blood tests said he was free of the genetic condition. 'I rang her in a terrible state and she arranged to see Archie and ran a series of tests to put my mind at ease. It was only when she reassured me he was all right that I was finally able to relax and enjoy being a mum again. 'I have such happy memories of Craig. The fact that I do, and that I've coped with such loss is down to Dr Hampton. She tried to save him - and she managed to save me.'","Dr Fiona Hampton supported Fay Calvert when her son was was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis .

"By . Amanda Cable . Do you know someone inspirational? The search for the 2013 winner is on . The Daily Mail is proud to be running the seventh Inspirational Women of the Year Awards, in association with British Gas and homelessness charity Shelter. Over the next weeks, we want you to nominate special women who deserve recognition. Here, AMANDA CABLE tells the story of one remarkable nominee. Her night had ended triumphantly and she went to sleep happy. Yet again, singer Erin McNeill, 18, had given a wonderful performance on stage. Today, she still has vivid memories of that evening - the adrenaline, the applause, her dreams of a career as a recording artist. Sadly, those dreams were not to be. As she drifted off to sleep on Valentine's Day, 2009, fire swept through the friend's house where Erin - poised to sign her first record contract - was sleeping. The blaze, probably caused by a pot left on the stove, reached a temperature of 600 degrees. When Erin was rescued by firefighters her life hung in the balance. She suffered third degree burns to 45 per cent of her body. Her right arm had fourth-degree burns, meaning the damage was so severe it reached her muscles. Lucky to be alive: Erin suffered third degrees burns after fire swept through a house as she slept . The schoolgirl's parents, roofing company manager Edward and school patrol supervisor Jean, both now aged 63, arrived at the local hospital in the early hours, to be told their youngest child was unlikely to survive. Erin, now 23, says: 'When my mum saw me, she couldn't even recognise me. My body had swollen so much as a result of the burns, I had gone from a size eight to a size 22. I was covered in wires and tubes, and the doctors told her to gather other family members to say goodbye.' She was transferred to a specialist burns unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, but infection set in and she suffered five cardiac arrests. Her life was only saved by a £60,000 specialist 'shark' skin treatment, that uses shark cartilage to replace lost skin and prevent skin moisture loss and infection. When she woke from a medically induced coma seven weeks later, Erin was confronted by the devastating extent of her injuries. Dark times: At first, the teen felt sorry for herself and wished nurses and fire fighters hadn't saved her . 'I tried to speak, but couldn't make a sound as my vocal cords had been damaged. I tried to raise my hand, but my arms wouldn't move. I couldn't feel my legs and remember thinking ""I've lost all my limbs"",' says Erin. 'A single tear ran down my face, but I couldn't move to wipe it away.' When she finally managed to raise her arm weeks later, her hand was, as she describes it, 'a twisted claw'. As Erin spent months in hospital having painful skin grafts, the effect her injuries would have on her life hit home. 'I'd gone from a rather selfish but totally independent teenager to a shuffling ghost, who needed to learn how to walk, talk and hold a spoon,' she says. 'Other people had to help bathe me and feed me. I lost every shred of my dignity. One day, I lost my temper too - and turned on a nurse. I remember angrily croaking ""Why didn't you just let me die? You've turned me into a toddler again"". Support: She now helps other burns victims through their ordeal . 'She walked away. I later found out she was used to such anger from frustrated patients. 'I felt terribly sorry for myself, and my family. I thought of everything I had lost. I had sung all my life. Now, my vocal chords were so damaged I could only whisper short sentences. It seemed so cruel.' Erin learned to talk, feed and dress herself again, returning to the house in Menstrie, Scotland, she shared with friends in time for her 19th birthday in August 2009, six months after the fire. 'My relatives all came, but it was agony seeing them. My cousin wore a glittery pair of high heels. I was upset as I knew I wouldn't be able to wear high heels again because of the damage to my legs. I couldn't even wear make-up because my arms weren't strong enough to apply it. My birthday was the one day I wanted to be dressed up and made-up and happy, but I couldn't.' 'I told the children what happened to me, and said none of us should discriminate against anyone who looks different' But over the weeks, Erin slowly began to realise how lucky she was to be alive. She thought about what she had left: her life, a family who loved her, loyal friends. She also thought of the firemen, who'd braved the inferno to save her. 'I went to thank the firefighters and the man, in his early 40s, who had carried me out of the fire was clearly quite traumatised by the events that night,' she says. 'He had found me unconscious, making the sound firemen call a “death gurgle” - which meant I was within ten seconds of dying. He relived this day in day out, and it shocked me from my torpor. I decided to dedicate my life to the firefighters who saved me. 'Soldiers who go to the frontline quite rightly have charities to support them. Firefighters face death and trauma every day, and yet there is little to help them.' Erin vowed to raise money for firefighters, despite the appalling aftermath of her injuries and her 15 operations since the fire. At the time she talked in a whisper, couldn't walk well and had weeping burns that made dressing agony. Nerve damage left her fingers clawed and she could not even pick up a cup of tea. Shock had made her hair fall out. Confident: Erin has won beauty pageants . Despite this, on the anniversary of the fire Erin held a Valentine's Day Gala, which netted £9,000 for the local fire service. She has since raised a total of £90,000 for causes, including the Glasgow Royal Infirmary burns unit and a local hospice. Brave Erin recently ran 5km to raise money for the British Red Cross. 'It was agony because of my muscle weakness, but worth every step,' she recalls. Erin is also working with the fire service, visiting schools. 'I would sit beside the fire safety officer with my cardigan on,' she says. 'Then, I would take the cardigan off to show my scars. I told the children what happened to me, and said none of us should discriminate against anyone who looks different. 'One day, a little boy said ""My brother is disabled and I don't like it when people point and laugh. But if you can face everyone, I know that I can too"". 'A girl did die in the fire that night - the old me - and it made me stronger and better' 'The teacher told me later he had never been able to discuss his brother before. ""You've changed his life today,"" she said.' Erin also mentors young burns survivors in hospital. She says: 'One, Kyle, suffered 80 per cent burns in a gas explosion and was refusing to take his medicine. He was 18, and felt his life was over. I marched in and said bluntly ""If you want to get out of this hospital, take that medicine"". 'I was another young person, so he listened. When he left hospital, I cared for him at home for a week to give his mother a break. 'I was exhausted by caring for him, but felt so lucky. The fire had changed me from a selfish teenager to someone who really understood the meaning of love.' While struggling to come to terms with the scaring, Erin also began to enter beauty pageants. 'I wanted to show beauty is something on the inside too, and scars don't take away a person’s beauty or dignity,' she explains. Brave: Burns victim Erin has dedicated her life to volunteering . 'Last November I won the United Nations International Pageant in Jamaica. I stood on the podium, baring my scars, and thought ""I hope there's someone out there who will see scars don't take away your life"".' After her win, Erin was abused by online trolls. One even phoned to tell her: 'You deserve to die'. 'A girl did die in the fire that night - the old me - and it made me stronger and better,' she says. In 2012, Erin won the British Red Cross Humanitarian Citizen Award for her volunteering. She now has a boyfriend Thomas, 20, a car valet. On their first date, her arms covered, she asked him to Google her to see her scars. 'I could tell instantly he was going to be OK with it. He sees me - not my burns,' says Erin. At night, Erin has a recurring dream: 'I'm belting out a Mariah Carey classic on stage in Las Vegas. Then I wake - and remember that I'll never sing again.'

"By . Amanda Cable . Determined: Jess Bacon, 16, went to sit her GCSEs just hours after her father died . On the first day of her GCSEs in May, 16-year-old Jess Bacon kissed her father goodbye, put on her school uniform and headed off to the exam hall. Anyone who'd seen Jess's wan face that morning might have assumed it was down to pre-exam nerves. But only a few hours earlier, she had been sitting with her beloved father, Martin - a teacher - as he drew his last breath. He was just 46 and died after battling a brain tumour. The gentle kiss on his cheek that morning had been Jess's final farewell. A few hours later, she was sitting her first paper. 'My studies had mattered so much to Dad. He was so determined he was going to live long enough for me to finish my GCSEs,' says Jess. 'The very least I could do for him was keep calm and do my best, regardless of what had just happened. 'Normally I find exams terrifying, but I felt a strange calmness that day.' Her fortitude in the midst of intense grief, is, she says, a reflection of the support her family received from the Sue Ryder hospice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, where her father's last days were spent surrounded by laughter and love. 'Walking away from him after he died was the hardest thing I've ever had to do,' says Jess. 'But he found peace at Thorpe Hall Hospice - and so did we. 'You can't sit and think ""Why me? Life isn't fair"", when you are among people who make you feel full of hope and surrounded by love, as we were at the hospice. 'The kindness of the volunteers was astonishing. Dad became unsteady on his feet, and one night when he was alone in his hospice room, he thought he heard someone calling for help. He tried to get  out of bed to go to them, and fell. 'After that, we didn't want him to be on his own at night. Mum said she would be there every evening, but the volunteers drew up a rota among themselves. 'From that moment on, incredible people - retired grandmothers, nurses who had already finished a 12-hour shift at the local hospital - took it in turns to be by his bedside night after night. Happier times: Jess with father Martin, mother Kathleen, and brother Josh . 'One lovely lady was in her thirties and had a young baby. She must have had constant nights of broken sleep at home, but every week, would give up one of them to chat and read to patients. Another had seen her own mother pass away at the hospice, and now came in for the night shift. The volunteers never asked for praise or thanks, but the kindness of these strangers was awe-inspiring.' Before Martin's illness, the Bacon family had a happy life  together in Peterborough. Their mother, Kathleen, was a teacher, and Jess and her younger brother Josh, went to the local school where Martin once taught. Jess smiles at the memory of those days, and says: 'Dad had always been incredibly enthusiastic and was always joking. At the end of each week, he'd come home and say ""It's that Friday night feeling everyone!""' But last spring, super-fit Martin, who regularly did charity runs and triathlons, began suffering from appalling headaches. As wife Kathleen, 46, recalls: 'He became more and more tired. For weeks, he suffered from crippling headaches which didn't seem to shift with painkillers. Martin had never even taken a day off sick, and always leapt out of bed at 5.15 am to go for a jog. But his energy had vanished.' He kept working, but in July after weeks of terrible migraines, he had one that lasted for three days and made him vomit. Kathleen took him to A&E. Fond memories: Jess with her father Martin, before he moved to Thorpe Hall hospice . Martin had a brain scan, and shortly afterwards doctors told them there was a large tumour in Martin's brain which would need to be removed. It was devastating news - but worse was to come. Three days later, a surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge explained the tumour was almost as big as a fist. He could remove 90 per cent of it, but Martin would then need radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, before he had surgery, Martin collapsed and a new scan revealed there was bleeding around his tumour. A seven-hour operation saved his life, but he developed an infection. More emergency surgery was required. A month later the two were given more bad news. Kathleen says: 'We were told Martin had just nine to 12 months to live. It was devastating. I wept, but Martin was so brave. He believed in God and said he wasn't scared. We decided not to tell the children it was terminal, but to say it was aggressive.' Even that news was terrifying, says Jess. 'We all cried, but it wasn't long before Dad was joking again. Things like, ""Well, I always have been unique! Trust me to get the worse tumour possible!"" Just before Christmas, he was told he had even more tumours in his brain, and his reaction was ""I'd better make a collection of them!"".' Despite the family's  attempts at positivity, in January, just as he prepared for chemotherapy, doctors found he had a tumour on his spine. 'We were told Martin had just nine to 12 months to live,' says Kathleen. 'It was devastating. I wept, but Martin was so brave.' His mobility rapidly worsened, and it became apparent Martin needed more care than his family could give. At their Macmillan nurse's recommendation, Martin moved to Thorpe Hall in April. Martin remained calm. But his family were in turmoil. 'Mum and Dad told us in January, he wasn't going to get better,' says Jess. 'Dad was determined not to die at home, because he didn't want us to walk into a room and think, ""This is where Dad passed away."" 'But Dad absolutely loved the hospice. He just felt so welcome and at ease there. It made it far easier for the rest of us. Everyone was so welcoming. 'Dad, of course, was still laughing and joking. A lady came into Dad's room and announced she did complementary massage, and Dad replied 'Is that legal?' We all collapsed laughing. 'Josh saw Dad every day after school. I spent my study leave at Thorpe Hall, doing my revision. 'After a while, everyone knew us by name. We'd walk down the corridor and staff would hug us.' As Martin weakened, the family spent more time at the hospice. 'Josh's 14th birthday was in April. He had planned to spend it with friends, but didn't want to leave Dad. So the nurses and volunteers baked Josh a birthday cake for us all to share.' Jess says, unlike in many hospitals, where staff are rushed off their feet, 'at the hospice, nobody was too busy to chat.' Emotions were high, however. Grieving: Husband and father Martin passed away at the hospice, leaving his family behind . 'One day, it all became too much for me. But then a volunteer called Ursula told me: ""He's still here now and you can talk to him - towards the end of someone's life they are in a coma, and you won't get that chance again. So spend that time together now."" 'I went back to Dad's bed, took his hand in mine, and just sat talking to him. I will forever be grateful for her advice.' As Martin deteriorated, the family moved into his room, all sleeping on mattresses on the floor. Jess says: 'We've always done everything together, the four of us. The doctors let us know what was happening at each stage. I knew they'd give me an honest answer to anything I asked. 'We had hoped Dad would come home, but in the end he only spent three weeks at the hospice. 'He was just sleeping in his last week, but we stayed with him, holding his hands, kissing him, and talking through all the wonderful family memories . 'It was so peaceful and quiet, and a time to reflect together as a family. I don't think we'd have ever had that privacy, or the chance to just be together, in a hospital setting. It meant that nothing was left unsaid. Christmas Appeal: Support the Sue Ryder hospice's good works by donating . 'The morning Dad passed away was the hardest. We gave him a kiss, and it was really difficult for us all to leave the room. But Mum explained it was his body that was left behind, and his soul had left. 'I went home and had an hour and-a-half to pull myself together and put my school uniform on.' Jess was awarded 2 A*s, 4 As and 6 Bs in her GCSEs and is currently studying for her A-levels. Along with her mother and brother, Jess continues to visit the hospice and receive counselling. She says: 'It became a home, and it helped us through the toughest point of our lives. I'll never forget the love there was for Dad - and all of us. 'The day Dad died, Josh baked cakes, then went back to the hospice and handed them around. It was just hours after Dad had died, but it was the best way Josh could think of to say thanks.' Martin, the father who joked until the end alongside the family he adored, would be so proud.","The Bacon family had a happy family life together .
But then father Martin was diagnosed with a fatal brain tumour .
His family couldn't look after him, so they moved him to Thorpe Hall .
They were overwhelmed by the kindness of the hospice's volunteers .
Thorpe Hall became a 'home' for the Bacon family .
And it gave Jess the courage she needed to complete her exams ."
"By . Amanda Cable . Spring clean: Amanda was impressed with Aldi's washing up liquid . Scroll down for video . When it comes to cleaning products, it takes a lot to persuade us away from Dettol, Domestos and Febreze. But last week Lidl's dishwasher tablets beat the brand favourite Finish in a consumer test. So which other own-label cleaning products are as good as the big names? AMANDA CABLE pulled on her rubber gloves to find out... BIG NAME: Fairy Liquid Original, £1.50 for 530ml . BEST OWN BRAND: Aldi Magnum, 59p for 500ml . VERDICT: I put them through their paces with plates that had contained lasagne, greasy roasting trays and even the dog bowls. Aldi offers the biggest bubbles, most effective wash and best value. A plain green liquid with no added frills such as perfume or moisturiser, which can mean more money has been spent on the cleaning ingredients themselves. In 2011, Which? found that a 59p bottle of Magnum will wash 11,750 plates. I couldn't face testing this out to the last dish - but I DID squirt Magnum into a bowl of dishes next to an identical bowl of dishes and Fairy. Eight hours later, the Magnum bubbles were still there, beating Fairy. SAVING PER ITEM: 91p (though you get 30ml more Fairy) ALSO TRY: The Co-operative Simply Value Washing Up Liquid, 35 pence for 500ml - much cheaper but bubbles don’t last quite as long. BIG NAME: Dettol Surface Cleanser Spray, £2 for 500ml . BEST OWN BRAND: Sainsbury’s antibacterial multi-surface spray, £1.35 for 500ml . VERDICT: I swear by Dettol, and found many own brands tended to foam when squirted, but the Sainsbury's version squirted strongly to reach corners and cleaned muddy dog paws on skirting boards with ease. No smearing, no mess left - but a saving of £2.60 a month, if you get through a bottle a week like I do. SAVING PER ITEM: 65p . ALSO TRY: Tesco Antibacterial Cleaner Spray with Byotrol, £1.30 for 500ml - it just slightly lacks the Sainsbury's power. Budget buy: Our writer could save £2.60 a month by switching to Sainsbury's surface cleaner instead of Dettol . BIG NAME: Finish Quantum Lemon Sparkle Dishwaster Tablets (30 pack), £12 . BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Citrus Burst All in 1 Dishwasher Tablets (30 pack), £3.50 . VERDICT: The success of Lidl's own-brand dishwasher tablets made headline news when they scooped a Which? Best Buy awards, beating my usual brand Finish. I was stunned to find that Asda's All-in-1 dishwasher tablets - which cost a quarter of the price of the market leaders - are also just as good. After a tough roast dinner, I could spot my reflection in every piece of silver cutlery, and even my glasses were shining - all for 11p per tablet. SAVING PER ITEM: £8.50 . ALSO TRY: Lidl W5 All-in-1 Dishwasher tablets, £3.99 for 40 - or 10p per wash. BIG NAME: Lord Sheraton Caretaker Furniture Polish, £1.58 for 300ml . BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Multi Surface Furniture Polish, 80p for 300ml . VERDICT: Big-name polish brands actually oil the wood, as well as polishing it - and none of the cheaper own brands manage to do this. But a friend who cleans for a famous museum in London, which boasts oak panelled walls and ornate antique wooden furniture swears by the Asda alternative. So I happily tried this 80p spray on my own maple kitchen units and oak dining table. There's no smearing or sticky residue and it collects the dust well. Use most days, and save your big name brands for a once a month super-shine. SAVING PER ITEM: 78p . ALSO TRY: Morrisons Classic Furniture Polish, 80p for 250ml - same price as Asda, just slightly less in the can. Can't tell the difference: Asda's toilet roll was as soft and strong as Andrex . BIG NAME: Andrex Classic White Roll (four rolls) £2.10 . BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Shades (four rolls) £1.78 . VERDICT: There’s . been a huge variation in quality of budget toilet paper in the past, . and some - such as the Co-operative own brand which is rough and cheap - . are still really inferior. But . others are working hard to match the market leaders. I can't tell the . difference between my usual Andrex and the cheaper Asda alternative, . which is just as soft and strong. There . aren't great savings here - in upping the quality of their budget roll, . supermarkets have also increased the price. But the average person uses . 30 toilet rolls a year, which means for a family of five, 150 rolls at . year. So any saving - even just 32p per packet of four - is a bonus. SAVING PER ITEM: 32 pence . ALSO TRY: Waitrose . Pure White toilet roll (4 rolls) £1.80 - also marvellous quality, and . nobody will realise it is a cash-saving alternative to Andrex. BIG NAME: Domestos Thick Bleach, £1.25 for 750ml . BEST OWN BRAND: Lidl W5 Thick Bleach, 55p for 750ml . VERDICT: Lidl won a Good Housekeeping accreditation in 2013 for its bleach. Famous brands like Domestos ARE better at sticking to the sides of the toilet and sink, cleaning for longer. Our own brand alternatives are slightly thinner, but clean almost as well. I get through a bottle of bleach a week cleaning up after a family of five - so if I switch to Lidl I save £2.80 a month. A big saving for a slight difference in quality. SAVING PER ITEM: 70p . ALSO TRY: Morrisons M Original Bleach, 75p for 750ml — Morrisons is working hard on its own brands: the results are terrific. BIG NAME: Cif Cream Lemon Fresh, £2.50 for 500ml . BEST OWN BRAND: Lidl W5 Cream Cleaner Lemon Fresh, 99p for 750ml . VERDICT: I used Lidl's cream to clean the bath and sink, but found it needs more rinsing than big brand name Cif. I noticed there was a difference here — pay more, and you save yourself the extra work. All of our own budget brand cream cleaners required more elbow grease than the big name brands. A switch not worth making, in my opinion. SAVING PER ITEM: £1.51 (though you get more Lidl cleaner) ALSO TRY: Sainsbury's cream cleaner, 80p for 750ml - a good budget alternative. Scrubbing up well: Asda floor cleaner was almost as good as Cif . BIG NAME: Cif Ocean All Purpose Floor Cleaner Liquid, £2.50 for 1 litre . BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Smartprice All Purpose Liquid Cleaner, 25p for 1 litre . VERDICT: The arrival of two dogs has made my life - and my floor - very messy. I get through a bottle of floor cleaner each week, which costs me £52 a year for my usual brand, Cif. But a simple switch to Asda’s budget Liquid Cleaner gives me a massive 90 per cent saving.  It wasn't too runny and didn't smell cheap and nasty, and cleaned almost as well. SAVING PER ITEM: 2.25p . ALSO TRY: Sainsbury's Floor Cleaner, £1.40 for 1 litre. BIG NAME: Persil Powder, £12 for 4.25kg . OWN BRAND: Lidl Formil Washing Powder (Colour/2-in-1/non bio), £6.19 for 4.875kg . VERDICT: My favourite brand Persil costs 24p per wash - and is worth every penny. The colour doesn't run and despite his sensitive skin, my son Charlie doesn't get a rash. I know from bitter experience that cheaper powders contain cheaper ingredients and are more likely to irritate skin. Cheaper powder doesn’t rinse as well and can leave white powder marks on your clothes in a coloured wash. But the fantastic Lidl powder costs just 12p per wash and brings none of my children up in a rash. There's no cheap after-smell, and when I tried it on muddy PE kit on a 40 degree wash, it worked wonders. I run two washes a day - so this makes a massive difference to my housekeeping budget. A winner. SAVING PER ITEM: £5.81 . ALSO TRY: Sainbury’s 2-in-1 Washing Powder, £5 for 4kg - nice fragrance. Great for towels and sheets. BIG NAME: Vanish Stain Remover Powder for Colours £4.60 for 500g . BEST OWN BRAND: Sainsbury’s Stain Remover Powder for Colours £2.49 for 500g . Half price: Sainsbury's stain remover does the job and is cheaper than Vanish . VERDICT: Anybody with a football-playing husband and equally muddy dogs requires a jar of stain remover. Vanish . has always worked brilliantly for me, but with a hefty price tag of . £4.60. I was thrilled to find that the cut-price Sainsbury version, . which is an astonishing £2.11 cheaper - performs just  as well. SAVING PER ITEM: £2.11 . ALSO TRY: Aldi Almat Stain lift, £2.39 for 2kg . BIG NAME: Lenor Fabric Conditioner, £2.20 for 750ml . BEST OWN BRAND: Waitrose Meadow Fabric Conditioner, £1.25 for 750ml . VERDICT: Big name brands such as Lenor and Comfort are thicker than the own brand alternatives. Cheaper fabric conditioners don't leave a long lasting smell, but they soften clothes just as well. I found myself using a tiny bit more - so in the long run, won't always pay. My pick of the own brands, though, is the Waitrose 'Meadow' fabric conditioner - a truly gorgeous and fresh smell. SAVING PER ITEM: 95p . ALSO TRY: Asda Moonflower & Ylang Fabric Conditioner, £1.20 for 750ml - Asda really have got their fragrances spot on. This is simply delicious. Big savings: Amanda found the cheaper products were worth buying . QUALITY: Cif Easy Life Bathroom Cleaner Spray,  £2.98 for  750ml . BEST OWN BRAND: Sainsbury's Bathroom Cleaner with trigger spray, £1.25 for 500ml. VERDICT: Be careful with cheaper spray cleaners. I squirted a Waitrose cleaner into the corner of the shower unit, and some of the foam flew out, bleaching my T-shirt in the process. Sainsbury's own brand trigger bottles don’t compromise on quality at all, cleaning beautifully - and this one was even cheaper than the equally impressive Asda version. SAVING PER ITEM: £1.73 (though you get 250ml more Cif) ALSO TRY: Asda Bathroom Cleaner Spray,  £1.50 for 750ml - no smears here, despite the price.","Last week Lidl's dishwasher tablets beat Finish .

So which other own-label cleaning products are as good as the big names?"
"By . Amanda Cable . The search for 2013's winner is over . The Daily Mail is proudly running its seventh Inspirational Women of the Year Awards, in association with British Gas and the charity Shelter. Over the coming weeks, we want you to nominate the special women who deserve to be recognised. Here, we tell the story of one of our remarkable nominees . . . As soon as the telephone rang at 1am on August 12, 2000, Claire Maitland knew her life was about to irreparably change. 'My husband Robin answered, and I remember lying in dread,' she recalls. 'I thought, “Nobody ever rings at this hour unless something terrible has happened”. 'I looked at Robin, and could tell from his face our world had been ripped apart.' On the phone was Claire's brother with the news her beloved 14-year-old nephew Sandy - a curly haired, freckle-faced boy with a cheeky smile - had drowned. 'I was paralysed with grief. I thought of his insatiable desire to climb trees, ride horses and scale mountains. I'd never known a boy to love life so much.' Sandy Dickson had been holidaying in Canada with his grandmother Julia and cousin Ben when he joined a group of youngsters swimming in a remote lake in Ontario. Amid the high jinks, Sandy had lost consciousness. A helicopter had gone to the isolated spot, but medics were too late to save him. Legacy: Claire setup the Sandpiper Trust in memory of her nephew Sandy, whose death in a tragic accident could have been prevented if medics had reached him in time . At Sandy's funeral at home near Dunblane, the children wore brightly coloured rugby shirts, his favourite sport. 'But Sandy's parents and the rest of our close family were plunged into a black hole of grief,' recalls Claire, 54. 'For months, we just existed. I couldn't stop thinking about Sandy's accident - and the remoteness of the lake where he drowned. 'I thought: “What if the same thing had happened in Scotland? Who would have been the first to reach him, and would they have been able to help?” ' In fact, often GPs and nurse volunteers are the first to reach casualties or extremely sick patients. While ambulance responders in Scotland are provided with emergency equipment by the NHS, GPs and nurses who first attend the scene are not. 'I started asking local doctors how well equipped they were to cope with accidents or critical illnesses in remote country areas. Their responses chilled me. Many GPs had no defibrillators - a machine that delivers an electric shock to the heart when someone is in cardiac arrest. 'One doctor said: “I dread hearing the words Is there a doctor in the house?, because I don't have the equipment to help anyone.” I realised more people like Sandy would die because of this critical lack of equipment. It started the tiniest seed of an idea.' Tragedy: Sandy was 14-years-old when he died - since then his aunt has sought to change how emergency care operates in remote areas . She adds: 'One morning in February my sister Penny rang, very tearful, saying she did not know what to do with the rest of her life.' 'Something clicked and I suggested starting a trust in Sandy's memory. Two weeks later, we decided we wanted to provide vital medical equipment that on-call local doctors and nurses lacked in regional Scotland and the far-flung isles. 'I remember agreeing that if we could stop one family losing a loved one, it would be worth it.'In fact, the Sandpiper Trust has helped to supply life-saving equipment for 2,000 emergencies a year. It worked with emergency doctors to design the distinctive blue Sandpiper Bag - containing 50 items of vital medical equipment, such as CPR face masks, mini tracheotomy kits, airway masks and stiff neck collars - to cover accidents and medical emergencies. Nine hundred bags, costing £1,000 each, have been distributed to GPs and nurses throughout Scotland, and medics on islands where no 999 services exist. With NHS funds stretched, many doctors had to buy their own defibrillators, or rely simply on CPR. So as well as blue equipment bags, the Sandpiper Trust has provided 48 defibrillators, at a cost of £1,000 each. Vital equipment, such as Pulse oximeters - machines that measure the level on oxygen in a patient's bloodstream - and canulas to give them fluid and blood, are provided and re-stocked as part of the Sandpiper Bags. Crucially, the trust has also provided 80 vehicle locators, costing £1,000. These are radio units  placed into doctors' cars or carried with them, and work like tracking devices, allowing emergency dispatch centres to immediately locate the nearest available GP. With 3,000 call-outs in the past 18 months alone, and £1.5 million raised in total, it means countless lives have been changed or saved. Claire, a former veterinary nurse,  says: 'I set up office at our home in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, so I could work as my four children - then 14, ten, nine and eight - did homework and played. I was horrified to learn that just one needle, to put an intravenous line into the arm of a patient, cost up to £70. Young promise: Sandy loved to ride horses, climb trees, scale mountains . 'We launched in February 2001 and with Penny and her husband I arranged school fetes, cake sales, garden openings and quiz nights. 'In August 2001, a year after losing Sandy, we presented the first seven Sandpiper Bags. It felt like such an achievement. The following year, I organised a clay pigeon shoot, golf weekend and dinner, which raised £70,000.' One of the many lives the trust has saved is Laura Anderson, 39, an oil company analyst, who was driving to work in a rainstorm on September 4, 2009. Laura, from Aberdeen, recalls: 'It was 7am and I remember the car skidding into a lamp-post. 'I was trapped by both legs. When the fire engine arrived, they cut the roof off the car and I suddenly felt very sleepy.' A volunteer doctor, consultant anaesthetist Mark Bloch, arrived with a Sandpiper Bag. Mark, 47, recalls: 'I kept her airway open, using a specialist laryngeal mask provided by the trust. With no ambulance able to reach us in the extreme conditions, it was the only way to keep her breathing. She would have died before the ambulance arrived. 'It took the ambulance an hour to reach us because of the conditions. I later saw Laura in intensive care, and told her the equipment that saved her life had been provided by a remarkable woman who sits at her kitchen table. 'Week in, week out, I save lives using the equipment that Claire provides. If I have a bad day - recently three young people died - Claire finds time to ring and ask if I'm OK. She's fuelled by adrenaline and compassion.' Laura, who now has a four-month-old son, says: 'Two years ago, I was with friends in remote mountains, when we saw a terrible accident involving two motorcyclists. A local GP was tending to them with a Sandpiper Bag. I pointed it out and said: “That's what saved my life, too.” Seeing the bags in action was incredibly emotional.' Gillian McKenzie's three children have Claire to thank for their mummy's hugs. On November 6, 2012, when baby Sula was ten weeks old, 42-year-old Gillian suffered a cardiac arrest. Gillian, from Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, says: 'My six-year-old son Struan fetched my neighbour, who realised I wasn't breathing.' Heroine: Claire pictured with the distinctive blue Sandpiper Bag containing essential medical equipment to cover accident sand medical emergencies . Neighbours desperately began CPR, but the arrival of a GP with a Sandpiper defibrillator saved Gillian. After two shocks, her heart began beating.'I met Claire for tea several months later, and we wept in each other's arms,' she says. Claire's tireless fundraising - she starts work at 8am each day and is unpaid - is achievement enough. But she also volunteers as a ChildLine counsellor, and is patron of a hospice. Incredibly, she works through the agony of constant and debilitating migraines, which attack on average 17 days each month. 'My migraines drive me on because they make me angry. But they affect my balance and vision,' she says. Three years ago, she organised a huge charity night, which raised £100,000. 'The morning after, I had a migraine so bad that my husband dialled 999 and I was blue-lighted in an ambulance because they thought it might be meningitis.' She spent five days in hospital - then returned to work. The Sandpiper Bag is now so well-known that dozens of requests from other countries are flooding in. 'Sandy would have been 27 now. I often wonder what he would look like, what he'd be doing with his life or who he might have ended up with. 'The only thing I know is he would have been so proud a trust in his memory has saved so many lives.' sandpipertrust.org .

"By . Amanda Cable . Wished you could Hoover early in the morning but don't want to wake the whole house up? Or want to pop the washing machine on at night but don't want to keep your neighbours awake? Such dilemmas could soon be a thing of the past, as the launch of the world's quietest vacuum heralds a wave of 'silent' gadgets. Here, FEMAIL puts them to the test . . . Hoping to do an early morning wash but worried about waking the whole house up? There's a hush-hush solution . HAIRDRYER . Ghd Air, £99.95, Decibels: 55  (compared with average of 80) Hairstylists love this hairdryer because they can still talk over its hum . WHAT IT CLAIMS: . Improved motor technology means the average noise level of a hairdryer has been reduced from 100 decibels ten years ago to 80 or fewer -  the level of a standard telephone dial tone and slightly quieter than the noise of city traffic from inside a sealed car. At 55 decibels, this is little more than a steady hum, which allows you to talk as you dry. AMANDA'S VERDICT: Hairstylists working behind the scenes at catwalk shows love this dryer because they can still speak over the small but powerful 2,100-watt motor, which has two heat settings. I chatted to a friend happily while I dried my hair. The downside is that I became distracted and ended up with a 'do' like Einstein. RATING: Perfect - especially if, like me, you have a teenage daughter who seems to use the hairdryer all day. 8/10 . Stylish - but, at £120, a costly way to buy a little peace and quiet . KETTLE . Kitchenaid Artisan, £119.95, Decibels: 60 (average 80) WHAT IT CLAIMS: Has a dual- wall construction like a Thermos flask, with two skins and airspace inside that traps the sound and stops the angry bubbling noises made by most rapid-boil kettles. AMANDA'S VERDICT: So stylish I could happily forgive it for whistling louder than Thomas The Tank Engine. But I flick the button, wait for the boil crescendo and - nothing. There is a low, constant sound but not the angry bubbling I'm used to. Does kettle noise actually bother me, though? At nearly £120 this is a costly way to buy a little peace and quiet. RATING: The Kim Kardashian of kettles - gorgeous but expensive! 6/10 . It's not the smallest or lightest of hoovers, but it is very quiet . VACUUM CLEANER . Bosch GS-50 Power Silence, £249.99,  Decibels: 66 (average 86) WHAT IT CLAIMS: The quietest vacuum cleaner on the market - so quiet you can vacuum when the children are in bed and the TV is on. A new motor compresses the air intake to reduce sound. AMANDA'S VERDICT: I scoffed at the TV ad showing a scientist wheeling this new-fangled vacuum around a sleeping tiger. But I tried it out at home while Dylan, our spaniel cross, lay sleeping. He has a terror of vacuum cleaners, which means any vaccuming noise is made worse by the sound of his barking. But he didn't wake once. Compared with my faithful Henry vacuum, this sounded as if it was producing half as much noise. It's not the smallest or lightest model but would be perfect for anyone who lives in a flat or shares a house. No screech, and no scattering of children holding their ears . RATING: At last you can watch EastEnders and vacuum at the same time. 10/10 . FOOD MIXER . Magimix cuisine 5200xl Premium, £369.99, Decibels: 70 (average 90) WHAT IT CLAIMS: The quietest food processor around. Even on the chopping function, there is just a gentle whirr. Winner of a prestigious Quiet Mark award from the Noise Abatement Society. AMANDA'S VERDICT: Experts say that any sound above 85 decibels can damage the ear - so each time I use my trusty old Kenwood at home, I really am suffering: it registers more than 92 decibels and sounds like a helicopter landing in the garden. I place this Magimix next to it and flick the switch. No screech, no scattering of children holding their ears. Nor does it vibrate. RATING: Used by TV chefs so they can talk to camera as they chop and blend. 8/10 . DISHWASHER . So quiet, I couldn't tell if it was running . Bosch SMS69L32GB, £575, Decibels: 38 (average 52) WHAT IT CLAIMS: This clever machine takes more than 140 knives, forks, saucers and cups but is so quiet you'll hardly know it's on. It takes 132 minutes to complete a cycle. AMANDA'S VERDICT: This has a time delay so you can set it going after midnight for lower energy costs, but it's so quiet it won't wake the family. I tried mine during the day and couldn't tell if it was running, so had to open the door to see (getting a steam facial in  the process). RATING: I like to know if my dishwasher is on. If you don't mind a slightly louder one - 42 decibels - try the Siemens iQ700. This has a clever gadget that projects the remaining time and exact progress of the washing cycle onto your floor, so you don't open it in mid-flow. 5/10 . Noiseless, but also very expensive . WASHING MACHINE . Miele W5872, £999, Decibels: 49 normal wash, 73 spin (Average 55 and 88) WHAT IT CLAIMS: Contains an extra-quiet mode to run your machine at a reduced noise level during quiet periods, such as at bedtime. Uses a special wash rhythm that allows your clothes to soak and gently wash with less spin and noise. AMANDA'S VERDICT: My washing machine screams the house down on spin cycle but this is so quiet I could sleep beside it. Any washing machine will be quieter on a concrete floor than a wooden one. RATING: Very quiet but expensive. 6/10 . I was able to empty the ironing basket without missing a word of Bake Off . STEAM IRON . Philips PerfectCare Silence, £300, Decibels: 30 (average 60) WHAT IT CLAIMS: The quietest ever steam-generating iron. Winner of an award from the Noise Abatement Society. AMANDA'S VERDICT: Irons are not terribly noisy but can be annoying if you try to alleviate the drudgery by watching telly. Steam generators work when you press a button by releasing steam via a pump from a water tank. This increases the steam but creates a loud rumbling noise followed by a bellow of steam. In contrast, this iron was almost completely silent. I was able to empty the ironing basket without missing a word of Bake Off. Perfect. RATING: Quiet even when you press the steam button - a silent dream. 10/10 .","Launch of the world's quietest vacuum marks the arrival of 'silent' gadgets .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Professional chefs spend hours perfecting the presentation of dishes, but one photographer has revealed the unseen beauty of food that hides deep within these restaurant meals. Austin-based Ajay Malghan thinly slices and flattens food between panes of glass and photographs them by manipulating background light and colour. He states his images of potatoes, broccoli, melon, and more resemble supernovas in space, or the vascular system in the human body. Scroll down for video . The images were taken by Austin-based Ajay Malghan for his project Naturally Modified. He thinly slices and flattens food between panes of glass and photographs them by manipulating the light shone from behind. The left-hand image is Malghan's take on a potato, with a stock image of new potatoes pictured right . Malghan began by painting lettuce, using different shades and colours. Following the Fukushima disaster, he used neon paints and contrasting hues to represent the radiation seeping into the ground. He begins by thinly slicing and flattening food between panes of glass before photographing them. The background and colour is manipulated using light shone from behind, and ink within the panes. His images include melons, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, broccoli and more. The project is called Naturally Modified. ‘Food, as well as being what we live off of, is my art. It’s what I work with,’ explained Malghan in The Secret Within documentary, produced by Whole Food’s magazine Dark Rye. ‘Something so simple can be so complex. There are so many layers to it; we always have this intimate experience with it, but we don’t know anything about it.' Malghan began by painting lettuce, using different shades and colours. Following the Fukushima disaster, he used neon paints and contrasting hues to represent the radiation seeping into the ground. ‘I thought it was quite fascinating that you can take something you have an extremely familiar relationship with, and manipulate it in a minor way but one that completely removes you from any context you were familiar with,’ he continued. He admitted the images that were the most difficult to get flat, or to slice or get the fluid out of were the most rewarding, including watermelon. Malghan said the thing that struck him the most as he worked with the food was the similarities to other objects in the universe, such as space and MRI scans. ‘You start seeing common threads in the universe, you start understanding through how little you know, you want to learn more.’ 'Food is my art. It’s what I work with,’ explained Malghan. ‘Something so simple can be so complex.

An image of a pear created using similar techniques is illuminated in red on the right . Malghan also compares the food to the human body. For example, he claims tomatoes are just bags of cells, like our bodies, and his images of watermelons, and corn remind him of the vascular system. When he exhibits his artwork, he deliberately doesn’t include labels ‘because that generates a conversation; people have to ask, and talk about the process.’ ‘A lot of the time, some people view art with a label first and that ruined it for me.’ An example Malghan gives in The Space Within documentary is an image of an orange he exhibited in Hong Kong that was purple.

Beef came from a cow, so it should have something that tells you what it was before, so after doing that I don’t eat cheeseburgers any more.’ Malghan concluded: ‘We usually just take food on the surface, we don’t usually question anything. [This] makes me more curious.’ Malghan concluded: 'We usually just take food on the surface, we don't usually question anything. [This] makes me more curious.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . It could almost be called the Mystery of the Missing Jewels as an Agatha Christie fan  found a strongbox full of the crime writer's jewels. The story begins in 2006 when Jennifer Grant, a fan of the crime writer, bought a travelling trunk for £100 during a house clearing sale of the Devon home of Dame Agatha. The house - Greenway, near Brixham in Devon - had been left to Dame Agatha's daughter Rosalind Hicks and was sold upon her death on October 28, 2004. Two of the pieces of jewellery formerly owned by Dame Agatha Christie that are being auctioned by Bonhams in October, after being found in a trunk bought during a house sale of the crime writer's f . Inside the trunk, which belonged to Dame Agatha's mother, Clara, was a locked strongbox which the new owner opened four years later finding a purse of gold coins, a diamond brooch and a diamond ring. The jewellery, valued at around £10,000, is being sold at auction in October after lying unseen for years at Christie's family home. Among the treasures in the locked trunk was a diamond brooch (left) and a diamond ring (right) Miss Grant said: 'I was thrilled to have stumbled upon my very own mystery. I always wondered what was locked inside the strongbox but I never dreamt it would be anything so exciting as diamonds - I could hardly breathe when I unwrapped the tissue paper and found them. Greenway, near Brixham in Devon was crime writer Dame Agatha Christie's summer home. She described it as 'the most beautiful place in the world' Dame Agatha Christie seen walking with her second husband Sir Max Mallowan, the archaeologist, in the grounds of Greenway House in Devon . 'As an Agatha Christie fan, it's wonderful to think that these items actually touched her life. I've enjoyed the jewellery greatly over the last four years but I don't wear it as much as it deserves. I thought - why not let someone else enjoy them.' Dame Agatha used Greenway, which she described as 'the most beautiful place in the world', as a holiday home. The house was used to film David Suchet's last appearance as Poirot on ITV last year. The jewels will be sold at Bonhams auction house in Knightsbridge, central London, on October 8. Dame Agatha Christie (1890-1976) as she is most usually remembered (left) and in old age (right) The first mention of the house situated on the River Dart is in 1493 when it is called Greynway. The present house dates to the late 18th century and was bought by Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan in 1938. They lived there until their deaths. She described it as 'the most beautiful place in the world'. Greenway was acquired by the National Trust in 1999 and it is now a Grade II* listed building. Dame Agatha used the house or its environs in some of her books including Five Little Pigs (1942), Towards Zero (1944) and Dead Man’s Folly (1956). They are mentioned in the Agatha Christie biography as pieces earmarked for the novelist and her sister Madge to inherit from their mother's collection. Dame Agatha wrote: 'My mother's valuable jewellery consisted of ""my diamond buckle"", ""my diamond crescent"" and ""my diamond engagement ring"" ... Madge was to have the diamond crescent, I was to have the diamond buckle...' '...my mother sorted amongst an array of odds and ends... all these required hours of sorting before they were packed in the trays in the various trunks.' Greenway features in several Agatha Christie novels, with its secretive walled gardens, tennis court and boat house on the river which wraps itself around the property. The 19th century diamond brooch found in the trunk is expected to reach between £6,000 and £8,000 at auction, while the diamond three stone ring has an estimate of £3,000 to £5,000.","Jennifer Grant purchased trunk at sale of Greenway, near Brixham in Devon .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Associated Press . Hajrija Selimovic waited for 19 years to put her family back together. Her husband and her two sons were being reunited Friday in a cemetery for Srebrenica massacre victims. After that, she will always be able to find them - and lean her head against their cold, white tombstones when she cries. Samir was 23 and Nermin only 19 when the Serb execution squad shot them. Scroll down for video . Bosnian Muslims pray during a mass funeral for 175 newly identified victims from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre . Bosnian Muslims carry caskets containing the remains of victims . The three were among the 8,000 Muslim men and boys executed when Serb forces overran the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica on July 11, 1995 - Europe's worst massacre since World War II. Even as the years pass, the remains of Srebrenica victims are still being found in mass graves. Every July 11, more are buried at a memorial center near the town. A relative of the Srebrenica victims mourns near the tombs at Srebrenica-Potocari Memorial and Cemetery in Srebrenica . Bosnian Muslim people walk among the graves of the victims . This year, Selimovic's two sons will be among the 175 newly identified victims laid to rest next to the 6,066 previously buried ones. It's also the site where last year she buried her husband Hasan, who was found in 2001. 'I didn't want to bury him because they only found his head and a few little bones,' she said, explaining why she waited for so many years. 'I waited, thinking the rest will be found and then everything can be buried at once ... but there was nothing else and we buried what we had,' she said. The eastern town of Srebrenica was a U.N.-protected area besieged by Serb forces throughout Bosnia's 1992-95 war. But U.N. troops offered no resistance when the Serbs overran the majority Muslim town, rounding up Srebrenica's Muslims and killing the males. An international court later labeled the slayings as genocide. A Bosnian Muslim woman cries near coffins at the memorial ceremony . Bosnian Muslim woman Senija Rizvanovic cries near the graves of her two sons in Srebrenica . Bosnian Muslim women pray at the Potocari Memorial Center during the funeral . After the massacre, then-U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright waved satellite photos of mass graves in Bosnia at the U.N. Security Council. Washington knew where the mass graves were, she told them. That's when Serb troops rushed to the sites with bulldozers and moved the Srebrenica victims to other locations. As the machines ploughed up bodies, they ripped them apart, and now fragments of the same person can be scattered among several different sites. 'The perpetrators had every hope that these people would be wiped out and never found again,' said Kathryne Bomberger, head of the International Commission for Missing Persons, a Bosnia-based DNA identification project. The ICMP, established in 1996 at the urging of former President Bill Clinton, has collected almost 100,000 blood samples from relatives of the missing from the Yugoslav wars. It has analyzed their DNA profiles and is now matching them with profiles extracted from the estimated 50,000 bone samples that have been exhumed. The group grew into the world's largest DNA-assisted identification program. It has identified 14,600 individuals in Bosnia, including some 7,000 Srebrenica victims. The agency, which also helped identify Hurricane Katrina victims and those who died in the 2004 Asian tsunami, is now involved in identifying missing people in Libya, Iraq, Colombia, Kuwait, Philippines and South Africa. A Bosnian Muslim woman cries near the coffin of a relative, one of the 175 coffins of newly identified victims from the 1995 massacre . An elderly Bosnian Muslim man, a survivor of the 1995 massacre, pays his respects at a relative's grave . Bosnian Muslim women cry in front of the coffin of a relative . Bosnia remains its biggest operation. 'Without DNA, we would have never been able to identify anyone,' Bomberger said Thursday. 'However, this means that the families have to make the difficult decision on when to bury a person. And many of the women from Srebrenica want to bury their sons, their family members, the way they remember them when they were alive.' So thousands of traumatized mothers and widows are faced with another trauma - the decision to either bury just a fragment or wait until more bones are found.

A boy holds flowers as Bosnians, citizens of Sarajevo, line up in the main street of Srebrenica to honour the victims of the  massacre . Bosnian Muslim clerics watch the funeral on Friday . This year, the families of some 500 identified victims have decided not to accept just two or three bones. Those will remain stored in a mortuary in the northern city of Tuzla until the families get tired of waiting or until more remains are found. `'We calculate that there are still about 1,000 persons missing ... in addition there are probably thousands of pieces of bodies' still to find, Bomberger said. 'This is an extremely complex process that has taken a long time, just simply because of the efforts the perpetrators went to to hide the bodies.' Selimovic, who made a hard decision last year regarding her husband, said this year's decision was easier. 'Now I am burying two sons,' she said. 'They are complete. Just the younger one is missing a few fingers.' Bosnian Muslim woman Rizvanovic Senija is comforted by medics during the  memorial ceremony .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb almost a century ago gripped the world. It took 10 years to record and document the numerous artefacts found buried with the young king, and these items were sent to various museums around the world. The latest exhibition at Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum curates many related sculptures, jewellery and original drawings to give a greater insight into the ancient Egyptian teenage leader.

Howard Carter and an unnamed assistant are shown inspecting Tutankhamun's inner-most coffin . On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as Osiris, while wall paintings, pictured, showed the king being embraced by the underworld god.
