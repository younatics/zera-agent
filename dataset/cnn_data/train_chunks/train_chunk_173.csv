"(CNN) -- Wayne LaPierre, the nation's most visible gun-rights advocate, rallied supporters on Saturday for a renewed fight against gun control, saying membership is up since the Newtown massacre, and calling the effort to stop new limits a ""long war"" and a ""fight for everything we care about."" The National Rifle Association's executive vice president vowed in remarks at the group's national convention that ""we will never surrender our guns."" He implored members to step up their outreach to members of Congress as part of a fight against ""elites"" and others who ""use tragedy to try to blame us, to shame us"" into compromise and who ""want to change America, our culture and our values."" LaPierre delivered a speech heavy on militaristic and sweeping patriotic rhetoric. It was a signature moment at the weekend event, which sought to embrace a culture war theme in its so-far successful fight in Washington against recent gun-control initiatives. LaPierre singled out President Barack Obama, who has pushed for new firearms restrictions following the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six adults dead. The killings jolted the nation and energized gun-control advocates, while putting pressure on LaPierre's group and testing its political muscle anew. Polls have shown most Americans favoring some kind of new restrictions. LaPierre said NRA membership has spiked, reaching a record 5 million, and he implored members to counter efforts by leading gun-control advocates, like New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Obama, and Democrats in Congress. ""We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation fight for everything we care about. We have a chance to secure our freedom for a generation, or to lose it forever,"" LaPierre said. ""We must remain vigilant, ever resolute, and steadfastly growing and preparing for the even more critical battles that loom before us,"" he said. LaPierre disparaged what he called Obama's ""all-out siege against our rights"" and efforts in Congress to enact new gun control measures, calling it ""political posturing."" ""Mr. President, you can give all the speeches you want. You can conjure up all the polls you can and call NRA members all the nasty names you can think of, but your gun control legislation won't stop one criminal, wouldn't make anyone safer anywhere,"" LaPierre said. ""And that flawed failure lost on its merits and got the defeat it deserved,"" he said, referring to the setback sustained by gun control advocates last month when a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks failed in the Senate. The outcome was considered a victory for gun rights advocates, who lobbied hard to block its passage. Obama has vowed to keep pursuing new restrictions, and a co-author of the ill-fated legislative amendment is working to revive it. LaPierre and the NRA propose, instead, that current laws be enforced, that schools include armed guards, that the government rebuild a ""broken mental health system,"" and ""for God's sake, leave the rest of us alone!"" LaPierre said the failed compromise background check proposal by Sens. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, were ineffective. ""The Manchin-Toomey bill you later backed wouldn't have prevented Newtown, wouldn't have prevented Tucson or Aurora,"" he said of other deadly mass shootings in Arizona in 2011 and Colorado last July, ""and won't prevent the next tragedy,"" ""None of it, any of it have anything to do with keeping our children safe at school anywhere,"" he said. LaPierre also struck out specifically at Bloomberg, who has poured funds into the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, for acting as a ""national nanny"" and criticized the media for, as he said, failing to hold Obama accountable. Incoming NRA President Jim Porter is setting his sights on congressional midterm elections in 2014 as crucial in the gun rights debate, urging members to support House and Senate members who have voted against recent efforts to instate a background check system.","NRA executive rallies supporters; says ""we will never surrender our guns""

"(CNN) -- Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton considers himself a ""truther."" The 37-year-old rapper, producer and one-half of the legendary hip hop group OutKast said his grandmother once told him his position as a public figure was to bring valuable information to his audience and community. ""There's facts right there in your face,"" Big Boi said. ""They've got a cure for cancer, they've got a cure for AIDS, cure for everything, but they make so much money off the medicine you'll never see it. The people have to understand that."" CNN Soundwaves: Big Boi on Big Boi . Talking about life . According to Big Boi the average person is living an illusion and accepting false information. Hence the name of his latest solo album (he counts it as his third, calling ""Speakerboxxx"" his actual first album), ""Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors,"" which he has called an overall ""search for truth."" Released via Def Jam, ""VLADR"" is a follow-up to Big Boi's 2010 release, ""Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty,"" and comes from a title his grandmother had for her (planned?) autobiography in which she would air the family's dirty laundry. Big Boi's latest musical effort is his way of exposing himself and the world around him. ""I'm talking about life,"" he said of the 14-track disc (17 if you nabbed the deluxe version). ""Some people don't get that because they're so numb to what the mainstream media is pumping into their head with these reality shows and a certain type of song that's played 1,000 times on the radio every day and I refuse to do that."" So what did he do? If you were to ask the music critics, Big Boi just released his most complete work to date and the closest fans will get (for now) to an OutKast album in terms of it's boldness in sound and creative risks. But before Big Boi could ever move forward carving out his legacy, he had to shake an old stigma from his past. 'The player and the poet' Shortly after the success of their first hit single, ""Player's Ball"" in 1993, Big Boi and his partner-in-rhyme Andre 3000 were dubbed ""the player and the poet,"" with Patton playing the role of the former. Through marketing and promotion, Big Boi was cast as the bad boy, while Andre was the thoughtful, creative one. Big Boi maintains that he has never liked the moniker. ""Everybody thought I was just a DBoy. I'm just selling dope and getting laid all day,"" he said. ""I think when they put that title on it people kind of took it and ran with it."" OutKast went on to sell more than 20 million records, earning multiple Grammys, including album of the year in 2004, and the group has since been hailed as creative geniuses and one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. Search for truth . While ""VLADR"" has a lot of George Clinton-style funk and features indie rockers Phantogram and Little Dragon, it also carries the political punch of Public Enemy, with songs like ""Shoes for Running,"" which some might say borders on conspiracy theory. One of the track's opening lines is: ""I wish they could send me to the moon and back with a cure for cancer and save the lives of my great grandmomma and great granddaddy now that's the answer to the question/ but they make money off the medicine leaving us all stuck in elections with no progressions just recessions."" And so back to that whole ""truther"" thing, which Big Boi said is just his taking the time to find information and share it with anyone who will listen. He is also quick to strike down the conspiracy theorist label. ""I mean its drone strikes, United States killing kids overseas every day, they're not telling you about that,"" he said. ""Why not? Are our kids' lives more valuable than the ones' overseas? A child is a child. These are facts. There's no conspiracy in this."" Best friends . Another theory Big Boi finds himself dealing with is the status of OutKast and his relationship with Andre 3000. There was the whole Gillette ""diss"" and the apology Andre 3000 made to Big Boi via T.I.'s ""I'm Sorry."" Or could it just be the fact that since, really, 2000's ""Stankonia,"" the duo has more or less not made an album together? If you listen carefully, Big Boi addresses the matter on ""VLADR,"" but he doesn't hold back if asked about it, either. ""People don't know or they don't catch all of the interviews and then (there's) all the sensational headlines, but you've got to really understand that me and Dre have a relationship that's bigger than music,"" he said. ""We're best friends. Music just came along because it's what we're put here to do and what God brought us together to do. But that's my brother; you know what I'm saying? There's no beef, no nothing."" In fact, not one song made it to the final cut of ""VLADR"" without a listen from Andre 3000, Big Boi said. Verbal exercises . Fans and the Internet were abuzz when word got out Big Boi and Dre would be ""reuniting"" for Frank Ocean's ""Pink Matter,"" and T.I.'s I'm Sorry,"" both tracks that already featured Andre 3000. In a text message, Big Boi responded to the idea of these songs being OutKast reunions. ""They aren't,"" he wrote. ""I'm just verbally exercising."" To the folks calling for a new OutKast album, Big's answer is, well, honest. ""If we did records like what I'm doing right now, if I go so deep y'all will never get an OutKast album,"" he said. ""We ain't excited about doing an OutKast album because people ain't going to understand it.""","Rapper Big Boi says his latest album is a ""search for truth""
Says there is no beef between him and fellow Outkast member Andre 3000 .

"(CNN) -- Donnie Collins' journey from female to male will continue, thanks to a college fraternity that raised money for sex-change surgery. Collins, a 20-year-old sophomore at Boston's Emerson College, learned soon after he joined the Phi Alpha Tau fraternity that his insurance company declined to cover surgery to remove breast tissue to flatten his chest. Phi Alpha Tau members, defying the conventional stereotype of a fraternity, launched a campaign on an online fundraising site -- Indiegogo.com -- with a goal of collecting the $8,100 needed for the procedure, scheduled for May. ""We see Donnie as a brother and we want to support him in this endeavor,"" Phi Alpha Tau Chapter President Jon Allen told CNN affiliate WBZ-TV. ""We are here less to raise money, and more to tell a story ... of transformation, and a story of self-discovery, and the story of brotherhood,"" the online appeal said. Opinion: Gender identity not just about body parts . The response was overwhelming, resulting in almost $16,000, according to the frat's website. The money left over after the surgery will be donated to the Jim Collins Foundation, an organization that helps ""fund gender-confirming surgeries for transgender people,"" the group said. ""I'm overwhelmed and surprised. I can't thank everyone enough,"" Collins told WBZ-TV. The whole Emerson campus has been supportive of Collins, according to Jason Meier, who supervises the school's Greek groups as student activities director. Being transgender no longer a mental 'disorder' in diagnostic manual . ""Emerson has always been very inclusive and accepting of LGBT students,"" Meier told CNN. ""I didn't even flinch or bat an eye. It just seemed like every day for these men."" Collins is not the first transgender member of the fraternity, Meier said. Another transgender student became a leader in the group, he said. Phi Alpha Tau, which has been active at Emerson since 1902, describes itself on its website as a ""professional communicative arts fraternity.""

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- China's Xi Jinping, who is expected to be named president in March and likely next premier Li Keqiang will inherit a foreign policy that puts a premium on partnerships that can help China fuel its resource-hungry economy. In the world of geo-politics, symbolism goes a long way in forging lasting, strategic relations. This is certainly the case when it comes to China's role within the Middle East, specifically with Saudi Arabia, the country with the world's largest proven oil reserves. When King Abdullah took over the throne in Saudi Arabia, his first foreign visit in January 2006 was to Beijing after an invitation of President Hu Jintao. Six years later, the countries' two state-run energy giants, China's Sinopec and Saudi Aramco, inked a huge oil agreement guaranteeing the Asian nation an additional 400,000 barrels a day from a Red Sea refinery in the Saudi city of Yanbu. This is on top of the estimated one million barrels of oil a day it now orders from the Kingdom. ""We need China as much as China needs us,"" said Khalid Al-Falih in a CNN interview right after he signed the agreement, ""But the energy corridor is only part of it. We envisage an exchange of goods and services and trade in other areas that add value to the Chinese economy and to the Saudi economy as well."" That deal follows a major equity investment in the Fujian province where Saudi Aramco invested in petrochemical manufacturing facilities along with U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil. In the 19th century the battle over influence of Central Asia was described as the ""Great Game"" as the British and Russian empires vied for control and influence in the region. In the 21st century, one may view China's influence in the Middle East in a similar vein. ""Clearly there are mutual interests in terms of large energy suppliers and consumers, but there will be stress points, of course,"" said Ben Simpfendorfer, co-founder of Silk Road Associates, an investment advisory firm specializing on trade between the Middle East and Far East Asia. China, experts say, is keen to lock in strategic commodity supplies rather than exercise political influence at this juncture. This is reflected in its vetoes -- together with Russia -- striking down resolutions against Syria on the United Nations Security Council. This strategy of non-intervention may not be sustainable, says Simpfendorfer, ""I think China's position will be challenged by the Gulf countries and that is certainly a risk the new leadership has to look out for"" especially since Beijing is so dependent on the region to fuel its economic expansion. But one cannot doubt whether the world's second largest economy is instrumental in rebuilding the ancient Silk Road. China continues to go to great lengths to foster developing market trade partners -- some argue to exploit their natural resources in the case of Africa -- as part of its ""Great Game"" strategy. China rolls out the welcome mat on its soil, for example recently inviting Arab leaders to Yinchuan, in northern-central part of the country, for the 3rd China-Arab States Economic and Trade Forum. There are some lofty expectations for trade between China and the Arab states. The United Arab Emirates' foreign trade minister, Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, said bilateral trade between the Gulf and China could hit $300 billion by 2014. Trade between China and the UAE grew 10% last year alone, witnessing a fivefold increase in less than a decade. Some see Dubai's Jebel Ali port as an excellent gateway for China into the African continent. This keen business interest in the Middle East is not likely to change with Xi Jinping taking over the helm in 2013, but is China ready for a G-2 world dominated by Washington and Beijing? Not yet, strategists suggest. Beijing prefers the relative comfort of the broader G-20 world that brings the developed and developing world under one umbrella, with the ability for the new leaders of China to seek political alignment from BRICS partners Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa. All the while, China continues to blaze new trails beyond the Middle East in search of strategic supplies. This autumn, the country made inroads into Afghanistan with the first high level visit in more than a half century. The bounty is a promising one with more than a trillion dollars of mineral deposits estimated in the country. China's ""Great Game"" continues with an ever expanding footprint from the Middle East well into South Asia.","China's foreign policy values relationships to fuel its resource-hungry economy .

"(CNN) -- European regulators need effective deterrents to stop Internet companies breaching data protection laws, according to the European Union justice department. The call comes as data watchdogs from the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands team up to launch a joint action against U.S. search-engine giant Google over alleged breaches of EU privacy rules. The joint action by Europe's heavyweights is a response to Google's announcement in January on new privacy settings. The Mountain View-based group said it collects and compiles data about its users based on their activity on its various sites -- from its search page to Gmail to YouTube to phones running its Android operating system. Yesterday, it was announced that Google's first privacy director, Alma Whitten, would be stepping down after three years in the job.

Mina Andreeva, a spokesperson for EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, told CNN that Google has not followed up on the ""concrete recommendations"" made in October last year. Read more: Google launches monthly user-activity feature . Andreeva added that new rules are designed to give regulators ""teeth"" and ensure that companies respect consumer privacy.

In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: ""Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services,"" adding that Google would continue to engage fully with the data protection authorities on the matter.

In March, Google was hit by a fine from France's privacy watchdog, CNIL, over data obtained mistakenly through the company's Street View service.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona will have to wait at least one more week to wrap up a fourth La Liga title in five seasons after they could only draw 2-2 against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. The Catalans needed to win their match and hope Real Madrid lost their derby game against Atletico to guarantee the title, but neither result transpired -- Real beat their city rivals 2-1 to reduce the arrears to 11 points. Having been on the receiving end of a Champions League mauling at the hands of Bayern Munich in midweek, Barcelona's weekend got off to an equally dismal start as Bilbao took the lead in the 27th minute when Markel Susaeta scored from close range. Lionel Messi came off the bench to steer Barca back into the match, levelling the scores with another sublime individual effort in the 67th minute -- his 44th in 33 league games -- before Alexis Sanchez made it 2-1 three minutes later.

Real also conceded first in the match against their city rivals at the Vicente Calderon -- Radamel Falcao opening the scoring in the fourth minute. But the lead only lasted nine minutes as defender Juanfran deflected an Angel di Maria free kick into his own net. Di Maria was on hand again in the second half latching onto to a pass from Karim Benzema in the 62nd minute before firing home the winner past Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

"(CNN) -- Champions League contenders Malaga have been handed a season long ban from UEFA club competitions after falling foul of the European governing body's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. The La Liga side will be allowed to continue in this season's Champions League, where they have reached the last 16 stage, but any ban would come into place over any of the next four seasons should they qualify to play in Europe. Malaga are the first high-profile club to be punished under new tougher FFP rules with UEFA's Financial Control Body (CFCB) making their ruling after a hearing Friday in Nyon, Switzerland. Malaga owe player wages and have debts with other football sides as well as the Spanish tax authorities, claim UEFA. The CFCB has given the club until March 31 next year to settle the debts and will impose a further one season ban from UEFA competitions, the Champions League or Europa League, if they fail to do so. Malaga have also been fined â‚¬300,000 ($396,000) but UEFA has released prize money due them from this season's Champions League. The club issued a strongly worded statement Friday to express their ""total disagreement"" with the UEFA decision. It went on: ""The measures taken against the club are absolutely disproportionate and unjustified given the club's situation. We consider that the club is being punished unfairly and used as a scapegoat and example to others. ""Malaga CF wishes to state that it will work energetically and without rest to achieve justice, using all available necessary means."" The club, who are currently fourth in La Liga, a spot which would see them qualify for a European place next season, can appeal to the Court of Arbitration in Sport in an attempt to overturn the decision. Since coming under the ownership of Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Thani, a member of the Qatar ruling family, Malaga have spent heavily on new players. But in November, they were one of nine European clubs referred to the CFCB because of debt problems and infringements of UEFA's licensing agreements and one of 23 to have prize money withheld. Despite the threat of sanctions looming over the club, Malaga have performed superbly this season under coach Manuel Pellegrini, winning Group C of the Champions League with a game to spare and earning a tie against Porto in the knockout stage. Five other clubs face one-year European bans, valid for three seasons, if they do not settle their debts by March 31. Croatian sides Hajduk Split and Osijek; Romania's Dinamo Bucharest and Rapid Bucharest; and Partizan Belgrade of Serbia, were all handed the punishment. Serbian's Vojvodina and Ukraine's Arsenal Kyiv received fines while the case against Polish side Lech Poznan was dropped. This season is the first since UEFA's FFP rules were introduced and they will come more fully into force in 2014. They give the ruling body sweeping powers, including exclusion from the lucrative Champions League. They are designed to prevent big spending clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses.","Malaga banned from UEFA competitions for financial irregularities .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is known as the undisputed king of clay with seven French Open titles to his name -- but the Spaniard was given an almighty scare in the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo Masters Friday. Nadal, who has won the past eight editions of the tournament, was made to fight all the way by Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov before eventually prevailing 6-2 2-6 6-4. It was the first time the 26-year-old had dropped a set at the tournament since 2009 as he racked up a 45th consecutive match victory in the French principality. That record had looked in doubt until his opponent began to suffer with cramp in his leg, allowing Nadal to emerge victorious. But despite working his way back to fitness following a seven month absence with a knee injury, Nadal admits he still lacks match sharpness. ""I didn't play tennis for seven months,"" he told reporters. ""I'm losing little bit intensity of the match for moments. ""That's normal after being a lot of time outside of the competition. I played for a month, then I stopped for another month. I need time to play with top rhythm for the whole match. ""I was playing great at the first set, playing my best level. So that's the most important thing."" Nadal was spotted playing with taping on his back, but he refused to elaborate on the problem when asked. He added: ""I'm happy to be in the semifinals, I played the best with what I had. It's normal have problems on the back, on the shoulder, on the elbow."" Dimitrov, 21, is rated as one of the most exciting prospects in world tennis and for a while looked set to become the first man to defeat Nadal in Monte Carlo since 2003. The 11-time grand slam winner was given a stern examination by the man ranked 34 in the world, who eventually succumbed after suffering pain in his left leg. ""It's a tough loss, I think I gave everything I had today,"" Dimitrov told reporters. ""Today he obviously showed why he's the best not only on that surface, I believe, but he's one of the best out there."" Nadal will now face France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who saw off Stanislas Wawrinka 2-6 6-3 6-4 in his quarterfinal tie. Wawrinka, who defeated Andy Murray in the previous round, fought off four match points before eventually being swept aside. ""It's an incredible challenge,"" Tsonga told reporters of his upcoming contest with Nadal. ""He's won eight times here. Anything I might achieve will be just a bonus for me. ""I no longer have any pain in my legs, because I know I'm going to play a player that's a lot better than I am on clay. ""I do have some weapons; I have everything to win and nothing to lose."" Top seed Novak Djokovic overcame his troublesome ankle problem to see off Finland's Jarkko Nieminen 6-4 6-3. ""My ankle is getting better and better,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""The pain is subsiding and that is very important for me. I just hope to play a good match tomorrow.""

"Editor's note: Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN, appearing regularly on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" ""Campbell Brown,"" ""AC360°"" and ""State of the Union With John King,"" as well as special event coverage. Gloria Borger says independent voters generally like Obama's approach to the job of president. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The giveaway was when they started calling him ""Barack."" It was jarring, at first, to hear many in this group of 12 independent voters refer to their new president by his first name. But the more they talked, the more it made sense. After all, they are seeing a lot of him. And they like it -- or at least they like him. ""There's a sense of intimacy, or relationship, that was there,"" says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the focus group in Towson, Maryland, on Wednesday night. ""[It shows] how unbelievably powerful his personal presence is. ... Don't get fooled by numbers alone. Something is stronger here."" So while the president's poll numbers start to dip, these dozen independents -- including four McCain supporters and a lone Nader voter -- are giving the president some leeway. They feel like they know him, and that he's ""honest,' as one put it. And while they say the country is ""broke,"" ""worried"" and ""confused, they're not blaming Barack. If anything, they seem invested in his success. Way back in the campaign, a central question was whether voters could get comfortable with Obama; now they consider him a regular guy. ""It's like if you call your boss by his first name, you identify with him,"" explains Alex Chambers, a 27-year-old teacher who supported Obama. ""He's more upfront, does a lot of speeches, verbalizes more than we've ever been used to,"" adds Nora Seeley, a 54-year-old dental hygienist who voted for Obama. ""I like it, he's showing himself."" It's the upside of a White House communications strategy that has the president out there all the time -- Obama as the Zelig of his own administration. While the inside-the-beltway chatter has been that the ubiquitous Obama ought to become a little more scarce (or voters will stop listening), these voters are clearly listening. ""He was able to speak about health care in a way that people can understand,"" says Remi Brooke, 60, an Obama supporter. ""It's the first time I've ever seen a politician able to do that."" But there's a downside to this all-Obama-all-the-time tack. These voters, at least, worry that Obama is trying to do too much, too soon. The succession of daily appearances on an assortment of issues -- particularly health care -- has made them anxious. ""He's on a mission,"" says Alex Chambers. ""When he gets an idea in his head, he's going to get it done."" David Sawyer, a McCain voter, agrees. ""He is determined [but] he's trying to have his hands in everything too much."" While change was the buzzword of the campaign, these voters say they didn't expect it -- nor do they want it -- at mach speed. In fact, it worries them. ""Why can't they take six months to look at these things?"" asks Raymond Fernandez, 44-year-old McCain voter. Pollster Hart says there's a message for the White House here: ""I don't think the president has any idea how people feel about the speed. They need to breathe. This is like trying to shove a meal down in a minute."" There's also a sense among these voters that Obama, as Nora Seeley put it, ""is putting his hands where he doesn't belong."" Case in point: the Henry Louis Gates imbroglio. ""He never really apologized,"" says Raymond Fernandez. ""But he admitted he stepped into it."" He got credit for backtracking with these voters, but they clearly felt he got ahead of himself in the first place. Then there's leadership. While the president gets credit from these voters for listening and talking to Republicans, they're unclear about what he really wants. He's the ultimate salesman they like to watch; they're just not sure about what, in the end, he's endorsing. ""He likes to get everybody else's opinion,"" says Remi Brooke. ""At the end of the day, he's got to make the decision."" So what's his spine made of? Right now, they're not so sure. Their answers ranged from steel to sand. And, along with the rest of us, they're watching health care, waiting to see him start to draw some lines in the sand. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: Independent voters generally like Obama's approach .

"(CNN) -- MotoGP will not visit Argentina until 2014 after next year's race was scrapped following a row between Spanish oil firm Repsol and the Spanish and Argentine governments. The race, which had been supposed to be held in the second round of the season, had been in doubt following a travel warning by the Spanish government. The directive warned against drivers or teams sponsored by Repsol making the trip and although this was withdrawn on November 20, the timing meant that the race had to be canceled. Lorenzo wraps up MotoGP title . Dorna Sports, commercial rights holder of the MotoGP™ World Championship, said in a statement: ""The Gran Premio de la República Argentina, which was set to take place at the Termas de Rio Hondo circuit early next year, has not been included in the 2013 calendar. ""On June 20th 2012, the Spanish government recommended that teams and riders sponsored by Repsol should not travel to the República Argentina due to safety reasons. Therefore, the celebration of the 2013 Gran Premio de la República Argentina remained under suspension until such recommendation would be kept in force. ""The deadline for Dorna Sports, commercial rights holder of the MotoGP™ World Championship, to officially propose the 2013 MotoGP™ Calendar to FIM was November 18th. ""On November 20th, the Spanish government notified through email sent to Dorna Sports the withdrawal of the above-referred recommendation, when the time for the Calendar presentation had already expired and therefore, there was no possibility to include a new MotoGP™ event. ""Anyhow, Dorna Sports commits itself to include Gran Premio de la República Argentina on the 2014 Calendar and onwards, to be approved by FIM subject to the homologation of the track, which presumably shall take place within the first quarter of 2013.

"(CNN) -- Heikki Kovalainen is returning to Formula One to help the team that fired him. The experienced Finnish driver is taking on a new technical development role at Caterham to help them understand why they have fallen behind their back-of-the-grid rivals Marussia. Kovalainen will return to the cockpit in first practice for the next two grands prix in Bahrain and Spain. ""It's great news that I'll be on track,"" the 31-year-old said. ""I'm really looking forward to getting back to work and helping the team as much as I can. ""I'll be taking part in the two sessions to give the team my input on the new parts we're bringing to those races, and I'll be working closely with the race drivers and the engineers on track to help everyone get the most out of the new package. ""I'm physically ready to get back into the car and I know my experience can help give the team new ideas and options for directions to take on setup and strategy."" Kovalainen made his F1 debut in 2007 and went on to win his first race in Hungary as a McLaren driver the following year before moving to Caterham -- then called Lotus -- when they joined the grid in 2010. But the Kovalainen lost his seat at CNN-sponsored Caterham in 2013 because he was not a ""pay driver"" -- which meant he did not bring any money to the team. Caterham hired Frenchman Charles Pic from Russian rivals Marussia and Dutch rookie Giedo van der Garde for this season, but have fallen to 11th out of 11 teams in the constructors' championship, behind Marussia, after the first three races. The Circuit: CNN's F1 interactive . It is important to finish inside the top 10 because that entitles teams to a greater share of the sport's revenue and prize money. Caterham bosses hope new developments on their 2013 car will help them catch up on the Marussia and close the gap on the midfield runners. But team principal Cyril Abiteboul says that task relies on using the experience of Kovalainen, who had been with the team since they first turned a wheel. ""Heikki has six years of F1 experience behind him so he is perfectly placed to provide us objective feedback on the various types of configurations we will run and to give us an objective view of the 2013 tires against his experience with the 2012 compounds,"" Abiteboul explained. ""Having invested in Heikki for our first three years of competition it would be a waste not to leverage the valuable expertise he brings. ""As F1 is a team sport, he will also provide support to Charles and Giedo, who are both doing a good job in their first months with the team."" The restructuring of Caterham's line-up means Ma Qing Huang -- who made history when he became the first Chinese racer to drive in front of his home crowd during practice at the last race in Shanghai -- loses his role as the team's reserve as well as his place in Caterham's GP2 team. The 25-year-old will stay on Catherham's driver roster, but his role has yet to be announced. U.S. driver Alexander Rossi will remain the second team reserve, but will take over Ma's seat in the GP2 championship -- which is the official feeder F1 series for the next generation of drivers. Kovalainen's return to F1 coincides with discussions between tire supplier Pirelli and the sport's chief Bernie Ecclestone about the possibility of running young drivers on a new tire compound in first practice to give them vital experience in F1. There are five drivers -- Max Chilton and Jules Bianchi of Marussia, Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez, Valtteri Bottas of Williams and Van der Garde of Caterham -- who joined F1 in 2013 with limited experience of driving an F1 car.","Heikki Kovalainen to return to Caterham after losing seat with the team in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- In Bahrain smoke billows on the street from burning tires and protesters use fire extinguishers to shoot iron arrows towards riot police. But at the Bahrain International Circuit it is business as usual as the roar of Formula One continues to fill the Sakhir track in the kingdom. Even so, Friday's practice session for Sunday's Grand Prix was overshadowed by political tensions as the sport's regulator and teams insisted the race should go ahead. Bahrain's Shiite opposition was said to be planning protests on Friday, though it was unclear if the police would allow them to go ahead. On Thursday, thousands demonstrated in several areas across Bahrain in yet another day of protests. But with no evidence of unrest in and around the track, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) -- the sport's regulator -- and Formula One Management (FOM) -- the commercial rights holders for the sport -- insisted the race will take place. ""The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and Formula One Management (FOM) wish to jointly confirm their belief that the Bahrain GP should go ahead this weekend,"" those two bodies said in a statement. ""The FIA and FOM also strongly believe that sport can often be a force for good and that the staging of the Grand Prix in Bahrain will come some way in helping soothe some of the issues which have been raised in the media. ""Jean Todt and Bernie Ecclestone are united in expressing their support for the Bahrain GP and the national organizer, and wish that all concerned respect the desire of the teams, drivers and all those involved in the staging of the event to do the best job possible over the weekend,"" added the statement, referring respectively to the FIA president and the F1 supremo. ""The local promoter and the national authorities have assured both the FIA and FOM that security, their responsibility, will be guaranteed for all participants to the Bahrain GP."" Tensions in the kingdom remain high following the 2011 uprising, where the majority Shiite population protested against the ruling Sunni minority. Those protests were brought to a swift and brutal conclusion by Bahrain's security forces along with the assistance of troops brought in from Saudi Arabia. While protesters have used the grand prix as an opportunity to bring global attention to their struggle, the Bahrain government insists the race will bring long term benefits to its people. ""F1 brings significant benefits to everyone in Bahrain, especially economically,"" the government said in a statement. ""Bahrain upholds the right to peaceful protest. It is a country made up of many communities with different views on its development. ""This is why it has launched a dialogue between all political groups to address political issues in a manner that will ensure the country develops in a sustainable way. ""It should be noted that in some cases protests encouraged by extreme opposition groups result in deliberate and targeted violence. ""Only in these case do security forces respond and they do so while exercising appropriate restraint. Some unfortunately believe that continued unrest on the streets affords them a political advantage, when it results in greater divisions between communities in Bahrain. Violence can never be tolerated."" Meanwhile, on the track, Kimi Raikkonen was the fastest man in the afternoon's second free practice session. The Lotus driver clocked a fastest time of one minute 34.154 seconds to pip Red Bull's Mark Webber by just 0.03 seconds. ""I would have liked to have got some more running in P2, but I still think we learned what we expected today,"" Australian Webber told the official Formula One website. ""Saturdays are perhaps becoming less important overall than they used to be, but they're still important in terms of traffic. ""You don't want to be in too much traffic on Sunday, as the tires don't like being disturbed and wear more which will shorten your first stint -- so you still need to be in a good position. ""We still have areas to improve on the car. Lotus and Ferrari look strong and Mercedes is there too."" Red Bull rival and three-time world champion Sebastian Vettel was third fastest in the afternoon, but he remains positive of his chances of success this weekend. ""It's pretty close,"" said Vettel. ""If you look at the opposition then Ferrari and Lotus were strong today and I think it will be close in qualifying. ""It's important to work with the tires around the track. I wasn't so happy with my short runs today - but that's why we have the Friday practice sessions I guess; I was happier with the longer runs. ""The tires still seem to be the dominating factor. The car seems quick, so we have to make sure we use that and then we should be on the right page."" Lewis Hamilton, who has recorded two podium finishes so far this season, found life more difficult after finishing the day 10th fastest. ""We're working as hard as we can and we just need to find some more time from somewhere,"" he told reporters. ""I don't really know where we are losing it. They have changed the car this weekend, changed the settings for what they think the track needs but I'm not convinced it is the right way to go. ""I don't know if they are right or wrong but we were struggling for pace today... But I am sure we will find it.""","F1 commercial right's holders FIA and FOM confirms Sunday's race will go ahead .

"(CNN) -- Sauber has confirmed that Mexico's Esteban Gutierrez will replace Kamui Kobayashi as the team's second driver for next season. The 21-year-old, who has been the team's reserve driver over the past year, will team up with Nico Hülkenberg, who has joined from Force India. Guttierrez finished third in the GP2 championship last season after winning three races, and will continue Sauber's recent tradition of having a Mexican driver with Sergio Perez having announced he will be joining McLaren at the end of the season. The deal means Sauber, who has a sponsorship deal with Mexican telecommunications company Telmex, has another Mexican driver at its disposal. While Telmex is owned by by the world's richest man, Carlos Slim, Kobayashi boasts no such support. The Japanese driver sits 11th in the current rankings, just below Perez and above Hulkenburg. Who is F1's greatest driver? Guttierrez told the team's official website: ""After three years working with Sauber I feel very grateful for all the attention I have received from everyone in the team and for all their input, which has allowed me to develop into a Formula One driver in a very progressive way. ""Now, after experiencing other categories of racing as an introduction to Formula One, this is the start of the real challenge to succeed at the pinnacle of motor sport. ""The support from my family, as well as from my sponsors, has been a key factor in getting there and I am very grateful to everyone who has been involved in our project. ""It will be a great pleasure to be racing in the same team as an experienced driver like Nico Hülkenberg. ""He will be a good reference point for me and will push me to adapt quickly to F1 competition so we can develop the car together with the team in the best way."" Team Principal Monisha Kaltenborn added: ""Esteban has already been part of the team for a long time and we have followed his career very closely. ""In 2010 we signed him up as an affiliated driver, and in 2011 and 2012 he was our test and reserve driver. We mapped out his path to Formula One step by step. ""Esteban has great talent and now he's ready to take the leap. We are in no doubt we have a strong driver pairing in place for the 2013 season with Nico Hülkenberg and Esteban Gutiérrez."" Blog: Vettel, Alonso on track for greatness? Sauber has also taken on Dutch driver Robin Frijns as its new test and reserve driver. Meanwhile, Caterham has announced that Charles Pic will drive for the team next season after signing a long-term deal following his decision to leave Marussia. The 22-year-old, who recorded highest finishes of 15th at the Australian Grand Prix and European Grand Prix, is relishing the new opportunity. ""I am very proud to be able to confirm that I am joining Caterham F1 Team next year and I'm looking forward to many seasons of successful racing cooperation,"" he said. ""It is clear that the team has great ambitions for the future: the investments already made and the decisions taken in the last few months show how committed the shareholders are to succeed and demonstrates their willingness to keep going forward. ""I am very excited about starting my second year in F1 with a team that has so much potential.

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel made the perfect start in his bid for an historic world title triple by setting the fastest time in both practice sessions Friday for the United States Grand Prix. Formula One is returning to the U.S. for the first time in five years on the new Circuit of Americas in Austin, Texas and the Red Bull star wasted little time in setting the pace. The 25-year-old German can become the youngest three-time champion and only the third to achieve the feat after Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher this weekend. He leads Ferrari's Fernando Alonso by 10 points with two races remaining and if he gains 15 points more than the Spaniard on Sunday the title will be his. Can F1 rekindle it's American dream? Vettel had problems with a water leak at the start of the second session and had to take to the escape road on Turn 12 on one of his runs, but his best time of one minute 37.718 seconds took him clear of the pack. Teammate Mark Webber of Australia was second quickest with Alonso third ahead of the McLaren pair of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. Kimi Raikkonen, who won the last round of the F1 season in Abu Dhabi, was only 11th fastest in his Lotus. Earlier, Vettel was quickest in the first competitive F1 action on the 5.516km track with a time of one minute 38.125 seconds. He was nearly one and a half seconds faster than Hamilton, but all the drivers were cautious as they adjusted to a slippery and unknown track, which had not been ""rubbered"" in. It was the biggest margin at the end of any practice session this season to underline his recent dominance.

"(CNN) -- The numbers keep stacking up for Sebastian Vettel. On Sunday he will start on pole position for the 36th time in the 100th race of his Formula One career, with the opportunity to become the sport's youngest triple world champion. The 25-year-old will clinch his third successive title if he wins his sixth race this season and main rival Fernando Alonso finishes lower than fourth at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. The Spaniard, who has a 10-point deficit to make up with two races to go, will start the U.S. Grand Prix in eighth place -- having been bumped up the grid after Lotus' Romain Grosjean was dropped five spots for an illegal gearbox change during Saturday's qualifying. if Vettel is second or third, then his Ferrari adversary needs to finish at least eighth or 10th to take the title race to the finale in Brazil. Latest F1 standings . ""I still think we are going to reduce the gap to Sebastian, which is what counts,"" said Alonso, himself a two-time world champion. ""He starts from pole and he has very strong pace, but the race will be long and let's see if we can seize our opportunities. ""We'll see how the start goes. If he wins the race and then wins again in Brazil he will be champion, and deservedly so."" Vettel was fastest in Friday's practice sessions and his Red Bull's speed was improved further by the arrival of a new front wing that night. ""We just need to look after ourselves, so we are very happy as we had no issues today,"" the German said. ""The best strategy is to keep your head down, which was the target in qualifying. But we saw at the last race how quickly things can change, so we'll focus on our race."" Vettel finished third in Abu Dhabi despite starting from the pit lane, but Red Bull could not clinch a third successive manufacturers' title as Mark Webber failed to finish after being caught up in several scrapes. The Australian will start the season's penultimate race third on the grid behind McLaren's Lewis Hamilton. ""We have an eye on the constructors' title, which we aim to put to bed,"" Webber said. ""It will be a huge result for everyone at the factory in Milton Keynes and (engine supplier) Renault."" Hamilton, who has no hope of adding to his 2008 world title before next year's move to Mercedes, is worried about starting on the dirty side of the new track. ""We'll ask the authorities to clean that side so people get an equal start into turn one, where it's so wide I don't think much can go wrong,"" he said. ""Obviously I don't want to get in the way of Sebastian's race, but I want to win so I will try my best to get through cleanly."" Hamilton's teammate Jenson Button was down in 12th after a power failure, while his future colleague Nico Rosberg was 17th and the man the Englishman is replacing -- seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher -- will start fifth. Grosjean's demotion from fourth meant his teammate Kimi Raikkonen will take that position on the grid as he seeks to follow up his Abu Dhabi win, while Alonso's Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa will be sixth ahead of Force India's Sauber-bound Nico Hulkenberg.

"(CNN) -- Slovenia's Tina Maze was crowned World Cup overall champion Sunday -- landing the coveted Crystal Globe with fully nine events of the season still remaining. Maze's victory in the super-combined at Meribel was her eighth of a remarkable season and meant she could not be caught by her nearest rival Maria Hoefl-Riesch. Germany's Hoefl-Riesch fell in the slalom section of the super-combi as Maze recorded an aggregate time of one minute 59.54 seconds. Maze had been fastest in the opening downhill on a shortened course after heavy overnight snow at the French resort and made no mistake on her slalom run.. Austrian pair Nicole Hosp and Michaela Kirchgasser finished second and third at 0.82 and 0.90 seconds. The 29-year-old Maze has achieved 1,844 points across all races in all alpine skiing's disciplines, finishing on the podium 18 times in a season marked by incredible consistency. She is almost certain to break through the 2,000 point barrier by the end of the season, a feat only once achieved by Austria's Hermann Maier in the 1999-2000 season. Maze also won the super-G gold at the recent world championships in Schladming in Austria and claimed two silvers in the super-combined and giant slalom. She succeeds American Lindsey Vonn as overall champion. Vonn has been sidelined for the season after a nasty fall in super-G at the world championships. Maze is not resting on her laurels and is targeting the individual discipline crowns in a triumphant year. ""I will stay focused and try to get all the globes possible and most important to keep that high level of performance until the end of the World Cup season"", she told the official FIS website. Meanwhile, Austria's Marcel Hirscher increased his advantage in the battle for the men's overall World Cup title with second place in the giant slalom at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany. Hirscher finished 0.60 seconds behind France's Alexis Pinturault, who was claiming his first World Cup win in the discipline. Triple world champion Ted Ligety of the United States finished third after making crucial mistakes on his first run. Ligety, who claimed the giant slalom title in Schladming, was only fifth going into the second leg and could not make up the deficit. ""I'll try and take all the points I can get, I don't think about the globes yet,"" Hirscher told the official FIS website, but with his nearest rival, world downhill champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway only sixth, he has a 209 point lead in the overall standings.","Tina Maze wraps up World Cup overall title with nine events still to go .

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa may have missed out on the MotoGP world title yet again, but the Spanish motorcycle star is determined to finish the 2012 season on a high note at one of his favorite tracks on Sunday. The Honda rider smashed Valentino Rossi's lap record at the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia on Saturday to claim pole position for the final race. He clocked one minute 30.844 seconds near the end of the session to head off compatriot Jorge Lorenzo, who clinched his second world title for Yamaha at the penultimate race in Australia last month. Last year's world champion Casey Stoner, who won at Phillip Island, will complete the front row in his final race for Honda before retiring. ""It was almost a perfect lap and I gave 100% because I knew I wouldn't be able to improve any more as the tires were very good for the first lap and then the drop in grip was quite severe,"" said Pedrosa, who will finish second in the championship for the third time since stepping up to the elite class in 2006. The 27-year-old has won five times at the circuit in MotoGP's three divisions. ""I'm very happy with the pole position and the new record because Valentino's old record was done with qualifying tires. We had only one dry session to test the new asphalt,"" he said. ""We still have to decide on the tires for tomorrow because we have used only the soft compound, but it depends on the weather -- if it rains we will need to take what we learned yesterday. I really would like to win here and finish the season with a good race."" Stoner, whose title defense was derailed by injury, has two wins and two second placings in Valencia since his MotoGP debut in 2006 but the Australian is not comfortable with the track's new surface. ""Qualifying didn't really go to plan, it was a pretty frustrating session. Due to the miserable weather this weekend, we had a lot of work to do in a very short space of time, we did make some good progress but unfortunately we couldn't find enough before the end of the session,"" the 27-year-old said after setting a time of 1:31.428. ""There is a new surface here and we expected everything to be really good and smooth but in fact we've found there are a lot of bumps on the circuit. Hopefully the weather is dry tomorrow and we can take that extra step in warm-up."" Lorenzo, who will be rejoined by Rossi at Yamaha next year, has won six out of 17 races and finished runner-up 10 times -- with just one retirement. ""It seems like it's going to be very close tomorrow. Dani is very strong here, not only in the dry but also in the wet and it seems it could be wet for the race,"" he said after clocking 1:31.195. ""I tried my best for pole position with the last rear tire but I didn't expect the lap time from Dani."" Seven-time world champion Rossi has not won at Valencia since 2004, and his hopes of a repeat seem slim after a poor final qualifying run for Ducati. The Italian, who has stood on the podium just twice in two years away from Yamaha, finished Saturday's session back in 11th -- more than two seconds slower than Pedrosa. He set the previous lap record of 1:31:002 in 2006.","Spanish motorcyclist Dani Pedrosa wins pole at final race of MotoGP season .

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League's man of the moment Gareth Bale kept Tottenham Hotspur's Champions League hopes alive with a stunning late winner against his former club Southampon Saturday. The White Hart Lane faithful were fearing the worst and a disheartening goalless draw when Bale brushed aside Luke Shaw before crashing home an 86th minute winner from outside the penalty area. It was his 25th goal of the campaign -- topping off a week when he was named the Football Writers' Association Player of the Year to go with his double success at the Professional Footballers' Association awards. The value of the winning goal and the subsequent three points was highlighted when North London rivals Arsenal continued their fine late season run with a 1-0 win at already relegated Queens Park Rangers in the late kickoff. Theo Walcott scored the only goal of the match after just 21 seconds, the fastest in the EPL this season, to lift his team to third in the standings on 67 points after six wins in eight games. Chelsea, who are playing newly crowned champions Manchester United Sunday, trail by two points with two games in hand. Tottenham also have 65 points and have played one game less than Arsenal in a desperately tight battle for the top four qualification spots for the Champions League next season. At the bottom end of the table, perennial relegation escapees Wigan stepped up their bid to survive again with a dramatic 3-2 win at West Bromwich Albion. They twice trailed before Callum McManaman side footed the late winner after brilliant work by Shaun Maloney. Shane Long and Gareth McAuley had given WBA their leads, canceled out by strikes from Arouna Kone and substitute James McArthur, who netted with his first touch. McManaman grabbed the third in the 80th minute and Roberto Martinez's men held on for a precious three points. The FA Cup finalists are just two points below fourth-bottom Sunderland, who host Stoke City Monday, and three points adrift of Newcastle United, who could only draw 0-0 at West Ham United. Norwich are also looking over their shoulders after Gabriel Agbonlahor completed a fine week for Aston Villa with a 2-1 away win at Carrow Road. Villa hammered Sunderland 6-1 earlier in the week and on 40 points look assured of another season in the English top flight. Elsewhere, deposed champion Manchester City were held to a 0-0 draw at Swansea City while already doomed Reading scored a fine 4-2 win at Fulham. On the final day of action in the second flight, Hull City secured a place in the Premier League for next season after drawing 2-2 at home to champions Cardiff City. Watford, Brighton and Hove Albion, Crystal Palace and Leicester City will contest the play-offs for the third promotion spot to the riches of the EPL.","Gareth Bale scores Tottenham's late winner against Southampton .

"(CNN) -- Formula One has yet to win over the United States, but former world champion Jenson Button hopes this weekend's race in Texas will be the start of something big. The new, purpose-built Circuit of the Americas in Austin will host the first U.S. Grand Prix since 2007 on Sunday -- the penultimate race of the season, and crucial in the drivers' title fight between Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso. ""Racing in Austin is one of the most exciting grands prix,"" Button told CNN. ""It's a purpose-built circuit for Formula One ... it's very important for us to make this work in the States. ""Five years ago we raced, it wasn't the best race but it was on a circuit which wasn't built for Formula One cars, but for IndyCar and NASCAR. ""This was built for Formula One. We're hoping it works. Looking at the layout of the circuit and driving it in the simulator, it's pretty cool. There are lots of corners, heavy breaking, long straights for overtaking. So I've got a feeling it's going to be a good weekend."" While F1 has spread around the world to new markets, it has struggled to touch the heartland of U.S. motorsport's fanbase, which favors open-wheel racing -- generally seen as more accessible for fans and competitors alike. ""Racing here, racing in Austin, a very young, vibrant city, we're hopefully going to get a lot of the youngsters interested in the sport,"" Button said. ""Not just as spectators, but actually wanting to be involved in the sport in the future."" Button's future in F1 is tied with McLaren for next season, but he will have a new teammate following Lewis Hamilton's decision to join rivals Mercedes. When Button joined McLaren in 2010 as a newly-crowned world champion, it was hoped he could form an all-British dream partnership with his compatriot. But after three seasons as teammates neither driver has managed to win the title, and a Twitter row erupted in the aftermath of 2008 champion Hamilton's announcement he will move to the German outfit in 2013. Hamilton will end a career-long association with McLaren after the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix next weekend, but Button insists the pair still enjoy an amicable professional relationship. ""We have a very good working relationship,"" Button said. ""We're competitive, as we should be -- you want to beat everyone and that includes your teammate. ""He's extremely fast, he's an extremely talented driver so it makes my life difficult. But I like that, I like that challenge. When we're working together, we share every bit of information, as we should."" Hamilton, who sits fifth in the drivers' standings 12 points and one place above Button, accused his colleague of ""unfollowing"" him -- unsubscribing to his tweets -- on Twitter after October's Japanese Grand Prix. ""Just noticed @jensonbutton unfollowed, thats a shame. After 3 years as teammates, I thought we respected one another but clearly he doesn't,"" Hamilton said via his official Twitter account, which has over one million followers. However, Hamilton, who made his F1 debut with McLaren in 2007, later apologized for the outburst, tweeting: ""My bad, just found out Jenson never followed me. Don't blame him! Need to be on Twitter more!"" Button's new teammate will be young Mexican Sergio Perez, who has made his name in an impressive second season at Sauber. ""He's obviously an exciting talent,"" added Button. ""He's willing to learn, he seems intelligent, those are the three ingredients you need as a racing driver. ""He's only 22, which is quite scary. He's 10 years younger than me which makes me feel very old! I'm looking forward to the partnership. It's a fresh start and it's exciting."" Button has won two races this season, in Australia and Belgium, and finished on the podium another three times. However, last season's runner-up has been frustrated by his inability to challenge both Red Bull's current leader and two-time defending champion Vettel, and Ferrari's Alonso -- who, like the German, is seeking a third world title. ""It's been a tough year,"" Button said. ""You've got to love the wins. The two wins for me were pretty special, but I've also had some pretty bad races. ""I sorted those issues out, but I'd lost so much ground by then it's difficult to fight for the championship. The last few races have been fun, I've really enjoyed it. ""There's been a massive amount of competition between the top four or five teams so the sport's in a great place. It is the best the sport has been for many years, so it's the best time to come back to America and see if it works. ""The racing is great, we've got a lot of top drivers, a lot of top teams, great partners and sponsors involved -- it should work.""","Jenson Button is looking forward to the first F1 grand prix in the United States since 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Whether it's breaking records on the piste, or making hit records in the studio, Tina Maze is determined to do things her way. The 29-year-old, who broke ranks with her national skiing federation to set up her own team, last weekend had the satisfaction of breaking the iconic all-time World Cup points record of the legendary Hermann Maier as she shrugged off pre-race death threats. The Slovenian has celebrated her numerous victories by turning cartwheels and, even more daringly, once famously unzipped her ski suit to reveal her under clothing to photographers after some rivals had wrongly accused her of gaining an aerodynamic advantage by placing padding in her sports bra. But not content with just grabbing the sporting headlines, Maze is also hitting the high notes in a fledgling career as a pop star -- inspired by influences such as Alicia Keys, Jessie J and, of course, Lady Gaga. A leading Slovenian music producer persuaded Maze to record a number he had written. Given her maverick reputation and single-minded approach, the title could not have been more apt:-- ""My Way is My Decision"" -- and it proved an instant hit, quickly reaching No. 1 in the Slovenian charts. The accompanying video -- which sees Maze moving in time to the catchy up tempo song -- has had over a million hits on YouTube. At one point, Maze dons a skiing helmet and uses a ski as a mock guitar, but fooling aside it is clear she has more than a modicum of musical talent. ""It was a new challenge -- I love music,"" she told CNN's Alpine Edge show. ""When I was a kid I played the piano for six years and all my family are musicians."" Having focused relentlessly on her skiing career since her teenage years, Maze is relieved to find an outside distraction in a completely different field. ""I was always looking for something different. Skiing is always so huge, you need so many talents to be fast and be good at this sport,"" she said. ""You need some talent and sensibility which you get with music."" Maze's skiing rivals were already aware of her talents on and off the slopes, and she often entertains her rivals with her piano skills when they stay at exclusive five-star hotels on the tour. When a concert was laid on at the end of the world championships in Schladming in Austria last month, she was quick to grab the microphone and belt out a few numbers. Maze had plenty to celebrate, having won a gold in the super-G and two silvers in the super-combined and giant slalom. Many predicted she would achieve the almost unprecedented feat of winning medals in all five of alpine skiing's disciplines, but tiredness and muscle soreness saw her finish fifth and seventh in the slalom and downhill respectively. But her incredible consistency across all the events has served Maze spectacularly well during the World Cup season, and she clinched the Crystal Globe of overall women's champion with nine events still remaining with victory in the super-G at Meribel a week after the championships at Schladming. It left her in touching distance of the all-time points record of the ""Herminator"" Maier and this was duly achieved with her ninth victory of the season in Saturday's downhill at Garmisch Partenkirchen. It took her past the magic 2,000 points mark of Maier and completed World Cup wins in all five of skiing's disciplines. With echoes of her hit pop video, she celebrated her win this time by using her ski as a guitar, and had time to throw in her trademark cartwheel. But afterwards, Maze revealed that she had received an email death threat, and there was a strong German police presence at Sunday's super-G, where she finished fourth. Typically, she shrugged off the threats. ""It shouldn't be part of the game but life is not perfect. It's not nice for me, it's not nice for my team. They want to ruin your day, ruin the record,"" she told gathered reporters. Maze has had to play second fiddle to the likes of American superstar Lindsey Vonn, the previous holder of the women's points record of 1980, but no longer. ""I've been improving for the past four or five seasons. You didn't see me much before, but I was improving and this season it all fits together,"" she said. Since 2008, Maze has been guided by her Italian coach and boyfriend, Andrea Massi -- going it alone with their team ""aMaze."" It has paid off in spectacular style. ""Winning the overall is a dream I've had since being a young skier. It's everyone's dream."" Vonn's shocking crash in the super-G at the world championships -- she was airlifted off the piste after sustaining a serious knee injury -- tempered Maze's subsequent triumph, and the Slovenian's look of horror and concern for her rival was only too evident. ""I'm really afraid of crashes,"" she admitted. ""I always concentrate 100% to make sure I do not make any mistakes such as happened to Lindsey. ""She was pushing the limits, she always does and that's why she's a great fighter."" Vonn faces a race against time to be fit in time for the Winter Olympics in Sochi next year, where Maze is determined to add to the two silvers she won at the 2010 Games in Vancouver as she carries the hopes of her small nation. ""It's my next major goal, to win a gold that's my goal,"" she said. And don't rule out a return to the top of the music charts (""I'm really proud of that"") by a young woman with talent and a zest for life -- a real crowd-pleaser in every sense.","Tina Maze has rewritten skiing's record books this season .

"(CNN) -- Chinese tennis star Li Na revealed she is reaping the rewards of a brutal preseason training regime after reaching the semifinals of the Australian Open for the third time in four years. Sixth seed Li beat the Poland's world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska on Tuesday 7-5 6-3 to advance to the last four of a major for the first time since becoming Asia's first grand slam singles champion at the 2011 French Open. Last year Li began working with Carlos Rodriguez, former trainer of seven-time grand slam winner Justine Henin, after deciding to end her professional relationship with husband Jiang Shan. ""We train every day for five, six hours, but not only playing tennis,"" the 30-year-old told reporters after setting up a tie with world No. 2 Maria Sharapova. ""Tennis was like maybe two, three hours. Fitness was for two or three hours as well. ""First time I was training with him, I was so excited, but after three days, I was dying. My husband didn't come with me to Beijing. ""I called him and said, 'Carlos is crazy'. He was like, 'Why?' I described the program to him. He was like, 'Don't joke.' I said, 'Hey, listen, I'm not making a joke.' "" Li, the Australian Open runner-up in 2011, said ending her tennis partnership with her husband had caused many people to think they had also ended their personal relationship. ""He was doing a very good job,"" she said. ""But between husband and the coach, it is very tough. Sometimes, if he said 'we should do something' I was feeling tired ... That's why sometimes we have to fight. ""The funny thing is I think two years ago someone said I was divorced. They were asking me. They asked me, 'Li Na, we hear you are divorced.' "" The extra fitness work paid off for Li as she ground out a victory in one hour and 42 minutes against an opponent who had beaten her at the recent Sydney International event and went into Melbourne undefeated with two titles to her name in 2013. ""She's a tough player,"" Li said of Radwanska, who had not dropped a set this year before the match. ""I was feeling against a wall. She can hit everywhere, but without a mistake. You have to focus on every shot. Not every point, every shot. If you hit slow or short, she'll attack."" Sharapova booked her place in the last four with a fifth consecutive straight-sets victory. The four-time grand slam winner made light work of fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova, beating the 19th seed 6-2 6-2. The 2008 Melbourne champion has dropped just nine games en route to the semifinals, a record for the tournament, but dismissed suggestions that her relatively untroubled run to the latter stages would leave her unprepared for Li. She has already earned $500,000 in prize money for just 315 minutes on court -- $1,587.30 a minute -- despite coming into the season's opening grand slam under an injury cloud. ""Well, going into the match, my goal is not really to be tested,"" joked Sharapova, who lost last year's final against world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka. ""If I do come into a situation where I feel like I have to pull through or I'm not playing my best tennis or she's up and I have to find a way to win, then that's what you have on that given day.""","Li Na benefiting from a punishing training regime ahead of the 2013 season .

"(CNN) -- Their Indian owners once talked about pushing Blackburn Rovers into the elite tier of the English Premier League but just 18 months after their takeover, poultry giants Venky's are contemplating relegation. Monday's 1-0 home defeat to Wigan Athletic condemned the former Premier League champions to the second tier amid angry scenes at their Ewood Park home. The club's Scottish manager Steve Kean, who has been subjected to abuse by supporters all season, had to be escorted from the pitch by police as a group of fans invaded the playing surface. After the game Kean insisted he was the man to restore Blackburn's status, telling the match broadcaster: ""We're absolutely devastated. The players are numb inside the dressing room. ""We felt as though we'd done a very good job tonight. It's a massive setback but we'll be back to fight another day. ""What we have to do is regroup. We have to add some established players and we have to look to keep as many of the players together as possible."" Rovers' relegation marked a stark contrast to the bright optimism that greeted their takeover back in November 2010 by Venky's, the first Indian owners of a Premier League club. Back then, they talked of finishing in the top four in the division, and linked themselves with high-profile players like Brazil's World Cup-winning attacker Ronaldinho. But after modest spending and a turbulent season, which also saw their manager banned for drink driving, a late goal from Wigan's Paraguayan defender Antolin Alcaraz sealed their fate. Upon the final whistle, a group of fans took to the pitch as Kean was bundled off the field by security staff and a handful of police. Others in the stands chanted: ""We want Venky's out."" Blackburn won their only Premier League title in 1995 but have failed to challenge since. They were relegated in 1999 but bounced back under former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness two years later. As for Wigan, victory secured their Premier League status and confounded a legion of critics who had written them off as doomed after they lost eight matches in a row at the start of the season. But a recent run of six wins in eight games, which has seen them beat Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle, has cemented their place in the top flight for another year. Meanwhile in France, Montpellier reclaimed their position at the top of the Ligue 1 from big-spending Paris Saint-Germain after a 2-0 victory at Stade Rennes. A strike from Senegal striker Souleymane Camara was added to by an own goal from Benoit Costil, as Montpellier moved three points clear of PSG with two games remaining. Lille kept up their faint hopes of retaining their crown with a 3-0 win over Caen. Tulio De Melo's double ensured they ended the evening five points behind Montpellier and two behind PSG. Bordeaux, 2009 champions, won 4-2 at AJ Auxerre, helped by two goals from Yoan Gouffran while SÃ©bastien Roudet's goal secured a 1-0 win for Sochaux at home to AS Nancy Lorraine.","Blackburn Rovers are relegated from the English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- After 10 years unbeaten, and an incredible 470 successive victories, Esther Vergeer is hanging up her racket. The 31-year-old has dominated wheelchair tennis for more than a decade, winning seven Paralympic gold medals, 13 world titles and all 21 of the grand slam singles events she entered, plus 23 in doubles. ""A special day: officially stopping tennis,"" Vergeer wrote on her Twitter page Tuesday. She won 169 singles titles overall -- 120 of them consecutively -- plus 159 in doubles, and helped the Netherlands win the World Team Cup 12 times. ""I am impressed I got this far. I sometimes still cannot believe that in all these years I did not have a breakdown. But for now it's enough,"" Vergeer told reporters. She was hailed as an inspirational figure by the head of the International Tennis Federation, Francesco Ricci Bitti. ""Esther Vergeer is a tremendous ambassador not only for tennis but also for disability sports,"" Ricci Bitti said. ""She is an inspiration to many. Wheelchair tennis owes her a huge debt of gratitude for her professionalism and her quality as a player. ""Everyone at the ITF wishes her well with her foundation and we know that anything she chooses to do in the future will be a success."" Vergeer began playing wheelchair tennis at the age of 12, having lost the use of her legs four years earlier after complications following spinal surgery. She also played wheelchair basketball, but focused on the racket sport and became world No. 1 for the first time in 1999. Vergeer spent 668 weeks at the top of the rankings, reaching a decade unbeaten on January 30, 2013 -- though her last competitive match was at the London 2012 Paralympics on September 8. ""I took a time-out since London and found out on the court there are no challenges left, but 'outside' there are plenty. For instance the will to give children with a disability an opportunity to play sport all over the world,"" she said, citing the work of her foundation. Her 470 consecutive wins is not a world record; Pakistani squash star Jahangir Khan won 555 successive matches between 1981-86. Another squash player, Heather McKay of Australia, was unbeaten from 1962-1981 and lost only two matches in her entire career. In terms of able-bodied tennis, Martina Navratilova won 74 matches in a row in 1984, while the Open-era men's record is held by Guillermo Vilas (46 wins in 1977). Vergeer's closing career record is 700 wins, 25 losses. As well as her own charity, she has worked closely with the foundation set up by her compatriot Johan Cruyff, one of the most iconic figures in Dutch soccer. Vergeer is a director at the ATP World Tour tennis tournament in Rotterdam, which this week marks its 40th staging with Roger Federer as the defending champion -- and was where she made a tearful announcement about her decision to quit. ""It's still hard and I've got to get used to it. It felt like an addiction, to get everything out of yourself each and every day, the kick of winning in three sets, winning Paralympic titles,"" she said. ""But going on would not add more to my career. I met so many people and situations that inspired me to mean something to others besides the court.""","Wheelchair tennis star Esther Vergeer ends her career, being unbeaten for 10 years .

"(CNN) -- Miguel Angel Jimenez may be the oldest golfer to win on the European Tour, but his lust for life has put a big dent in his hopes of extending that record in 2013. The 48-year-old, known for his love of cigars and fine wine, has been ruled out for at least three months after breaking his leg while skiing in his native Spain at the weekend. ""When I took up skiing I knew the risks that I was taking, but I love it so much I could not stop,"" he told the European Tour website. ""I was going down a hill and lost control briefly and when I fell it was very sore. I knew immediately I had broken something. ""The medical staff at Sierra Nevada took me for an x-ray straight away and I am very thankful to them, as well as all of the staff at the hospital, for their quick and professional response.

"(CNN) -- Sixth seed Juan Martin del Potro suffered a shock third-round defeat at the Australian Open on Saturday losing in five sets to unseeded Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. The former U.S. Open champion and quarter-finalist in Melbourne 12 months ago had dropped just 13 games in his opening two matches, but Chardy soon had the big Argentine on the back foot taking the opening two sets with ease. The third was much closer, finally going del Potro's way in the tiebreak and when the Argentine took the fourth set, Chardy's chances of pulling off an upset looked to have gone. But the 25-year-old Frenchman, who hit 78 winners during the match, rallied to take the fifth and close out an impressive 6-3 6-3 6-7 3-6 6-3 victory in three hours 45 minutes. ""If I wanted to win, I had to take my chances and go for it. I'm very happy when my form is like this against a good player like Juan Martin,"" Chardy, ranked 36th in the world, said. There were few alarms for the other top seeds in the men's draw. World No.2 Roger Federer saw off home favorite Bernard Tomic in straight sets 6-4 7-6 6-1 to set up a fourth round clash with Milos Raonic. The 13th seed from Canada also recorded a comfortable win (7-6 6-3 6-4) over 17th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber from Germany. Andy Murray is also safely through to the fourth round after beating Lithuanian qualifier Ricardas Berankis 6-3 6-4 7-5. The Briton will play Gilles Simon for a place in the quarter finals after the Frenchman prevailed in a close-fought five setter (6-4 6-4 4-6 1-6 8-6) against compatriot Gael Monfils. The match, which took nearly four-and-three-quarter hours, included an incredible 71-shot rally in the second set which lasted two minutes and nine seconds. No.21 seed Andreas Seppi progresses to the last 16 in Melbourne for the first time after beating Croatian 12th seed Marin Cilic in five sets 6-7 6-3 2-6 6-4 6-2. The 2008 finalist and seventh seed, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga demolished Slovakia's Blaz Kavcic 6-2 6-1 6-4 to set up a fourth round meeting with compatriot Richard Gasquet who also completed a straight-sets victory (6-3 7-6 6-0) over Ivan Dodig.

Defending champion and top seed Victoria Azarenka was made to work harder on Saturday. The 23-year-old prevailed in three sets 6-4 4-6 6-2 over Jamie Hampton from the U.S. and will face Russia's Elena Vesnina in the fourth round after she beat 16th seed Roberta Vinci 4-6 7-6 6-4.

"New York (CNN) -- Twelve firefighters from Ladder Company 3 who lost their lives trying to save people at the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, were honored Wednesday in a ceremony at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Fire Department of New York Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano, firefighters, family members and friends watched as the company's truck, covered in a white sheet, returned permanently to the site where the Trade Center towers once stood. The 60,000-pound truck had been maintained by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in a climate-controlled room, according to a press release from the 9/11 Memorial Museum. It was escorted to the former site of the World Trade Center by the current Ladder 3 truck. The fire department bagpipe band, the FDNY Emerald Society Pipes and Drums, played ""America the Beautiful"" as the truck was lowered to its permanent location, 70 feet below ground level. ""We will never forget the heroism of the hundreds of firefighters and other first responders who rushed into those burning towers on September 11,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. ""The sacrifice of the Ladder 3 Company and the FDNY is something that should be honored by us all. Their names, along with the other courageous first responders who perished, will be permanently etched in bronze on the memorial and their truck will be preserved in the museum as a legacy of their heroism."" ""All the memories come back, all the emotions,"" Robert Sweeney, chief of operations for the fire department, told CNN Wednesday. ""Some anger, some pride in the department."" The firefighters from the East Village neighborhood company were conducting search-and-rescue efforts in the North Tower when the structure collapsed, Sweeney said. The finished memorial is to include two waterfalls and reflecting pools surrounded by more than 400 trees and bronze plates inscribed with the names of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. The memorial will be opened to 9/11 victims' family members on the 10-year anniversary of the attacks on September 11 of this year and will open to the public the next day.","Ladder Company 3's truck is put in place at the 9/11 Memorial .

"(CNN)  -- They learned as children that the world is a scary place where strangers with hatred in their hearts steer planes into buildings, grown-ups cry for days and everything can change in an instant. They grew up with color-coded terror alerts and long lines at airport metal detectors. They saw the economy sputter. And still, the bad guys appeared to get away with it. Osama bin Laden was their bogeyman, the monster under the bed. Now the 9/11 generation has come of age. Children who were 8, 9 or 10 when the World Trade Center towers fell and the Pentagon burned are in college. So when the news came that bin Laden was dead, it was young people across the country -- from the campuses of Penn State to American University to Vanderbilt to Stanford --­ who filled the streets with a chorus of cheers, honking horns and fireworks that lasted well into the wee hours of Monday morning. Check out iReport's Open Story for world reaction . For the 9/11 generation ­-- the label experts give to a subgroup of the millennial generation or generation Net -- it was a celebration of America's renewed strength under a president they helped elect. To them, bin Laden wasn't so much a person as an embodiment of all things scary and evil, said Dr. Patricia Somers, an education professor who has studied college students affected by 9/11. ""They were celebrating a symbol,"" she told CNN over the phone from her office at the University of Texas in Austin. The 9/11 generation, Somers said, actually is made up of two subgroups -- children who were in high school or college when the terror attacks occurred, and those who were in elementary school. The experience for the older children was less filtered; many watched live television reports of the attacks in their living rooms and classrooms. The elementary school children were more sheltered, a conscious decision by parents and educators to spare them from trauma. They experienced 9/11 in later installments, through memorials and anniversaries. The older group can remember a safe ""before,"" Somers said. The younger ones, 10 years later, may not even recall a time when there was not a war on terror. Members of the 9/11 generation seem to have more in common with their grandparents than their parents; both experienced attacks from outsiders with a clearly identifiable evil frontman ­ -- Adolf Hitler during World War II and bin Laden during 9/11. Students who grew up near New York City feel the effects of 9/11 more deeply than others, ­no matter their age at the time. They are more likely to know someone who died that day. The attacks are part of the region's shared experience. At Rutgers University, 30 miles from New York, students in the communications department are compiling a narrative of the experiences of children who lost a parent at the World Trade Center. For many, it means profiling people from their hometowns in New Jersey. Those experiences appear to have shaped their reactions to bin Laden's death. When the news broke, Rutgers junior Megan Schuster immediately thought of the Hargrave sisters -- Corinne, Casey and Amy -- whom she interviewed for the 9/11 Project. The girls' father, T.J., a former soap star and executive at Cantor Fitzgerald, died as the twin towers fell. Read Megan Schuster's essay . Schuster was troubled by the exuberant reaction to bin Laden's death. ""I don't like the concept of 'celebrating' death,"" she said. ""Killing bin Laden does not bring back the lives of all those lost on 9/11. I think it teaches the encouragement of death. But death is not the answer."" Senior Travis Fedschun was glued to the television for updates. He said he didn't feel like celebrating, even if capturing bin Laden seemed to be the first thing that had gone right for the United States in a long time. His thoughts turned to the teenager he interviewed for the Rutgers project, Kaila Starita, who lost her father, Anthony. He worked at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""Families don't use the word closure.

Added a fellow student working on the project, senior David Seamon: ""It's not for us to say whether or not bin Laden's death will help a fatherless teenager sleep better at night.""

Jennifer Lilonsky is 24, at least a couple years older than the other students working on the project, and knows her perspective is darker because she was ""less sheltered"" from the horror. ""The truth is that it will never end. That is the goal of terrorism,"" she said. ""This is not justice. There will never be justice. ... Even the end of his life alone brings fear."" Read Jennifer Lilonsky's insights . Experts who have studied the 9/11 generation say its members are more patriotic, more politically aware, more socially conscious and more plugged in than previous generations. So yes, American flags were waved, not burned, on campuses Sunday night. Chants of ""U-S-A! U-S-A!"" thundered as if killing a terrorist was an Olympic event. ""We were young at the time of the September 11 attacks, so we have grown up with this constantly in our minds,"" Chris McDonald, a student at Vanderbilt, told CNN's iReport. ""To see justice delivered after such a long, hard wait is a feeling of unspeakable happiness."" Noah Gray, an American University student who joined the celebrants in front of the White House, said a friend summed up how his generation feels in a tweet on Sunday night: ""Osama was the first person I was ever taught to hate. I waited 10 years, but now it's done. Unreal."" But not everyone of that generation felt unbridled joy. Betsy Mitchell, a 19-year-old student at East Carolina University, said she was ridiculed on Facebook for tempering her glee. ""Celebrate our military, celebrate America for standing tall, don't celebrate the fall,"" she said. ""I did not like it when the terrorists celebrated killing Americans, I don't like it when we do the same thing. Yes, bin Laden needed to die, but he is still a human being."" Ohio State University student Robert Peterson told iReport that he had second thoughts as ""people ran through the streets, blowing noisemakers and shouting in happiness"" but he didn't judge the revelers. ""I do not feel it is right to celebrate the death of a person, but what we are seeing here is the demise of terrorism. Thus, I am not so much enamored for the death of bin Laden as I am for progression toward a safer, less violent world."" Belief blog: Partying made me cringe Belief blog: Making no apologies . Somers, the University of Texas education professor, led a widely quoted study of 9/11's impact on college students. She said bin Laden's death represents ""the end of an era"" for them. ""But there will still be terrorism, and there will still be terrorist attacks. Everybody was celebrating Sunday night, but then a sobering realization comes to them. It's been 10 years, and it was a rough 10 years,"" she said. Somers based her study on what is known as Terror Management Theory. People who face their own mortality after acts of terrorism respond by seeking meaning and purpose in their lives, she explained. After 9/11, most Americans reacted with shock, disbelief, a need to huddle with friends and family and retreat from gatherings of large groups. Some bought guns or stocked up on duct tape and canned goods. Others searched for information. But among college students, Somers witnessed more lasting reactions. As the initial shock wore off, many students became intensely patriotic. Then, some questioned their patriotism, asking, ""Do we have to accept everything the government does?"" They grew interested in politics. Giving blood after the attacks fed a growing civic-mindedness, and they volunteered for charitable groups. Some even changed majors or signed up for military duty. ""Right after 9/11, we had the new normal,"" Somers said. ""Maybe this is the newest normal.""","College campuses erupted in celebration at news of Osama bin Laden's death .

"(CNN) -- Like so many Americans across the country, I was shocked when I heard of the attacks at the Boston Marathon. A part of me immediately traveled back to when I was cheering runners myself as a student at Wellesley College, the midpoint for the marathon, a time when such dangers as bombings never crossed our minds. Boston is an indelible part in the personal history and identity of those who have lived or attended school in the city. That someone had detonated bombs at an event that symbolized unity in a place known for its rich diversity and as a birthplace of our nation's freedom was heartbreaking. This last week has seen a whirlwind of fighting in a dramatic manhunt, leaving an entire city on lockdown and lives in danger. I am heartened to hear stories where the human spirit rose above the ugliness and absolute horror facing the community. Law enforcement officers and other first responders risked their lives to help others. Several marathoners ran straight to the hospital to give blood, and doctors rushed to hospitals. A restaurant opened its doors and offered free food to its neighbors while they were stuck in a lockdown. It is these testaments of unity and heroism that make us stronger. Bostonians are coming together and helping each other because, as U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said, ""When tragedy strikes, we are ... one family. We hurt together, we help each other together."" We have, sadly, seen less than stellar moments in our nation's response to these attacks. A New Yorker in the Bronx says he was viciously beaten soon after the Boston Marathon -- he was mistaken for ""Arab,"" and believes the attack was motivated by the bombings. A mother in Malden, Massachusetts, who was wearing the traditional Islamic head covering, says she was punched in the shoulder by a man shouting anti-Muslim slurs while blaming Muslims for the Boston bombings. While most leaders and media have been measured in their tone, we have seen some jump to conclusions or incite vitriol against their fellow Americans, the most outrageous of which was commentator Erik Rush tweeting, ""Let's kill them all,"" referring to Muslims. He later claimed it was sarcasm but then wrote on a social network site: ""It's nice to see all the Islamist apologists standing up for those who would waste them in a heartbeat."" As we learn more about the two brothers who are suspected of these horrific crimes, Americans should not let anyone, especially those who seek to instill fear, tear our nation apart. Emotions and frustrations are running high, and as we grapple to make sense of the tragedy, it is critical for all Americans to refrain from scapegoating any group of people or targeting innocent Americans based on their racial, religious and ethnic identity. As Americans, we were all proud of the way most citizens in this tragedy responded. Bystanders, first responders, marathoners and law enforcement rushed to do what they could. These good people came from every faith and background, reflecting the rich diversity that makes our country great. We must remember that the same thing that defined our strength on that day should define our strength in response -- a nation that unites people from every faith, culture and background in a common purpose. We stand taller, braver and united when we stand together. And that is something no criminal should ever be able to take from us. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Erik Rush was a Fox News contributor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Farhana Khera.","Farhana Khera loves Boston, went to Wellesley College, halfway point of marathon .

"London (CNN) -- Controversial Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli will be given another chance after being caught in a heated training ground bust-up with manager Roberto Mancini on Thursday. Photographers outside the English Premier League champions' training ground captured images of the pair grappling, prompting coaching staff to intervene to separate them. Balotelli then walked off the pitch, before leaving the training ground about 10 minutes later. The flamboyant 22-year-old has infuriated his manager on several occasions since being signed from Inter Milan for $39.1 million in 2010. Mancini recently said that the Italy international needed to train harder to make the playing team, and once threatened he may never play for Manchester City again after he was sent off during a defeat at Arsenal. But in a statement on the club's website, Mancini -- who the photographs suggest was the aggressor, repeatedly tugging the player's clothes -- downplayed the exchange, which was sparked by Balotelli's hostile challenge on Scott Sinclair. ""Mario made a tackle on his teammate that I would prefer to see in a game, and not against a teammate,"" said Mancini. ""I asked him to leave the pitch -- he said no, so I moved him off. That's all that happened and it was nothing more than that."" The Italian described the incident as ""nothing unusual"" and insisted it had ""already been forgotten."" Balotelli appeared at the club as usual for training on Friday. ""My thoughts have not changed about him and these things happen from time to time,"" Mancini said. ""Will Mario have more chances? I will give him 100 chances as long as I can see him trying to improve and working hard for this football club."" The gifted but inconsistent performer's relationship with his club and manager have often been strained, prompting Mancini to once remark after a match that if Balotelli had been a teammate during his own playing days, he may have given him a punch in the head every day. Since his arrival in the UK, Balotelli has made headlines for setting his house on fire with fireworks, handing out wads of money to the homeless, tussling with teammates on the pitch and throwing darts at his club's youth team players. His poor disciplinary record, which saw him miss a total of 11 domestic and European games through suspension during the past season, led the club to dock him two weeks' wages. Balotelli appealed to an English Premier League tribunal over the fine, but recently dropped the matter in a gesture the club described as ""a sign of respect for Roberto Mancini, the supporters and the club."" Despite Balotelli's failure to impress on the pitch this season, Mancini recently insisted the club would not be selling the striker during the January transfer window, stressing his ""love"" for his fiery compatriot -- who he also managed at Inter. ""I think Mario will stay but the future depends mostly on him,"" he told Italian media. ""The relationship between me and him is always good, even if one day he does something. I love him because for many years we live together. I've seen him grow. But the professional relationship is another thing and I've told Mario what I need from him. ""The time of cheap talk is over. Balotelli is 22 years old and now it's time to be professional. I ask from him seriousness and commitment in training, a more stable private life and correct behavior on the pitch.""","Mario Balotelli and Roberto Mancini were embroiled in bust up in training on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- It's not just clothes, shoes, sofas and other household goods that are on sale right now -- plenty of footballers are up for grabs as well. The January transfer window opened on New Year's day in Europe -- 31 days of opportunity for clubs, be they title chasing or relegation haunted, to reinvent their season. A window of opportunity for players to seek pastures new. A window of opportunity for fans to dream afresh. And a window of opportunity for agents and lawyers -- football's middle men -- to secure their cut from these transfers. The biggest deal so far was actually arranged during the previous transfer window, in August. Brazil international Lucas Moura has now signed a four-and-a-half-year contract to join big-spending French club Paris St. Germain from Sao Paulo in a transfer worth an initial $52.8 million, with up to $6.6m in bonuses. File under bargain . Within hours of this window opening, struggling English Premier League club Reading confirmed the signing of Sporting Lisbon captain Daniel Carrico. The 24-year-old former Portugal Under-21 defender has signed an initial two-and-a-half-year contract, with the option of a further year, after Reading paid $990,000 for him. By all accounts Reading have snagged a bargain. Over in Italy, Inter Milan's Wesley Sneijder, who has not played for the Serie A club since September -- partly due to injury, partly due to a dispute over his contract -- is another player likely to move during the January window. The 28-year-old is one of football's highest-paid players, but he has struggled to regain the heights of 2010 when he helped the Netherlands reach the World Cup final after a treble-winning season with Inter, who are keen to reduce their wage bill. Speculation also surrounds the playing futures of a host of other players, including the likes of Barcelona striker David Villa and midfielder Frank Lampard of Chelsea. "" I think it'll be reasonably quiet in continental Europe, but I can see a few high profile moves happening in England,"" Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN. ""In the English Premier League the stakes are so high as regards to television money that in certain scenarios it does actually make sense to spend relatively heavily in an effort to secure an objective, be it a higher table position or staying up."" Buyer beware . Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has called the January transfer window ""the silly season"". That is because clubs are loathe to sell their best players midway through the season and if they do more often than not will slap a premium on the departing star, just as Liverpool did when they sold Fernando Torres to Chelsea for $80m in 2011, with the Anfield club subsequently paying Newcastle $57m for Andy Carroll. Those two transfers perhaps best demonstrate the danger of buying in January, with Torres only just starting to recapture the form he showed at Liverpool, while Carroll is now on loan at West Ham. It is not just the transfer fee and the players' wages that clubs also have to take into consideration when they sign a star -- there is also the cost incurred by employing the agents who oil the wheels of every transfer deal. Between October 1, 2011 and September 30, 2012, English Premier League clubs spent over $123 million on fees to agents, who fill a dual role -- sometimes working for clubs, while also representing players. It is a competitive business. In England there are 493 licensed agents, Italy has 937, Spain has 559, while Brazil has 291, according to the FIFA website. ""There are too many agents chasing too few players of commercial potential which leads to a ruthless, cut-throat industry,"" wrote lawyer and agent Mel Stein recently,  estimating that there is a ratio of one agent for every six professional players in England. Even before the window had opened Newcastle found themselves at the sharp end of that ""cut-throat industry"" as Chelsea expressed an interest in signing Magpies striker Demba Ba. Representatives of the Senegal international, who has an $11.3m release clause in his Newcastle contract, held talks with Chelsea on Sunday, which were described as unproductive. Yet by Wednesday Chelsea had triggered the release clause in Ba's contract and Newcastle finally gave the 27-year-old permission to speak to the European Champions League holders. The role of Ba's representatives -- according to UK media reports his agents want to share fees of $3.25m -- has irked Newcastle manager Alan Pardew. ""In some respects I feel a little bit sorry for Demba,"" said Pardew. ""There are people out there fueling this who are not actually involved or want to be involved and that's the sort of world that we are in."" Ba's official agent is Alexandre Gontran. CNN was unable to reach him via phone or email, but another source close to the negotiations dismissed the 27-year-old forward's reported demand for a signing on fee of £2m ($3.25m) and a weekly wage of £100,000 ($163,000) as ""ludicrous."" ""When I negotiate a transfer I try to do a deal where everybody comes out a winner -- the selling and buying club, the player and the agent,"" added the source, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of such negotiations. However, the regulation of agents is proving cause for concern for world governing body FIFA. With as few as 25-30% of international transfers concluded using licensed agents, FIFA wants to ditch the system for regulating them. ""A possible new approach could be to regulate the conduct of clubs and players, and extend the scope of the regulations to include all kinds of intermediaries,"" FIFA said in November. ""In other words, the regulations would stop attempting to regulate access to the activity, and instead control the activity itself. ""Players and clubs could choose any parties as intermediaries, but would have to meet certain criteria and respect certain principles. This approach would also result in the annulment of the current licensing system."" But FIFA's hopes of reforming the agents' regulations have met opposition from a number of leading football associations, and for the time being the idea of deregulation has been kicked into the long grass. Not that the agents are particularly happy with how the current system works, with one describing it as a ""joke."" ""I belong to a generation of agents that had to make a deposit of $219,000 to get the license,"" said Brazilian agent Paulo Teixeira. ""I got mine in 1997 as co-founder of the Associaçao Brasileira Agentes FIFA. There were only seven of us and we were called 'the Golden Seven.' ""Then the deposit was dropped, replaced by an insurance scheme, which had to be done in every country. The FIFA agent concept disappeared then, and licenses had to be issued by every association. ""If you want a license, I can show you the way to get one for a maximum of $6,600."" Administrative backlog . Where huge sums of money are involved, disputes invariably follow, thereby providing an administrative headache for FIFA, which has to deal with 3,500 complaints a year relating to transfers. One French agent, Malick Coulibaly, who is still waiting for a decision over a complaint he filed to FIFA in September 2010 over a transfer, is so fed up with the backlog that he is trying organize a petition among agents to bring about reform of the system. ""A lot of agents or players called me to tell me about their problem with too long a delay. There is a one-session trial per month, which is incredible for the number of cases,"" he said. ""These delays break careers of players and lead to a lot of collapses of business for agents because many of them don't pursue litigation."" A FIFA spokesman said that type of delay was ""very unusual from the cases I've had to help provide answers to in the past."" The more you delve into the world of transfers the riskier business it appears. If buyers should beware of rushing to find a bargain in the January sales, agents and players might also proceed with caution.","Football's January transfer window opened on New Year's day in Europe .

"(CNN) -- Second seed Maria Sharapova dropped just four games on Friday as she swept aside six-time grand slam winner Venus Williams 6-1 6-3 in the third round of the Australian Open. The win continued Sharapova's imperious recent of form. The Russian, a winner of the Melbourne event in 2008, became the first woman to not concede a single game in her first two matches at a grand slam since 1985. Sharapova lost to world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in last year's final, but she already looks well placed to go one better in 2013 ahead of a fourth round encounter with Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens. Former world No. 1 Williams has endured a tough time since winning her most recent grand slam title in 2008. She was forced to withdraw from the 2011 U.S. Open having been diagnosed with the auto immune disorder Sjogren's syndrome. ""I was a really determined player out there because I knew the tennis she's capable of producing and playing,"" Sharapova told reporters. ""Despite what she's ranked or seeded, it doesn't matter when you go out on the court. She's been there. ""She's experienced enough to know no matter if you're playing the third round, the quarters or the final, you have to be ready. ""I certainly was. Since the draw came out, I was really looking forward to that match-up."" It was a good day for the top seeds in the women's draw, with Chinese No. 6 seed Li Na easing past Romanian No. 27 Sorana Cirstea 6-4 6-1. Li, who became Asia's first grand slam singles champion when she triumphed at the 2011 French Open, remains on course for a semifinal meeting with Sharapova, provided she can progress from her round four match with 18th seed Julia Goerges. Fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska was rarely troubled as she beat British No. 1 Heather Watson 6-3 6-1. The 2012 Wimbledon runner-up will now play former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic, who advanced from an all-Serbian encounter with Jelena Jankovic. German Angelique Kerber ended U.S. rookie Madison Keys' run at her first grand slam. The fifth seed progressed courtesy of a 6-2 7-5 success. In the men's draw, top seed Novak Djokovic was made to work on his way to a 6-4 6-3 7-5 win against Czech Radek Stepanek. Next up for the defending champion is Switzerland Stanislas Wawrinka after the No. 15 got the better of American Sam Querrey. ""I wasn't expecting an easy match coming into the third round and playing a seeded player,"" Djokovic told a post-match press conference, on the same day he also condemned former seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong. ""(Stepanek) loves the big stage. You saw how much fun he had. I also had a lot of fun playing. It was a very entertaining match."" Djokovic's fellow Serb Janko Tipsarevic was made to work for his spot in round four. The world No. 8 came from two sets to one down to win 3-6 6-4 2-6 6-4 6-3 in a match which lasted three-and-a-half-hours. Fourth seed David Ferrer and No.5 Tomas Berdych both continued their strong starts to the tournament. Spain's Ferrer recorded a 6-4 6-2 6-3 win over 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis, while Berdych of the Czech Republic eased to a 6-3 6-2 6-2 success against Austrian Jurgen Melzer.","Second seed Maria Sharapova storms past Venus Williams at Australian Open .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- We've become used to a world where what we buy is determined by what products are stocked by a handful of chain stores, but there are signs that may be changing. The future could be one of thriving cottage industries and skilled artisans lovingly producing custom-made wares. An ""apple jacket,"" by jacquelineknits, is just one of the handmade items you can find on Etsy. That's the vision of Etsy, a U.S.-based Web site that describes itself as ""an online crafts fair."" But unlike your local Sunday-morning market, Etsy's crafts fair has some 200,000 stall holders, who have this year sold just under $50 million-worth of their homemade goods. The site was conceived and launched in 2005 by Rob Kalin, a carpenter, among other things, who was looking for somewhere to sell his work online. At the time, the only real outlet was eBay, but Kalin was looking for something different, something that would provide a place for small-time artisans to sell their creations. But according to Etsy, the site is more than simply a good business opportunity. ""One of our goals is to change the way the economy works. It's become normal for people to buy online and the spread of the online buying culture means it has become very democratic. If you have a computer and camera and you like to make things, you can make and sell anything you want. I consider it liberating for people,"" an Etsy spokesman told CNN. If the site's popularity is anything to go buy, it's a model that's proved tremendously successful. But the reason for that success is that Etsy has tapped into a growing pool of crafters and a demand for handmade goods. In the U.S. especially, there has recently been a resurgence in the popularity of handmade goods. The idea has even emerged of crafting as a form of political activism -- the term ""Craftivism"" has been coined to describe the idea of 'making your own' as a statement against runaway consumerism and the homogeneity of mass production. A survey carried out by Etsy earlier this year revealed the average age of its crafter/sellers to be 35 -- a far cry from the stereotypical image of grandma knitting a scarf in her rocking chair. Tapping into that zeitgeist, Etsy has tried to create a crafting community by hosting online crafting workshops and offering advice on how to turn a hobby into a business. The site encourages interaction between crafters, but crucially, it enables interaction between buyers and sellers. ""Anyone can go to, say, H&M and get a sweater, but then you have the same sweater as millions of people, but there's no real meaning to it. It's really great to be able talk to the person who made something that you now own -- it gives it another layer of meaning and specialness that a lot of people are looking to find,"" said the spokesman. Do you prefer handmade to mass produced? Interestingly, Etsy also offers a service called Alchemy, where buyers request a specific product they want made, along with a deadline and price range, and sellers bid to provide that product for a certain fee. That concept of 'merchandise on demand' turns the idea of mass production on its head, but British Web site Kings of Neon takes the idea one stage further. Designer Adam Duffy set up Kings of Neon when he realized there was a demand for customized sneakers. As well as adorning plain white plimsolls with his own colorful creations, Duffy lets his customers send him their own graphics, which he turns into a design for them. ""Personally, I've never bought anything mass produced. I think fashion is about being individual and not wearing the same thing as everything else, otherwise it almost becomes a uniform,"" Duffy told CNN. Next month he intends to launch a new site that will allow users to create their own designs online, an extension of the shoe customizing offered by NikeiD and Vans, which let you personalize your sneakers' color scheme online. The design-your-own trend is growing and it's not just limited to sneakers. Zazzle.com lets you customize your own T-shirts, mugs, plates, skateboards, postcards, ties, aprons and pretty much anything else that has a printed image on it. It's just a matter of importing the image you want to use, adding some text, if that's what you want, and clicking 'ok.' The result won't make Gucci lose any sleep, but it will be unique. While it's very different experience from that offered by Etsy, Zazzle does have tools that let you sell your designs on their Web site. At first glance, U.S. online T-shirt firm Threadless is a similar proposition, but what sets Threadless apart is the way it determines which T-shirt designs it sells. Threadless lets members of the public send in their own T-shirt designs, which are then displayed on its website. The site's 800,000 users can view the designs and vote for the ones they'd like to see printed. Each week, six designs, selected from around 800 submissions, make it onto T-shirts, which are then sold on the Web site. The designers receive $2,000 in cash and $500 in gift certificates. What's clever about the Threadless method is that it means the T-shirts it manufactures have always been extensively market tested -- by the same target market it's pitching its product to. It's an example of what has become known as 'crowdsourcing' -- getting members of the public to collectively perform a task usually done by a professional. Although the term has been applied to some very different projects, at its best it's profoundly democratic -- and it's made possible by the Internet. Kings of Neon, Zazzle and Threadless can only exist because the Internet allows interaction between buyer and seller. Similarly, Kalin started Etsy because he couldn't afford to rent a physical shop in New York to sell his work from. By providing a virtual shop floor, and a potentially huge passing trade, the internet is a leveler that allows the artisan to compete with the chain store. With the idea of designing-your-own gaining currency, the emergence of a growing army of crafters, and a way for them to sell their product, all that's needed for a shopping revolution is a consuming public ready to ditch the chain stores in favor of the artisans. EBay recently announced a new web venture called Worldofgood.com, which will provide a shop front for all manner of mostly handmade, ethically supplied goods from around the world. The idea is similar to Etsy, but with a global, 'fair trade' spin, and the involvement of web giant eBay is a sure sign that handmade has gone mainstream. ""In my opinion, in the U.S. and the western world there is a backlash now. Brand names were really popular in the 80s and 90s, but now I think people are kind of tired of that -- they want something that's more tailored to them,"" Etsy's spokesman said. If he's right, and we see a growth in craftspeople and artisans selling directly to the public, then the commerce of the future may bear an uncanny resemblance to that of the past.","U.S.-based Web site ""Etsy"" is 'an online crafts fair' with 200,000 sellers .

"(CNN) -- After eight years as senator from New York, Hillary Clinton is trading places, moving from Congress to the incoming administration. Former President Bill Clinton has been mentioned as a possible replacement for his wife in the Senate. On Monday, President-elect Barack Obama announced that he asked his former rival to be his secretary of state. That means the scramble begins to replace Clinton on Capitol Hill. Among those mentioned to take her seat as New York's junior senator is her husband, former President Bill Clinton. At a news conference in Chicago, Illinois, on Monday, after Obama announced her selection, Clinton said she wanted to ""thank my fellow New Yorkers who have, for eight years, given me the joy of a job I love with the opportunity to work on issues I care deeply, in a state that I cherish."" Clinton added that ""leaving the Senate is very difficult for me."" The task of choosing a successor falls to David Paterson, New York's Democratic governor. Whomever he picks would serve for two years, before a special election in November 2010 to decide who fills the last two years of Clinton's term. Paterson has a strong bench to choose from. There are a number of contenders, including at least eight members of New York's delegation in the House of Representatives, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion, Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi, Caroline Kennedy, and her cousin, Robert Kennedy Jr. ""This is not an election. This is not a campaign. It's a constituency of one. David Paterson. It's all about what the governor wants to do,"" said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report. ""Paterson has said he would prefer someone from upstate New York, or a woman or an Hispanic candidate,"" Rothenberg said. As for some of the more unconventional picks, Rothenberg said Paterson could ""try to make a splash with a big name like Robert Kennedy Jr."" or a ""quirky interesting pick"" of someone like Caroline Kennedy, who is not a politician. But some are suggesting the former president should take his wife's seat. In an op-ed column last week in The Washington Post, journalists Karl Meyer and Shareen Blair Brysac urged Paterson to ""send Bill Clinton to the Senate."" If that happened, Clinton would become the third former president to go from the White House to Capitol Hill. President John Quincy Adams lost his re-election bid in 1828. Two years later he returned to Washington after winning election as a congressman from his home state of Massachusetts. He served in the House of Representatives until his death in 1848. President Andrew Johnson also served as a Senator from Tennessee in 1875, 7 years after the Senate acquitted him of impeachment charges. He died a few months after taking office. Bill Clinton would bring gravitas to the job, and he obviously knows his way around Washington. But some Democratic strategists who used to work for Bill Clinton don't think the former president would want to go from leader of the free world to being the junior senator from New York. Clinton's office deferred to Paterson's office when asked for a comment. In a statement released Monday in which he praised the choice of Hillary Clinton for the nation's top diplomatic post, Paterson said, ""In order to appoint the best possible candidate to replace Sen. Clinton, I am consulting with a wide variety of individuals from all across New York State. ""I expect to announce Sen. Clinton's replacement when the position becomes officially vacant,"" he said.","Sen. Clinton tapped to be secretary of state in Obama administration .
New York Gov. Paterson will name Clinton replacement in the Senate .
Appointed senator will serve two years before special election .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From Dallas, Texas to Dabancheng, China, energy companies are staking fortunes on harnessing wind power. Texan energy companies are investing heavily to build wind turbines following a landmark ruling last week. Several Texan transmission companies announced Monday they were forming a consortium to invest in the $5 billion cost of building new power lines to take advantage of the state's vast wind power. The consortium, comprised of existing transmission operators, includes Dallas-based Oncor, the state's largest power delivery company, Electric Transmission Texas (ETT) and units of American Electric Power Co. among others. Those new lines, dubbed by Oncor as a ""renewable energy superhighway,"" will accommodate about 18,500 megawatts of wind generation by 2012-- enough energy to power 4 million homes. Texas currently leads the nation in wind capacity at about 5,500 MW. The companies are hoping to take advantage of a landmark ruling on Friday that gave Texas preliminary approval for a $4.9 billion plan to build transmission lines to carry wind power from West Texas to urban areas. It is said to be the largest investment in clean, renewable energy in U.S. history. Texas citizens will have to assist with the plan's construction; paying an extra $3 to $4 per month on their bills for the next few years. However, they stand to recoup these costs in what they will save in energy bills later. Not surprisingly, energy companies are eager to jump on the bandwagon to build a large part of the superhighway.   Oncor Senior Vice President of Transmission Charles Jenkins said in a news release: ""At Oncor we want to be an important part of the solution. Texas is already a leader in wind energy and this is the next step in maintaining that leadership position. The wind energy industry has benefited from the support of billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens, who is planning to build the world's largest wind farm on about 200,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle. When completed, his 2,700 turbines will be capable of producing enough electricity to power 1.3 million homes. Pickens spoke to CNN about his plans to increase reliance on natural resources like wind and solar. He said: ""What I want to do is to fold in the great resource we have in the central part of this country, which is wind. And then you have resource from Texas west to California. ""You've got solar. Those two resources have to be developed. So when you develop the wind, you can then remove natural gas from power generation and put it into a transportation fuel market. ""Wind power is ... clean, it's renewable. It's everything you want. And it's a stable supply of energy. It's unbelievable that we have not done more with wind."" Meanwhile, China could well be on its way to blowing the U.S. out of the water when it comes to harnessing wind energy. This is a rare energy success story for a country whose carbon emissions were recorded as the highest in the world last year, according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. But the Chinese energy revolution has been quietly gaining strength, observers say. Like their American counterparts, Chinese tycoons are increasingly directing their investment into renewable power. Zhu Yuguo, ranks at 102 on the Forbes China Rich List, with a personal fortune of 5.71 billion Yuan and has invested heavily in the wind power industry. Steve Sawyer of the Global Wind Energy Council said: ""China's wind energy market is unrecognizable from two years ago."" ""It is huge, huge, huge. But it is not realized yet in the outside world,"" Sawyer said in an interview with London's Guardian newspaper. China's wind generation has increased by more than 100 percent per year since 2005 and 20 per cent of the power supply to the venues of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games will come from wind generators, according to the official state agency, Xinhua. It was initially hoped the country would generate 5 gigawatts of wind by 2010, but that goal was met three years early in 2007. The 2010 goal has now been revised to 10 gigawatts but experts say this could well hit 20 gigawatts. The Guanting Wind Farm in Beijing has installed capacity of 64.5 megawatts and has supplied 35 million kilowatts of electricity to Beijing so far. The wind farm is estimated to supply 100 million KWH per year to Beijing, or 300,000 KWH per day, enough to satisfy the consumption of 100,000 households. However, China still relies heavily on using coal, which supplies 70 per cent of China's energy needs. But Junfeng Li of the China Renewable Energy Industries Association has a more optimistic outlook. In a paper last month, he wrote: ""China is witnessing the start of a golden age of wind power development and the magnitude of the growth has caught policymakers off guard. ""It is widely believed that wind power will be able to compete with coal generation by as early as 2015.""","Texas energy group launch bid to develop ""renewable energy superhighway""

"(CNN) -- Robert Richards' love affair with the stars began when he was just a child. ""I'm an orphan of Apollo; I grew up with the Star Trek generation,"" he says. Bob Richards: Aiming for the Moon . Richards was just one of many children left wide-eyed and inspired by the moon landings. But for him, they were a false start. ""I had this enormous expectation that I would have an experience in space. It just didn't happen,"" Richards says. Man stepped on the moon, but only to prove a point. ""We faltered,"" he explains. ""We didn't continue our operations on the moon; we didn't go to Mars."" Now, Richards and his colleagues are bringing their childhood dreams to life, as part of the burgeoning NewSpace movement, which has sparked a renaissance in space exploration. The children of the moon landings have grown up: they now hold the positions of power to make their dreams come alive. ""They want to make the world of 'Star Trek,' of '2001,' and now ... they're in charge of NASA, they're in charge of the private companies, and they're making it happen,"" he explains. Richards says his path to the stars was ""inevitable."" Inspired by science fiction authors like his friend, Arthur C. Clarke, visionaries like Carl Sagan and movies like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" he studied aerospace and industrial engineering at Ryerson University, then physics and astronomy at the University of Toronto, before moving to Cornell to study space science, where he became special assistant to Sagan. Now, Richards is the ringleader behind Odyssey Moon, a company formed on the Isle of Man to pursue commercial ventures on the moon. The team were the first to enter the Lunar X prize, a Google-sponsored competition with a $20million jackpot for the first privately funded team to land a robotic spacecraft on the moon and send images and data back to Earth. But the X Prize is not Richards' only goal. He thinks that there are fortunes to be made in space -- and he plans to be the first lunar entrepreneur. ""We believe that beyond the prize, there's actually ongoing commerce on the surface of the moon,"" he reveals. Innovation and collaboration, both important drivers in the Odyssey Moon team, are the key to humanity's future, believes Richards. ""Space, by its nature, is an international endeavour,"" he says. ""Every space program will be successful based on the amount of international cooperation it's able to achieve."" With that in mind, in 1987 he founded the International Space University, which educates students from all over the world in space technology. ""We're creating a universal planetary culture looking on space as an achievement and a goal for all humanity."" For now, Richards' sights are set on the moon. ""The Google X Prize has certainly captivated my enthusiasm and interest, and I would certainly like to win that,"" he says. But he also sees Earth's satellite as a stepping stone to the stars. He confesses, ""If somebody was going to offer an X Prize for Mars, I'd be going for that ...""","As a boy, Richards was inspired by the moon landings and science fiction .
But his childhood expectations failed to be realized as the space race cooled .
Now Richards and the NewSpace movement have renewed interest in space .

"(CNN) -- Janine Benyus is a pioneer and champion of the Biomimicry movement and author of the influential 1997 book ""Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature"". Benyus draws her design inspiration from nature's wisdom and believes that we can use nature's best ideas and processes to solve human problems. CNN spoke to her about her inspiration, her work and her hopes for the future. CNN: How would you describe yourself? I'm natural sciences writer and the author of a book about biomimicry and these days, I'm a biologist at the design table. Janine Benyus, who coined the term biomimicry, gives talks on how companies can be inspired by nature. CNN: What do you mean by the term ""biomimicry""? Well bio-mimicry is basically innovation inspired by nature; it is looking to nature for advice, design advice, when we are trying to create new products or processes. It's borrowing nature's designs and recipes and strategies, and actually emulating them. So for instance, if you are making a new kind of solar cell, you might want to look at leaves as your model. And ask, how do leaves photosynthesise? Then try to copy the design that nature has evolved over 3.8 billion years. CNN: How did you come to coin the term ""biomimicry?"" It came about through my work as a natural history writer. I had written five natural history books, and they are full of plant and animal adaptations that are just amazing.  I wrote books about how organisms are so exquisitely matched to their environments through their adaptations, you know, how the whale is able to dive as deeply as it does, how the swift is able to fly. Then it occurred to me, is anybody trying to emulate these amazing technologies and chemistries and designs? Is anybody borrowing nature's blue prints, and actually trying to leap frog and take advantage of the wisdom of all those years of evolution. Once I asked that question, I began to collect all these papers and that was back in 1990. I wrote the book in 1997. CNN: How did writing the book impact your life? After it was published, I went back to write my next natural history book. And the phone started ringing. It was a surprise to me; it was companies and individual inventors. Companies that were inventing everyday and they had problems to solve. They said, ""Gee the book was fabulous it was about all this science that was happening in the bench and early stage research. But we're doing innovation in real time. Can you come and be a biologist at our design table."" CNN: Did it all just snowball from there? Yes, I got a call from a woman named Dayna Baumeister, who was doing a PHD at the university of Montana, and she had just read the book, and she said 'My God, I just read this book and I shook for three days' and she said 'this is what I want to do with my life, can I come and see you?' She came down to my house and we talked for about 11 hours straight. We started to do design workshops for people in the design professions to teach them how they might look to the natural world for practical solutions for practical models and that's how the Biomimicry Guild started. CNN: Can you give us an example of the kinds of problems we can solve through biomimicry? A company may ask us a question like, 'how does nature reduce vibrations' and we'll look at how mammals do it, how birds do it. Then we'll come up with different ideas, and very often, they are incredibly elegant. Think of these birds flying around, they have to be strong but lightweight. So all of these technical questions these companies were asking, we were able to provide them with biological models. You want a way to take salt out of water, look at how mangroves are living in salt water but feeding themselves on fresh water. We were simply creating a new source of inspiration for designers and engineers by looking at the biological research that had already been done. CNN: What kind of work do you do at the Guild? JB: You know biological knowledge is doubling every five years. Enormous amounts of data, and now with all the searching tools, we are able to look functionally to find some of these answers. We started the Guild in 1998 and we have everything from a dial-a-biologist service, where you can call us for an hour and we brainstorm with you to a head-hunting service, where we actually find a biologist to sit at your design table, we train them and vet them to make sure they're suitable. CNN: Do you have a typical client profile? No. We could get a call from the vice president of general electric research, and we would pick up the next line and it would be an 8th grader asking us to help him with his homework. Then we realized we probably have two kinds of organizations here, and then we started the Biomimicry institute. CNN: How does the Institute differ from the Guild? The institute is devoted to research and education, both formal and informal. We put things there that we want to make sure stay in the public domain, so we have a portal called asknature.org. and our mission is to organize all biological information by function. For example, an inventor sitting in a barrio in Brazil, if they have access to the internet, can type in a question 'how does nature lubricate,' and that information is free to them. CNN: What other projects are you working on? The other initiative that we have that I'm excited about is something called ""Innovation for Conservation."" We think that if you build a wind turbine and get a great idea from a humpback whale's flipper, that the least you can do is celebrate that insight, by saying thank you and making a thanksgiving loop. Basically, it's just good manners to say ""thank you"" in some way. ""Innovation for Conservation"" would take proceeds from a product that is bio-inspired and send them back to restore or conserve the habitat of the organism that inspired it. CNN: Can you give us a glimpse of how you see the future? Well, my most optimistic future would be one in which our technologies would be as well adapted as nature's. I think that if we really pay attention and we become nature's apprentice, if we begin to learn from these designs and recipes and strategies in the natural world and we recreate our technologies in that image. I believe that every organism that I can see is sweetening this place. I think if we were to learn from their strategies, we too might be participants in that process, not depleting this place that sustains us, but actually enhancing it to the point where it becomes more and more conducive to life.","Janine Benyus is pioneer and champion of the Biomimicry movement .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For the first time, and for a limited period only, people in North America will be able to get their hands on the XO, MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte's rugged little laptop that's designed specifically for children. Children in Cambodia using XO computers. The XO was designed for children in developing countries. And for each cutting-edge XO purchased in the West, another will be given to a child in a developing country. The ""Give One Get One"" scheme, which launches Monday, is part of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project to equip the world's poorest children with a learning tool. For $399, customers can order a laptop for themselves; bundled into the price is the cost of delivering a second XO to a child a poor country. The laptops, which went into high-volume production on 6 November, go on sale online at 6 a.m. Eastern Time Monday until November 26. Founder of OLPC, MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte told CNN that the launch of the scheme was exhilarating. ""It must be like a runner's high,"" he said. ""A lot of muscles hurt. Many people thought we would not get to the finish line."" Negroponte is convinced that providing children in poor countries with computers is a cost-effective and empowering route into self-learning. In January 2005, he unveiled One Laptop Per Child, with the aim of building a $100 laptop and supplying it in bulk to developing countries. OLPC has come under fire from some quarters for failing to make the laptop as cheap as promised, and some, including Dell CEO Michael Dell, have dismissed Negroponte's $100 aim as unrealistic. But while the cost of the laptops is currently around the $180 mark, Negroponte remains determined that his $100 machine is attainable once mass production kicks in. The rugged, green-and-white XO is made by Taiwanese company Quanta Computer Inc., the world's largest laptop manufacturer and maker of laptops for Apple, HP and Dell amongst others. Quanta will build 40,000 units in the first month, then ramp up production to 80,000 in December and 120,000 in January. The XO uses open-source software and has long battery life, a built-in camera, mesh networking and a simple user interface. It features a screen that's clearly visible even in bright sunlight, uses a tenth of the power of a conventional laptop and can be recharged by hand when mains electricity isn't available. While the laptop was designed to appeal to children, with its tough exterior, bright colors, touchpad and cute bunny-ear antennae, Negroponte told CNN that expressions of interest in the XO have so far come from a wide range of potential buyers -- and geek blogs are buzzing with anticipation of its release. Some have questioned whether laptops are the answer to the developing world's problems. But in countries where education is patchy in quality and provision, Negroponte sees the computer as an educational lifeline that could open up opportunities for children to learn independently. ""It is a window of hope,"" he says. ""Education is at the root of eliminating poverty."" Negroponte has admitted that firm orders from developing countries have not always followed their verbal expressions of interest. ""I have to some degree underestimated the difference between shaking the hand of a head of state and having a check written,"" he told the New York Times in September. ""And yes, it has been a disappointment."" But Negroponte hopes that the Give One Get One scheme will kick-start more bulk orders for his little green machines. ""It is like an avalanche,"" he told CNN. ""Not much snow needs to slide before a huge avalanche is created. We hope Give One Get One will be like the first pieces of snow."" It's the G1G1 link between a child in North America and a child in a developing country that Negroponte hopes will sway people to purchase an XO. ""In the Give One Get One program, the likely recipient in the developed world is a child,"" he explained. ""For that child to be using the same laptop as a kid in Africa is especially meaningful."" Customers wanting their XOs for the holiday season have been advised to order early: the first 20,000 units should be delivered by Christmas, with their partner computers heading to Peru and Uruguay. Later orders will follow in 2008. And Negroponte's message to those considering it as a gift this year? ""Don't hesitate. Don't buy it because it is an inexpensive laptop,"" he told CNN. ""Buy it to join a movement to change the world."" ................................. Are you putting in an order for an XO? Can laptops fill the education gap in developing countries?

"(CNN) -- When Neil Armstrong took one small step onto the moon in 1969, it seemed only a matter of time before the advent of thriving space colonies and summer vacations on distant planets. But after an initial flurry of moon landings, manned lunar expeditions dwindled: the last time an astronaut left his footprints on the moon was in 1972. Plants such as lettuce, peppers and tomatoes will be on the menu at Moon Base One. Then, in January 2004, President Bush announced NASA's intention to return humans to the moon by 2020, and in 2006, NASA announced plans to set up a manned lunar outpost by 2024, with the European and Russian Space Agencies now planning bases of their own. After years in limbo, the dream of living in space is alive once more. Sustaining long-term space habitation presents space agencies with a whole new set of technological and logistical challenges. Currently, the International Space Station supports three astronauts in a low Earth orbit, with food supplied periodically by space shuttle. But, just as home cooking is cheaper than getting takeout, when it comes to more permanent settlements, this kind of supply voyages would be prohibitively expensive: we will need to grow our own food in space. Raymond Wheeler, a plant physiologist at Kennedy Space Center, explained to CNN, ""In the near term it's not needed, for example on the space station and initial short sorties to the moon, but as you go further and stay longer, regenerative systems become much more cost effective."" Wheeler sees this development of space farming as a gradual process in which space outposts become increasingly self-sufficient. ""It would probably be evolutionary,"" he said. ""The first human missions to Mars might set out with everything stowed, but they might set up the beginnings of an in-situ production system -- maybe a plant chamber -- that you could use to grow perishable foods. You wouldn't be providing everything, but in subsequent missions if you returned there you could expand the infrastructure."" Of course, this means growing plants in conditions very different from those on Earth. Yet research has shown that plants are surprisingly adaptable. For example, while plants normally use gravity to direct the growth of their stems and roots, in low gravity conditions they can use light to orient themselves. And research suggests that plants can grow well even at very low atmospheric pressures. That reduces the leakage of oxygen and carbon dioxide from their growth chamber out into space, but crucially, it also reduces the structural requirements of a ""space greenhouse,"" meaning less construction material needs to be shipped into orbit. Nor is the absence of soil a problem. Many supermarket vegetables are already grown hydroponically in nutrient-enriched water, and research indicates this technique could work well in space. Some have even suggested the loose rock regolith on the surface of the moon or Mars as a growing medium, although additional minerals would need to be brought from Earth. So what's on the menu at Moon Base One? Well, initial crops would need to be small in stature and grow well in controlled environments with artificial light. Plants such as peppers and tomatoes are already extensively grown hydroponically, while lettuce, with its short lifecycle, would yield fast returns for pioneering space colonists. But again, Wheeler sees the choice of crops as part of an evolutionary process. He tells CNN, ""The first things you might grow would be perishable foods -- maybe vegetables or fruits -- things that don't keep very well if you're on a journey to Mars. Even though you're not providing a lot of calories, these things could have a strong impact in terms of adding color, flavor and texture to the diet."" ""The other reason for considering freshly consumed foods on early missions is that they don't require any processing,"" he continued. ""If you were to grow grains, like wheat, you'd have to thresh the seed out of the head, then clean it and mill it to make flour. Staple crops like wheat, soy bean, rice and potato -- things that would provide carbohydrates, protein and fat -- they're the final end point."" Crops need a sheltered environment, protected from the extreme temperatures and frightening levels of radiation found on the moon's surface, with water, carbon dioxide and light. Researchers at the University of Arizona's Controlled Environment Agriculture Center (CEAC), in collaboration with Sadler Machine Company (SMC), have come up with one solution: to house plants and astronauts in an inflatable habitat. They are working on a full-scale prototype Mars Inflatable Greenhouse. Space-worthy inflatable structures have been around since the 1960s and are lightweight, compact in transit and easy to assemble on landing. But what's novel about the CEAC design is that it incorporates a bio-regenerative life-support system -- the kind of technology that could one day not only feed an outpost on the moon or Mars, but also provide it with oxygen and recycle its water. Gene Giacomelli, Director of CEAC, told CNN, ""If people get to Mars we want to be able to feed them, but maybe even more importantly revitalize the atmosphere -- allow the plants to consume the carbon dioxide as they do so well here on Earth, and provide oxygen."" In the prototype designed by Phil Sadler (SMC) and evaluated by Giacomelli and graduate student Lane Patterson, plants are grown hydroponically. As water evaporates from their leaves, air moisture is condensed and re-used for irrigation. The inedible bits of plants, the stems and leaves, are fed into a composter that breaks down the biomass, releasing carbon dioxide that can be re-used by growing plants. In a working moon base, waste water from the astronauts' showers and laundry could also go into the composter, where it would be cleaned by microbes and then used in the plants' hydroponic system, before being condensed and re-used by the astronauts once again. The CEAC team intends to test the finished prototype in Antarctica, a harsh and remote environment that provides a realistic analog of conditions on the moon. The team has already provided a food growth chamber for the Amundsen-Scott South-Pole Station and the time Sadler and Patterson have spent there has provided a unique insight into some of the other benefits that bio-regenerative life support might provide for inhabitants of a space base. ""It's not just oxygen, fresh water and food that it provides, but it's also the green, living plants that psychologically become so important to people living and working in a confined, harsh, black and white space at the South Pole or in a moon or Mars base,"" says Giacomelli. Patterson adds, ""Bright lights, high humidity, green plants and the fragrance as well -- these are things that are missing in that environment. Those things shouldn't be underestimated."" The CEAC project offers a tantalizing glimpse of the kind of habitat that may house settlers in the space colonies of the future. And perhaps one day, as you relax in your inflatable villa by the Sea of Tranquility, plants will provide much more than just your dinner. ...................................................................................................................

"(CNN) -- One was a quadriplegic who controlled the steering with his breath, the other a former wheelchair basketball Paralympian who took up sailing only two years ago. But together they secured the first Paralympic sailing gold medal at London 2012, and all with one race to spare. Wednesday saw the Australian pair of Daniel Fitzgibbon and Liesl Tesch clinch victory in the two-person keelboat class, as they built an unassailable lead going into today's final day of racing. The medal continued Australia's blistering form in sailing at the London games. In July they won four golds, topping the medal table. But this gold could be their most impressive yet, exhibiting not just great sailing prowess, but the latest in Paralympic technology -- enabling those with the most severe disabilities to compete at the highest level. Paralympics sailor: 'My disability is a gift' Fitzgibbon only has limited movement in his arms and none in his legs after breaking his back falling off a jetty when he was 21 years old. But technology has allowed him to compete at this year's games, helping him to steer his specially adapted boat. ""As part of Paralympic sailing an important aspect is the seating ... so we worked hard on that and we have some nifty systems in it,"" he explained to the Australian press before leaving for London. One of those ""nifty systems"" is the sip and puff system that allows him greater control steering his boat by blowing or sucking into a specially adapted straw that then interprets his signals. ""(With my hands) all I have to do is push and pull, just like a tractor, it's made out of light weight carbon fiber too ... My hands are strapped in so I need to find a way of controlling (the boat) so we came up with this sip and puff system."" Technological breakthrough . Yet sailing at the Paralympics is still a relatively new phenomenon. The sport was only introduced at the Sydney games in 2000 after a successful trial at Atlanta four years previously. More than 80 sailors have taken part in over six days of competition, in three separate classes culminating in today's final crucial races. But, perhaps inevitably, Paralympic sailing is a complicated sport to both compete in and to judge. Both men and women sail in the same classes but are classified by the severity of their disability -- an issue that has caused many controversies both at this Paralympics and in disabled sport in general. A score of one is given to most severely disabled, seven for the least. ""We have classifiers who are physios and doctors, but they know all about the rules of sailing,"" explained Linda Merkle, president of the International Association for Disabled Sailors. ""When we selected the particular boat (class to be raced at the Paralympics) we said that one should be female and the other male and that one has to be a class one or two disability, like being a quadrapligic. The more severely disabled sailor tends to be on the helm."" But it has been the technological advances in recent years that have allowed the more severely disabled sailors compete. ""It is the adaptations (to the boat) that allow them to compete and have an even level,"" says Merkle. ""With the sonar (boats), disabled sailors are not able to get from one side to the other. So now there's a transferring seat -- a 'traveler' -- so the sailor can now move more freely. The adaptations have really allowed them to compete, and compete in able-bodied sailing too."" The freedom of the sea . The final day of competition is likely to be the most watched event in Paralympic sailing history. Only a handful of nations compete and Merkle wants to capitalize on the sport's growing success. ""We also include people with visual impairments and we are now folding blind sailing into the sport,"" Merkle said. ""We are growing and we do have a development segment of our organization to help countries to move in and spread the word."" That should not be too difficult to achieve. After all, disabled sailing is an easier sell than many sports given that it has one huge advantage over the others: the freedom of the sea. ""That's the beauty of sailing,"" says Merkle. ""You feel free. And when you come to the Paralympic sailing you can't see what the disabilities are. ""It gives you freedom and the ability to compete.""

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy may have already wrapped up the money list title, but two veteran golfers have much to play for on the final day of the European Tour season's penultimate event in Hong Kong. Miguel Angel Jimenez, at 48 seeking to become the tour's oldest winner, finished the third round tied for the lead with 43-year-old Michael Campbell -- whose last victory came in 2005, the year he won his only major. ""I love to be in contention. It's been a long time since I've been there,"" said Jimenez, who has won 11 of his 18 European Tour titles since turning 40 but has not triumphed in more than two years. Jimenez, who was one of Jose Maria Olazabal's vice-captains in Europe's Ryder Cup victory in September, carded two-under-par 68 to join Campbell on 10-under 200 overall in a tournament he won in 2004 and 2007. No. 1 McIlroy misses the cut in HK . Irishman Des Smyth was 48 years and 34 days old when he won the Madeira Island Open in 2001, while Jimenez will turn 49 on January 5. ""I like to be in contention on this golf course and you have to have patience and let everything happen,"" said the Spaniard, who led after a first-round 65. ""That's what's going to happen tomorrow, stay patient because anyone can win."" Campbell is resurrecting his career this year, having fallen out of the top 1,000 rankings at one stage following his breakthrough win at the U.S. Open and subsequent victory at the World Match Play Championship later in 2005. ""Today was sort of scrappy; apart from a couple of drives, it was pretty average really,"" said the New Zealander, who is now ranked 339th. He is 83rd in the Race To Dubai standings following a third-place finish in Portugal last month, but outside the top 60 who qualify for the season-ending World Tour Championship in Dubai. ""I just managed to grind out a score, which is very important with me not playing so well. I turned a 73 into a 69, which is always nice,"" said Campbell, who led by one shot at the halfway stage while defending champion McIlroy missed the cut. ""Miguel is playing great golf, and he's won this twice before and he's the man to beat."" They have a one-shot lead from young Italian star Matteo Manassero -- who won last weekend in Singapore as McIlroy wrapped up a money list double -- and China's Zhang Lian-wei. ""Last week really made me relax a lot on the golf course, and these three rounds and my position coming into this Sunday is certainly due to and what happened last week - I've got more freedom,"" said the 19-year-old Manassero, who shot 64 on Saturday to surge up 10 places. Zhang matched Campbell's 69, but Sweden's Fredrik Andersson Hed dropped back to fifth on 202 after a 70. Two more veterans were three shots behind the leaders, with 38-year-old Irishman Peter Lawrie tied with 42-year-old Dane Anders Hansen as both seek to end a wait of more than three years for their second and third respective European Tour titles. Meanwhile, Sweden's Henrik Stenson took a three-shot lead into Sunday's final round of the SA Open. The 36-year-old was being chased by South Africa's George Coetzee, who fired nine-under 63 to hold hopes of winning his national title and his first on the European Tour. Ryder Cup winner Ian Poulter will battle with home hope Adam Scott in the final round of the Australian Masters, as the Englishman held a one-shot lead in his bid to follow up his win at the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament in China earlier this month.

"(CNN) -- It's one of the top 10 most-visited sites worldwide, with over 2 million articles in its English language edition. But is online encyclopedia Wikipedia's strength -- that anyone can edit it -- also its greatest weakness? Wikipedia: an invaluable repository of global knowledge or a magnet for digital vandals and hoaxers? This June, former president of the American Library Association, Michael Gorman hit out at academics who endorsed the use of Wikipedia to their students, saying in the Encyclopaedia Britannica blog that ""a professor who encourages the use of Wikipedia is the intellectual equivalent of a dietician who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything."" Gorman added that Google and Wikipedia were creating a generation of ""intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet,"" with no interest in exploring non-digital resources. Gorman's remarks received a mixed response. Some said that students should be taught to discern whether a source was authoritative. Others pointed to academics who cite Wikipedia, saying it was unfair to prevent students from doing the same. Ben Fairweather, research fellow in the center for computing and social responsibility at De Montfort University, England, was quoted in the Times Higher Education Supplement saying that Internet resources had made research more efficient and removed some of the ""drudgery out of producing good work."" Gorman's position was that he was not taking issue with the technology per se, but was concerned by the lack of peer review based on an intellectual meritocracy, adding, ""That meritocracy must be based on respect for expertise and learning."" Perhaps surprisingly, this view is shared by Larry Sanger, who was with Wikipedia from the start and is often referred to as a co-founder. (Though that's up for debate on the site, too.) When he parted ways with Wikipedia, Sanger felt that the site's vulnerability to vandalism could undermine its reputation. That spurred him to set up ""Citizendium,"" a rival wiki-based project where articles are vetted by known experts and authors are required to use their real names. Citizendium launched this year with the aim to become ""the world's most trusted knowledge base,"" though with just 3000 articles to hold to Wikipedia's 2 million, some would question whether the site can ever catch up. For the most part, Wikipedia is working. A 2005 study by British journal Nature found that the online encyclopedia was about as accurate as its competitors on science. But a commonly cited peril of Wikipedia's anonymity is vandalism. In one notorious example, journalist John Seigenthaler Sr. was listed as a suspect in both Kennedy assassinations by a prankster: the entry remained up for four months in 2005. Such abuse tends to get quickly swept away by the site's volunteers, especially if an article has been placed on a watch list by editors who are interested in the subject. Still, at any given point, Wikipedia visitors can't be sure of what they're getting. Look no further than the Seigenthaler entry: For 31 hours last September, he was said to have killed and eaten JFK. Seigenthaler slammed the site in an opinion piece in USA Today, berating Wikipedia's ""volunteer vandals with poison-pen intellects."" Some might say that the edits in Seigenthaler's profile would never have made it into the mainstream media. But those seeking proof of just how much emphasis even professional journalists can place on Wikipedia need look no further than the example of Ronnie Hazlehurst, a British composer of TV theme tunes for shows including ""Yes, Minister"" and ""Last of the Summer Wine,"" who died this October. According to several high-profile obituaries, including the BBC, Reuters, the London Times and The Guardian, Hazlehurst, at the age of 72, also penned ""Reach,"" a 2000 hit for UK pop combo S Club 7. The unfortunate writers had omitted to double-check his Wikipedia discography, and collectively fell victim to Wiki-hoaxers. Even those who spot errors in their own profiles can be reluctant to address them. In April this year, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and academic Douglas Hofstadter told the New York Times of his Wikipedia entry, ""[it] is filled with inaccuracies, and it kind of depresses me."" When asked why he didn't fix it, he replied, ""The next day someone will fix it back."" Wikipedia recognizes that to-and-fro tussling -- or ""edit warring"" -- is damaging to its reputation, and some of the more controversial topics -- such as those on Islam, Elvis Presley and abortion -- have been locked to limit who can alter them. But as its reputation as an online resource has grown, the encyclopedia has also become a target for corporate spin. In January this year, the Associated Press reported that Microsoft had offered a blogger cash to alter Wikipedia articles. Microsoft claimed that the articles contained inaccuracies on an open-source document standard and a rival format put forward by the software giant. Then, this summer, Virgil Griffith, a 24-year-old Cal Tech graduate student, unearthed some eyebrow-raising data. Wired.com reported in August that Griffith created an application called WikiScanner that tracks edits that have been made to Wikipedia articles and cross-references them against IP addresses, which can be traced back to companies' offices. Griffith proved what many had suspected for some time: that edits on company profiles were often originating from IP addresses owned by those companies and even their competitors. Just a few of the corporations listed included Exxon Mobil, Apple, Microsoft and Wal-Mart, along with several politicians' offices. """"It was dead easy,"" Griffith told Forbes.com. ""I just combined two databases and -- poof -- you have these public relations disasters."" Some of those edits, Wired reported, appeared to be ""transparently self-interested, either adding positive, press release-like material to entries, or deleting whole swaths of critical material."" Wired cited the example of voting-machine company Diebold, ""with someone at the company's IP address apparently deleting long paragraphs detailing the security industry's concerns over the integrity of their voting machines, and information about the company's CEO's fund-raising for President Bush."" The deleted text was restored by a Wikipedia contributor, who added: ""Please stop removing content from Wikipedia. It is considered vandalism."" So should we turn our backs on Wikipedia -- scratch it and start again? Absolutely not. As a project -- to gather together our collective knowledge -- Wikipedia is admirable. As a repository for human knowledge, it is invaluable. As an introductory resource on anything from scientific formulae to walk-on characters in TV sitcoms, its breadth is unmatched. Its content is also a priceless reflection of humanity and its concerns. Only a tiny fraction of its vast repository is polluted by vandals, hoaxers and ne'er-do-wells, who in turn are chased down by its dedicated band of editors and administrators. But a resource that can be edited by experts and non-experts alike will always carry risks, and perhaps that's Wikipedia's greatest lesson for us all: that its very existence must force us to question notions of accuracy and reliability, while giving us a means to correct errors and add to the global knowledge pot. Two things are certain: no encyclopedia will ever be perfect, and we will never reach consensus on all Wikipedia articles. And in the meantime, while an invaluable first port of call, those using Wikipedia would be well advised to confirm their facts elsewhere. ..............................

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The butt -- in more ways than one -- of a thousand puerile schoolboy jokes, methane, in the form of natural gas, has for some time now been used to fuel cars and other modes of transport (the Honda Civic GX, which uses natural gas, has been rated the cleanest car on earth). ""Amanda"" is the world's first train to run exclusively on biogas . Despite producing 25 percent less CO2 than petrol or diesel, however, natural gas is still a fossil fuel, and burning it results in the emission of significant amounts of atmospheric pollution. As a ""biogas"", however -- derived from recently living organic matter -- methane is far less environmentally damaging since the CO2 it gives off is immediately reabsorbed by plants and thus adds little to the net sum of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Methane biogas is already being used in projects around the globe to generate electricity -- in China and India, indeed, it has been employed for decades -- and is attracting increasing interest from the car industry as a source of renewable energy. Now a company in Sweden has developed a novel and environmentally sustainable -- if somewhat gruesome -- method of actually obtaining methane: boiling cow intestines. The digestive tracts of all living creatures produce methane, a by-product of the action of bacteria breaking down ingested food matter. Because cows have four stomachs, they create considerably more of the gas than any other animal -- 75 percent of the total methane produced by all animals. To date no viable method has been devised to capture this gas as it erupts from either end of the cow. Swedish company Svenska Biogas, however, are currently doing the next best thing: taking the bits of cows that would otherwise be discarded during the slaughter process -- stomach and intestines primarily, but also udders, blood and parts of the liver and kidneys -- and extracting the residual methane directly from them. ""Depending on the cow's size, we can get 80-100 kilos of material from each animal,"" Carl Lilliehook, Managing Director of Svenska Biogas told CNN. ""These are all the things that would otherwise be classified as food-process waste and either incinerated or disposed of in landfill sites. ""This material is then heated at 70 degrees centigrade for one hour to boil off the impurities, and put in a digester for one month, where micro-organisms break it down, producing a mixture of methane and CO2 which is drawn out of the top of the digester."" Having been ""upgraded"" -- filtered through water to remove as much of the CO2 as possible -- the resultant methane biogas is then used to fuel cars, taxis, rubbish trucks and the 70-strong bus-fleet in Linkoping, the town where Svenska Biogas is based. ""We have been running this system for two years, and are now taking 54,000 tonnes of slaughterhouse waste each year,"" explains Lilliehook, ""Mainly from cows, but also from pigs and chickens. ""From this we are able to produce five million cubic meters of biogas. Linkoping's seventy buses use three million cubic meters annually, and the rest fuels other vehicles such as cars and dust carts."" The boiled-gut biogas is even being used to power ""Amanda,"" a train that runs the 116 kms between Linkoping and Vastervik and the world's first train to be powered solely by biogas (the entrails of one cow, it is estimated, are enough to fuel the train for four kilometers, making Linkoping-Vastervik a 29-cow one-way journey, or a 58-cow return). The decomposed stew of innards from which the gas has been extracted, meanwhile, is employed as bio-fertilizer by local farmers, ensuring that the whole process leaves no waste. As well as cow guts, Svenska Biogas is also producing biogas from sewage and organic plant matter, but it is their pioneering intestinal work that is attracting the most attention. Already two other companies in Sweden are doing the same thing, and there has been interest from countries around the world, including the UK, Ireland, South Korea, China, India and Argentina (the latter alone dumps the guts of 35 million slaughtered cows annually in landfill sites). Arnold Schwarzenegger, as governor of California, has been in touch with a view to introducing the technology to the U.S. ""I've even had discussions with someone from Uganda"" says Lilliehook. ""Apparently President Museveni had heard about our biogas train and wanted to have something similar in his own country."" Lilliehook accepts that cow guts are not necessarily going to provide the definitive solution to global warming. In the week that the U.N. under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs warned that the world is already in the grip of a climate change ""mega-disaster,"" however, he believes that they have an important role to play. ""I certainly think that this is a technology that can help to reduce greenhouse gases,"" Lilliehook told CNN. ""True it costs more than petrol or diesel -- you need 20 percent more biogas to give the same amount of energy -- but the environmental benefits in terms of waste disposal and cleaner emissions are enormous. ""Biogas is definitely the way forward."" So far as methane biogas is concerned, the winds of change would definitely seem to be blowing. ...................................

"(CNN) -- South African ""Blade runner"" Oscar Pistorius has apologized for the timing of his complaints about the length of his rivals' prosthetic limbs after his shock loss in the 200-meter sprint at the Paralympic Games in London. Minutes after losing the race to 20-year-old Brazilian runner Alan Fonteles Cardaso Oliveira on Sunday, Pistorius accused the gold medalist and others in the race of wearing ""unbelievably long"" blades. ""You can't compete on stride length. You saw how far (Alan) came back so, you know what, we're not racing a fair race here, but I gave my best on a great night,"" he said. Live: Catch the Paralympics action as it happens . Early Monday, Pistorius apologized for the timing of his comments but said that he believed ""there is an issue here."" ""I accept that raising these concerns immediately as I stepped off the track was wrong,"" Pistorius said in a statement. ""That was Alan's moment and I would like to put on record the respect I have for him."" Oliveira passed the South African in the final stretch to take the gold medal in a time of 21.45 seconds. It was slower than the world record of 21.30 set by Pistorius in the qualifying heat Saturday, but fast enough for a decisive win against the race favorite who clocked a time of 21.52. Like Pistorius, Oliveira, is a double-amputee who runs with the aid of prosthetic limbs. Immediately after the race, Pistorius expressed incredulity at Oliveira's dash in the race's final seconds. ""I think Alan's a great athlete but you can't come back (that much). I run just over 10 metres per second and I don't know how you can come back -- by watching the replay -- from eight metres behind on the 100 to win. It's absolutely ridiculous,"" Pistorius said. Pistorius also accused bronze medalist American Blake Leeper of stretching, if not breaking, the rules. ""The guy came down literally overnight and made his blades longer. His knee height's like four inches higher than what it should be."" The South African said he'd attempted to raise the issue of blade length with the International Paralymic Committee (IPC) in the weeks before the race but his concerns had ""fallen on deaf ears."" The IPC issued a statement saying that all athletes competing in amputee events had their prostheses measured before the race and all complied with IPC Athletics Rules. Oliveira said it was ""difficult"" to hear allegations of cheating coming from someone he regarded as a ""great idol."" Pistorius' grandmother on his fighting spirit . Asked whether Pistorius was just a bad loser, he said: ""(He is) not a bad loser. Pistorius is a great athlete... I still do not know with whom he is picking a fight. It's not with me."" Oliveira denied he had cheated and attributed his performance to training. ""It's not just about the protheses, there is training behind. I get upset to hear this kind of thing. I'm inside the rules (of the International Paralympic Committee). I came here to celebrate and do not enter in any polemics,"" he said. It was a sentiment echoed by Leeper. ""(Pistorius) has his opinion. You know, we go by the IPC rules. I'm following the rules. I feel like I'm not cheating, I do the best I can. I still work hard every day -- I train six days a week, two or three times a day. So I feel it's not the legs. For him to say it's the legs, I disagree. But he's a great runner. I truly support him and what he does, honestly."" After a short meeting with Pistorius after the race, the IPC's director Craig Spence said the committee's science and medical director Peter Van Der Vliet would meet the athlete at a later date in a ""non-emotional environment."" ""The IPC respects the significant role Oscar has played in raising the global profile of Paralympic Sport since his Games debut in 2004. Therefore we are more than willing to give him an opportunity to air his views,"" Spence said in a statement. Opinion: Oscar Pistorius, an inspiration and a question . Pistorius later appeared to back away from his earlier statements, tweeting an image of him shaking Oliveira's hand and the message: ""Congratulating Alan of Brazil for his 200m win.. The fastest last 80m I have ever seen to take it on the line. pic!"" Just weeks ago, Pistorius made history by becoming the first double-amputee to contest an able-bodied Summer Olympics when he competed at the 2012 Games in London. While the runner failed to win a medal, his presence on the track was lauded as an example of victory over adversity and a lesson in dedication to a goal. After initially being refused permission to compete against able-bodied competitors, Pistorius hired a legal team to prove that his artificial limbs didn't give him an unfair advantage. Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee at 11 months of age and now runs on specially-adapted carbon-fiber limbs. Later this week, Pistorius will compete in the men's T44 100-meters -- set for Wednesday and Thursday -- and the T44 400-meters -- Friday and Saturday -- both of which he won at the Beijing Paralympics four years ago.

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius, a South African double-amputee nicknamed the ""Blade Runner,"" made an unprecedented Olympic debut Saturday, finishing second in his 400-meter qualifying heat. With a time of 45.44 seconds, Pistorius qualified for Sunday's semifinals. The runner's legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old because of a bone defect. He runs on special carbon fiber blades, hence the nickname. His debut Saturday made him the first Paralympian runner to compete in the able-bodied Olympics and the third overall.

The 25-year-old got to London after jumping through hurdles. The four-time Paralympic Games gold medalist won a silver medal as part of South Africa's 4x400-meter relay at the world championships in Daegu, South Korea, last year. But he looked set to be excluded from the individual event in London after failing to run the Olympic 'A' standard qualification mark twice in international competition. But South African selectors relaxed their qualification rules last month and named him in both events.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Oh, the humanity."" When these three words were uttered by aghast radio journalist Herbert Morrison -- as the LZ129 Hindenburg airship crashed and burst into flames in New Jersey in 1937 -- it was seen as the end of airships. The other remaining Zeppelin-class dirigible, the Graf Zeppelin II, was destroyed by the Nazi administration who felt the materials could be put to better use with more conventional aircraft. The Aeroscraft ML866 is a prototype for future cargo vehicles that could have a payload of up to 60 tonnes . But, 70 years on, could the Hindenburg-style airship be experiencing a renaissance? There are two types of craft that are commonly called ""airships."" The first is basically a balloon filled with a lighter-than-air gas, with an attached pod for the pilot and passengers, and tilting propellers to aid with descent and maneuvering. These are known as 'blimps' and are commonly used for promotional activities, for filming sporting events and by law enforcement agencies for surveillance. But their limited payload make them unsuitable for other purposes. The other type of airship is the dirigible. Like a blimp, a dirigible airship is filled with lighter-than-air gas but it has an internal skeleton. This greater rigidity allows dirigible airships to carry larger payloads than blimps.  See pictures of airships through the ages. » . While the Hindenburg crash dented public confidence in the dirigible airship concept, the principal cause of the disaster wasn't bad design but propaganda. The Germans were desperate to show off their technical achievement. But the United States, the world's primary supplier of the inert gas helium (which was used to inflate and lift the airships), had imposed a military embargo on the gas. So the Hindenburg was filled with the massively explosive gas, hydrogen. And it exploded. Massively. In recent years the concept of the dirigible airship has been reevaluated because of the environmental need to find lower-carbon methods of freight transportation; and the military and humanitarian need to deliver supplies to remote locations not served by airports. One failed attempt to resuscitate the airship content came from the German company Cargolifter AG in the mid 1990s. It planned a large airship, the CL160, to be used as a transporter for large and heavy loads. A giant hangar, one of the world's largest structures, was built in Brand, near Berlin in Germany, for storage and manufacture of these giant craft. But Cargolifter became insolvent in 2002. The hangar was sold for a fraction of its construction cost and now houses an indoor water park. In 2005 the Aeros corporation of Montebello, CA. resurrected the airship concept. Responding to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)'s ""Walrus"" program the company was given a $3.2 million grant to develop: ""a very large airlift vehicle concept designed to control lift in all stages of air or ground operations including the ability to off-load payload without taking on-board ballast other than surrounding air."" What distinguishes a ""Walrus"" craft from a Hindenberg-style airship is that it would not be lighter than air. Rather it would generate lift from a combination of aerodynamics, propellors and gas buoyancy. This would allow for a quicker descent without the expulsion of lift gas, for instance. DARPA terminated the Walrus program but Aeros is continuing to develop the technology with a view to creating an enormous civil airship utilizing a glass-fiber and carbon-fibre semi-monocoque envelope structure. The planned Aeroscraft ML866 could be the next generation of corporate transportation. With more than 465 square meters (5000 square feet) of interior floor space, the ML866's interior could house a floating boardroom or an opulent flying home. Because it would be flying at a lower altitude than a passenger jet (6,000 to 12,000 feet, as opposed to 25,000 to 35,000 feet) the cabin would not be pressurized. The technological legacy of the Walrus program is the COSH (control of structural heaviness) system. By compressing and decompressing stored helium, the aircraft can become lighter for take-off and heavier for landing. If Aeros secure funding to develop the ML866, it would be offered with a choice of turboprop engines (for either greater speed or heavier payload). But could large airships supplement the role of large passenger aircraft? Flight International's technical reporter Rob Coppinger is skeptical: . ""Whether it is cargo, corporate or mass transpiration I think the issues with airships are; can [airships] carry enough people/cargo between two popular destinations and do it fast enough to carry a sufficient volume of cargo/people to generate enough revenue to pay for the development, certification and running costs? ""I think if it were easy to financially justify, they would exist already."" Coppinger concedes, however, that airships could have potential military applications. Aeros plans to begin testing a non-rigid airship, the Aeros 40D, in 2008 to demonstrate the helium compression and decompression system. Production of a prototype Aeroscraft ML866 has begun, with a test flight planned for 2010. ...................................... Are dirigibles just a load of hot air? Would you travel by airship?

"(CNN) -- From escaping bullets in Sudan as a young boy to becoming a track and field Olympics star, U.S. athlete Lopez Lomong has been running and defying odds nearly all of his life. Lomong, who carried the American flag into the 2008 Olympic Opening Ceremony in Beijing, was among the thousands of refugees known as ""The Lost Boys,"" victims of Sudan's long and brutal civil war. At the age of six, Lomong, who qualified Wednesday for the 5,000-meter final at the London Games on August 11, was separated from his family when he was kidnapped by soldiers during a Sunday morning mass in his native country. Lomong was taken along with several other children to a prison where they would be trained to become child soldiers. ""I saw kids dying every day and I would say, 'OK, maybe next time it's going to be me,'"" remembers Lomong, 27. ""That basically changed my life and from that moment I'm no longer six years old -- I became an adult."" But a few weeks later Lomong managed to escape from the prison camp with the help of three older abducted children. Barefoot but determined, Lomong and his friends went a through a hole in the prison fence and started running as fast as they could, in what Lomong describes as their ""race to freedom."" After running for three days and nights the boys finally reached Kenya, where Lomong spent the next 10 years of his life in a refugee camp. In 2001, Lomong's remarkable life journey took another turn. Aged 16, he was among the nearly 4,000 ""Lost Boys"" who were resettled in various cities across the United States as part of a U.N. and U.S. government program. Read more: Former 'Lost Boy' runs boot camps for business . He was adopted by a family in Tully, a small town in upstate New York, where he went to high school and first started thinking of running as a career. He became a U.S. citizen in July 2007 and one year later he made the national Olympics team, taking part in the 1,500-meter race in Beijing. Lomong didn't make it to the finals but was honored by his fellow athletes who selected him as the as flag bearer for Team USA. ""That is the most incredible thing I take away from the Olympics,"" he says. ""It's not only track and field. There are swimmers; there are wrestlers; there is everybody united and we are all walking together to bring as many medals to our country. Those are the things that I will never forget -- I was very excited to be part of that and carry America's flag into the opening ceremony."" This week, he returns to the Olympics for the second time. This time his goal is to achieve Olympic glory. ""I want to go back to do what I didn't do in 2008,"" says Lomong, a graduate of Northern Arizona University. ""I want to win the medal. Yes, I was a flag bearer in 2008; I don't want to be a flag bearer anymore, I want to bring the medal back home."" See also: Nigeria's first Olympic canoeist . Determined to win a medal for his adopted country, Lomong is also focused on making a difference in South Sudan. He has established a foundation in his name to help people in his native country, focusing on four pressing issues. ""We need to be able to go back and give these people education, clean water, nutrition, medicine,"" says Lomong, who also reunited with his family in South Sudan in 2007. ""To live, to see another day, to think there is someone out there in the world caring for them so they can be able to pursue their dream."" Lomong has also written a book, called ""Running for My Life: One Lost Boy's Journey from the Killing Fields of Sudan to the Olympic Games,"" where he narrates his long and epic life journey. See also: Sudan's 'Lost Boys' reunited with the past . He wants to share his inspiring story with the world so that people know where he comes from and understand why he is running. ""I want to be the one telling that story to the people who never had a voice before because there are a lot of kids out there right now that are still going through the things I went through. They are still getting kidnapped. They are still going hungry for days, they don't have families,"" he says.

"RAMALLAH, West Bank (CNN) -- The harsh reality of life and death in Gaza is a common theme for Palestinian filmmakers. A still from ""Fatenah,"" the first commerical animation to come out of the Palestinian Territories. But it was the 2004 death of a young Palestinian woman -- not at the hands of a militant attack or an Israeli incursion -- that struck a note with two filmmakers. Their animated film, ""Fatenah,"" is inspired by her struggle with breast cancer, which is still a sensitive subject in the Palestinian territories. ""The amount of trouble she has to go to just to survive, you feel somehow committed to be part of that project, it is so strong and so emotional,"" director Ahmad Habash told CNN. Fatenah, which tells the fictional story of a young seamstress from a Gaza refugee camp, is the first commercial Palestinian animation film ever made. The heart-wrenching tale follows Fatenah's pain and humiliation as she struggles to leave Gaza for treatment after finding few Palestinian doctors willing to help. At first, one doctor suggests she loosen her bra, while another says her condition will probably go away once she marries. It takes six months for Palestinian doctors to treat her concerns seriously and diagnose her with breast cancer. Fatenah becomes tied up in Israeli and Palestinian bureaucracy, denied treatment until it is too late. It is a devastating tale that Habash said is not unique. ""The Shata refugee camp, which exists in Gaza ... represents any refugee camp and [Fatenah] could be any woman,"" he said. ""The story could happen again."" The film's executive producer Saed Andoni said it was a gamble telling such a tragic story using animation. But he believes that bet has paid off. ""I think the animation has softened the harshness of the topic,"" he said. ""Breast cancer and illness and death and Gaza and the siege, it's all heavy stuff, it's all harsh stuff. Put it in an animation style, give it a new dimension, give it a new perspective."" At a screening in the West Bank city of Ramallah, audience members wept after hearing Fatenah's story, saying they related to her plight. One scene shows Fatenah checking her breast for lumps. The filmmakers hope this will help to break down barriers around a subject that is still very hidden in the region. ""It's very taboo to speak about the woman's body in Palestinian society, but in the film it happens and nobody criticizes and nobody says anything about it,"" Andoni said. ""They accept it."" The film breaks new ground by dealing with matters often swept under the carpet in Palestinian society. Andoni said the film's greatest endorsement came from the father of the woman whose real-life story inspired the film. The woman's father said he cried when he watched it. ""It's a very human story and if it can touch the real family, it is a great moment,"" Andoni said.","Young Palestinian's death from breast cancer inspires first commercial animation .

"(CNN) -- The bombings at the Boston Marathon have brought attention to ""pressure cooker bombs."" Improvised explosive devices can be constructed using everyday items, and those made with pressure cookers have been around for 40 years. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has issued repeated warnings against IEDs made with pressure cookers. IEDs have been used in numerous attacks in the United States, most notably the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing; the May 2010 attack in Times Square; and failed attempts by the Underwear Bomber and the Shoe Bomber. Some experts view the aircraft used to strike the Twin Towers and the Pentagon on 9/11 as the largest IEDs ever created. Abroad, Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the July 2011 attack in Oslo, Norway, described the IED he detonated -- before killing 77 people at a youth camp -- as a ""marketing tool"" for his extremist views. IEDs are a global threat and have become an effective weapon for those who advance their cause through terror and violence. For the past several years, excluding Iraq and Afghanistan, there are on average, three IED incidents each day. The Department of Defense's Joint IED Defeat Organization has an even higher estimate of 500 IED incidents per month, again excluding Afghanistan and Iraq . Historically, IEDs have been used in a variety of situations, including conflict and post-conflict environments (Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, Israel, Lebanon and Gaza and the West Bank); illegal drug operations (Mexico, Colombia and Peru); insurgencies (Chechnya, Russia, Nigeria and Northern Ireland); election-related violence (Kenya, Nigeria and Ivory Coast); religious crises (India, Pakistan and Nigeria); ethnic conflicts (Nigeria, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Serbia); and other notable acts of terror (France, Norway, Russia, United Kingdom and United States). The Boston Marathon attack exemplifies what some parts of the world experience on a regular basis. According to our estimates, in the 10 days before the Boston Marathon, IEDs took the lives of more than 100 people in seven countries. And in the past 60 days, 64 people were killed in a Pakistani incident in February and 44 people were killed in a Nigerian incident in March. The Boston attack also cast a spotlight on the severity of injuries that result from IED use. Thousands of U.S. service members, veterans and civilians around the world endure the consequences of these horrific injuries. IEDs cause the top four injuries to veterans, including hearing loss, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. According to the Blinded Veterans Association, approximately 34% of those injured by IED blasts suffer dual sensory loss of vision and hearing in addition to the well-documented physical wounds such as loss of limbs and other permanent physical disabilities. Treating these injuries is a challenge because the U.S. Department of Defense inadequately shares blast trauma research with the Veterans Administration and other organizations. To date, the domestic and international threat of IEDS has been ignored. No nation has formally condemned the use of IEDs. While the United Nations annually issues a resolution condemning landmines, it has never issued a resolution condemning IEDs. Members of the U.S. Congress have recently raised the alarm on this threat. In May 2012, a bipartisan group of 92 members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to President Barack Obama calling for a unified U.S. strategy and international action against IEDs. So far, no adequate response from the administration has been received. To fill this vacuum of inaction, I founded the Global Campaign Against IEDs in an effort to push for the reduction of IED use and the trafficking of IED precursor materials. Through a coalition of public, private and military efforts, we can reduce IED networks and prevent IED networks from forming. A purely military approach has failed to stop IEDs in Afghanistan and Iraq. The solution to this dilemma, proposed by the Global Campaign against IEDs, will be comprehensive, involving public, private and military partners. Finally, the broader global community must come together and take meaningful action against IEDs and those who use them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Morris.","Bob Morris: Pressure cooker bombs, like the one used in Boston marathon, are not new .

"(CNN) -- Known as the cradle of the Renaissance, Florence is a culture-rich city in the heart of Tuscany, Italy. Over the centuries, it has been home to Renaissance masters Leonardo da Vinci, Giotto, Michelangelo, Dante and Brunelleschi, who have left their legacy in a trove of art and architecture that is world renowned. It is this rich legacy that inspires art-lovers to visit, and in summer the city is crammed with tourists determined to make the most of the city's treasures. While small, Florence contains a quarter of the planet's UNESCO world heritage sites, which can be overwhelming for first-time visitors. With this ratio of classics-per-square-meter, it's impossible to see everything in one visit -- but here is a selection of CNN's cultural highlights. A good starting point is Florence's cathedral, The Duomo (Piazza del Duomo), whose teracotta-and-white dome dominates the city's skyline. The building's ornate facade is decorated in pink, white and green marble. Inside, however, the cathedral is refreshingly simple. The 700-step climb up the inside of the dome -- architect Brunelleschi's 15th-century feat of engineering -- is not for the faint-hearted, but the views from the cupola are well worth it. Also in the cathedral square is Giotto's Campanile, a belltower that soars into the Tuscan sky. With its magnificent statues, rich relief carvings and strong design, it exemplifies Renaissance architecture. If heights don't make you dizzy, iyou'll also get a great view of the city from the top. One of the oldest art museums in the Western world, the Uffizi Gallery is unmissable. Come here for a who's who of Renaissance art: As well as da Vinci's ""Annunciation"" and ""The Adoration of the Magi,"" the gallery houses ""The Baptism of Christ,"" attributed to Verrocchio and da Vinci, as well as numerous works by Giotto, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Rafael, Titian and Tintoretto -- truly a visual feast. Some believe that the Palazzo Vecchio conceals a hidden treasure. It is thought that da Vinci's ""The Battle of Anghiari"" could lie hidden behind one of Vasari's frescoes, not least because Vasari, who greatly admired da Vinci's work, has included the words ""Seek and you shall find"" in one of his paintings. Forensic art historian Maurizio Seracicin is using infra-red rays to see if it's there. Michelangelo's sculpture ""David"" takes pride of place at the Accademia Gallery, where you can also find Botticelli's ""Madonna and Child."" For more sculpture, head to the Bargello National Museum, where you'll find an impressive array of works by Donatello, Luca della Robbia, Verrocchio, Michelangelo and Cellini. At the Museum of Leonardo da Vinci, visitors flock to see life-size models of the artist's ideas and inventions, from a glider to a tank, all carved from wood. It's a great place to appreciate the range of Leonardo's creativity. If you're footsore and feeling overwhelmed after racing around the key cultural sights, it might be time to head away from the crowds. Over the Roman Ponte Vecchio Bridge, famously lined by jewelry shops, is the Pitti Palace, seat of the Dukes of Tuscany, and rising up behind it are the exquisite Boboli Gardens. Take a picnic and climb up to the top, then congratulate yourself on escaping the crush and admire the view. Alternatively, take a trip back to the Middle Ages by listening to San Miniato's Benedictine monks sing Gregorian chants during vespers at Florence's oldest church, dating back to the 11th century. It's another spot that affords great views, as it sits at one of the highest points in Florence. Florence is also strongly associated with Italian fashion. Gucci, Pucci and Cavalli were founded here, as was Ferragamo, while Prada, Chanel, Armani and others retain a strong presence in the city. The glossy boutiques can be found on Via Tornabuoni -- or you can follow the fashionistas and pick up some cut-price designer treats at the thriving designer outlets on the outskirts of Florence. And if you are looking for something more offbeat, try the Museo La Specola, a zoology museum where you can find eerily accurate wax models of corpses, a multitude of stuffed animals and other Victorian museum curiosities.","The cradle of the Renaissance, Florence has produced some of Italy's greatest artists .

"London, England (CNN) -- It's the pinnacle of the English flat racing season, bringing together the best horses from around the country -- and even further afield -- to compete for a purse of more than $2 million. The annual Epsom meeting has spawned many similar events around the world, among them the Deutsches Derby, the Derby Italiano and, perhaps most famously, the Kentucky Derby. Indeed, the name ""Derby"" has entered the vernacular and is now used to describe almost any race for three-year-olds. But the Epsom Derby is still the most venerable of them all. Dating back to 1780, the race is named after its founder, the 12th Earl of Derby, himself a prominent owner and breeder of racehorses. Today it draws crowds of up to 200,000 people. But for one of that number, the Derby is more than just a race. The queen's association with the Epsom Derby runs deep. She began attending the event as a princess. After her coronation in 1953, the Derby was her first official engagement. It was nearly a fairly-tale beginning: the queen's horse Aureole should have claimed the honors but a massive bay colt named Pinza had failed to read to the script. So there's a certain symmetry to her decision to mark the beginning of her weekend of Jubilee celebrations with a visit to Epsom Downs. Interactive: A year in the life of the queen . A familiar, if inscrutable, figure at track, the queen's enthusiasm for racing is well-documented (it's even said in racing circles that her reading material of choice over her breakfast is the Racing Post). She is also one of the UK's best-known owners and breeders of racehorses, with about 30 horses currently in training. Hampshire-based trainer Andrew Balding is one of a handful of trainers entrusted with ensuring the queen's horses are kept in peak physical condition. He currently has three horses in training for the queen: ""She is a very well-informed and keen owner, probably the best-informed owner in the country."" ""She adores breeding racehorses,"" says her racing manager, John Warren. ""As a consequence the Derby is the most special thing because it combines all that everyone knows about racing, into this one particular race. The British bloodstock industry is very lucky to have a patron such as the queen."" But despite this, the Epsom Derby remains the only one of the English ""Classics"" (a series of three-year-old races comprising the 2,000 Guineas, 1,000 Guineas, Oaks, St Leger and the Derby) that she has not won. Read more: The young queen who grew into a modern monarch . You have to go back to 1909 to find the last time a Derby winner was owned (in this case leased) by a reigning monarch; that was Minoru, owned by King Edward VII (although omen-watchers may note that as Prince of Wales he had success in 1900 with the portentously-named Diamond Jubilee). The queen herself has come tantalizingly close. In ten attempts, her best placing has been second (in the year of her coronation). But perhaps her best chance to capture the Derby came last year with Carlton House. The story of how the son of U.S. ""super sire"" Street Cry came to be in the queen's possession bears retelling: Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, himself one of the world's biggest racing enthusiasts, approached the queen to purchase one of her horses, Highland Glen, to join his stables in Dubai. After an auspicious start to his racing career, the horse had then heaped shame on his illustrious owner when he refused to enter the starting gates for a big race at Glorious Goodwood. In recognition of his volatile temperament, the queen refused to accept any payment for Highland Glen and let the Sheikh have him for free. Interactive: The queen in numbers . The grateful Sheikh wanted to repay the queen's gesture and later that summer sent word that had hand-picked four yearlings from his own breeding program which he intended to gift to the queen. One of those was Carlton House. The colt started that year's Derby as the red-hot favourite, buoyed by a wave of public support for the prospect of a first win in the country's premier Classic for the queen. Unfortunately, bad luck in running and the loss of a shoe conspired to relegate him to third, behind an exuberant Mikael Barzalona on Pour Moi. Although the queen's reaction went unrecorded, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that Carlton House represented an unrepeatable chance for Her Majesty to lay her hands on the one piece of silverware that has eluded her for six decades. By all indications, however, the disappointment of last year has not dampened her enthusiasm for the event. So although the queen's red and purple silks won't be seen on any of the runners entered in this year's Derby, whether it's the Aiden O'Brien-trained Camelot or Andrew Balding's mercurial colt Bonfire who joins the ranks of the immortals, one thing is certain: there will be one fan on Derby Day cheering louder than them all.","The queen starts the jubilee weekend with a visit to the Epsom Derby .

"London, England (CNN) -- If you've been in London for the queen's Diamond Jubilee, you'll almost certainly have seen the city's ""other royals"": the Pearly Kings and Queens of London. ""We'll all be out in full-swing where we're needed,"" Vanessa Vallely, the pearly queen of the City of London told CNN before the celebrations kicked off. ""We are a recognizable part of London. I have a vision that when people go out to buy souvenirs like red-letter boxes and things like that. Well, maybe one day, there will be a little pearly queen fridge magnet!"" With their colorful feathered hats and hand-sewn pearl button suits, the pearlies are an instantly recognizable London institution dating back 150 years. It all started with Henry Croft, an orphan turned street-sweeper and rat-catcher in Victorian London. At first, the young Henry Croft struggled on the streets of London but he found help with the Costermongers of Spitalfields Market -- apple sellers in London's East End. Read more: Buckingham Palace rocks in queen's honor . The Costermonger's sewed pearl buttons down the seams of their trousers to distinguish themselves in the busy markets of London. Inspired, Croft decided to create his own version -- covering every inch of a three-piece suit and top hat with pearl buttons. His theatrical flair attracted a lot of attention and Croft found he was soon earning more money than he needed. So, he donated much of it to charity, funding the London orphanage where he grew up. When he died in 1930, hundreds of mourners attended the funeral. Croft's charity work had become so well-known that he appointed a Pearly King and Queen in each of London's boroughs before he died to carry on his works. The pearlies have been working ever since, handing down their inherited titles and duties from generation to generation. In May, several pearlie families gathered at the Carpenters Arms pub in East London for a pearlie coronation. Nine pearly kings and queens were crowned. In fact, it was the biggest pearlie coronation since the 1960s. Read more: Pomp, pageantry and pouring rain . Vanessa Vallely and her 13-year-old daughter Mia were crowned the pearly queen of the City of London and the pearly queen of Hoxton, respectively. Traditionally, each pearlie sews their own pearl button suit before being crowned, often decorated with family symbols: a heart for charity, a horseshoe for luck, for example. Vanessa Vallely pairs her new suit with a sleek set of jet black Manolo Blahnik shoes but admits she had a little help sewing on the hundreds of pearl-buttons. ""It's a fantastic tradition. It's a role model ambassador. We stand for the good old days. What you're seeing is a real cockney knees-up."" She said ""Wherever basically we can pitch up and raise money."" ""My friends think it's really cool."" Mia chimes in, ""Some of them think it's kind of strange. But most think it's cool and something really fun. Which it is!"" Interactive: 60 years of royalty, discovery and global events . A ""cockney knees up"" is exactly what draws many people to the Pearlies. Tourists crammed into the modest pub, pints in hand, to catch a glimpse of the coronation proceedings. With lots of laughing and a bit of shouting, nine shiny, plastic crowns and polyester-ermine cloaks were placed on the heads and shoulders of the new pearly kings and queens. The coronation itself is brief but the celebration last long into the summer evening. The music strikes up and the pearlies begin their rounds with plastic buckets, collecting spare change for charity. It may not seem like much but it adds up. Jackie Murphy, the pearly queen of Hackney, raised more than $100 thousand dollars for her charity last year. She proudly displays her suit of 19 thousand pearl buttons she sewed herself. On the lapels, are the pins of at least a dozen charities she has helped. ""We don't ask for a fee, but we charge a donation for our chosen charities."" She explains proudly, ""Now, my daughter's a pearly queen and my grandchildren are princes and princesses. It's a lovely tradition.""","The Pearly kings and queens are a recognizable London institution .

"London (CNN) -- With races run, records set and a remarkable sporting infrastructure now in place, the London Olympic and Paralympic Games have confirmed the UK capital's reputation as one of the world's great cities. The Games will also have inspired millions across the globe to pursue sporting careers across a range of disciplines. But arguably London 2012's legacy is more intangible. Who would have thought gold medallists like American swimmer Mallory Weggemann, Brazilian Alan Oliveira, South Africa's double amputee Oscar Pistorius and Briton's Ellie Simmonds (swimming), Jonnie Peacock (athletics) and David Weir (wheelchair racer) would become household names across the world? Recording unprecedented crowds, with some two-and-a-half million tickets sold, the British got behind the Paralympics in a way that no other country has previously done and helped shift perceptions towards disability around the world as they did so. The Star newspaper in Pistorius' home nation captured an emotion reverberating around the globe saying that the Paralympic Games have marked a watershed in the way the planet views disability. ""The 2012 Paralympics will live long in the memory as the Games where South Africa and the world learnt that these Games were not the fun games nor the 'shame' games,"" wrote The Star. ""London was where the athletes became professional, where they became elite and celebrated their elevation to a new status,"" the newspaper added. It was a Paralympics where spectators finally started to focus on ability rather than disability, a request many Paralympians have always made. ""I think people are going to look back at this Paralympic Games and for the first time really, truly believe that Paralympic sport is not just inspirational, it's hard-core sport,"" said Pistorius. Born with a congenital defect, Pistorius had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. But the 25-year-old has overcome his disability to such an extent that he became the first double amputee to compete at the Olympics when running in South Africa's 4x400m relay team this summer. The achievements of Kenya's Mary Zakayo have also helped change attitudes to Paralympic sport in Africa. The wheelchair-bound javelin and shot put thrower was the women's Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award winner in Sunday's Paralympic closing ceremony -- an award given to a male and a female athlete who exemplify the Paralympic spirit. ""Because of my success in field events, more women with disabilities in my community and in Kenya have shown interest in sports,"" Zakayo says. ""The Paralympic Movement is spreading in my country and opens opportunities for people with disabilities and help change the perceptions towards people with disabilities in a positive way."" But it's not just Africa where attitudes are changing. The Gulf Daily in Bahrain has been won over, crediting this year's Paralympics with providing a ""fundamental change in the way much of the world looks at disability,"" adding that the Games ""swiftly taught us to look beyond disability towards achievement."" Thirty-two years after Moscow refused to stage the Paralympics, the enthusiasm shown by the organizers, the British crowds and, of course, the athletes at this summer's Games has finally begun to convert the Russian public, says tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. ""Russians are not used to encountering disabled people in the street ... yet for the first time, they discovered a previously unknown sporting world and its courageous fighters,"" the paper said. Even in Britain, attitudes have been changing. Polls conducted during the Games showing that eight out of 10 British adults thought the 2012 Paralympics had had a positive impact on the way disabled people are viewed by the public. This would be yet another triumph for the London 2012 organising committee whose chairman, Lord Coe fervently believes that the British public will never view sport nor disability in the same way after this summer's Paralympics. ""We set a goal to create awareness,"" said Lord Coe, the chairman of the London 2012 Organising Committee. ""I really think we have done that in helping converting some of those extraordinary talents into household names. I really genuinely think we have had a seismic effect in shifting public attitudes (towards disability)."" On Monday afternoon, the likes of Simmonds, Peacock and Weir were joined by fellow Paralympians and Olympians as crowds estimated to be in excess of one million thronged the streets of London to wave goodbye to what Prime Minister David Cameron called a ""golden summer of British sport."" It officially ended on Sunday as the Paralympics closing ceremony extinguished the flame in the Olympic Stadium for the final time, before the Paralympic flag was handed to the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian city which will host both Games in 2016. And if the legacy of London 2012 really proves to be a defining shift in the global attitude towards disability, then what on earth could Rio expect to achieve in four years time?","London 2012 Games have produced massive crowds, memorable action and a surprising legacy .

"(CNN) -- The Olympics may have started out as an idealistic showcase of amateur sporting prowess, but now it's a very big business. In fact, it's one of the biggest brands in the world, claims a new report. The four-yearly sporting spectacular -- rated second in scale behind soccer's World Cup -- is worth just over $47.5 billion according to valuation specialist Brand Finance. That leaves it behind only Apple ($70.6 billion) and above the corporate world's next biggest brand, Google ($47.4 billion). These figures, based on the International Olympic Committee's financial statements, put the legacy of Pierre de Coubertin well above major sponsors such as Samsung ($38.2 billion), General Electric ($33.2 billion) and Coca-Cola ($31.1 billion). The Frenchman -- who believed in the right for everyone to take part -- revived the Ancient Games in the late 1800s. Some 116 years after the first modern Olympics took place in Athens, the event is apparently now worth 134 times the National Bank of Greece ($354 million). iReport: Send us your pictures and videos . While the Hellenic economy is all but crippled in these difficult economic times, the Olympics -- originally dedicated to the gods, but now seemingly devoted to the dollar -- is experiencing significant financial growth. In the four years since the Beijing Games, total revenue has increased 38% to $5.1 billion. Of that amount, broadcast revenue has boomed by 51% to $3.9 billion (compared to just $1.2 million in 1960) with the largest spend by continent in North America ($2.3 billion). These numbers are expected to go up again as the Olympic cycle moves from London to Rio in 2016, with Brand Finance -- which has yet to rate soccer's World Cup or European Championship -- reporting that revenue will pass the $6 billion mark. In fact, another report -- by Sportcal -- states that this four-year cycle will be worth $8 billion overall, covering London 2012 and Vancouver's 2010 Winter Games. As the IOC retains only 10% of its income to cover operating costs, this represents a healthy profit -- much of which is plowed back into developing sport worldwide. ""There is no doubt that the Olympics 'Brand' is a formidable revenue generator and has huge value,"" says Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh. ""It has recently been criticized for heavy-handed brand control, but it should not be forgotten that in the current four-year cycle $4.6 billion has been generated for initiatives to develop sport worldwide. It is also expected to produce a net benefit to the UK economy of more than $25 billion."" However, British sports business expert Simon Chadwick argues that these figures do not show the whole picture -- and he insists that brand value is more complex than mere numbers can portray. ""While it cannot be denied that the IOC contributes to the funding and development of sport across the world, many of the costs associated with running the Olympics are covered by host nations which, in turn, can divert resources away from investment in other sporting projects that might normally be pursued,"" Chadwick, of England's Coventry University Business School, told CNN. ""Moreover, the Games often inflict economic costs upon countries (such as increased congestion, increased crime, resource inflation etc.) that are not accounted for by the financial figures quoted here. ""The IOC has created value for the brand on the back of unprecedented protection; there can be few corporations across the world that oblige governments to pass legislation aimed at protecting the Games' interests. As such, the IOC is afforded competitive and commercial benefits that are essentially unique and highly distinctive."" Such restrictions mean that the likes of McDonald's (valued at $22.2 billion) have an almost free reign in the supply of food on the Olympic Park site. And sponsorship deals can ensure a hefty return on investment for the corporations who sign Olympic partnership deals, known as the TOP program. ""Procter & Gamble expects to generate an extra $500 million in sales from London 2012, having already generated $100 million from Vancouver 2010,"" states the Brand Finance report. ""GE, which reportedly paid $200 million for TOP sponsorship rights covering London and Vancouver, already believes it has earned back its investment. ""GE uses its Olympic links to win big contracts in the host nations, particularly in developing nations such as China (after Beijing 2008) and the upcoming Winter Games in Sochi, Russia for 2014."" However, Chadwick believes sponsorship is only one factor in measuring brand value. ""All the sponsorship figure does is to tell us something about the value of the Games brand to a sponsor, rather than to consumers,"" he said. ""This sense of corporatism is further amplified by the geographic figures, which are heavily skewed towards North America. The implication is that there is little value in the Olympics brand in Africa (which provides just 1% of the broadcast revenue)."" As well as raising the issue of who the Olympics actually benefits, Chadwick believes the report gives a limited picture of the Games' brand value. ""It highlights the willingness of broadcasters and sponsors to pay for the right to be associated with the Games. The figures are therefore not necessarily an accurate indicator of true global worth in that there is no clear link to the peoples' purchase intentions and behavior in relation to the brand,"" he said. ""What the precise nature of that value might be is open to question. It is also somewhat worrying that a significant part of the brand value attributed by this study emanates from only two sources: broadcasting and sponsorship. ""The domination of broadcasting revenues is an especially worrying point as it implies that the majority of brand value is delivered by media spectacle alone. ""This casts some doubt on the extent to which consumers and fans value the brand, but also implies that the generation of brand value is delivered by broadcasters and sponsors, and not by the IOC or the inherent or intrinsic qualities of the products it delivers."" Chadwick argues that it is wrong to compare the Olympics with corporations such as Apple and Google, who operate on different timeframes and in a different business environment. ""The methodology used to value a brand like Apple will be entirely different to that employed to value the Olympics -- it is therefore scientifically unsound to make any such sort of comparison,"" he said.","Report says the Olympics is the second biggest brand in the world .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Despite the passage of a law banning Gadhafi-era officials from Libya's government, armed groups continued their blockade of two ministry buildings in Tripoli on Monday, this time demanding the dismissal of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan. The adoption of the political isolation law by Libya's parliament on Sunday had been a main demand of militiamen who surrounded the foreign and justice ministries last week. But on Monday some of the armed protesters said they want Zeidan out. ""We came out with two main demands, the political isolation law and the dismissal of Ali Zeidan's government,"" said Osama Kubbar, one of the leaders of the armed protest. Kubbar said the protesters will not back down from this demand, and ministries will continue to be surrounded until Zeidan steps down. According to Kubbar, indirect negotiations with officials close to the prime minister were under way. Last week two senior government confirmed talks with the leaders of the armed protests to try and resolve the situation. On Sunday, a member of the General National Congress -- Libya's parliament -- told CNN that there were discussions among some lawmakers to withdraw confidence from Zeidan's government. Kubbar accused Zeidan of being unfit to rule Libya, and some of the prime minister's official appointments were opposed by former revolutionary fighters. Zeidan's actions, Kubbar said, disrespected and provoked them. He said his group protested peacefully for months, but when their demands were not met, they resorted to armed protests. ""(The government) forced us to do this. I hold them responsible; this is the only language they understand,"" he said. Kubbar is the deputy head of an umbrella group created at the end of 2011 that includes several former rebel groups. Many Libyans expressed concern on Sunday that the law's passage after months of political wrangling would undermine the democratic process and further embolden armed groups. So far the Libyan government has said it will not use force in dealing with the armed protests to avoid bloodshed, according to recent comments from Zeidan. ""The government has so far shown a policy of restraint; they can actually confront if they chose to, but that would seem like a civil war broke out in Libya,"" said Mohamed Eljarh, a contributor to Foreign Policy magazine's ""Transitions"" blog. ""I think that is why they're still showing restraint until now. Not sure how long for though."" According to Eljarh, the government has the support of some regional militias who could mobilize if there any efforts to remove Zeidan by force. Like some other Libya analysts, Eljarh believes the armed protests are fueled by political interests. He says leaders of the movement, such as Kubbar, ran in last year's parliamentary elections but failed to win a seat. Kubbar also tried to become prime minister, but he could not secure enough parliamentary votes for a nomination. ""These guys aren't representatives of anyone but their own interests and agendas ... it is nothing to do with legitimacy, democracy or safeguarding of the revolution. ... To me, this is pure struggle for power and influence,"" Eljarh said. Zeidan's government, in power since November, inherited a country awash in weapons and militias and has taken steps to try and rein in these groups as it struggles to build an army and a police force. ""Zeidan and his government took a tough line on militias in Tripoli and Benghazi, and they are now paying the price for such a line,"" Eljarh said.","Protesters who won new law against Gadhafi-era officials continue efforts .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China on Friday denied accusations by Japan that a Chinese navy vessel had put a radar-lock on a Japanese warship near a group of disputed islands at the heart of a bitter feud between the two Asian nations. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense said in a statement, its first official response to the claims, that Japanese officials had given out ""false information"" and ""hyped up"" the threat from China. Opinion: Is Asia sleepwalking into war? The Japanese allegations this week have put a fresh strain on relations between Tokyo and Beijing, which remain at loggerheads over who has sovereignty over the remote, rocky islands in the East China Sea. The tensions have resulted in maritime standoffs and the scrambling of fighter jets in recent months. Japan currently administers the islands, but China has been regularly sending its own vessels on patrols in the surrounding waters. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday described as ""dangerous"" and ""regrettable"" the actions of the Chinese frigate that Tokyo says used radar to gather information on the location of a Japanese destroyer in the East China Sea last week. That type of radar could be used to produce data needed to fire upon the Japanese vessel. Read more: How a remote rock split China and Japan . But the Chinese defense ministry said Friday that its navy vessel's radar maintained ""normal operations"" and that it didn't use the fire-control radar. It also denied accusations that its navy put a radar-lock on a Japanese helicopter earlier in January, saying that Tokyo's claims didn't match the facts. ""Japan unilaterally released false information to the public without confirming the facts with China,"" the ministry said. Tokyo unimpressed . But the Japanese government stuck by its account and expressed dissatisfaction with the Chinese statement on Friday. ""Japan cannot accept the Chinese explanation and urged a sincere response from China on the matter,"" Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said. The Japanese foreign ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador to Tokyo over Beijing's denial of the radar incident. The United States expressed concern earlier this week about the alleged radar-locking on the Japanese ship. Interactive: Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? ""Actions such as this escalate tensions and increase the risk of an incident or a miscalculation, and they could undermine peace, stability and economic growth in this vital region,"" Victoria Nuland, the spokeswoman for the State Department, said Tuesday. The United States has tried to avoid getting dragged into the island dispute, saying it doesn't take sides on such competing claims of sovereignty. But U.S. officials have admitted that the islands fall under a mutual security treaty between Washington and Tokyo. The Japanese call the disputed islands Senkaku, and China refers to them as Diaoyu. Near them are important shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and possible mineral deposits. Competing claims . Disagreement over who owns the small, uninhabited islands has soured diplomatic and economic relations between Japan and China since September, when Japan announced it had bought several of the islands from private Japanese owners. China was outraged, as were protesters who marched through several Chinese cities calling for boycotts of Japanese products and asserting Beijing's sovereignty over the islands. Some of the protests turned violent, and damage to Japanese offices and businesses was reported. In December, the dispute escalated when Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese plane was seen near the islands. Chinese ships have repeatedly entered contested waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard. China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Tensions with Russia . Japan was given an abrupt reminder of a separate territorial dispute on Wednesday when its defense ministry said two Russian fighter jets entered Japanese airspace near the tip of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The Russian jets left Japanese airspace without incident after a little more than a minute, the ministry said. The incident occurred near a set of islands disputed by Tokyo and Moscow since the end of World War II. Russian officials denied their jets entered Japanese airspace, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong, and Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo. CNN's Dayu Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.","The Chinese defense ministry says Japanese accusations don't match the facts .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed the Republican version of the Violence Against Women Act on Wednesday, despite strong opposition from Democrats. The GOP version, passed 222-205, offers a stark contrast from the bill passed by the Senate in late April, which will lead to further political fighting as both chambers attempt to work out a compromise over the law's reauthorization. Wednesday's vote fell largely along party lines, though 23 Republicans voted against their own party and opposed the bill. Meanwhile, six Democrats defected and voted in favor of the Republican version. The Violence Against Women Act was first enacted in 1994. It has been reauthorized twice since then with bipartisan support and very little controversy. That's not the case this time around. The Senate approved a bill last month with bipartisan support, voting 68-31 with every Republican woman supporting the measure. That version expands coverage to offer services to more illegal immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse. It also specifies that the law include gay, lesbian and transgender victims. Human Rights Watch released a report Wednesday showing immigrant farmworkers are especially at risk for domestic abuse and argued provisions in the Senate bill -- not the House version -- ""would go some way toward fixing the problem and should be enacted."" House Republicans oppose those changes, saying they are unnecessary because the law already covers all victims, and instead favor a narrower version of renewing the law. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, opposed the GOP bill and has been calling for a vote on the Senate measure. ""All victims of domestic violence, irrespective of gender, ought to be protected,"" Hoyer said. ""We believe the protection ought to be comprehensive, and we don't believe the Republicans' bill does that."" He joined a number of House Democrats who urged their colleagues to vote against the bill prior to the floor vote on Wednesday. The White House late Tuesday threatened to veto the House GOP bill, in part because it ""fails to include language that would prohibit discrimination against LGBT victims."" The veto threat also says the GOP proposals ""senselessly remove existing legal protections"" and ""jeopardize victims by placing them directly in harm's way."" ""Today we are now debating something else that I never thought that we would be debating, which is whether or not all victims should be protected or just some,"" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, in a press conference Wednesday. ""And we stand strongly together in saying that every single victim of domestic violence should have the law on their side. Vice President Joe Biden reacted to Wednesday's vote by saying the House-passed version of the bill ""will roll back critical provisions to help victims of abuse."" House Republican leaders, meanwhile, accused Democrats of creating a phony fight for political gain. ""This is another one of the Democrat gimmicks that goes on around here,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a recent news conference. ""This is an important issue, but for our friends to be playing political games with this, frankly, is very inappropriate."" Sandy Adams, a first-term representative from Florida who rode the Republican wave in the 2010 midterm elections, agreed. ""I want to reauthorize it; I do not want to politicize it. The victims deserve better than that. Americans deserve better than that."" After the vote, Adams said, ""Make no mistake about it; this is a victim-centered bill that is all inclusive. Just like past reauthorizations, the House-passed legislation is focused on all victims, without regard for race, ethnicity, sexual preference, or nationality. House Republicans presented Adams as their new messenger this week in their fight to combat ""The War on Women,"" one of the harshest election-year attack lines congressional Democrats have launched at Republicans. They accuse the GOP of waging this war on issues ranging from contraception to preventive health care coverage. ""I'm pretty sure I'm not at war with myself,"" said Adams. She has maintained a relatively low profile during her time in Congress. But she stepped into the spotlight in a big way -- becoming the GOP face of the latest battle on Capitol Hill over the Violence Against Women Act, bringing her own story of domestic abuse with her. ""At an early age, I quit high school at 17 and joined the Air Force. Married by 18,"" Adams said. ""During the marriage, I had a little girl, and I realized really soon that my husband had a penchant for drinking, and when he drank, he turned very mean, very violent."" She took her daughter and left. She later found work as a law enforcement officer before winning a seat in the Florida state House and eventually running for the U.S. House. ""I have experienced it both on a personal level and a law enforcement level,"" Adams said. ""I know how this law has helped so many people in our country."" Her personal story may have helped Republicans push their version of the 18-year-old law and also help deflect the continued Democratic criticism that Republicans are insensitive toward women. While Adams condemns politics playing a role in this latest congressional standoff, being at the center of it doesn't help someone like her, who is facing some tough politics herself -- she is up against a much higher-profile fellow Republican, Rep. John Mica, in an upcoming primary in Florida. Now that the House has passed the Republican version of the bill, it will need to reconcile differences with the Senate over its bill. Both sides agree on the end goal: to renew the law. But in an election year, the lingering question is: How long will Congress drag out this fight? CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","NEW: The House passes the GOP version of the Violence Against Women Act 222-205 .

"(CNN) -- The curtain was raised on the English flat racing season in emphatic style as the Godolphin-owned Dawn Approach stormed to victory in the 2,000 Guineas, the first ""classic"" of the season, at Newmarket's Rowley Mile Saturday. The powerful chestnut, ridden by Kevin Manning, took the lead inside the final furlong and never looked like tiring, running out a five-length winner from Glory Awaits. It was a dominant performance in a race which has traditionally served as a bellwether for future greatness; a roll call of just the last few winners of this race includes no less personages as Camelot, Frankel, Makfi and Sea The Stars. It was also the first step towards redemption for Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai. After a tumultuous fortnight for Godolphin, which saw Sheikh Mohammed's racing operation engulfed by a doping scandal the likes of which has never been seen in British racing, the Sheikh himself was in attendance to witness his famous royal blue colors flying high once more, albeit courtesy of a horse trained outside of his Godolphin power base. Although he refused to be drawn on the scandal in his post-race remarks, Dubai's ruler was clearly relieved. ""I am very happy to come and to see a good horse winning the Guineas -- and I think he is a great horse,"" he said. Sheikh Mohammed purchased this horse as a two-year-old from Irish owner/trainer Jim Bolger. Indeed, the Sheikh is almost certainly thanking his lucky stars that he elected to keep Dawn Approach in training with Bolger in Ireland rather than move him into the care of Mahmood Al Zarooni, his disgraced former trainer who is currently serving an eight-year ban from the sport after he admitted to doping 15 of his horses with anabolic steroids, including 1,000 Guineas hopeful Certify. That yard in Newmarket remains on lock down until every horse can be demonstrated to be clean and steroid free. Superstar showdown . This race had been billed as a showdown between two unbeaten superstars, Dawn Approach and rival Toronado. At least one horse had to lose his unbeaten record today, and it was Toronado who appeared to fade badly at the business end of the race, having been kept in contention up to that point by Richard Hughes. Dawn Approach, meanwhile, though he took longer to get into his stride, appeared to promise much more as he flew past the winning post to the delight of a packed Rowley Mile crowd. ""He is a very special horse. He traveled very well throughout the race,"" winning rider Kevin Manning said. Although considered the first leg of English racing's Triple Crown, it is by no means a certainty that a Guineas winner will go to contest the longer distance Epsom Derby, racing's 'blue riband' event and the second leg of the treble. Bolger disclosed after the race that any decision about the Derby would be taken in consultation with the owner. ""Sheikh Mohammed said we would sleep on it and we will see from there,"" said Bolger. ""He's a hardy horse and I'm sure he will come out of it well."" Despite this, Dawn Approach is widely expected to head to Epsom next month and has already moved into firm favoritism for the Derby, a race that has never been won by Godolphin. What price the ultimate comeback for racing's most famous patron? For Sheikh Mohammed and Godolphin, the journey of one thousand miles may just have begun with eight furlongs in Suffolk. 1,000 Guineas . Hughes bounced back from Saturday's disappointment to win the first British Classic of his career in Sunday's 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket. The 40-year-old Irishman, who was last season's champion jockey, came home first on Sky Lantern -- like Toronado, trained by his father in law Richard Hannon. The champion two-year-old last year, Sky Lantern worked her way through the field to win in sunny conditions.","Dawn Approach wins 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket .

"(CNN) -- The week of hellish Thanksgiving travel is almost upon us, when news crews will descend upon airports everywhere for their epic updates from the front line: ""Breaking, breaking! The airport is really crowded, you guys!"" Those reporters are correct: Before we can lapse into that tryptophan-laced food coma with family and friends, we must travel. And since Turkey Day is secular and more or less universally observed, we must do it en masse.

"(CNN) -- After sweating out several weeks when news broke that his ""late girlfriend"" never existed -- and after sweating out the first day of the NFL draft without getting picked -- Manti Te'o can now sit back, knowing he has a home in professional football. The San Diego Chargers drafted the Notre Dame star and one-time tabloid fixture with the draft's 38th pick, the sixth selection of the second round. The Heisman Trophy runner-up talked during last season about his girlfriend Lennay Kekua, a 22-year-old Stanford University student whom he said died within hours of his beloved grandmother. The sports website Deadspin broke the story in January that Kekua wasn't real, and Te'o subsequently insisted he'd been the victim of a hoax. A California man named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo later admitted on the ""Dr. Phil"" show that he'd created the alter persona of Kekua, even pretending to be a woman when he talked frequently to the Notre Dame linebacker. Some had speculated Te'o, who led the Fighting Irish to an undefeated regular season before they lost in the national title game to Alabama, could go in the first round. But every team with a pick passed. Another player who slid down NFL draft boards, despite the predictions of many NFL prognosticators, was West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith. He was selected 39th, right after Te'o, by the New York Jets -- who currently also have Mark Sanchez and Tim Tebow on their roster. Overall, the top of the NFL draft wasn't dominated as it often is by big-name playmakers -- there were no running backs chosen in the first round. In fact, three of the first four picks were offensive lineman, starting with the Kansas City Chiefs tapping Central Michigan's Eric Fisher No. 1 overall.","Manti Te'o is picked 38th -- the 6th pick of the second round -- in the NFL draft .

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of trying to attack the Dutch royal family by crashing his car near their bus has died, Dutch police said Friday. A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn. The man, whose name was not released, had been seriously injured in the crash Thursday in the town of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, police said. He died early Friday, police said. He had been charged with trying to attack the royal family, authorities said. Were you there? Send us your video, images .

Five people, as well as the driver, were killed and 12 were wounded in the incident, which happened during the country's annual Queen's Day celebration, police said. Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday.  See who the Dutch royal family are » . As the bus moved along, a black hatchback zoomed past it. The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by. The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear. There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said. Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving. The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, newspapers Friday widely expressing disbelief and suggesting the monarchy would have to change. ""Queens Day will never be the same,"" the Trouw newspaper said. ""The Netherlands always has been proud of their no nonsense royal family. With this comes a Queen who not only cycles a bike, but also mixes with people without obvious security measurements. Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?""

"(CNN) -- Brazilian star Kaka expects to be joined by fellow world 'Galacticos' as Real Madrid president Florentino Perez constructs a Spanish Primera Liga side that he hopes will rule supreme. Brazilian superstar Kaka expects to the first of several 'Galaticos' joining Spanish giants Real Madrid. World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo would join $100 million signing Kaka at the Bernabeu tomorrow if Perez had his way. So, too, would the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Villa. ""Real Madrid intend to build a great team, along with historic players such as Raul and Casillas,"" said Kaka. ""We will make history again, both in Spain and Europe. I guess the sporting project is very good. The world's 20 most wanted footballers. ""The president is already making contact (with potential signings) and is putting together a competitive team, one which will try to once again become champions. That's why I chose Madrid."" Perez wants Real to rediscover the flair, verve and artistry that once made them the most celebrated club in world football. He recently returned for a second spell as president and the arrival of midfielder Kaka confirmed that he will again pursue the policy that snared the likes of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham. Manchester United forward Ronaldo clearly tops the wanted list and according to PA Sport Perez told Onda Cero and Radio Marca: ""I will do everything possible to get Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid. Kaka is the first signing."" Quizzed about reports that United have allowed Ronaldo to sign a pre-contract with Madrid, he added: ""I have read about this but I have been at this club a week and not seen anything about this."" He added: ""What I want the most is to keep good relationships with other clubs. The only thing I have done is ensure we follow the path Santiago Bernabeu marked out for us; (signing) the best players in the world (Alfredo Di Stefano), the best in Spain (Amancio) and, with them, the best from the youth set-up (Raul)."" Indications are it will be a summer of change at Madrid with nine players likely to be on their way out. ""(The squad) has 28 players. We can bring in six new and only register 25,"" he said. Perez, meanwhile, told Sky Italia: ""We are always thinking about great players. Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are among other great players around the world. All the latest transfer gossip and speculation. ""We all know that these are players that we would like to buy but they can't all come."" The comments will not be too well received at United's Old Trafford and Perez insisted any move for Ronaldo would be done via the right channels. ""Ronaldo is a great player who we would like to bring to the club, but first we have to speak to Manchester United because the important thing is for us to maintain a good rapport with everyone,"" he said. Inter Milan striker Ibrahimovic is another target, although Madrid may have to compete with arch rivals Barcelona for the Sweden international, while Villa has also been earmarked. Spanish daily Marca claim Perez has an agreement in place with Villa's club Valencia, whose financial position means they are unlikely to reject an offer which comes close to their valuation.","Brazilian Kaka expects to be joined by fellow world 'Galacticos' at Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- How will the Dreamliner get back in the air? The answers lie in a dense federal document posted online Thursday. The Federal Aviation Administration's Airworthiness Directive for Boeing's 787-8 was posted online Thursday and goes into effect upon publication Friday in the Federal Register. The directive outlines the modifications necessary for the much-anticipated Dreamliner to fly again after faulty battery systems grounded the aircraft earlier this year. The FAA stated that any 787's return to service would only take place after the agency monitors modifications of the aircraft in the U.S. fleet and inspects the work. United plans to resume 787 service in May . ""An FAA inspector will have to accept the work before the airplane technically is in compliance with the (directive),"" said FAA spokesman Les Dorr. Nearly 50 already-delivered Dreamliners have been grounded for more than three months, after two incidents on jets operated by Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. The Dreamliner's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East, where long-haul flights account for much of an airline's business. United Airlines, which has six Boeing 787 aircraft, is the only U.S. airline to take delivery of the Dreamliner so far. It will cost the airline about $2.8 million to implement the fix, according to the FAA's Federal Register filing. Calling the FAA plan ""a good step forward,"" United spokeswoman Christen David said the company is developing ""a return-to-service plan, and we look forward to getting our 787s back in the air."" The company plans to begin domestic flights using the 787 in May and possibly launch the Denver-Narita (Japan) route on June 10. Airline quality report sorts out duds from the dynamos . Boeing is sending special teams to assist in the repairs, according to Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel. ""The FAA's publication of the Airworthiness Directive is an important step forward in returning the 787 fleet to flight status,"" Birtel said in an e-mail. The directive requires that 787 operators install ""main battery and auxiliary power unit battery enclosures (APU) and environmental control system (ECS) ducts; and replacing the main battery, the APU battery and their respective battery chargers."" ""Once modifications are completed on individual airplanes, our customers will determine, with their regulatory authorities, when to return their 787s to service,"" said Birtel. Although the FAA's fix only applies to U.S. carriers, it's likely other foreign civil aviation authorities will consider the U.S. agency's plan, said the FAA's Dorr. Boeing has already started installing the modified battery system on 10 aircraft in service and nine aircraft in production, said Boeing CEO Jim McNerney during Boeing's earnings call Wednesday. ""We expect to complete the bulk of fleet retrofits by mid-May,"" said McNerney, according to a transcript of the call. McNerney said Boeing expects to resume Dreamliner deliveries in early May.

"Washington (CNN) -- A top Senate Democrat has offered a pair of amendments to an immigration reform bill bolstering rights for same-sex couples, a politically risky move that threatens to shatter Republican support for the sweeping legislation. Vermont Sen. Patrick's Leahy's amendments would recognize same-sex marriages in which one spouse is an American, and also would allow U.S. citizens to sponsor foreign-born same-sex partners for green cards as long as there's proof of a committed relationship. They were among dozens of amendments filed with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday as the panel prepares to take up the legislation later this week. ""For immigration reform to be truly comprehensive, it must include protections for all families,"" Leahy said. ""We must end the discrimination that gay and lesbian families face in our immigration law."" Other amendments proposed by committee members include a proposal by Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions to significantly cut the number of foreign workers granted admission to the United States under the bill. Gay rights plan clouds immigration reform prospects . ""This bill (as currently written) would authorize a dramatic surge in permanent low-skill and chain migrationâ€”and would bring in millions more temporary foreign workersâ€”at a time when 90 million Americans are outside the labor force and nearly 50 million are on food stamps,"" Sessions said. ""The result would be lower wages and more unemployment."" Utah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch filed proposals to boost visas for high-skilled workers, and require both DNA identification and proof of payment of all back taxes for any undocumented immigrant seeking legal status, among other things. The Judiciary Committee, chaired by Leahy, is currently considering the 844-page bill filed by the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" -- four Senate Democrats and four Senate Republicans who labored for months to bridge a cavernous ideological divide on the hot button issue. Four members of the group -- Republicans Jeff Flake of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Democrats Dick Durbin of Illinois and Chuck Schumer of New York -- are also members of the Judiciary Committee. The Gang of Eight's bill creates a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while strengthening border security and bringing dramatic change to labor policy on America's farms. If enacted, the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation's immigration policy since 1986. Proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of roughly 11 million undocumented residents. Critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty, rewarding those who chose to break the country's immigration laws. Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told CNN it's unlikely the narrowly divided 18-member Senate committee would make significant changes to the legislation. ""Members of the Gang of Eight have indicated they'll band together to resist substantial changes to the bill,"" Fitz noted. ""The central structure of this proposal is remarkably solid."" Fitz, a close observer of the legislative maneuvering surrounding the bill, predicted that only a small fraction of amendments filed Tuesday will actually be voted on by the panel. Members ""will hit a fatigue point,"" he said. Of all the amendments up for consideration, however, Leahy's same-sex measures are likely to prove the most politically controversial. Under Leahy's sponsorship plan, modeled after his Uniting American Families Act, gays and lesbians requesting green cards for foreign-born partners would have to be married if their states currently recognize same-sex marriages. If their states do not recognize same-sex marriage, they would have to meet a series of requirements proving major emotional and financial commitments. The list of requirements could include, among other things, jointly owned property, shared child custody, joint bank accounts, joint credit cards, proof of a commitment ceremony and photographs of shared vacations and holidays with extended family. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, arguably the most prominent Republican member of the Gang of Eight, warned recently that Leahy's proposal is a political poison pill that could undermine any hopes for passage of the broader bill. ""This immigration bill is difficult enough as it is,"" Rubio told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt last month. ""If you inject something like this in the bill, it will die. The coalition behind it will fall apart."" Rubio, a potential presidential candidate, warned that he would withdraw his own support if Leahy's amendment is added. ""This is not the issue to engage this in,"" he warned. ""You will threaten the entire product."" Rubio discussed immigration reform with more than two dozen conservative grassroots leaders in a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, according to an aide to the senator. Most of the activists are backing the reform effort, the aide said. Durbin acknowledged Tuesday that while he backs Leahy's proposal, it could prove problematic for the larger immigration reform bill. ""There are some problems on the Republican side when it comes to dealing with (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) issues,"" Durbin told CNN. The Illinois senator noted the possibility that the upcoming ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on the federal Defense of Marriage Act could render the whole issue moot. ""The DOMA ruling could change this whole debate,"" Durbin said. ""They could eliminate DOMA and impose obligations on our federal government (relating to) same gender marriage, and that would dramatically change what we're trying to achieve."" Fitz said Leahy will ultimately ""find the right way forward."" ""The Republican-controlled House will never accept (his same-sex amendment) as part of their bill,"" he said. Leahy's ""not going to tank this bill."" Regardless, it is significantly easier for Leahy to add the amendment to the bill while it is being considered by the Judiciary Committee. Democrats hold a 10-8 majority on the panel, and can approve changes on a strict majority basis if necessary. In contrast, controversial amendments taken up by the full Senate are virtually certain to face a 60-vote threshold. The Democratic caucus only controls 55 seats in the 100-member chamber. Backers of the bill have been hoping to win as many as 70 votes in the Senate, in order to give the bill bipartisan momentum heading into the more skeptical, GOP-controlled House. A bipartisan group of eight House members is currently working on its own immigration reform plan.","Amendments to immigration legislation would bolster rights for same-sex couples .

"London (CNN) -- Sixty years ago Monday, a 25-year-old woman visiting a remote part of Kenya got a message that her father had died. She cut her trip short and flew home to London. Prime Minister Winston Churchill met her at the airport -- because with her father dead, she had become Queen Elizabeth II. Celebrations of her Diamond Jubilee, marking six decades on the throne, officially begin Monday and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames. On Monday, the queen thanked the public ""for the wonderful support and encouragement that you have given to me and (husband) Prince Philip over these years."" She said in the open letter that she planned to ""dedicate myself anew to your service."" She called on people to ""give thanks for the great advances that have been made since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm heart"" in a brief letter that she signed simply ""Elizabeth R."" She was honored with a 41-gun salute in London's Hyde Park Monday, and a 21-gun salute in Edinburgh, Scotland. Two new photographs of the queen were released Monday as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, showing her wearing a necklace worn by Queen Victoria in her own Diamond Jubilee portrait in 1897. She is the oldest British monarch in history, but has not yet passed her great-great-grandmother Victoria as the longest-reigning one. Elizabeth II was not in line to the throne when she was born April 21, 1926. But the fate of Lilibet, as she was known to her friends, changed when her uncle Edward abdicated the thone to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. That made Elizabeth's stuttering father George king, and Elizabeth became queen when he died aged 56 following a lung operation. The queen seems to have inherited her mother's longevity. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, as she was known once George VI died, lived to be 101. The British monarch has no political power but Elizabeth has immense power as a figurehead. She is officially the head of state of 16 countries that used to be part of the British Empire, has met presidents and prime ministers, and has seen the world change beyond recognition during her reign. Following the queen's visit to Ireland in 2011 -- the first by a British monarch since Irish independence -- Prime Minister David Cameron described the effect Elizabeth is able to have when she chooses. At a state banquet, ""suddenly she started speaking in Irish, in Gaelic,"" Cameron recalled. ""It came as a complete surprise to everybody including the president (of Ireland,) who looked around the room and mouthed the word 'Wow.' It was that kind of moment. You don't often get people at state banquets saying 'Wow,' but it was a wow moment.""

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal has called for stricter doping controls and more transparency to help eradicate drug cheating in tennis. Nadal wants to ensure tennis is not plagued by the doping problems which have affected so many other sports, notably cycling, following the Lance Armstrong saga. ""It's something even I don't like to talk about because it has damaged the image of sport, and sport doesn't deserve this kind of thing in my opinion,"" the 11-time grand slam champion told CNN's Open Court show before his weekend triumph at Indian Wells. ""When somebody like Armstrong was an idol for most of the people who loved sport, at the end, you see that was not true. ""It's a big disappointment, so I think we need to work together in the same direction to change the situation. It cannot continue like this. ""We need to be stricter on a few things. We need to have all the controls made public."" Nadal, who made his return to action in February following a seven-month absence with a knee injury, said tennis needs an all-encompassing approach to drug testing in order to maintain the sport's image. ""We have to work together, we have to be working together with the administrators and hopefully we can change that terrible situation,"" he said. ""We are lucky that in tennis, it has happened in just very exceptional cases but at the end, tennis is in sport, so if that happens in other sports, it affects tennis too."" In recent months sport has been hit by several high-profile doping scandals. Cyclist Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles, while Australian sport was given a wake-up call after a government report alleged athletes were using illegal substances supplied by organized criminal groups. Cheating in sport: What are banned substances? Football's governing body FIFA has already stated its intention to introduce biological passports, while the outcome of the Operation Puerto trial in Spain into the relationship between sport and doctor Eufemiano Fuentes' doping network is ongoing. Biological passport . The International Tennis Federation (ITF) recently confirmed that it will introduce a biological passport program, a system similar to the one used in cycling, where players' drug test results are kept over a long period of time so that the use of illegal substances is more easily detected. ""The implementation of the athlete biological passport is an important step in the evolution of the tennis anti-doping program as it provides us with a great tool in the fight against doping in our sport,"" said ITF President Francesco Ricci Bitti. In 2011 the ITF and the World Anti-Doping Agency conducted just 21 out-of-competition blood tests in a bid to detect illegal products such as human growth hormone (HGH), EPO, transfusions and other blood-doping substances. According to the latest figures, the vast majority of tests in tennis in 2011 -- 2,019 of a total of 2,150 -- were urine. In February, the ITF banned Czech Republic player Barbora Zahlavova Strycova for six months after she tested positive for the stimulant sibutramine at a tournament in October. She insisted the drug had made it into her system through a supplement and denied taking it to enhance her performance. In 2010, former top 100 player Wayne Odesnik, was suspended by the ITF after Australian customs officials found eight vials containing HGH in his luggage. He denied using HGH and never tested positive for it. His two-year ban was cut in half because the ITF said Odesnik cooperated with its anti-doping program. Earlier this month, 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer told CNN that it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to think tennis is clean, while world No. 1 Novak Djokovic recently queried the declining number of blood tests he had undergone. ""I wasn't tested with blood for the last six or seven months,"" he told reporters. ""It was more regularly in the last two, three years ago. I don't know the reason why they stopped it.""","Rafael Nadal wants stricter drug controls in tennis .

"Washington (CNN) -- One year after a video surfaced showing government contractors using hedge clippers to cuts limbs off anesthetized goats -- an effort to replicate wartime injuries -- the U.S. Coast Guard says it is looking for training that does not use live animals. In a report released Friday, the Coast Guard cleared its members of any wrongdoing, saying the training is required by the Department of Defense and that Coast Guard participants did not violate any law, regulation or standard of conduct. But it said the contractor was cited for violating the Animal Welfare Act. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Manson K. Brown, who investigated the matter, ordered the agency to look for training methods that ""reduce and/or eliminate the role of live animals."" ""While no misconduct was committed by Coast Guard personnel, the controversial nature of (the program) demands the service continue to closely scrutinize its policies,"" Brown wrote. In the meantime, a Coast Guard spokesman acknowledged, the training program will continue. The so-called ""Live Tissue Training"" session that gave rise to the controversy occurred March 3, 2012 -- the last day of a five-day course for non-medical military personnel who might face life-threatening situations. Thirty-two Coast Guard members -- 29 of whom were being deployed to Iraq and the Persian Gulf -- participated at an outdoor site in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Instructors with Tier 1 Group, a federal contractor, anesthetized and intentionally injured the goats so the students could assess and treat combat-like injuries, the Coast Guard said. During the first phase of the training, the group was divided into teams of four to six students, and instructors placed anesthetized goats -- which they referred to as ""patients"" -- on tables. The instructors ""had the students turn their backs to the table while the instructor inflicted trauma to the animal."" Students then turned, assessed the injuries, and treated the animals. During the second phase, instructors ""inflicted combat-like injuries to the animals with a shotgun, pistol, ax, and scalpel,"" Brown's report says. The injured animals were laid out alongside a road to simulate an attack with an improvised explosive or enemy firefight, the report says. Teams ran into the simulated hot zone, some administering aid while others secured the scene and simulated returning gunfire. At the end of the training, the goats were euthanized. The number of goats was not disclosed. A participant videotaped some of the training, leaking the video to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, an animal rights organization. PETA posted the video online and filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Coast Guard. PETA said the training did not reflect battlefield situations, that the goats showed signs of pain and that the students did not show any sense of urgency in treating the animals. It also said an instructor cheerfully whistled while dismembering an animal as Coast Guard members made jokes. Brown's report concluded Coast Guard members behaved properly. ""Before the training started, both a T1G instructor and a Coast Guard chief petty officer encouraged students to make reports of any unprofessional behavior,"" the report says. It says many students described the training as professional, some calling it the best medical training they had ever received. ""However, one student opined that instructors and students were too lighthearted during training,"" the report says. But another student said the laughter was unconnected to the course. ""There is nothing in the video to suggest that this type of behavior was prevalent during the training or was motivated by anything other than reaction to a high stress situation,"" the report says. ""When one student inappropriately waved a severed animal leg in the air, a more senior ranking student quickly reprimanded him and the behavior stopped,"" the report says. One student also said that having only one person administer anesthesia was not sufficient for all of the animals, the report says, noting that the PETA video shows one animal moaning. Based on the video, the Department of Agriculture subsequently cited T1G for violating the Animal Welfare Act, the report says. Asked about the citation on Friday, the Agriculture Department gave CNN a warning letter it issued Tier 1 Group on Aug. 8, 2012, saying the department has evidence the contractor violated a regulation governing proper anesthesia for animals. T1G did not immediately return a CNN request for comment. But R. Andre Bell, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said, ""We conducted a follow-up inspection and determined the noncompliance items had been addressed."" A PETA official decried the Coast Guard report. ""Basically, this report says that all of the disturbing allegations that PETA made are true, but that the Coast Guard isn't accepting responsibility for it. They all but say that it was the contractor's fault,"" said . Justin Goodman, director of PETA's Laboratory Investigations Department. Last September, 11 members of Congress signed a letter asking the Government Accountability Office to investigate Tier 1 Group, citing last year's Coast Guard training and a 2011 USDA action citing the contractor for ""inadequate anesthesia oversight"" for at least 50 goats. PETA said the GAO has referred the matter to the Defense Department's inspector general's office, which could not be reached late Friday. T1G won a $1.7 million contact with the Naval Supply Systems Command in 2012 to conduct 24 iterations of Live Tissue Training for 360 Navy personnel using pigs, the letter says.","Video previously showed contractors dismembering goats to replicate battlefield wounds .

"(CNN) -- Four days after a U.S. civilian-operated cargo jet plunged into the ground shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, killing all seven people aboard, one expert said that a number of factors likely were involved in the incident. ""Accidents, of which this was among the worst that I've ever seen, are typically a confluence of circumstances of seemingly unrelated events, which all coalesce to create a disaster,"" said Arthur Rosenberg, a pilot, engineer and partner in the New York-based law firm, Soberman & Rosenberg. The doomed plane's final moments appear to have been captured by a dashboard camera inside a vehicle on the base. The approximately three-minute video shows what appears to be the National Airlines jet starting its climb at 11:20 a.m. local time Monday from the base. National Air Cargo, the parent of National Airlines, said the flight had refueled at Bagram en route from Camp Bastian, a British military base in Afghanistan, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. National said the aircraft had landed uneventfully in Bagram and no additional cargo or people were taken on there, it said. Prior to departure, the cargo was reinspected, it added. ""The cargo contained within the aircraft was properly loaded and secured, and had passed all necessary inspections prior to departing Camp Bastian,"" the company said in a statement posted on its website. It identified the crew members as two pilots, two first officers, a loadmaster and two people involved in maintenance. U.S. military plane crashes in Kyrgyzstan . The pilots were likely doing a ""maximum performance takeoff"" in an attempt to climb to altitude as quickly as possible, thereby limiting exposure to any attempts to shoot it down, Rosenberg said Friday, citing the jet's pitch attitude, which he said appeared higher than normal. National Airlines, which specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses, did not immediately return a call asking about whether the pilots had, in fact, performed such a takeoff. About 12 seconds into the video, the Boeing 747-400 appears to stall, rolls from side to side, and drops. At 23 seconds, the plane crashes nose first into the ground off the side of the road, erupting into a ball of orange flame and black smoke. CNN cannot confirm the video's authenticity. It bears the date 2013/02/01, but date stamps can easily be inaccurate. The cargo aboard ill-fated Flight NCR102 included five mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles that were being taken out of Afghanistan as part of the drawdown of U.S. forces, said Shirley Kaufman of National Air Cargo. MRAPs can weigh 12 tons to 24 tons apiece, depending on the model, according to a 2011 Congressional Research Service report. That would mean the MRAPs had a total weight of at least 60 tons, which is within the jet's specifications, according to Boeing. If the takeoff had been rougher than usual, ""it could have caused the cargo in the back of the plane to become loose,"" Rosenberg said. If that happened, and the cargo slid to the rear of the plane, it could have left the plane with an improper weight and balance, he said. He compared that situation with what happens when a heavy person and a light person get on either end of a seesaw. ""The light person is never going to get the heavy person off the ground,"" he said. In the case of cargo that was not properly placed or secured, ""You've got a big, heavy person at the end of the airplane, which outweighs the flight control's capacity to override that weight."" Rosenberg's law firm specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes. He does not have direct knowledge from the investigation. The critical role of the loadmaster in such flights was outlined in a posting published last month on Bagram's website. ""When you are a pilot flying a C-130 Hercules over potentially hostile territory, the last thing you need to worry about is whether your cargo is secure,"" it says. ""That's why each sortie the 774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron flies includes two loadmasters."" They are responsible for checking all the systems in the rear of the aircraft and overseeing the loading of the cargo, then making sure it stays that way, it says. ""Upon takeoff, we'll be looking back at the cargo until we get off the ground, making sure none of the chains break or pop out,"" Airman 1st Class Michael Brown says in the airfield's story. ""If they do, we let the pilots know... and we taxi back."" ""There's a lot of trust that we put in our loadmasters,"" said Capt. Kenneth Pedersen, 774th EAS aircraft commander, in the same story. ""They're pretty autonomous ... making sure the cargo is secure and loaded correctly."" Other possible contributors to the crash include malfunction of the flaps on the wings, or some other flight-control system or even a massive loss of power, Rosenberg said. But Rosenberg said he considered the last possibility to be the least likely, given the redundancy built into the four-engine jet. ""It's a fantastic plane,"" he said. The video leaves no doubt that, whatever the cause, the plane wound up flying too slow to generate sufficient lift on the wings to keep the airplane aloft, he said. ""In all my years of being involved in aerospace and piloting and litigation, I have never, ever, ever seen such a dramatic crash sequence as this one,"" he said. ""It really is nauseating to look at, a monster like that falling out of the sky. That's not supposed to happen."" Rosenberg predicted that the cockpit voice recorder and digital data recorder will provide investigators with the answers to the questions they are asking. In its statement, National Air Cargo said it ""will not speculate as to the cause of the accident,"" and that it was fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.","""It really is nauseating to look at,"" pilot says of plane crash video .

"(CNN) -- Milton might be dead on ""The Walking Dead,"" but actor Dallas Roberts (who portrayed the Governor's one-time lackey) is very glad to be alive -- and finally able to talk about the show's season three finale. ""You can't imagine the pressure that's finally off,"" he said. ""I'm finally able to have all the cards on the table."" Before Sunday night, Roberts had only told three (OK, maybe four) people about how Milton would become a walker, keeping the list limited to his girlfriend, his kids, and maybe a trusted friend who lived near where they shot the show in Atlanta. ""I may have taken an authorized photo of myself as a walker, and I may have sent that to him under threat of dismemberment if he passed that along,"" Roberts said. ""But the last thing you want to do is spoil season three of 'The Walking Dead' where you turn into a zombie and kill Andrea!"" Laurie Holden shares final thoughts on her 'Walking Dead' experience . Turning into a zombie meant Roberts finally got his turn in the chair in the ""more bloody and gross"" makeup trailer reserved for walkers. All season long, Milton has been kept squeaky clean, raising serious questions such as, ""Where is he sending his dry cleaning?"" Roberts laughed. ""How is he showering three times a day? Where is he getting all his razors?"" ""From the beginning, they were like, 'No sexy dirt on him. He's always clean. He's always tucked in,'"" Roberts continued. ""I was like, 'Wow, there's something about this that's going to go somewhere.' And nope! He's just the clean guy. No sexy dirt for me. Milton never got the sexy anything, did he?"" But for the few scenes in the finale, Roberts was sexy, dirty, bloody, the whole shebang, as Milton was left in a locked room to turn and ""tear the flesh from (Andrea's) bones,"" whether he liked it or not. That scene meant he got to go through a lot of emotional turmoil, ""knowing she's going to be taken out, knowing it's over, and everything he worked for is going to die, and someone he cared for is going to die."" What's inside a walker? Cast, producer spill their guts . Milton didn't imagine that he would be ""used as a tool to take Andrea out"" as well, and if he had, ""he would have behaved differently,"" Roberts said. ""I think he thought there would be a bullet in his head, and that's it."" In the original plan for the scene, there actually was a bullet involved, but during the reshoot, it was changed to a stabbing. Either way, Milton had to collapse, he said, ""in a pool of fake viscous blood that sort of cooled and crackled for hours and hours and hours."" To make shooting that part of the finale a little easier, his co-star David Morrissey kept him in stitches beforehand with some ""gallows humor."" ""Before the door opened and he throws me to my knees, he and I were crying, laughing, at the jokes we were making,"" Roberts said. ""I can promise you that they were completely inappropriate, and that they were hilarious. After a while, it wasn't even that it was funny as much as that we needed to straighten up before that door opened. It was like laughing in church, or laughing in school."" But no matter how much fun he had on set, don't expect Milton to be back in the form of flashbacks or visions a la Lori for Rick. ""I don't think anyone wants the Governor to see Milton in a white dress on a balcony!"" Roberts laughed. (Plus Roberts just landed a regular gig on ""Unforgettable"" and remains a recurring guest star on ""The Good Wife."") Besides, assuming he was on the outs, Roberts swiped a beaker that Milton used to use. ""I wasn't going to take the clothes, for sure,"" he said. ""I mean, they were great clothes for Milton, but not for Dallas. Pleated khakis!""","Dallas Roberts portrayed the Governor's one-time lackey, Milton, on ""The Walking Dead""

"(CNN) -- U.S. luxury bridal designer Vera Wang's first store in China has gotten off to an unfashionable start. Amid cries of discrimination, the company announced Wednesday it would scrap a controversial policy of charging customers a nearly $500 fee to try on clothes. The store, which had its soft launch in Shanghai in January, has been charging customers a RMB 3000 (US $480) fee for a 90-minute appointment to try on its famous wedding gowns. The non-refundable fee would be credited toward any purchase made. Local media and netizens have decried the fee, exclusive to the Shanghai store, as discriminatory to Chinese customers. Some speculated that the fee was intended to discourage efforts to copy Wang's coveted bridal designs, which can run several thousand dollars per gown. ""In the United States, they say unmarried women want a Vera Wang gown, divorced women miss their Vera Wang gown, women remarrying are glad they can have a Vera Wang gown,"" wrote user Wumei120 on the popular Sina Weibo microblogging platform. ""Each Vera Wang wedding dress is a piece of fine art. To see such wonderful work, girls cannot help but want one."" A search for Vera Wang dresses on Taobao, a popular online marketplace, revealed prices for as low as RMB 273 (US $44) for knock-off versions. A spokeswoman at the Shanghai store would not confirm if the fee was aimed at discouraging copycat efforts, emphasizing only that it ensured a ""luxury shopping experience,"" complete with a personal shopping assistant and afternoon tea. She said the store had been instructed via e-mail on Wednesday to adhere to the brand's global standards and scrap the fee upon its grand opening, which the company has previously announced as April 29. Vera Wang's collections were previously distributed in China only through high-end boutiques and department stores. Chinese consumers currently account for approximately 27% of worldwide luxury consumption, according to a December report by management consultancy McKinsey & Co. It called China the ""paramount driver of growth"" in the luxury sector, estimating its consumers would make up 34% of global luxury spending by 2015. Alexis Lai reported and wrote from Hong Kong, and Lucrezia Seu reported from Beijing.","U.S. luxury bridal designer Vera Wang's first store in China charging US$480 to try on clothes .

"(Financial Times) -- Bollywood films are known for their upbeat finales, but the industry behind them also has plenty to celebrate. India's Hindi-language film business marks its centenary this month, while a new feature toasting the nation's cinematic heritage, Bombay Talkies, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last week. Indian filmmakers are in fine financial fettle too, as a boom in multiplex screens brings record audiences in to see their song-and-dance spectaculars, making last year the sector's most successful ever by sales. But a management revolution is brewing in a business that dates its birth to the first screening of a silent film in Bombay in May 1913, and one brought about by the arrival of some of the biggest names in the global entertainment business. US-based studios such as Disney, Viacom and Fox are attempting to win a larger share of the Indian film market, which is both the world's most productive and most popular, churning out more than 1,000 films annually and selling more than 3bn tickets last year. Money is one motivation: Indian film revenues are projected to increase by more than half to $3.6bn over the next four years, according to consultants KPMG, helping the country surpass Britain as the world's fifth-largest film market by sales. Openness to outsiders is equally as important, however, especially to international participants seeking growth across the developing world. ""Which of the large emerging film markets is as free of regulation as India? Here there are no restrictions. Anyone can come and make what they want,"" says Ronnie Screwvala, the head of Disney UTV, India's largest film producer by revenue. ""The only other potentially really large market, China, is full of limits on how many films foreign groups can make and distribute."" Disney is the most prominent of the new foreign arrivals, following its acquisition last year of UTV , a large Indian film and television group, in a deal worth $454m. Viacom may follow suit as industry observers expect the US conglomerate to buy out the remainder of its 50-50 joint venture with Network 18, an Indian media company. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is increasingly prominent, with its Fox Star Studios division building on the success of the company's larger and more established Star India cable television business. Hollywood's biggest names have nonetheless had to grapple with an unusual challenge as they attempt to crack the Indian market, says Jehil Thakkar, head of media entertainment at KPMG in Mumbai, namely the unusual reluctance of local film-goers to warm to their main product. India has proved almost uniquely resistant to imported English-language films, with foreign efforts taking only 9 per cent of the country's box office last year compared to about half of the market in China. Consequently only a few dozen English-language films are released each year, as India's public show a clear preference for films in Hindi, alongside those produced in more than a dozen other local languages. In response, the foreign participants have adopted an unusual approach: setting themselves up as domestic film studios, which attempt to beat Bollywood at its own game by producing Indian-language films, overseen with minimal interference from their parent groups in California. ""In nearly every other world market, the Hollywood studios have basically established local distribution offices to push their own American movies,"" KPMG's Mr Thakkar says. ""But India is the only place where they have been forced to go local with a vengeance."" These hybrid international businesses have proved commercially successful so far, says Vikram Malhotra, chief operating officer of Viacom18, while introducing a shake-up on the financial side of an industry that until recently was dominated by small, family-controlled production houses. Alongside two domestic studios -- the film arm of industrialist Anil Ambani's Reliance empire and Eros International, a film producer traded on Aim, London's junior stock market -- the big US studios account for the majority of funding for Indian films too. ""In a very short span of time, the financing architecture of the industry has changed completely,"" says Mr Malhotra, who estimates that roughly three-quarters of film funding in India is controlled by larger corporate groups, up from about a tenth only 10 years ago. Such companies still face challenges as they aim for future growth. Domestic ticket prices remain among the world's lowest, for instance, while India, despite the opening of new multiplex cinemas, still has far fewer screens per capita than most other big markets. This limits profitability. Even hit Bollywood films rarely earn more than Rs1bn ($18.5m), a fraction of their Hollywood equivalent. The industry is also yet to crack the global export market: its products are popular with India's sizeable diaspora, but there is little sign of a long-hoped-for ""crossover"" Bollywood hit capable of winning over a wider international audience. Nonetheless, the scale of the change brought by the arrival of international groups is clear. ""For 95 out of the 100 years of Bollywood there were no corporations at all. It was one big family business, based on handshakes and hugs, often with quite dubious sources of finance,"" says the head of one large Indian entertainment group, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Now you have professionals running the businesses, and professional sources of finance too. It has upended the entire power structure of this industry, and for the better."" © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Bollywood celebrates its centenary this month .

"(CNN) -- The third body recovered in Yosemite National Park near where three hikers were swept over a waterfall in July has been identified as missing 21-year-old Ramina Badal, park officials said Tuesday. The bodies of the other two hikers had previously been identified. In July, witnesses said the three -- two men and a woman -- climbed over the guardrail at the top of a trail and went into the gushing river that feeds the waterfall, known as Vernal Fall. They were quickly swept over. Park officials had said previously that a body found by a park ranger on November 29 was determined to be that of Ninos Yacoub, 27, of Turlock, California. His body was found in the Merced River about half a mile below the base of the waterfall. Hidden dangers in Yosemite . Yacoub was with Hormiz David, 22, of Modesto, California, and Badal, of Manteca, California, when the three disappeared. David's body was recovered in August about 240 feet from the base of the waterfall. Badal's body was found Saturday in the same general location where Yacoub's body was discovered, park officials said.","Ramina Badal, 21, was one of three hikers swept over a waterfall in July .

"London (CNN) -- The relationship between rock stars and royalty has not always been a cosy one. Back in 1977, The Sex Pistols stuck a grubby finger up to the silver jubilee with a raucous barge party on The Thames. In 2012, a day after a flotilla of 1,000 boats took to the same stretch of water, it seems that peace has been made. The diamond jubilee was marked with an entertainment extravaganza on a stage built around the Queen Victoria Memorial outside London's iconic Buckingham Palace. Smoothing the marriage of music and monarchy was Take That's Gary Barlow, who curated a star-studded line-up designed to represent the best of Queen Elizabeth II's 60-year reign. Barlow's friend and sometime bandmate Robbie Williams opened the show, performing his boisterous ""Let Me Entertain You"" with the trumpets and drummers of the Royal Scots Guards. In the crowd, Queen guitarist Brian May nodded approval: he's qualified to do so, having opened 2002's ""Party at the Palace"" playing the national anthem on the roof. But the real VIPs were in the royal box, where Prime Minister David Cameron stood with Prince Charles, The Duchess Of Cambridge, Princes William and Harry, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and numerous other Windsors. Prince Philip, the queen's husband, was absent, having been admitted to hospital with a bladder infection. Britain's Prince Philip hospitalized . The evening opener seemed geared more to the tastes of younger royals. Will.I.Am sang ""I Gotta Feeling"" with octave-hopping pop singer Jessie J, X-Factor alumni JLS produced a medley of hits, while Barlow performed a duet with a painfully out of tune Cheryl Cole. Before long, the old guard showed the whippersnappers how it's done. Enter Cliff Richard, a man with hits in every decade of Elizabeth's reign and a mega-mix to prove it. A closing ""Congratulations"" was as kitsch as his powder pink suit, but The Duchess Of Cambridge waved her Union Jack approvingly. Monday was not all about pop though. Classical pianist Lang Lang thumped out ""Rhapsody In Blue,"" before tenor Alfie Boe segued ""O Sole Mio"" into ""It's Now Or Never,"" jiving on the spot for the latter in a matter unbecoming of most opera singers. However, the curveball of the evening was yet to come: enter the brilliant Grace Jones, who took to the stage dressed like a sci-fi villainess, and spun a hula hoop for the duration of her sensual anthem ""Slave To The Rhythm."" ""Happy Birthday, our queen,"" she concluded, missing the entire point of the occasion. Meanwhile, young crooner Ed Sheeran looked positively pedestrian in comparison, though with his shaggy red hair the people far off in the cheap seats must have wondered why Prince Harry popped up on stage with an acoustic guitar. At 9 p.m. local time, the crowd stood for the queen. Her majesty's arrival was marked by the live debut of The Commonwealth Band's ""Sing,"" a track written especially for the jubilee by Gary Barlow and Andrew Lloyd Webber. ""Hear a thousand voices shouting loud,"" the syrupy lyrics commanded. As darkness fell, the procession of stars continued -- Shirley Bassey performed the aptly titled ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" while Kylie Minogue, dressed as a Pearly Queen, and Elton John whipped the crowd into a frenzy with a storming version of ""Crocodile Rock."" By the time Stevie Wonder appeared, the stage was beginning to resemble a Who's Who of pop music. The American legend sang ""Isn't She Lovely"" with lyrics re-worked for the occasion: ""Isn't she special, a young 86-years old,"" he crooned. He also played ""Happy Birthday,"" perhaps having conferred with Jones. Our attention was then drawn to the roof of the palace, where 80s British band Madness sang ""Our House"" as a light projection transformed the imposing royal residence into a row of typical British terraced houses. Then it was back to the stage, where former Beatle Paul McCartney concluded the show. McCartney has provided the finale for so many star-studded galas that the image of him performing ""Ob La Di, Ob La Da"" as Elton, Shirley Bassey and Cliff Richard clapped along en masse brought on a strange feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu. But, as ever, his humble, unifying charm made for a warm ending. Before the majestic fireworks display and the heart-thumping national anthem, Barlow led the Queen, the Duchess Of Cornwall and Prince Charles on stage. ""Your Majesty, Mummy,"" began Prince Charles, as he delivered a touching speech with the right mix of levity and respect. The audience was treated to three hours of big names and big tunes, but -- acerbic comedians and Grace Jones aside -- the Diamond Jubilee Concert was a safe bet. Cynics might argue that a more accurate view of modern Britain could come from the likes of Plan B, whose ""Ill Manors"" single sticks the knife into Cameron's Britain, but a gig at Buckingham Palace was never going to be the place for punk sentiment.","Three-hour concert outside London's Buckingham Palace for the diamond jubilee .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Pro-democracy demonstrators battled Egyptian police for a third straight day Sunday, their anger stoked by images of a military police officer stomping on a woman's exposed stomach over the weekend. The latest round of street clashes has left at least 10 people dead and 500 wounded since Friday, said Dr. Hisham Sheeha, a spokesman for Egypt's health ministry. An 11th person, a boy arrested Saturday, died in police custody from his wounds, the boy's attorney, Ragia Omran, said Sunday. Cairo's stock exchange plunged amid the new turmoil, while Saturday's images of the woman's beating appeared to draw more people to the streets. ""I will go down and fight the army and retrieve the honor of this woman and those martyrs killed for the sake of Egypt's future,"" taxi driver Ahmed Fahmy told CNN. The woman and a male companion were set upon by more than 20 police officers during Saturday's demonstrations in Cairo. She been dressed in a traditional robe and headscarf -- but as police clubbed her and dragged her down the street, those items were pulled away, exposing her midriff and blue brassiere in a country known for its Islamic conservatism. Then one of the police officers aimed a foot at her upper abdomen and stamped squarely on it, while another officer jumped on the man as he lay on the pavement nearby. ""The army were like vultures who found a prey,"" said Mohamed Zeidan, who filmed the beating from a balcony overlooking Tahrir Square. He said after he stopped filming the beating out of fear of being discovered, ""The soldiers even beat an older couple who tried to help her up."" A CNN crew that managed to escape Saturday's chaos witnessed other beatings, with children, the elderly and people on their way to work finding themselves on the end of police truncheons. Images of the woman's treatment were splashed across the front pages of Egyptian newspapers on Sunday and zipped around the world on social media networks. But a spokesman for the military, which has ruled Egypt since February's ouster of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, had no apologies. ""What was woman like her doing in a conflict zone?"" asked the spokesman, Maj. Mohamed Askar. ""She must have participated in the attacks on the military and the Cabinet."" Askar questioned why the woman has not come forward to identify herself. ""Our troops do not just attack people for no reason,"" he said. ""If she had nothing to hide then she would have presented herself. Where is she?"" Two people who know her, including the man seen being beaten alongside her in the video, told CNN the woman is a political activist and student. She does not want to speak to reporters now, but a journalist who saw the incident and was beaten as well said the woman suffered ""serious bruises and cuts"" as a result. ""I started to run, but she froze and fell to the ground when another protester bumped into her,"" said Hassan Mahmoud, the journalist. ""I tried to help her get up, but the soldiers were brutal even when I told them I was a journalist. They even continued to beat her after her body was exposed."" Some Egyptians questioned the authenticity of the video. Cairo businessman Shehab Ali said there was ""something fishy"" about it to him. ""The army officer is wearing a pair of sneakers, which is not standard military attire considering they are all in full gear and wearing flak jackets,"" he said. ""And how come the woman is not wearing a t-shirt or anything else under the traditional Arabic robe, although it's freezing cold and winter now?"" But cabdriver Fahmy said the images brought tears to his eyes. ""I grew up admiring our army and chanted, 'The army and the people, one hand,' "" he said. ""This seems like the enemy."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the reports of violence on Sunday and said her thoughts are with the families of those killed or injured. ""I urge Egyptian security forces to respect and protect the universal rights of all Egyptians, including the rights to peaceful free expression and assembly ... Those who are protesting should do so peacefully and refrain from acts of violence,"" she said in a statement. Tahrir Square has been the epicenter of anti-government demonstrations since last January, when the revolt against Mubarak began. Fresh protests sprouted in November, when the generals named Mubarak-era premier Kamal Ganzouri as a caretaker prime minister until parliamentary elections are complete. Hundreds of police and troops swept through the plaza on Saturday, barricading nearby streets, chasing off protesters and setting tents on fire. Authorities arrested 14 people Friday and 150 on Saturday, nine of them women, said Adel Saeed, the spokesman for the general prosecutor's office. ""They have been accused of inciting violence, resisting arrest, throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks at security forces, burning public property,"" Saeed said. Sunday, demonstrators hurled more rocks and Molotov cocktails and police and soldiers, injuring 58 of them, Interior Ministry spokesman Gen. Marwan Mustapha said. Protesters captured an army officer in uniform and beat him before debating whether to swap him for a demonstrator who has been captured by the military. Several newly elected lawmakers and religious leaders from Cairo's al-Azhar University tried to negotiate a truce between protesters and security forces, but failed and were asked to leave. The Egyptian stock market went into a nosedive amid the latest violence, losing 6 billion Egyptian pounds (about $1 billion) at its opening Sunday and finishing down nearly 3.5%. Ganzouri criticized the unrest as an ""attack on revolution"" Saturday and condemned protesters for throwing stones and damaging public property. He also denied that security forces were using live ammunition against demonstrators. In addition, 213-year-old Egyptian maps and other artifacts were destroyed after a library in Cairo was set ablaze during Saturday's clashes, officials said. The original manuscript of the ""description of Egypt"" and ""irreplaceable maps and historical manuscripts preserved by many generations since the building of the Scientific Center in August 1798 during the French Campaign"" were destroyed in the fire, Ganzouri said in a statement.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""It's the queen's diamond jubilee soon!"" I recently babbled excitedly to some of my American friends. ""Let's have a party like we did for the royal wedding -- I'll provide Union Jack hats and streamers, jugs of Pimm's and a gargantuan amount of chocolate Hobnobs!"" There was barely a murmur in response. Just one year previously, they'd been a stampede of Yanks at 5am on my doorstep, desperate to get prime position in front of the television as Kate walked up the aisle. ""You know, the queen?"" I battle on in my local Los Angeles coffee shop. ""Helen Mirren played her, remember? She was Colin Firth's daughter? She's the great-great-granddaughter of Judi Dench, when Judi was into Scotsmen and horses?"" None of my film tidbits cause a swirl of interest, despite my Hollywood crowd. In Tinseltown years, Queen Elizabeth II is about 405 -- roughly the same as Dumbledore, they imagine -- and far too old to get excited about. ""Will the princes be there?"" one Californian chum finally responds. ""Of course! She's their grandma!"" I reply indignantly. ""Well, in that case,"" she nods, ""I'm sure we'll all be there. Any glimpse of those boys is worth getting up early and facing traffic for."" I must admit, after living as a Brit in America for seven years, I have found we share surprisingly few traits or interests. We Brits love Take That; Americans have never heard of them. We crave a simple hot cup of tea with a splash of milk while they insist on adding ice cubes and a slice of lemon. We're scared of guns, they're scared of boobs. But one place where our old and new world tastes collide is with Prince Harry. ""Don't you just love him?"" I hear as much as ""I love your accent!"" Watching my adopted homeland fall under the spell of the young royals has encouraged me to dismiss any cynicism I might have toward them (paying for a round of shots at Boujis, are we? A skiing trip -- how lovely, I wish I could afford to get piste!) and embrace the great international marketing campaign they are doing for the UK right now. I admit feeling a smug superiority watching Jennifer Lopez fawn over Kate and William on their trip to my city last year. Our future monarch and his Mrs. have the X factor -- without the help of publicists, agents or Botox. Our history makes them dazzling, our traditions make them awe-inspiring. And combining that -- at last! -- with great bone structure, a sense of humor and the slightly-common touch (thanks to Diana's legacy and high street fashion). The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the duke's naughty little brother are a triumvirate of British charm, to be exported all over the world as a symbol of our greatness, much like Downton Abbey. I love that Kate wears the same outfit time after time and does her own supermarket shopping; I like that Wills enjoys a Sunday roast round ""Mike and Carol's,"" (his in-laws) adore Harry's incessant need to take the mickey out of his brother, be it wearing a mask of his face on a fun run or asking him embarrassing questions in front of journalists. As much as I think the queen has done a brilliant job, and I look forward to celebrating her jubilee with glee, we have the kids to thank for the detoxification of this once staid, fusty old brand. And I'm sure no one would agree more than Her Majesty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sarah Ivens.","Sarah Ivens is a British journalist living in America .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Users of Sina Weibo, China's popular Twitter-like micro-blogging service, now have to abide by new rules aimed at preventing online rumors and other controversial posts. The ""user contracts"" that took effect on Monday come as authorities put increased pressure on China's social networks to police what their users are saying. Sina has also rolled out a points system as a way to manage users who post content that contravenes the new rules, according to documents posted on Sina Weibo's website. Under the system, each Weibo account will begin with a score of 80 and points will be deducted for any perceived misconduct. Accounts that drop to zero will be canceled. Weibo and rival platforms like Tencent's QQ have become hugely popular in China, with many Chinese regarding them as an important source of news and other information. Weibo is estimated to have 300 million users. The contract seeks to prevent posts that ""spread rumors, disrupt social order, or destroy social stability."" Other banned content includes revealing national secrets, threatening the honor of the nation, or promoting illicit behavior such as gambling. 'China's Twitter' introduces contracts to curb rumors . The new rules also seek to stop the use of code words or other expressions often employed by Chinese web users to refer to controversial people or events. For example, the disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai was often referred to as BXL. Doug Young, a Chinese media expert from Fudan University in Shanghai, said the steps are intended to ease Beijing's concerns about the spreading of false rumors. ""I think Sina are trying to be proactive and clean up the site and show the government they are taking steps to stop people from spreading false information or other posts that create trouble,"" he said. In April, China's Internet regulator temporarily suspended the comments sections of Weibo and Tencent's QQ as a punishment for allowing rumors to spread. Authorities also closed 16 websites and detained six people for allegedly spreading rumors of ""military vehicles entering Beijing"" shortly after the arrest of Bo when China's Internet was rife with talk of an alleged coup.","Users of China's popular Sina Weibo service have to abide by new rules aimed at preventing online rumors .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- The UAE recalled its ambassador to Iran on Thursday in protest of a visit by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to a disputed island. Abu Mousa is one of three Persian Gulf islands that are the subject of a longtime border dispute between the two countries. The UAE's Foreign Ministry said it was summoning Tehran envoy Saif Mohammed Obaid Al Zaabi for consultations. The move comes a day after Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed condemned Ahmadinejad's visit to Abu Mousa ""in the strongest possible terms,"" according to a report by state news agency WAM. The UAE says Iran has illegally occupied Abu Mousa since 1971. The two other disputed islands are the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. The foreign minister described the visit as a ""flagrant violation'' of UAE sovereignty and said it was a setback to efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the issue, WAM reported. Ahmadinejad used his visit to Abu Mousa to comment on the historical basis for the Persian Gulf's name, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg, is a densely populated melting pot with some of South Africa's worst social ills: poverty, unemployment, HIV/AIDS and crime. Andile Gaelesiwe was raped twice before she was 20 and is  now trying to change the culture in South Africa. One of the most common crimes in Alexandra Township --- and throughout the country --- is rape. A recent survey by the Medical Research Council of South Africa, a statutory government funded body, found that one in four South African men has raped at least one woman in their lifetimes. And that nearly half have raped more than one woman. We talked with some Alexandra Township men who openly admitted they have raped and speaking to them it became clear that at the time they committed the crime they did not see it as wrong. They have grown up watching male members of their community treat women with contempt, they told us. Beating women, raping them and treating them like second class citizens -- that is what they have grown up believing was the right way to treat females. One of the men -- whom CNN agreed not to name -- told us that he and three friends gang-raped a girl they met a party.  Watch the men describe their attacks » . ""With me it was not a problem,"" he said, ""but when I went to the bathroom having to find the third guy busy with her it was like I had a problem because she was crying, she was not happy."" His friend added: ""I would tell myself that there is nothing I want in life that I can't get, even a beautiful woman because when you try your luck with them, their response makes you feel like you are nothing. That's why we decide to do things like this, having sex with them forcefully."" The men we talked to have all spent time in jail but have never been convicted of rape. Zwelithini Sono, a former defense lawyer who now helps rape victims, says he has never lost a rape case. ""Police inefficiency, criminal justice backlogs, ill prepared prosecutors who in some instances are really not sensitive about the cases and the kind of trauma that the victims are normally exposed to, and the time that it takes between arrest and the prosecution or even finalization of these cases is really too much for some of the victims to even be able to stay in the system and ensure that they finally get the justice,"" said Sono. He says he reached his breaking point in 2005 after securing yet another acquittal for a rape suspect -- who then admitted to a friend that he committed the crime. Sono now provides legal assistance for rape victims and counsels young men about the seriousness of violence against women. He says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young men in South Africa  have been socialized. It institutionalized violence, broke up homes and left boys without good role models to teach them right from wrong, he said. ""There has not been enough conversations with men to try to sensitize them on the violence of rape, how sensitive women are and the kind of love that we can actually share."" Andile Gaelesiwe is a rape victim who is also trying to change the culture by encouraging women to speak out. She was raped by her father at the age of 11 and again by a taxi driver in her late teens. She says the stigma and shame of rape is what forces most women including herself to keep it a secret. She said: ""It's usually somebody that you know -- an uncle, a neighbor -- and therefore families would rather say, 'What are people going to say if we turn around and say Uncle-so-and-so did it? Let's rather we shut up about it.' ""Other families, especially in the rural areas, will go as far as saying the accused's family or the actual accused pays some kind of damage to this family as if to say that this girl who has been raped will now be healed because the two families have had an understanding."" She publicly revealed her experience in 2003 when a caller to the radio station where she worked threatened to kill herself after being raped. Attitudes may take years to transform but both Sono and Gaelesiwe are among South Africans trying to turn the tide of abuse. ""There can be a change of mind-set. If we put processes together, there will be a battle that we are going to win, and that is to provide our women and children with the best support, with love that they wish for each and every day,"" Sono said. The South African government's efforts to deal with the scourge have been criticized as uncoordinated and unsustainable. They include establishing courts sensitive to sexual violence. It is a battle government alone will not be able to win and hence the importance of involvement by people like Sono. The young rapists we met have attended Sono's session and they tell us they do not see themselves violating women ever again. ""One thing that especially us black people need is studies about humanity,"" one of them said, ""so that I can see my sister as my sister and let not that thought come into my mind."" They now believe that part of the answer lies in women being strong enough to face their accusers in court. But in South Africa this takes courage and is even harder when a victim does not have support from her family or community. According to the latest police statistics 36,190 women were raped between April and December 2007 -- more than 130 rapes a day. But these were the reported cases. Human rights activists believe the majority of rapes in South Africa go unreported.","Rape victim and defense lawyer battle attitudes towards women in South Africa .

"Washington (CNN) -- A war of words continued Tuesday over the possible contempt of Congress vote against Attorney General Eric Holder later this week, with the White House citing past examples of presidents claiming executive privilege in similar disputes over documents. The White House response followed a letter Monday night from House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, that slammed President Barack Obama's assertion of executive privilege in the panel's probe of the botched Fast and Furious gun running sting. With the House scheduled to vote Thursday on the contempt measure against Holder, the White House fired back against Issa with a list of past cases in which presidents asserted executive privilege for the same kinds of documents sought by Issa's committee. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that House Republicans have made the dispute a political issue, while another spokesman, Eric Schultz, ridiculed Issa's analysis of the executive privilege claim by Obama. Issa's panel has been seeking documents that show why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that said top officials had only recently learned about the Fast and Furious operation. However, Holder has refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama to assert executive privilege over such documents last week. In his letter Monday, Issa said Obama's assertion of executive privilege means that he and his most senior advisers were involved in ""managing"" Fast and Furious and the ""fallout from it"" or that the president asserted a power he knows is unjustified ""for the purpose of further obstructing a congressional investigation."" ""To date, the White House has steadfastly maintained that it has not had any role in advising the (Justice) Department with respect to the congressional investigation. The surprising assertion of executive privilege raised the question of whether that is still the case,"" Issa said in his letter. Schultz responded that Issa's account ""has as much merit as his absurd contention that Operation Fast and Furious was created in order to promote gun control."" ""Our position is consistent with executive branch legal precedent for the past three decades spanning administrations of both parties, and dating back to President Reagan's Department of Justice,"" Schultz said. ""The courts have routinely considered deliberative process privilege claims and affirmed the right of the executive branch to invoke the privilege even when White House documents are not involved."" A supporting document provided by Schultz listed five such cases, including an October 1981 assertion by Reagan involving documents describing internal deliberations inside the Department of the Interior and another by Reagan a year later involving internal Environmental Protection Agency files. Republicans on Issa's committee approved the contempt measure against Holder for refusing to hand over all of the requested documents in the panel's investigation of the operation run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The vote last week came after Obama asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the panel. The White House move means the Department of Justice can withhold some of the documents. Opinion: Don't be nosy about Fast and Furious . The ATF launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. If the House passes the contempt measure Thursday, it would be the first time in history a sitting U.S. attorney general was cited for contempt of Congress. ""I urge you to reconsider the decision to withhold documents that would allow Congress to complete its investigation,"" Issa said in his letter. ""I remain hopeful that the Attorney General will produce the specified documents so that we can work towards resolving this matter short of a contempt citation."" By the numbers: Fast and Furious . The showdown between Issa and Holder over the Fast and Furious program dates back to subpoenas issued by the House committee last year. Issa and Republicans contend that Holder and the Justice Department are concealing details of how Operation Fast and Furious was approved and managed. Democrats argue that Issa and his GOP colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and, by extension, the president in an election year. A video released Tuesday by Democrats on Issa's panel showed the chairman making past allegations of White House links to Fast and Furious, juxtaposed with Issa saying Sunday there was no evidence of a White House cover-up. ""Get the facts. Read the report,"" the video says in conclusion. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, alleged last week that Republicans were targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. Issa, however, said in his letter that the assertion of executive privilege ""raises more questions than it answers."" The letter provided details of a June 19 meeting between Issa and Holder on the eve of the committee's partisan vote on the contempt measure. Issa said Holder wanted to ""buy peace"" on the matter. ""He indicated a willingness to produce the 'fair compilation' of post-February 4th documents. He told me that he would provide the 'fair compilation' of documents on three conditions: (1) that I permanently cancel the contempt vote; (2) that I agree the department was in full compliance with the committee's subpoenas, and; (3) that I accept the 'fair compilation,' sight unseen,"" Issa said in the letter, calling Holder's conditions ""unacceptable."" ""The attorney general's conditional offer of a 'fair compilation' of a subset of documents covered by the subpoena, and your assertion of executive privilege, in no way substitute for the fact that the Justice Department is still grossly deficient in its compliance with the committee's subpoena,"" Issa's letter said. ""By the department's own admission, it has withheld more than 130,000 pages of responsive documents."" Issa also stressed the importance of forging a settlement rather than pursuing contempt of Congress proceedings, and asked the White House for answers to questions about the executive privilege assertion. ""To what extent were you or your most senior advisers involved in Operation Fast and Furious and the fallout from it, including the false February 4, 2011 letter provided by the attorney general to the committee?"" Issa's letter said. ""Please also identify any communications, meetings, and teleconferences between the White House and the Justice Department between February 4, 2011 and June 18, 2012, the day before the Attorney General requested that you assert executive privilege.""

"(CNN) -- The Chinese Super League has seen its global profile skyrocket over the last 12 months with the arrival of several high-profile football stars in big-money deals. The trend continued on Thursday with the announcement that Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi will take over the reigns at ambitious Guangzhou Evergrande on a two-and-a-half-year contract. ""I dispatched an assistant to go see the club's matches, which made me even more determined,"" the 64-year-old told a press conference which was broadcast live on Chinese state television. ""I am very enthusiastic about coming to China."" Lippi has an impressive managerial record, having coached Juventus to five Italian Serie A titles and the European Champions League in 1996. Guangzhou, China's reigning champions, started the spending spree last year by signing Argentine playmaker Dario Conca from Brazilian side Fluminense for a national record transfer fee. Conca has since been joined in China by former France striker Nicolas Anelka, who, after a prolific career across Europe, swapped Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in January. Paraguay's Lucas Barrios will become the latest recruit when he signs for Guangzhou from German champions Borussia Dortmund on June 1, for a fee which eclipses the one paid for Conca. So what is attracting such stellar names to a country which has a limited football heritage? ""There are things happening in Chinese football but there is still a long way to go,"" Asian football expert John Duerden told CNN. ""I can't imagine that Lippi has been always been desperate to work in the Chinese Super League, though China is a fascinating place and some of the cities are fantastic."" Previous coach Lee-Jang soo had achieved on-field success with Guangzhou, leading the club out of the second tier, to the 2011 Super League title and into the Asian Champions League. But Duerden said Lee's profile was not big enough for a club with grand ambitions. ""It's all about the name,"" he said. ""While Lee is well-liked in China and east Asia, outside the region he has little standing. Hiring Lippi sends the message that Guangzhou want to be Asia's first superclub."" Duerden said the surge in football spending in China has been financed by powerful political figures, but that it may be detrimental to the future of the sport in the country. ""The spark is all down to politics, power and connections. The next generation of China's leaders, including the next president are fans of football, and it is a great way for business leaders to get close to the decision-makers. ""There is a huge disconnect between what the game actually needs and what it is getting. There are less than 10,000 registered under-12 players in China (Japan, with a tenth of the population has over 300,000) and you have to wonder what a similar amount of money would do if invested in the grassroots."" Since arriving in Shanghai, Anelka has seen his role at Shenhua change. Last month, the 33-year-old was added to former Fulham manager Jean Tigana's coaching staff. Tigana then resigned from his position, paving the way for Anelka to assume a surprise player-coach role. ""The situation is fairly chaotic at Shanghai and the team is pretty mediocre,"" said Duerden. ""Big money was spent on new strikers but what the team really needs is midfielders. ""He (Anelka) does seem committed and is starting to talk to the press a little more. He also has the respect of the players, for obvious reasons, and he seems to be taking the coaching role quite seriously."" Meanwhile, Manchester United announced on Thursday that striker Michael Owen has left the English club following the expiration of his contract. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid star has been ravaged by injury during his three years at Old Trafford, scoring just five goals in 31 Premier League appearances.","Italy's World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi is the new coach of Guangzhou Evergrande .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday night, two teenagers called authorities pleading for help after their hike through the Santa Ana Mountains of southern California went awry. Then their cell phones went dead -- meaning that not only were they lost, but so, too, was their link to potential saviors. Their story took a positive turn Wednesday night, when rescuers came across 19-year-old Nicholas Cendoya. But there was no sign of his hiking mate, 18-year-old Kyndall Jack. Until now. Video shot Thursday from helicopters showed Jack perched precariously on a steep area full of dense brush. A rescuer was by her side, and she was hoisted up to an awaiting helicopter and transported to a local hospital. ""She is alive,"" Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Jason Park said. Park didn't offer much more than that as he addressed reporters Thursday. He said the teenage girl was ""responsive, ... she appears to be dehydrated, she's weak."" But the fact she survived four days in the wilderness was cause for celebration. Park described her family as ""extremely happy"" upon hearing about her rescue. There was similar elation among the search-and-rescue team, which included dozens of volunteer sheriff deputies who surveyed the dangerous terrain looking for signs of life. ""Regardless of how hard they worked or how how tired or how hungry they are, it's a tremendous victory for them,"" Park said. The ordeal began on Easter, when the two teens set off on trails in part of the Cleveland National Forest located in an unincorporated part of south Orange County. The pair called the sheriff's department that night, and deputies responded, believing the hikers were about a mile from their vehicle. ""But their cell phone battery died, and contact was lost,"" the department said in a news release. That set off a frenetic search through an area marked by dense brush and steep terrain. A big break came Wednesday night, when Cendoya was discovered, but his hiking mate was nowhere in sight. ""He believed they had been separated possibly since Sunday night and has no recall how they got separated,"" searcher Michael Boyle told reporters. Cendoya is being treated at Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, where Dr. Mike Ritter said he is ""awake and talking."" ""Nick wanted me to convey to all of you ... how grateful he is for all the help,"" Ritter told reporters. As to Jack, Mike Leum with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said he heard her before he saw her Thursday. ""So I was screaming, yelling across the canyon, 'Can you see me?'"" Leum recalled. ""'Yes I see you,' (she responded), and I could not see her yet, because she was on top of a rock behind a bush."" Leum said he asked Jack to wave the one arm she could, at which point he finally spotted her. By then, a helicopter was on its way -- from which a paramedic at one point descended to check on Jack, and into which she ascended on her way eventually to a nearby hospital. ""She was in a lot of pain, obviously completely dehydrated, and very weak and going in and out of consciousness,"" said Jim Moss, also with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. ""We just told her not to move because she was in a pretty precarious place."" During Jack's rescue, an Orange County volunteer deputy sheriff ""sustained head trauma"" after falling 60 feet, the sheriff's department lieutenant said. The volunteer was in serious but not life-threatening condition at Mission Hospital -- ""able to move his arms and his legs ... and he is alert,"" said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Erin Giudice. Orange County Fire Authority Capt. John Muir said one lesson from the ordeal -- even with the happy ending -- is that hikers should plan first and plan for the worst. ""If you're going to go hiking, we want you to be safe, we want you to prepare,"" he said.","NEW: Rescuer says Kyndall Jack, 18, yelled out to him before he finally spotted her .

"(CNN)  -- Opponents of health care reform have reached the brink of intellectual bankruptcy. With no original ideas or solutions, they've now resorted to bringing out a tried-and-tested bogeymen in a last-ditch attempt to derail much-needed legislation. Of course, I'm talking about trial lawyers. Somehow, the fringes of the GOP have made health care about trial lawyers and medical malpractice. Instead of focusing on how to fix our broken health care system, opponents of real reform would rather limit the legal rights of injured patients. Talk about misguided priorities. Medical negligence affects real people. The Institute of Medicine found, 10 years ago, that up to 98,000 people die every year from preventable medical errors, and countless more are severely injured. This is like two 737s crashing every day for an entire year. If air travel were this unsafe, would we blame the passengers or the airlines? But instead of working to create a better, safer health care system, some have decided that casting injured patients aside is an easier route to go. Last time I checked, this bill is supposed to be about health care, not bargaining away people's rights. Tort law changes are not a new or novel idea. Forty-six states have passed some kind of tort reform -- our research finds about 36 of them have some sort of cap on damages  -- yet costs have continued to skyrocket. Instead of saving money for consumers, tort reform has served as a sop to the insurance industry, allowing them to make record profits off the backs of doctors and patients. On average, doctors' premiums are actually higher in states that cap the amount of damages patients or families can receive, compared with states without such caps, according to the Medical Liability Monitor. Just look at Texas and California, frequently mentioned as ""models"" for tort reform despite having the most Draconian anti-patient laws in the nation. Both states impose caps on damages, a cruel and unjust way to value one's life. A patient who has been disfigured, blinded, or lost a limb is worth almost nothing under their respective state laws. The same applies to children, the elderly, and homemakers -- because they don't have any ""lost wages,"" the cost of bringing a case is almost equal to the maximum amount they can recover, putting justice out of reach. And how is health care in Texas and California today? They both lead the nation in the number of uninsured, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and have the most expensive health care markets, . It hasn't lowered costs or covered the uninsured, but prevented people injured through no fault of their own from seeking justice. Hardly a ""model"" the rest of the nation should follow. The health care bill passed by the House (Section 2531) provides states with incentive payments for instituting certain malpractice pilot projects; caps on damages or attorney's fees do not apply, as they have clearly been miserable failures for patients in California, Texas, and elsewhere. But that won't stop health care reform opponents in the Senate from proposing similar ways to limit patients' legal rights, even though it's been shown time and again to not lower costs, cover the uninsured, or improve patient safety. Lawmakers should ask families devastated by medical negligence what they think about so-called ""tort reform."" Blake Fought, 19, had just recovered from an illness and was ready to go home when a nurse improperly removed his central line IV. Because of the improper procedure, bubbles of air entered Blake's brain, heart and blood vessels. In front of the nurses and his own parents, who were there to take their son home, Blake asphyxiated and died. Or ask the Gourley family, whose son Colin has cerebral palsy from negligence that happened during his birth. He could not speak until he was 5, and has been through numerous surgeries because of orthopedic issues. After a jury determined that Colin was a victim of medical negligence, caps in that state cut his verdict to a quarter of what he will need. Colin will be forced to rely on state assistance for the rest of his life. What's surprising to many is that there are hardly any medical negligence suits in the first place -- less than 1 percent of the whole civil docket. While up to 98,000 people die every year from medical errors, and countless more are injured, only one in eight ever files suit. A 2006 Harvard study found that 97 percent of claims were meritorious, debunking the idea there's an influx of ""frivolous"" suits. It's perplexing why this one issue -- making up only half a percent of all health care costs --  serves as red meat for such rabid health care reform opponents. But when one doesn't have substantive, constructive solutions to fixing health care, it's easier to create straw men and cast aspersions. If you want to put the trial bar out of business, start with decreasing the number of unnecessary deaths and injuries from preventable medical errors. Not only will that lower costs and lead to healthier patients, but also mean fewer people seeking legal recourse. Instead of limiting the rights of injured patients, institute safeguards to ensure their health and well-being in the first place. Next time you hear a baseless attack on trial attorneys or calls for ""tort reform,"" remember what health care is all about: patients. And restricting patients' legal rights won't make anyone safer or healthier, nor will it lower costs or cover the uninsured. It's just another desperate distraction in a debate that has seen its fair share of off-the-wall rhetoric and political theater. With all the deaths each year from preventable medical errors, this is not a topic that warrants foolishness and nonsense. There is simply too much as stake. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Tarricone.","Tarricone: Health bill foes using scare tactic of tort reform to stop needed change .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The death of a 12-year-old student in Brooklyn from the staph infection MRSA has prompted fear among parents and students throughout the New York City school system, forcing officials to respond. Omar Rivera, 12, a New York seventh-grader, died of drug-resistant staph on October 14. Omar Rivera, a seventh-grader at Intermediate School 211, died October 14 from the infection, according to the New York City school superintendent, but investigators were unable to confirm where he contracted the infection. MRSA is short for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and is responsible for more deaths in the United States each year than AIDS, according to new data. ""There's often no way to know how an individual person got the infection,"" said New York City Health Commissioner Tom Frieden. ""An infection in a child like this is extremely rare. Fatal infections in children is in the order of 1 in a million. It's a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the family."" The Office of School Health sent letters to parents Thursday, notifying them of Rivera's death. Despite assurances from health officials that Rivera's death was an isolated incident, several parents decided to keep their children out of IS 211, which opened at its normal time Friday after the disclosure of Rivera's death Thursday, as it has every day since the death. Watch more on the student's death » . The Heath Department said in its statement, ""We have no reason to believe that other children or school employees are at increased risk of staph infection."" But department officials advised in a press conference Friday that people should limit skin-to-skin contact, wash their hands regularly and not share items such as towels and razors. Nearly nine out of every 10 resistant staph infections are hospital or health-care related, Frieden said. ""Hospitals are taking it seriously and need to continue to improve the way they prevent and treat staph infections,"" he said. According to the CDC, 25 to 30 percent of the population carry the staph bacteria -- one of the most common causes of infection. While such infections are typically minor, invasive MRSA infections, because they are caused by drug-resistant staph, can become fatal. Dr. Julie Gerberding, the director of the CDC, says these infections are not new. ""It's important to appreciate that many of these infections are the same infections moms have been dealing with for decades. They're very preventable,"" she says. ""If you see a skin infection that looks like the redness is getting bigger or if it's associated with a lot of swelling around the wound or if the individual has a fever, those are reasons to definitely seek doctor's attention. But most of the time these are things that can be treated with the same kind of common sense approach that is we've been using for years."" Pat Mshar, an epidemiologist for Connecticut's Department of Health, emphasized that the highest rate of MRSA deaths -- 58 percent -- is found in hospitals. ""The healthy person in the community -- like the high school student -- generally is going to be able to be treated adequately without adverse outcome,"" she said. So long as an infected student seeks treatment, covers open cuts or lesions and avoids direct skin contact with other students, ""it's OK to go to school."" She noted that recent reports of MRSA numbers and the student deaths has heightened concern. ""Parents are more aware of MRSA now than they ever were before,"" she said.

"London (CNN) -- A frozen food producer caught up in a scandal over horsemeat found in beef products in the United Kingdom, Sweden and France said Saturday it will sue the Romanian producer it blames for the problem. The French arm of Swedish frozen food firm Findus said it would file a legal complaint Monday against the unnamed Romanian business. Findus said it had been told that its products were being made with French beef, not Romanian horsemeat. ""We were deceived,"" said a Findus France statement. ""There are two victims in this affair: Findus and the consumer."" Also, the British arm of Findus said Saturday said it was considering legal action against suppliers, adding that early results of its internal investigation ""strongly suggests"" the horsemeat contamination of a beef lasagna product ""was not accidental."" Meanwhile, an emergency meeting was held in London Saturday, as ministers, food inspectors and retailers grappled with a scandal that appears to be spreading across Europe. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said it was ""completely unacceptable"" that consumers were being sold food that contained horse in place of beef. Horsemeat found in hamburgers in Britain and Ireland . The evidence so far suggests ""either criminal activity or gross negligence,"" he said. Paterson warned that ""more bad news"" could come. UK food businesses have been ordered to test all processed beef products for ""authenticity"" and report back to the authorities by Friday. ""I am determined that we get to the bottom of this and that any wrongdoing discovered is punished,"" said a statement by Paterson after the meeting. Retailers in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden pulled millions of lasagna and other processed beef products off the shelves as the alarm was raised over the Findus lasagnas. The controversy comes less than a month after horsemeat was found in hamburgers sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Officials in Ireland have pointed to Polish meat ingredients as being the source of horsemeat found in burgers there. The UK Food Standards Agency said the evidence ""points to either gross negligence or deliberate contamination in the food chain. This is why we have already involved the police, both here and in Europe."" An agency spokesman, Brad Smythe, told CNN that participants in Saturday's meeting had agreed that ""meaningful results"" must be achieved by Friday. ""This concerns products that are most likely to have been contaminated, such as beef lasagne and other budget ranges,"" Smythe said. The meeting was about clarifying what tests are possible, what laboratory capacity is needed, and what can be done to protect consumer confidence, he said. Horse: Coming soon to a meat case near you? ""This is completely unacceptable -- this isn't about food safety but about proper food labeling and confidence in retailers,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday, quoted on his official Twitter feed. The revelations have thrown the meat industry into crisis and revolted many meat eaters in the United Kingdom, where horsemeat is generally considered taboo, although it is commonly eaten in neighboring France, as well as countries including China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Italy. Findus said Thursday it had withdrawn its lasagna -- labeled with the British spelling, ""lasagne"" -- from UK stores Monday as a precaution after its French supplier, Comigel, raised concerns about the type of meat used. Meanwhile, Findus France has temporarily withdrawn three ready-prepared dishes -- lasagna bolognese, shepherd's pie and moussaka -- because of the discovery of horsemeat in purported 100% beef products, the firm said. The company added, however, that the three products could still be eaten without health risk. Responding to questions as to how long it had known about the horsemeat issue, Findus said it had only been alerted by Comigel in a letter dated 2 February. That letter had made Findus ""aware of a possible August 2012 date"" for the contamination, the company said. British retailer Aldi said it had also withdrawn two of its products, a beef lasagna and spaghetti bolognese, after supplier Comigel ""flagged concerns that the products do not conform to specification."" While horsemeat is not itself a food safety hazard, its unauthorized presence -- in quantities up to 100% -- in foods purported to be made with beef has raised serious concerns. Comigel has not yet responded to CNN requests for comment. Chief among food inspectors' concerns is that the illicit horsemeat could contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or ""bute,"" commonly used to treat horses. Neigh it ain't so: Burger King finds horsemeat at European supplier . Meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone is not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health. Findus has been ordered to test the lasagna withdrawn from shelves in the United Kingdom for the drug's presence. Aldi said in a statement that tests on random samples of its affected products, labeled Today's Special Frozen Beef Lasagne and Today's Special Frozen Spaghetti Bolognese, ""demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30% and 100% horse meat. ""This is completely unacceptable and like other affected companies, we feel angry and let down by our supplier. If the label says beef, our customers expect it to be beef."" Samples of the affected Findus lasagna also contained between 60 and 100% horsemeat, according to UK and Irish food safety inspectors. In January, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA, while 23 of them -- or 85% -- tested positive for pig DNA. In nine out of the 10 burger samples, the horse DNA was found at very low levels, the inspectors said, but in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horse meat accounted for about 29% of the burger. Tesco apologized to customers after the revelation and promised action to make sure it never happened again. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws proscribe the consumption of pig products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horsemeat. The Justice Ministry confirmed last week that a number of meat pies and similar items supplied to prisons in England and Wales were labeled and served as halal -- prepared in compliance with Islamic dietary law -- but contained traces of pork DNA, the Food Standards Agency said. Horsemeat is not commonly eaten in the United States, but the country does export it to Canada and Mexico. Congress passed a bill in November 2011 that lifted a 5-year-old ban on the slaughter of horses for meat in the United States. CNN's Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: Findus UK says horsemeat in lasagna product may be intentional .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An investment executive who paid more than $20 million for an original, handwritten copy of the Magna Carta presented the ancient paper Monday to the media and plans to loan it to the National Archives. People photograph the rare copy of the Magna Carta before it's auctioned at Sotheby's New York in December.

The National Archives considers the manuscript ""a milestone in constitutional thought"" from the 13th century, and plans to place it on public display later this month. Rubenstein in the 1970s was the chief lawyer for a Senate panel that reviewed constitutional amendments. The original Magna Carta was signed in 1215.

"(CNN) -- American Chuck Blazer will leave his role as general secretary of CONCACAF, the body which governs football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, on December 31, ending a 21-year association with the organization. Blazer, 66, joined the body in 1990 and will leave his position to focus on other football-related projects. ""My passion for soccer is undiminished and it is time for me to explore new challenges within this wonderful sport,"" Blazer said in statement on CONCACAF's website. ""Leading this organization during the last two decades of unprecedented growth and accomplishment has been a great honor and a tremendous challenge.

Despite stepping down from his role with CONCACAF Blazer will retain his position with FIFA, the body in charge of world football. Blazer has been a member of FIFA's executive committee since 1997 and was part of the vote last year which awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. It has been a turbulent time for CONCACAF following the resignation of former chief and FIFA vice president Jack Warner in June. Warner, from Trinidad and Tobago, resigned from his post with FIFA after allegations of bribery and corruption in the run up to FIFA's presidential ballot in June. The vote was won unopposed by Sepp Blatter, the Swiss who has been at the head of world football since 1998. Blatter's sole rival in the race for the FIFA presidency was Mohammed bin Hammam, the former head of football in Asia. Bin Hammam loses first round of legal battle . Qatari Bin Hammam has since received a lifetime ban from FIFA following the same corruption allegations which had been made against Warner.

"Editor's Note: Republican strategist Alex Castellanos was a campaign consultant for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and has worked on more than half a dozen presidential campaigns. Castellanos is a partner in National Media Inc., a political and public affairs consulting firm that specializes in advertising. For a rival view, read here . Alex Castellanos says the Constitution requires that votes be counted equally within a state. (CNN) -- Minnesotans are a peculiar breed, the stereotype goes. They are disproportionately well-mannered. When dinner is offered, Minnesotans refuse at least three times before accepting. They habitually react to the most bone-chilling personal misfortune with a stoic, ""Could have been worse."" They speak an indirect idiom to avoid hurting another's feelings. ""So, what gave you the idea that we talk like that then?"" Minnesotans eat lutefisk, not for its taste, but from a sense of cultural responsibility. After all, the delightful state staple is fish prepared in lye. Who would want to miss ""All You Can Eat"" night? ""Minnesota Nice,"" however, can expose the soft underbelly of the state to self-interested politicians. This year, it may allow comedian Al Franken to walk away with one of the state's highest public offices and the U.S. Senate might finally gain what it has always lacked: a clown who is a credentialed professional. Even with Washington in disgrace and Congress suffering all-time-low approval ratings, a U.S. Senate seat still has value. Ask Rod Blagojevich, the chief executive of Illinois, a state whose lowest point, previously, was the Mississippi River. It is now his own governor's office. If the U.S. attorney's charges are true, at least Blagojevich had sufficient respect for a Senate seat to ask aspirants to pay for it. In Minnesota, Franken might pocket the Senate seat formerly held by Norm Coleman without paying a cent. As Michael Stokes Paulsen, a professor of law at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis wrote in The Wall Street Journal, there is a lot in the recount affair to concern us. Franken has exploited a weakness in almost every state's recount process. Recounts, Paulsen observes, must not violate the 14th Amendment, which provides that ""no state shall...deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" The Constitution suggests it is a matter of some importance that votes be counted uniformly in a democracy. The Supreme Court's ""Bush v. Gore"" 2000 decision reaffirmed the equal protection clause: Ballots in one precinct or county must not be evaluated differently than those in others. Recounts, however, are conducted locally, with individual precincts and counties interpreting state election laws. The result in Minnesota is a crazy quilt of newly evolved standards that, in fact, have become no standards at all -- and are constitutionally unacceptable. All votes are meant to get equal protection in Minnesota, but Franken's votes are getting more equal protection than Coleman's. In some parts of the state, as a Wall Street Journal editorial observed, recount officials have accepted Franken votes tallied on election night, even when the physical ballots were nowhere to be found for the recount. Let's say, through error or design, some overly enthusiastic election night official fed Franken votes through a voting machine twice: In some parts of Minnesota, Franken kept those votes, even though they could not be re-tallied. In other jurisdictions, the election night tally was thrown out and Franken got to include votes he didn't have election night but his team subsequently discovered. Availing himself of dissimilar standards in different parts of the state, Franken got to pick which benefited him the most, the election-day tally or the recount. In some localities, Franken's campaign has even been allowed to double-count ballots. If a legitimate ballot is damaged and cannot be mechanically counted, Minnesota law allows election officials to create and count a duplicate, as long as the original is marked and both ballots are stapled together. The Wall Street Journal contends that 80 to 100 original and duplicate ballots were separated and counted individually in the recount. Even if this were Illinois, such electoral imagineering is unlawful. Has the Coleman campaign allowed itself to be victimized? Perhaps. As Paulsen noted, the Minnesota Supreme Court's 3-2 decision allowed local boards to count absentee ballots that had been excluded, but only if both the Coleman and Franken teams approved. ""Insiders agree that Mr. Franken's team played a far more savvy game than Mr. Coleman's,"" he wrote. ""The margin of Mr. Franken's current lead is partly the product of a successful what's-mine-is-mine-what's-yours-is-vetoed strategy, and of the Coleman team's failure to counter it,"" Paulsen wrote. Unfortunately for Franken, the equal protection clause is not concerned with the cleverest competitors or the most savvy strategy. The Constitution is there to protect voters, not candidates, and it says all their votes must be valued identically. A recount is supposed to eliminate the political absurdities we find in Minnesota. Instead, Franken has exploited this recount to manufacture them. As a result, he has a lead -- and 25 precincts in Minnesota now have more ballots than voters. The good people of Minnesota need not worry, however. That oracle of objectivity, the selfless Democratic leader of the Senate, has declared Al Franken the winner. There's no need to see the process through, Harry Reid said Wednesday, because, ""There is no way that Coleman can win this. The numbers just aren't there. He should concede."" Reid adds that ""polls in Minnesota show that about half the people are upset...at Coleman asking for this additional work."" Shame on Coleman for insisting that every vote be counted, especially when those votes are his. In politics, much like football, both teams have to play by one set of rules. Neither team is allowed to score points after the game is over and the other team has left the field. Otherwise, the Vikings could still go to the Super Bowl. With Al Franken's vote counters, John McCain could still have been sworn in. There is good news for Coleman, however: The U.S. Constitution is still law in Minnesota. Minnesota courts will soon speak on the unequal evaluation of votes that has consistently advantaged Franken. If state courts do not invalidate Franken's dodgy lead in a trial that started Monday, it would not surprise if the U.S. Supreme Court finally did. Franken has tried to claim a hasty victory with more votes than voters. In so doing, he has shrugged aside the Constitution and underestimated the people of Minnesota. Their civility is built upon steel-eyed character. They believe all votes and all voters should be treated equally. The nicest state in the union deserves nothing less. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Castellanos.","Alex Castellanos: Minnesota's recount violated equal protection clause .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Sunday for a three-day trip centered on an international nuclear security summit in Seoul. He flew into Seoul, where he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with his South Korean counterpart Lee Myung-bak. Top officials from 54 countries, including China and Russia, will attend the summit meeting on Monday and Tuesday. But its message of international cooperation has been overshadowed by North Korea's announcement last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch in April. South Korea has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear-armed missile, while the United States has warned the move would jeopardize a food-aid agreement reached with Pyongyang in early March. President Lee has already said he will use the summit to drum up international support against the actions of his northern neighbor. North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) cited a spokesman from the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea as denouncing the South for working to turn the summit ""into a platform for (an) international smear campaign"" against the North. The North has a right to a nuclear deterrent and to conduct a ""satellite launch for peaceful purposes,"" the committee's statement said, and will take ""counter-measures"" if the South stirs up international criticism of its actions. Against that tense backdrop, Obama is scheduled on Sunday to visit for the first time the demilitarized zone that splits the Korean Peninsula in two. He will also meet with some of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, two of his top national security advisers said Tuesday during a conference call. Although Obama himself has not been to the demilitarized zone during his two previous trips to South Korea as president, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton paid a visit to the area in 2010. And Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, used binoculars to peer into North Korea from a sandbagged bunker on the southern side of the border in 2002. The date of Obama's visit "" is virtually two years to the day"" since the sinking of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, which left 46 Southern sailors dead, said Daniel Russel, director for Japan, South Korea, and North Korea at the U.S. National Security Council. South Korea says a North Korean torpedo attack was to blame for the ship's sinking. The North has denied the accusation. In a dramatic reminder of the U.S. military presence in South Korea, an American F-16 fighter jet crashed Wednesday near Kunsan airbase on the western coast of South Korea. The jet's pilot safely ejected before the crash, and no casualties were reported, said Maj. Eric Badger, public affairs officer of the 7th Air Force. Seoul's nuclear summit will be the second after Obama hosted the first meeting in Washington in 2010. He initiated the biennial summit after presenting his vision of a nuclear-free world in Prague in April 2009. The official agenda will deal with nuclear terrorism and how to secure the world's nuclear material. Although North Korea is not on the agenda, it is likely to be discussed on the sidelines. Pyongyang announced this month it would carry out a ""satellite launch"" in mid-April to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the country's founder. Using ballistic missile technology, however, is in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 and against a deal struck with the United States earlier this month that it would not carry out nuclear or missile tests in return for food aid. Pyongyang has said it will see any critical statement of its nuclear program as ""a declaration of war."" Concerns about Iran's nuclear program, again not on the official agenda, will also be discussed in bilateral meetings between leaders. CNN's Paula Hancocks, Shruti Pant, Jethro Mullen and Bob Kovach contributed to this report.","The South is running a ""smear campaign"" against its neighbor - North Korean state media .

"(CNN) -- 2013 will be a year of harsh change for the tech industry. We've just experienced five years of rapid, messy and disruptive innovation, and smartphones and tablets aren't the future any longer -- they're the present. Powerful mobile devices connected to broadband-speed cell networks are now an everyday reality, and it's going to take more than a bigger screen or faster processor to make an impact this year. Think of 2013 as the year of refinement and reckoning. Here are five big developments to keep an eye on: . 1. The future of Microsoft . Microsoft has been very candid about ""missing a generation"" of mobile innovation after Apple introduced the iPhone, and 2012 was all about the results of a furious catch-up effort: the company launched the completely rethought Windows 8 for PCs, Windows RT for tablets and Windows Phone 8 for smartphones. CEO Steve Ballmer also repositioned Microsoft as a ""devices and services"" company, and he introduced the Surface and Surface Pro, two tablets designed by Microsoft itself to compete with traditional PC companies such as Dell and Sony. That's a lot of bold bets, and they all have to pay off in 2013. The PC era is over, and Microsoft has to show consumers it has something to offer in a world dominated by tablets and smartphones. Windows 8 and Surface sales appear to have been slow so far, so we'll see how the company does. There is one all-but-guaranteed bright spot, though: a new Xbox is due to be announced this year. Top tech wishes for 2013 . 2. Can Apple get its software mojo back? Apple found success in 2012 by introducing an iPhone with a bigger screen and an iPad with a smaller screen, but it'll have to focus on software in 2013 to stay ahead of the competition. Apple CEO Tim Cook has now launched two iPhones since taking over for Steve Jobs, and both of them have come with buggy, incomplete flagship software features -- the iPhone 4S launched with the charming-but-not-so-useful Siri voice assistant, and the iPhone 5 launched with a homegrown Maps app so buggy that Cook was forced to apologize to customers. In the meantime, archrival Google has begun shipping some of the best iPhone apps around -- I've replaced most of Apple's apps on my iPhone homescreen with Google-built replacements such as Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome and YouTube. Most of my peers in the industry have done the same. That's not a good sign. Cook just fired Scott Forstall, the controversial head of iOS development who presided over Siri and Maps. Designer Jony Ive is now in charge of both hardware and software, so we'll see if the company can regain its reputation for state-of-the-art software design with the next iPhone and iPad. 3. Will Amazon go head to head with Apple and Google? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was very blunt when he introduced the new Kindle Fire HD in September -- he called it the ""best tablet on the market."" That was an obvious shot at Apple and the iPad, but Amazon's real competitor may well be Google, especially as the market for books, music and movies moves entirely online. There's no way Amazon wants people searching Google to find content and products from multiple sources. Amazon wants to build an ecosystem so robust you never want to leave. Think of what Apple did for music with the iPod and iTunes and then imagine Amazon doing that for everything. But the Kindle Fire products aren't good enough to compete with the iPad yet, and Amazon doesn't have all the services it needs to compete with Google either. It needs to offer at least e-mail and search, and a social experience wouldn't hurt either. That's not a small undertaking, but Amazon is one of the few companies with the scale, infrastructure and resources to make it happen. The rumors are getting louder. We'll see whether Amazon makes a big move in 2013. 4. Can Facebook grow up? 2013 will be Facebook's first year as a public company, and it has to prove that it can be a stable, reliable investment. That's no easy task: Facebook figured out how to make money selling ads on its website just as most of its users switched to smartphone and tablet apps. Selling ads on mobile isn't nearly as easy, and Facebook has to figure out how to display relevant ads to smartphone users without crossing the privacy line -- a line about which users are increasingly worried. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg has to answer to his investors now, and the pressure to cross that line will increase every day that Facebook isn't making money in mobile. 5. Can Google take Android back from Samsung and the wireless carriers? Here's the brutal truth of the smartphone market: the only companies that make any money are Apple and Samsung. Every other company, from HTC to Sony to Google's own Motorola, is struggling. And that's a huge problem for Google. Apple obviously writes its own software for the iPhone, but Samsung's phones all run a customized version of Google's open-source Android, and Samsung is so dominant that it could very well split off and start building its own version of Android, just as Amazon did with the Kindle Fire. That would be a huge blow to Google. If the rest of the market can't make money using Android soon, it'll provide a big opening for Microsoft. Google also has to find a way to limit the influence of wireless carriers on Android. Companies such as AT&T and Verizon are all too happy to load up Android devices with unnecessary crapware and bloatware that ruin the user experience while delaying important software updates. The animosity between Google and the carriers has gotten so deep that Google's new Nexus 4 flagship device doesn't have an LTE radio; the carriers simply wouldn't cooperate. That's in stark contrast to the iPhone experience, which is pristine and controlled by Apple from the start. It's a control that irritates power users but offers a sense of support and security to the rest of Apple's millions of customers. There's a happy balance between the two extremes, and Google needs to find it before Android begins to slip away entirely. These are just five of the many interesting things to look out for in 2013, from the future of TV to the rise of wearable computing. After several years of rapid change, we've all got computers in our pockets. The next few years will be about what we do with them to make our lives better.

"(CNN) -- Valentine's Day is about spending quality time with that special someone who floats your boat. And what better way to show your love is deeper than the ocean than by treating your sweetheart to a romantic sea-themed excursion? But if you thought watching sunsets over water was going to cut it, think again. From staying on the Beatles' famous yellow submarine in Liverpool to pearl diving in the Persian Gulf, CNN takes a look at the top seven dates for adventurous aquatic-lovers. All you need is love on a yellow submarine . The Beatles may have sung ""You can't buy me love,"" but that doesn't mean you can't buy a romantic getaway on the Fab Four's yellow submarine. Inspired by the submarine that featured in the band's 1968 animated film of the same name, the floating hotel is moored in the pop idols' hometown of Liverpool. The converted narrowboat features a psychedelic lounge adorned with gold Beatles records and the original mod scooter from the 1979 British rock film ""Quadrophenia."" Film buffs will have extra reason to twist and shout -- the narrowboat also featured in the 1990 Sean Connery thriller ""The Hunt for Red October,"" before its current reincarnation. Chocolate-making cruise . From the time of the ancient Aztecs, chocolate has been sending us into raptures of aphrodisiac bliss. But the process of cooking sweet treats can be just as sensual as eating them -- particularly when you're puttering down the Thames in a vintage 1960's boat. Alan Whatley, former chef at London's prestigious Savoy restaurant, shows guests the fine art of creating sumptuous chocolate desserts -- all while meandering through the south England countryside on a 12 meter wooden vessel. Setting sail from Henley-on-Thames, the picturesque three-hour journey offers views quite literally fit for a Queen -- Her Majesty's official home, Windsor Castle, backs on to the river. ""It's something a bit different from your standard chocolate in a box,"" charter manager, Daisy O'Halloran said. ""You can learn a new skill but you've also got the romance of the river."" Persian Gulf pearl diving . For hundreds of years, the Persian Gulf has been a rich source of the world's pearls, with divers plunging up to 40 meters below the water to get their hands on the ""jewels of the sea."" Now adventurous couples can also try their luck, with Bahrain's Al Dar Island offering day trips on traditional wooden sailboats, called dhows. After an onboard history lesson and demonstration, guests use a weighted rope to navigate down to the shallow seabed in search of riches. Once back on deck, they can admire their haul over a lunch of freshly prepared middle eastern dishes. Lighthouse love-in . ""Love has no age, no limit, no death,"" said 1932 Nobel Prize winning English writer, John Galsworthy. If you want to show your love is forever, the thousand-year-long musical piece playing from London's only lighthouse comes pretty close. Lovebirds can take in glittering views of the city from the lighthouse on the Thames, while listening to a unique composition of ancient Tibetan singing bells. The haunting music, played from loudspeakers, began in 1999 and aims to continue without repetition until 2999. ""It's incredibly romantic,"" said administrator, Victoria Burns. ""You can daydream together whilst enjoying magnificent views of the City through diamond-leaded windows."" World's most romantic islands . Arctic hot tub adventure . Scented candles, a hot tub and breathtaking views of the northern lights -- it's not a honeymoon suite, but a unique floating hotel in the Arctic. Introducing Vulkana, a 1950s fishing trawler converted into a luxury spa moored in northern Norway. The 23 meter vessel offers safaris along the dramatic Arctic coastline and boasts a wood-fire sauna, saltwater hot tub and seven-meter diving board for the more adventurous. When not marveling at the snow-capped views from the comfort of a steaming spa, sweethearts can take part in winter activities, inclduing reindeer-sledding and skiing. ""There's something spiritual about the boat itself,"" co-owner Erlend Larsson said. ""It's had a long life, and many different owners, and all of them have said how safe and calm everybody feels onboard."" Painting the Turkish Riviera . Roman general Mark Antony was supposedly so taken with the stunning south coast of Turkey -- known as the ""Turkish Riveria"" -- he gave it to Egyptian Queen Cleopatra as a wedding gift. Boasting dramatic cliffs perched over the sparkling Mediterranean Sea, it's easy to see why. Hundreds of years later, creative couples can also capture the scenes that so besotted Anthony -- in an island-hopping painting course. Setting sail from the small fishing town of Kas in south west Turkey, the tour winds past sun drenched islands before arriving at the ancient sunken city of Kekova. There, artistic lovebirds can sketch the 2nd Century ruins from the comfort of their wooden sailboat. Tropical underwater photography . It's the enduring problem of holidayers: the photos never quite live up to the reality. And if you're going to take your beloved on an expensive tropical getaway, you may as well capture it properly. Thailand island Koh Lanta, on the south west coast, offers vibrant coral reefs, thriving marine life and sparkling clear waters. And perhaps the best way to capture this spectacular underwater world is with a deep sea photography or video course. Divers are quipped with specialist underwater cameras and taught everything from spotting unusual aquatic animals to creating a dramatic composition.

"(CNN) -- Christiane Amanpour will return to CNN with a weekday program on CNN International while continuing at ABC News as a global affairs anchor, the networks announced Tuesday. Amanpour will begin hosting a program on CNN International in 2012 as part of a ""unique arrangement"" with ABC News, CNN Worldwide President Jim Walton said in an e-mail message to CNN staff. ""Christiane Amanpour has been synonymous with international reporting and with CNN for many years,"" Walton said in a statement. ""We could not be happier that through this unique arrangement with ABC News, her experience and global perspective are returning to a nightly news broadcast for our international audience."" Amanpour, who left CNN in 2010 to become host of ABC's ""This Week,"" said in a statement that she was ""thrilled and honored"" by the opportunity to host multiple specials for primetime ABC News and return to CNN. ""I am looking forward to getting back into the field to report stories on global issues that matter greatly to the American people,"" she said. ""At the same time, I will be broadcasting once again to hundreds of millions of people across the world with a weekday show on CNN International."" Former ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos will return to the program and continue his role as an anchor for ""Good Morning America,"" ABC News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said. ""Christiane has had an absolutely remarkable year at ABC News, with world-beating exclusives,"" ABC News President Ben Sherwood said in a statement. ""We're thrilled that she will be able to get back out in the field, bringing these important global stories back to our audiences, particularly primetime."" Amanpour spent more than 25 years reporting from around the globe for CNN. Most recently, she was CNN's chief international correspondent and anchored ""Amanpour,"" a 30-minute daily interview program that aired on CNN International from September 2009 to April 2010. Her body of work has earned nine News and Documentary Emmys, four George Foster Peabody Awards, two George Polk Awards, three duPont-Columbia Awards, the Courage in Journalism Award, an Edward R. Murrow award, an inaugural Television Academy Honor and nine honorary degrees. In 2007, Amanpour was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for her ""highly distinguished, innovative contribution"" to the field of journalism. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: ABC: Stephanopoulos will return to ""This Week,"" continue at ""Good Morning America""

"(CNN) -- Jim O'Neill, the Goldman Sachs economist who famously captured the globe's shifting economic power when he coined the ""BRIC"" acronym, now says the euro may not exist by 2020. O'Neill's views were aired at the Spring Ambrosetti Forum, where delegates gathered by the peaceful Lake Como. But unlike its serene waters, many delegates felt the future of the European Union -- which has been destabilized by economic crisis and political infighting -- remained murky. O'Neill, speaking to CNN at the forum, said: ""If we carry on the same way as we are, by 2020 the euro might not exist."" Read more: Oknoplast sees Europe' s window of opportunity . According to O'Neill, ""Germany will be exporting twice as much to China as it does to France by the end of 2020."" He added, ""I have joked to some of the European policy makers that in such an environment, Germany would want to be in a monetary union with China, not with France."" Read more: Auto industry revs up recovery on Spain . Villa d'Este plays host to the Ambrosetti forum twice a year. It is an elite gathering of European economists and business leaders, and for two days they have just one item on the agenda: The state of the global economy. Some have compared the Ambrosetti Forum to Davos; albeit a much smaller version. With serene views of Lake Como, a warmer climate and fine-dining, it's certainly a deluxe version. Read more: Henkel: Reaping rewards of its revamp . Light from chandeliers dance over the delegates as they sit in their four closed-door sessions a day, which are broken up with coffee breaks and three course meals. Nouriel Roubini, the economist also known by the name ""Dr Doom"" for predicting the credit crunch, was a little less gloomy about the eurozone than O'Neill when he spoke to CNN. Read more: Shipping giant looks to China to combat downturn . ""Compared to a year ago, when there was a risk that Greece would exit the eurozone, that the eurozone would break up, that Italy and Spain would lose market access, those tail risks have been reduced,"" he said. Roubini believes these risks have been reduced, in large part, by the European Central Bank's commitment to purchase sovereign bonds in the secondary markets. Now, Roubini told CNN, the European Union faces a ""political backlash"" with austerity fatigue from the likes of Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Greece, and bailout fatigue from Germany. ""There is a toxic nexus between a lack of competitiveness, unsustainability, low potential growth and an ongoing recession,"" he said. The need for political cohesion around a drive for austerity was common to many delegates' views, as was a desire for closer fiscal union. ""Europe is in the middle,"" Andrea Canino, the chairman at MC Partners, told CNN. ""We don't know where the power is, it is not any more in the national state and it is not in Brussels."" Such uncertainty would kill Europe, he added. Guiseppe Recche, the chairman of Eni, the Italian multinational oil and gas company, said his business continues to struggle in its European market. ""Wherever we do business, and we work in over 80 countries, we do well, except for Italy and Europe,"" he said. ""Is that because Europe is not competitive? Is that because Europe doesn't have technology to sell? Probably not. ""It needs to manage its expenses, austerity needs to be spoken of, and of not just in negative terms, a fiscal balance of expenses is needed."" The Ambrosetti Forum will reconvene in the autumn, the mist will have lifted over the lake, and, for the delegates, perhaps the future for the European Union will be looking clearer too.","Roubini believes eurozone break-up risk has been reduced, in large part, by ECB measures .

"(CNN) -- Zambian police rearrested two men this week on charges of engaging in homosexual acts ""against the order of nature,"" a rights group said. James Mwansa and Philip Mubiana, both 21, were arrested after neighbors reported them to the police, according to Amnesty International. Authorities subjected them to anal examinations without their consent and forced them to confess, the human rights group said. ""Anal examinations conducted to 'prove' same-sex conduct are scientifically invalid, and if they were conducted without the men's consent, contravene the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment under international law,"" said Simeon Mawanza, an Amnesty researcher in Zambia. It was the second detention for the two men in recent days, the group said. Last month, authorities arrested them, and later released them on bail on May 2. They were arrested again Monday and have been denied bail, according to Amnesty. Both have pleaded not guilty, and are being held at a jail in Kapiri Mposhi until their trial starts May 22. ""The arrest of the two men solely for their real or perceived sexual orientation amounts to discrimination and it is in violation of their rights to freedom of conscience, expression and privacy,"" Mawanza said. Zambian officials were not immediately available for comment. Homosexuality is illegal in Zambia and most African countries based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs. Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison. Last year, a Cameroon appeals court upheld a three-year sentence against a man convicted of homosexuality for texting his male friend to say, ""I'm very much in love with you."" South Africa -- one of the more progressive nations in the continent on the issue -- was the first African country to impose a constitutional ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation. But sexual violence against lesbians has become so common in South Africa, the nation has coined the term ""corrective rape"" to describe it. A handful of other nations issue a death penalty for consensual same-sex relations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.","Authorities subject them to anal examinations without their consent, a rights group says .

"(CNN) -- Reaction to North Korea's nuclear test -- its third since 2006 -- poured in Tuesday from around the world: . Barack Obama, U.S. president: . ""This is a highly provocative act that ... undermines regional stability, violates North Korea's obligations under numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions, contravenes its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, and increases the risk of proliferation. North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to international peace and security. The United States remains vigilant in the face of North Korean provocations and steadfast in our defense commitments to allies in the region."" For South Koreans, a familiar tone from Pyongyang . ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies."" U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta . ""We're going to have to continue to deal with rogue states like Iran and North Korea. We just saw what North Korea's done in these last few weeks -- a missile test and now a nuclear test. They represent a serious threat to the United States of America and we've got to be prepared to deal with that."" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs: . The Chinese government ""resolutely opposes"" North Korea's nuclear test, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a prepared statement. ""Holding up peace and stability in Northeast Asia is China's resolute position,"" it said. ""We strongly urge (North Korea) to abide by (its) promise to denuclearize and take no further action that will worsen the situation."" Park Geun-hye, South Korean president-elect: . ""Despite the strong warning from the international community and South Korea, North Korea has conducted its third nuclear test, and we strongly condemn it."" ""The North Korean nuclear test is a serious threat to the peace of the Korean peninsula and the world, and it has hampered the credibility between the South and North."" Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs: . The Russian Federation condemned the test of the nuclear explosive but also called on other nations not to react with a show of military might. In a written statement, the foreign ministry said North Korea's actions are an affront to the community of nations. ""It's doubly sad that we are talking about the state with which our country has a long history of good neighborliness,"" the ministry said. Russia called upon North Korea to stay away from a nuclear missile program, adhere to U.N. Security Council regulations and return to six-party talks. Then the foreign ministry directed a message to North Korea's adversaries: ""We expect that the current action of Pyongyang will not be used as an excuse to increase military activities around the Korean Peninsula."" Shinzo Abe, Japanese prime minister: . ""North Korea's nuclear testing is a grave threat to the safety of Japan and a serious challenge against international disarmament framework based on the non-nuclear proliferation treaty. We can never tolerate it as it significantly compromise the peace and safety of Northeast Asia and the international society."" ""Japan firmly protests and sternly condemns the nuclear testing."" Statement from the office of Ban Ki-moon, U.N. secretary-general: . ""The Secretary-General condemns the underground nuclear weapon test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today. It is a clear and grave violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is deplorable that Pyongyang defied the strong and unequivocal call from the international community to refrain from any further provocative measures. The Secretary-General had repeatedly called on the new leadership in Pyongyang to address international concerns and start building confidence with neighboring countries and the international community. The Secretary-General is gravely concerned about the negative impact of this deeply destabilizing act on regional stability as well as the global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation. He once again urges the DPRK to reverse course and work toward de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Young Kim looks to build his own legacy in North Korea . The Secretary-General is confident that the Security Council will remain united and take appropriate action. In the meantime, the Secretary-General remains in close contact with all concerned parties and stands ready to assist their efforts."" Yukiya Amano, International Atomic Energy Agency director general: . ""This is deeply regrettable and is in clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions."" ""The IAEA remains ready to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue by resuming its nuclear verification activities in the country as soon as the political agreement is reached among countries concerned."" Statement from NATO: . ""We condemn in the strongest terms the test by North Korea of a nuclear weapon, conducted in flagrant violation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. This irresponsible act, along with the December missile launch, poses a grave threat to international and regional peace, security and stability. North Korea's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction represents continued defiance of the U.N. Security Council and the broader international community."" William Hague, British foreign secretary: . ""I strongly condemn this development, which is a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874 and 2087. North Korea's development of its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities poses a threat to international and regional security. Its repeated provocations only serve to increase regional tension, and hinder the prospects for lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula."" Francois Hollande, French president: . ""I condemn in the strongest terms the nuclear test just made by North Korea,"" Hollande said on the French government's website. ""France again urges North Korea to immediately comply with its international obligations and to carry out complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear and missile programs."" Statement from the German Foreign Office: . Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle ""strongly condemns"" North Korea's nuclear test. The ""international community should consider further sanctions against the regime,"" the agency's official Twitter feed said. Bob Carr, Australian foreign affairs minister: . ""The Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms nuclear testing by North Korea.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least five people were killed and 30 others wounded Friday after a bombing outside a Sunni mosque in northeastern Baghdad, police said. The blast took place as worshippers were leaving the mosque in the al-Rashidiya neighborhood following Friday prayers, police said. There has been an uptick in violence lately between Shiites and Sunni Arabs, and the persistent tensions have stoked widespread fears that the simmering hostilities, which raged during the Iraq War, could morph into a civil war. Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized, and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. There have been protests for months by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. The anger has escalated since a confrontation last week between police and protesters in Hawija. More people died violently in Iraq in April than in any other month since June 2008, the United Nations said Thursday. A total of 712 people died and 1,633 more sustained injuries ""in acts of terrorism and acts of violence,"" the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said. Civilians made up most of the victims -- 595 -- and 1,438 civilians were injured. READ MORE: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode .

"(CNN) -- Hot air balloon rides at Egypt's popular tourist destination of Luxor are set to resume Wednesday, according to a statement on the Egyptian Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission's (CARC) website (Arabic). President of the CARC, Mohamed Ibrahim Sherif, confirmed balloon flights would restart, the Egypt Independent reported. Hot air balloon rides were banned in Luxor after a February 26 accident that killed 19 tourists. Preliminary investigations suggested that gas canisters aboard the balloon exploded, causing it to plummet about 1,000 feet (300 meters) to the ground. It was the world's deadliest hot air balloon accident in at least 20 years. Read more: Balloon crash kills 19 .

"London, England (CNN) -- One of Britain's most cherished maritime treasures will complete a miraculous rise from the ashes when it reopens to the public later this week. The Cutty Sark was devastated by fire in May 2007 but a Â£50 million ($81 million) restoration project has seen the historic vessel returned to its previous majestic glory. The 143-year-old vessel is the world's last surviving tea clipper -- a type of nineteenth century merchant sailing ship renowned for its speed -- and was once considered the epitome of commercial maritime technology. It will receive the royal seal of approval when the Queen and Prince Phillip preside over its reopening ceremony in Greenwich, London, on Wednesday. As part of the extensive restoration process the vessel has been raised 11 feet (3.3 meters) above ground, with its lower levels encased in a glass casing symbolic of the sea. See also: World's oldest warship gets $25 million revamp . This new feature enables visitors to walk underneath the ship, exposing the design and engineering feats that enabled the Cutty Sark to reach what were once record-breaking sailing speeds of 17 and a half knots (20 mph). ""We have raised the ship so she'll be right up there with the best (historic ships),"" Richard Doughty, chief executive of the Cutty Sark Trust, told CNN. ""She's a beautiful ship, a name that everybody immediately recognizes,"" Doughty added. ""The fire touched people's hearts (and) you value something when you think you're going to lose it."" Launched from the small town of Dumbarton on the banks of the River Clyde in western Scotland in 1869, the Cutty Sark has a long and colorful history. The ship carried a wide variety of cargo during its working lifetime -- including the finest teas, wool and gunpowder -- and made frequent journeys between the UK and major trading ports in Asia, Europe, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. See also: Adventure tourism at the bottom of the sea . Most of the tea clippers to grace the waves during the same period lasted for only a few years and just seven survived into the twentieth century. By the mid-1920s, the Cutty Sark was the only one still afloat and in 1954 it was transferred to its current dry-dock site in Greenwich. Here the vessel became a symbolic memorial to Britain's 19th century maritime and colonial dominance, attracting visitors and maritime enthusiasts from all over the world. It is this rich historic significance that the restoration project hopes to convey. A number of new hi-tech educational features meanwhile have been added to augment the overall theme. ""She was the fastest of her day, the last remaining tea clipper, emblematic of the importance of international trade and Britain's maritime heritage,"" said Jessica Lewis, curator of the Cutty Sark restoration project. ""We've used a variety of media to tell the story of the ship in different ways -- oral history and reminiscences, new AV (audio visual) and digital interactives. Once up and running the offer will be enhanced with live interpretation and family events,"" Lewis added. The Royal Museum Greenwich, which will take over the day-to-day running of the Cutty Sark after the reopening ceremony, hope the attraction will pull in around 300,000 visitors every year. See also: Voyage to discover historic vessel of Sir Francis Drake . Although the ship doesn't officially reopen for business until Thursday, visitors to the site have been able to view the vessel from afar as the finishing touches are applied. Those canvassed by CNN were positive in their appraisal of the Cutty Sark's restored aesthetic appearance. ""It's a really impressive sight,"" said Cathy Sertori who had traveled to London all the way from Australia. ""I'd heard about the restoration project and it's such an important historical ship that we really wanted to come down and see it while we are here,"" Sertori added. ""There is already loads to see in London but the glass feature is so impressive. It will give people a totally different perspective on the skills and design that went in to creating such a magnificent ship,"" she said.","The Cutty Sark will reopen to the public in London this week .

"(CNN) -- Angolan authorities have arrested two people in an attack on the Togo national soccer team that left three dead, state media reported. The men were captured at the same location in the state of Cabinda where the bus carrying the soccer team came under fire on Friday, the Angolan Press Agency said Sunday. It did not say when they were arrested. The suspects were said to be members of the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda, an armed wing of a separatist group that has claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again. Cabinda is a disputed oil-rich enclave in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is the site of eight matches in the African Cup of Nations tournament, to which the soccer team was headed. The tournament is one of the biggest sporting events in the world this year, and Angola's first since a 2002 peace deal ended decades of civil war in the southern African country. The president of the Confederation of African Football sent ""his most heartfelt condolences"" to Togo Monday. Issa Hayatou expressed his sympathy ""on behalf of the entire African football family"" in a letter to Togo's President Faure Gnassingbe, the confederation announced. Togo tragedy should not increase World Cup worries . Hayatou went to Cabinda personally following the attack, the sports body said. The confederation will observe a moment of silence in memory of the slain Togolese before each match in the first round of the tournament, it announced Monday. Togo striker Thomas Dossevi said rebels opened fire on the team bus with AK-47 assault rifles. The gunfire killed the team's assistant coach, its communication officer and the bus driver. At least seven others were wounded, including goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale. Erin Smylie, a spokeswoman for the South African hospital that has been treating Obilale, told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph the 25-year-old remained ""stable but ventilated and sedated to assist with recovery."" After the ambush, Togo's government said the squad had to return home, though the team had indicated it would like to play. ""It's disappointing that Togo left, but it was a difficult decision,"" said Kwesi Nyantakyi, president of the Ghana Football Association. Do you think athletes are an easy target for attack? Togo was to play Ghana on Monday. ""I saw them. They were really down. We tried to console them and encourage them. Their departure was a definite blow to the competition,"" Nyantakyi said Monday. Angolan officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the nation's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security, particularly in Cabinda. ""'The security has definitely improved since we arrived here on Thursday,"" Nyantakyi said. ""There are helicopters flying in the air, patrol teams in the host venue. ... We have security all the time, even at the hotel."" CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","NEW: Angola news agency: Two men arrested over attack on Togo team .

"(CNN) -- Brett Rumford is enjoying the European Tour's 'Asian Swing' and is well placed to secure back to back victories by taking a one-shot lead into the final round of the China Open Sunday. The Australian, who won the Ballantine's Championship in Korea last weekend with an eagle at the first playoff hole, carded a third round three-under 69 in blustery conditions at the Binhai Lake Golf Club. Rumford, 35, carded a hat-trick of birdies to catch overnight leader Mikko Ilonen and the Finn bogeyed the last after driving into the water to relinquish the lead. It left Rumford on 12-under 204, one clear of Illonen, with Spain's Pablo Larrazabal in third, a further shot back. Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat will go into the final round in fourth -- three behind. The tournament has been notable for the appearance of teenage local players, notably 12-year-old Ye Wocheng, who missed the cut. But his amateur counterpart, Dou Zecheng, a relative veteran at 16, continued to impress and carded a level-par 72 for two-under overall. ""I had some good iron shots and my putting was especially good today, but I still need to improve on my distance,"" he told AFP. Up front, Rumford has taken charge but acknowledged conditions were difficult, particularly on the back nine. ""That was a tough day,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""I really started to feel things on the back nine. I did really well to hang in nicely with some tired golf swings, I mentally stayed with it -- physically not so much but mentally I hung in there."" Defending champion Branden Grace of South Africa was the last player to win two successive events on the European Tour, back in January 2012. He is nine shots behind in China after a third round 72. Meanwhile, on the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson grabbed a share of the halfway lead at the $6.7 million Fargo Championship in North Carolina. The legendary ""leftie"" carded a five-under 67 at Quail Hollow to stand on a nine-under 135. Australia's Scott Gardiner, who matched Mickelson's 67, was tied for second on 137 with Americans Nick Watney and George McNeill. World No.2 Rory McIlroy shared fifth place with five others, three behind. Mickelson finished second behind McIlroy at Quail Hollow in 2010 and is tuning up for the U.S. Open championship at Merion next month. Northern Ireland's McIlroy, one of seven joint leaders after the first round, shot a one-under 71 to be tied with England's Lee Westwood, Australian Rod Pampling and home pair Jason Kokrak and Derek Ernst.","Brett Rumford leads China Open by a shot after third round .

"(CNN) -- A locally-produced slapstick comedy was the runaway box office hit last year in China, but international films swept the top 10 highest-grossing films in the country. Industry insiders say international influence is only set to grow, as Chinese censors loosen restrictions on foreign films and more fans make a habit of seeking out the latest blockbusters. Last year, the country's box office receipts increased 30% to over RMB 17 billion ($2.7 billion), making China the world's second-largest box office . On the fifth episode of CNN's monthly show ""On China,"" host Kristie Lu Stout traveled to Hengdian World Studios to discover what strikes a chord with Chinese viewers. There, she asked Dan Mintz, CEO of DMG Entertainment Group, and acclaimed film directors Jin Yimeng (Eva) and Lu Chuan what Chinese filmgoers want to see. On the surface, the script for success is not dissimilar to what works in the United States, they said. U.S. films, including ""Titanic 3D"" and ""Mission: Impossible-- Ghost Protocol"" comprised seven of the top 10 highest-grossing films in 2012, according to the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. While foreign films accounted for only a quarter of the 303 movies screened in Chinese theatres last year, they took in over half of overall ticket sales (52.4%). Chinese moviegoers seek escapism, according to Jin, China's first female director to exceed RMB 100 million ($16 million) at the box office. She struck gold with her 2009 romantic comedy, ""Sophie's Revenge,"" which featured international Chinese star Zhang Ziyi. Previously, Chinese romantic comedies were primarily low-budget efforts that failed to capture audiences, she said. Indeed, the highest-grossing film in China last year (RMB 1 billion or $161 million) was ""Lost in Thailand,"" a locally-produced lowbrow, slapstick comedy featuring two rival colleagues battling snakes and gangsters to win the favor of their boss. In contrast, Lu's ""The Last Supper,"" a dark historical film dramatizing the transition between the Qing and Han dynasties, felt flat when it was released in late November. ""People struggle for [the] whole year, they want some entertainment,"" he said. It is not to say that Chinese audiences only welcome comedic fare. While it did not crack the top ten, ""Looper,"" a futuristic sci-fi movie by U.S. writer-director Rian Johnson and starring Bruce Willis, was still a big hit both internationally and in China last year. Its scenes in Shanghai aside, Looper's projections of the future mirrored the ongoing question of China's trajectory, said Mintz, whose company co-produced the movie. ""There's never really been a film that has talked about mainland China in the future, and that I think is very, very specific to what Looper was,"" Mintz said. ""It's obviously a powerhouse...but where is it going to be in the future?"" Easy access to theaters is also driving mainland viewers to the silver screen. China has over 12,000 movie screens and it is adding more at a rate of eight to 10 each day, Mintz said. Cinemas in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai are comparable to those in the U.S., Lu added. But the guests said the overriding factor in increasing box office sales is a growing predilection for young Chinese to visit the cinema every week. ""I know some young people, they go into movie theatres every week and sometimes if they like [the movie], they watch [it] three times,"" said Jin. China's film boom is not without its obstaclesâ€”particularly in navigating government censors. Lu described the process as opaque and protracted. For his critically-acclaimed film ""City of Life and Death"" about the controversial Rape of Nanking, he said censors took nearly a year to approve the script and half a year to approve the film. While censorship restrictions are all-encompassing on the surface, Mintz said the rules are subject to interpretation for each film, describing the system as a Chinese way of saying, ""Let me say what you can't do and we'll work our way backwards."" ""There's a rule that says you can't do this and there's a rule that says you can't do that,"" he said, adding, ""If we live by those rules, we wouldn't be anywhere, we wouldn't be in this business."" Case in point: Looper managed to bypass the rule against featuring time travel by making other concessions. Restrictions are slowly easing, Mintz said, and ""each new precedent will then lay the ground for the next one."" While Chinese cinemas have a strict annual quota of screening 20 foreign films, the government allowed 14 extra films to be shown last year, as long as they were 3D or IMAX versions. The share of revenue for foreign film companies was also increased to 25%. Filmmakers point out that opening up the mainland film industry is not only essential for foreign films to do well in China, but also for Chinese films to break into international markets. There is clearly a mutual appetite between the Chinese and American film industries. Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping stopped by Hollywood on a U.S. visit last year. Dreamworks and Chinese media groups are set to open a joint venture animation studio in Shanghai, as part of a new entertainment district billed as rivaling Broadway in New York. ""This is definitely the best time for the Chinese filmmakers because there are so many investors with hot money...we have so many opportunities,"" said Jin.","International films swept top 10 highest-grossing films in China in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- A recently built superyacht suggests that at least some wealthy holiday makers are demanding more from their sailing trips than just exotic islands and sun-drenched sea decks. The 74-meter RV Pegaso comes with the usual roster of flat-screen TVs, designer furniture and en-suite bathrooms, but a closer inspection reveals that it also doubles as a fully-fledged floating laboratory. Indeed, Pegaso's ""RV"" designation stands for ""research vessel"", and the boat is equipped with a five-man submarine, a decompression chamber for deep sea diving and a small team of marine biologists. Alex Flemming is the chief executive of the yacht's managing company, Pegaso Marine. He explains that anyone who charters the yacht can have as much or as little involvement in the research as they like, with the one condition that they always allow a group of scientists to travel with them. Flemming believes demand for boats of this type represent a growing trend within the yachting community, where people are looking for something more than just a hedonistic getaway. ""The historic perception of the superyacht set is the south of France, drinking champagne and having a lovely time,"" he said. ""But suddenly people are going: 'Hang on a second. I can go somewhere further afield and be a part of something bigger.' ""This is about getting the most out of time and also feeling as though they're doing some good,"" he added. According to Sean Dooley of the Ocean Preservation Alliance (OPA), the boat is owned by an accomplished diver and marine preservationist who wishes to keep his identity private. ""This is his fourth vessel. He'd already been yachting for 15 years and traveled around the world twice,"" claimed Dooley. ""It was at that point he said: 'Let's do something different.'"" The boat's original dining area was converted into a lab and fitted with scientific equipment capable of everything from tagging endangered marine life to monitoring water pollution levels. As well as the decompression chamber, the vast array of diving equipment on board RV Pegaso includes a machine that produces high-quality oxygen -- allowing trained guests to dive deeper, longer and safer. One of the biggest draws -- for guests and scientists -- is the five-person submarine on board. Weighing 14 tons, managing company Pegaso Marine claim it's the world's only privately owned diver-lockout sub, allowing divers to enter and leave underwater via different chambers and explore depths few others have ventured before. Such experiences can be transforming. Dooley recounts the journey of a guest aboard a similar research vessel in the Socorro Islands, just off Mexico, who helped scientists tag giant manta rays in an effort to track their migration patterns. The vital data was packaged into a video that the guest then presented to the president of Mexico. ""He was able to help conduct important research that will have a lasting impact. And as he kept telling us, this was the best trip he'd ever had,"" said Dooley. But all this worthy enterprise does nothing to distract from the luxury embellishments at hand on RV Pegaso. True to its owner's vision of combining high-level research with opulence fit for a sultan, guests who are not otherwise tagging hammerhead sharks or monitoring the breeding habits of whales, can enjoy comforts that include an eight-person spa pool, bar, cinema, gym and extensive observation lounge. ""When we do trips with our clients, they still like wonderful meals, they still like massages, they still like the luxury of living aboard a superyacht,"" said Dooley. ""But we've got a whole other layer of richness you just can't get from your average superyacht.""","Introducing RV Pegaso, a 73.6m superyacht boasting a science lab and submarine .

"Davos (CNN) -- Visualize, if you will, a massive freeway interchange, with automobiles criss-crossing at varying speeds. Some raced through the 2008-2009 financial crisis like they were just getting on the famous German autobahn, others have decelerated dramatically. We gathered an all-star panel of three central bank governors from Brazil, China and Nigeria, the finance minister of Mexico and the chief executives of Coca Cola and Renault-Nissan for a one hour discussion ""Emerging Markets at a Crossroads"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Medvedev: Russia is open for business . The overall verdict? The BRICS markets, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, share little in terms of a common DNA but investment in these markets are still paying handsome dividends due to the size of their consumer markets. At the top end, China should hit 8% growth in 2013, according to the Deputy Governor of the Chinese Central Bank Yi Gang. Urbanization, he said, just crossed the 50% mark and this flood of people into regional hubs in China will continue to boost growth. It has not been all smooth sailing for the world's largest emerging market, stringing together seven straight quarters of declining growth, until recent numbers of the 4th quarter reversed that trend. How to fix Zimbabwe's challenge . On the other end of the spectrum is Brazil. Despite a sizeable market, a bounty of natural resources from forest products to deepwater oil deposits, and hosting the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games to boost infrastructure spending and future tourism arrivals, Brazil has gone into a downward economic spiral. Today the heat is on President Dilma Rousseff to put Latin America's largest economy back on a growth path after plummeting from 7.5% growth in 2010 to just over 1% when the final numbers are tabulated for last year. What's your economic mood? Alexandre Tombini, the affable central banker from Brazil, tried to brush off long-term concerns when I asked if the president's economic team was behind the curve when it repeatedly slashed interest rates to combat a slow-down. The team has been blamed for mismanaging expectations when they suggested 3% or more growth could be delivered in 2012. Even during this turbulent patch, Tombini notes that nearly 40 million people have been pulled up into the middle class and that measures to cuts energy costs and payroll taxes will make Brazil much more competitive. It is ""better now than later"" said Tombini of the reforms finally in place. In a separate plenary session, Christine Lagarde, the IMF Managing Director, said the emerging markets should use 2013 as a time to rebuild financial buffers and ""rebalance their business models to boost domestic demand."" The IMF a day before the World Economic Forum got underway said that emerging market economies will grow 5.4%, fractionally lower than the group's forecast last October. Defterios: What I've learned from 20 years at Davos . The stumbling performance of all the BRICS minus China is what has led investors to home in on the next wave of emerging markets, especially the highly populated countries such as Nigeria, Turkey and Mexico. Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto entered office December promising to deliver on a ""Pact for Mexico"" of sweeping economic reforms, while trying to reboot relations with Washington. Finance minister Luis Videgaray said their administration will use a comprehensive approach, which may even include opening up the state oil giant Pemex to foreign investment. Oil output has been on the decline for a decade and could benefit from the expertise of the U.S. energy giants. The narrative has changed from the drug war that has claimed more than 60,000 lives to tapping into the economic potential south of the Rio Grande. Growth opportunities have pushed poverty levels down 9% to 42% of the population and migration has been reversed, according to Videgaray. Mexico exports 82% of its products to the U.S. and that exposure led the economy down 9% during the worst of the financial crisis in 2008-09. But if there is a leading light in terms of the next tier of fast-developing countries, one has to point to Nigeria, which has more than doubled its average growth rate over the past two decades to 7%. The financial and political capitals, Lagos and Abuja, are booming and central bank governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi says it is a priority to spread the wealth to the other 35 states in the country. Is the rise of China creating conflict? The same tired themes still haunt Africa's second largest economy: Poverty and corruption. Nigeria ranks 139 out of 176 countries in Transparency International's corruption perception survey. Sanusi said oil and subsidy regime fraud needs continued pursuit of perpetrators but his country is one of the few to put bankers in jail for their misdoings during the financial crisis. A great deal has been written about the BRICS hitting a wall, with their better days being behind them, but the long serving chief executive of Renault-Nissan said investors are lacking perspective. In the developed markets of the world, the average rate of automobile ownership is 500 to 600 cars per 1,000 inhabitants. Carlos Ghosn, the Brazilian-born CEO of Lebanese parents, said in the BRIC markets could be as low as 100 per 1,000. This implies substantial growth, justifying the half trillion dollars or more of investment for plants being set up in these emerging markets.","CNN's John Defterios gathered an all-star panel for his discussion 'Emerging Markets at a Crossroads' in Davos .

"(CNN) -- A soldier has been detained and charged with murder in Wednesday's shooting death of a civilian employee at Fort Knox, Kentucky, according to a court document and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command. The soldier, identified in an FBI criminal complaint as Marquinta E. Jacobs, was assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. He was captured in Tennessee, where his mother lives. The civilian, who has not been publicly named, was shot several times with a .45-caliber handgun in a parking lot at Fort Knox about 5:40 p.m. Wednesday. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. The victim was shot near Jacobs' pickup truck, and Jacobs fled the scene in the truck, according to the complaint filed by FBI Special Agent Mark A. Coleman. According to Coleman's complaint, Jacobs' wife said Jacobs owns a .45-caliber handgun. She allowed investigators to search the home; they found boxes of ammunition believed to be the same type as that used in the shooting. Jacobs' wife said her husband had come home, left the truck and departed again on a motorcycle. Investigators found the motorcycle early Thursday morning at the home of his mother in Portland, Tennessee, the complaint says. Jacobs was believed to have left his mother's place in a Kia Rondo. He was later apprehended by Portland police and Army Criminal Investigation Command agents, the command said in a press release Thursday afternoon. The shooting occurred outside Fort Knox's Human Resources Command building, prompting officials to lock down the army post for an hour. Chris Grey, a spokesman for the CID, said agents were investigating the incident as ""a domestic issue and not a random act of violence."" Authorities are withholding the name of the victim pending notification of his family.","NEW: Soldier Marquinta E. Jacobs arrested in Tennessee, charged with murder .

"Denver (CNN) -- A high school senior's racy picture is causing controversy after the yearbook staff refused to publish it, calling the picture inappropriate. The photo shows 18-year-old Sydney Spies in a short skirt and revealing top. She had it taken by a professional photographer in her hometown of Durango, Colorado, and submitted it to the yearbook with her mother's approval. ""She tells me that she has grown tired of seeing all the boring pictures submitted, and she wanted to do something different,"" said Sydney's mother, Miki Spies. Seniors at Durango High School can submit their own photos to the yearbook. They often choose pictures that reflect their interests, like sports or music. A committee of five students determines whether the photos are acceptable. They rejected Spies' photo, calling it inappropriate. A second photo, showing her in a short dress against a brick wall, was also rejected. ""There's something wrong when people can't express themselves in their own yearbook,"" Miki Spies said. The Durango School District says it wasn't part of the process, but it supports the decision of the yearbook committee. According to spokeswoman Marty Kay Hutton, ""The student editors of Durango High School's yearbook informed a senior student in December that her photo in question would not be included as a senior portrait in the yearbook and asked her to submit a replacement. Durango School District administration supports this decision."" Miki Spies says her daughter should be able to express herself, just like any other student. ""There are no standards that are required for yearbook photos. She's into the arts outside of school,"" Miki Spies said. The photos have outraged many as the story has spread. On a Facebook page set up by the family, some of the comments are extremely negative: . ""Too sexy for a young woman. Think of how you will be remembered for the rest of your life, in the eyes of your classmates."" ""You are gross and your parents are losers like you are."" ""Tramp."" Miki Spies says that she is surprised by the comments but that they have strengthened her resolve to fight for her daughter. She's not sure what they will do next but says she has contacted the ACLU for help. ""I'm a fighter for the underdog, and I hate the abuse of authority,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The Whitney Houston headlines last week sent a familiar shiver through me. In the 1970s, I ran one of the leading entertainment business public relations firms. Celebrity clients were wildly indulging themselves, accountable to no one. It was money, power and prestige, with no one to say, ""That's enough."" Drugs and alcohol were endemic. Today, the conversation revolves around prescription drugs, but back then we were into more basic mind-altering substances: pot, psychedelics, cocaine and heroin. To be truthful, I had an amazing run before it all turned to garbage. My office, on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, was set up like a huge living room with couches, overstuffed pillows on the floor, rock star posters lining the walls and a coffee table, the centerpiece of which was a large crystal bowl, filled at all times with a generous supply of cocaine. The house rules were ""help yourself if you're here on business -- but no take-outs!"" We were regularly visited by our clients, including The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, The Doors and Steppenwolf. As you could imagine, my office was a very popular place. But 29 years ago, I stood at the precipice with a decision to make. With a career of impressive accomplishments in the rear-view mirror, I had what looked like only despair and death ahead of me. Alcoholism and drug addiction had rendered me into what the ""Big Book"" of Alcoholics Anonymous refers to as ""pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization."" The choice seemed simple. Choose life or death. Do I acknowledge I have a problem, or do I continue to live in denial? Do I listen to my friends and family, or do I seek my own counsel? Do I continue to deteriorate mentally and physically, or do I say, ""I've had enough?"" Do I choose to live, or do I want to die? If I once had a dream, I thought, it was long ago shattered. If I once had a dream, it's floating face down in a bottle of Jack Daniels. If I once had a dream ... ahh, screw it, I ain't no Martin Luther King Jr. Throwing in the towel and surrendering to admitting I had a serious problem should have been the obvious thing to do, given the state I was in. But at the time, change seemed impossible, unimaginable, incomprehensible and downright insane. Insane was the right word, all right, but it described my state of mind. Alcohol and drugs are subtle foes; cunning, baffling and powerful. I seemed to be the last one to know I was in big trouble. When my high-profile career started to fall apart, it was other people's fault. When my substantial income dried up, my business manager was to blame. When the beautiful house I so dearly loved was finally foreclosed, it was the bank that was screwing me. When she finally couldn't take it anymore and left, I knew she was the type to do this to me. When my friends began to disappear, they were scum and didn't deserve me. And when, at last, my only friends, my drugs and alcohol turned on me, I knew it was over. And so a journey of unimaginable proportions began. Not to any outward destination. No rehab, no trip to a far-off spa. I didn't move to another city, as if a geographic change would fix it. No, I didn't have to travel anywhere, except into the mirror, and by peeling the onion of my soul. The journey was within, to at long last discover where the real problem resided. It was, of course, in me. What a surprise -- with the loving help and support of a 12-step program, I found the real culprit. We in recovery refer to alcoholism as a spiritual sickness. And if you look that up in the dictionary, you'll find a photo of me. ""Mr. Spiritual Sickness of 1982."" If you ask me nicely, I might show you a picture of that lost soul that I still carry around in my wallet. Yes, I had long hair and a beard, the smug look of false confidence on my face and even the obligatory turquoise jewelry of that era. But look more closely, and you'll see in my eyes shallow pools of emptiness, pupils like pinholes from the daily consumption of narcotics. As a friend remarked when he saw the photo, ""The lights are on, but nobody's home."" After you shake your head in disbelief,and look up at me again wondering how this was possible and how I became such a different person, I will offer you an explanation. I'm a recovering drug addict and alcoholic who was spared from a life of misery, incarceration and death. I've been spared from the life of self-centeredness that led me to care very little about others and only about myself. I've been spared from the countless fears of inadequacy, failure, success, intimacy and anything else that threatened my well-guarded defenses. I've been spared a life of darkness and shown a path into the light. We don't yet know why Whitney died, but we know she struggled with addiction.

"(CNN) -- Coming soon to your TV: a high-stakes recipe contest for home cooks, a giant boxing glove that knocks players into icy water and challenges carried out entirely in the dark. Maybe. These are a few of the television formats for sale next week at MipTV, the world's largest marketplace for TV programming, held in Cannes, France. Beginning Sunday and for the next three days, about 12,000 attendees will examine the formats and programs of more than 1,200 TV producers, up 25% from last year. For the smart TV executive, it's a chance to find ratings gold. Some of America's most popular TV shows, including ""American Idol,"" ""Dancing With the Stars,"" ""Big Brother,"" ""The Voice"" and ""America's Got Talent,"" started out as formats sold to networks after they proved successful in other countries. In addition to the structure of the show, the format seller provides the know-how, helping buyers adapt the program to the unique characteristics of viewers in each country. It's a business that's been growing since 1951 when ""What's My Line?"" on CBS was sold to the BBC. And it's gotten bigger every year. ""I think in these times when there is pressure on budgets, people rely on alternative formats because they know they're getting well thought-out programs that have proven their worth in a number of territories,"" said Trish Kinane, president of worldwide entertainment for London-based FremantleMedia, a world leader in format sales. FremantleMedia has a huge catalog of TV formats for sale, but at MipTV it will shine a spotlight on ""Recipe to Riches,"" a Canadian production. In that show, home cooks prepare their favorite recipes in a designated category, such as appetizers one week or entrees the next. The day after each show, the winning food item is featured in supermarkets across the country. Shoppers buy and taste the items and then vote for the best one overall. ""It's not just a traditional cooking show,"" Kinane said. ""In Canada, of the top 10 products over the last 10 years, four have come as a result of this show."" Another show on FremantleMedia's menu is ""The Boxing Glove,"" developed by Fuji Television in Japan. Here, contestants stand above a pool of icy water. An enormous boxing glove swings slowly toward them. A TV monitor in the glove shows a question. A correct answer brings the glove to a stop. In ""Total Blackout,"" contestants are put in a completely dark room and play games, including trying to identify items by touch. The Syfy cable network already bought the show for the United States and will premiere its American version on April 25 with Jaleel White as host. The event also gives U.S.-based shows a shot at the international market. In a press release, cable network A&E touted ""450 hours of new programming for international broadcasters."" ""A+E Networks comes to MIP TV with a newly expanded sales staff and a dynamic programming catalog that features some of the highest-(rated) series and formats on U.S. pay TV,"" Marielle Zuccarelli, managing director for A&E Networks international content distribution, said in the release. ""Our lineup is headlined by the epic mega-doc, 'Mankind: The Story of All of Us,' and our hit formats will feature high on the agenda as we aggressively ramp up this area of our business and roll out some of our latest productions."" Game and reality shows have had the greatest success at MipTV, but nothing is guaranteed. The CW's dating show, ""Farmer Wants a Wife,"" and the NBC quiz show ""The Weakest Link"" failed to win big ratings in the United States despite becoming hits elsewhere. Comedy and drama formats also are for sale. Over the years, some of America's most beloved scripted shows were conceived elsewhere, then adapted for U.S. viewers. ""Till Death Us Do Part"" became ""All in the Family,"" ""Steptoe and Son"" transformed into ""Sanford and Son"" and ""Man About the House"" turned into ""Three's Company."" More recently, ""The Office"" was successfully adapted from the British original and gave NBC a hit. Other recent attempts haven't worked out as well. Examples of flops include ""Prime Suspect,"" ""Life on Mars,"" ""Wild at Heart,"" ""Life Is Wild,"" ""Kath & Kim,"" ""Eleventh Hour,"" ""Coupling"" and ""Blackpool"" (which became ""Viva Laughlin""). ""Comedy is very much of its time and often is dependent on the character and the performer,"" Kinane said. ""It's about the zeitgeist. I think comedies will work in the short term, but they're not going to be like 'The Price Is Right.' "" Kinane predicted that interactive shows, such as ""Recipe to Riches,"" where viewers can watch a show and then eat the food the next day, will start a trend among TV format producers. ""Viewers love being involved, and this is just going one step further,"" she said. Of course, such shows must be taped long before they are aired. ""It takes seven months for the supermarket to get the product in stores,"" she said.","About 12,000 attendees will examine formats and programs for sale next week at MipTV .

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela was discharged from the hospital Saturday, the country's presidential office said, ""following a sustained and gradual improvement in his general condition."" Mandela ""will now receive home based high care,"" the statement said. The 94-year-old, who was South Africa's first black president, was admitted to the hospital on March 27. He has received treatment for a recurring lung infection and pneumonia. The governing African National Congress welcomed the news. ""Let us continue to keep President Mandela and his family in our prayers as he continues to receive treatment from home,"" the party said in a statement. The presidential office did not specify whether Mandela would return to his home in Johannesburg or in his childhood village of Qunu. Each home is equipped with a mini clinic that can provide 24-hour care as he continues his recovery from this bout of pneumonia. Mandela, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has become increasingly frail over the years and has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010. His history of lung problems dates back to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during apartheid. He contracted tuberculosis during the 27 years he was imprisoned. He underwent treatment for a lung infection and had surgery to remove gallstones over the Christmas holiday in 2012, one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990. President Jacob Zuma ""thanks the hard working medical team and hospital staff for looking after Madiba so efficiently,"" the statement from the presidential office said. ""He also extended his gratitude to all South Africans and friends of the Republic in Africa and around the world for support."" Madiba is Mandela's clan name, and how he is widely referred to in South Africa. CNN's Per Nyberg and Robyn Curnow contributed to this report.","South Africa's governing ANC welcomes the news of Mandela's release from hospital .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A Chinese millionaire's $8,888,888 gift to Yale University has impressed and provoked his countrymen. Lei Zhang's donation will help pay for a new School of Management campus at Yale and a new auditorium there will bear his name, the school announced last week. He received a master's degree in business from the school in 2002. The gift is the largest ever pledged to the management school. The dollar amount is based on the number eight, which Chinese regard as lucky. Reactions to Lei's gift have ranged from obscenity-laced rants to understanding, according to translated forum comments on chinaSMACK, an aggregator of stories on China's Internet. ""Traitor, were you born with the knowledge you had before going to America?"" one poster asked. ""Why not donate the money to those in China who cannot afford to go to school, the impoverished areas who cannot afford to build schools?"" another wrote before calling Lei a ""double-crossing bastard."" Others defended Lei's gift. ""Yale helped him achieve his current career and he is gratefully repaying them, we should be pleased,"" a blogger wrote. ""From an objective perspective, who others donate their money to is their personal business, and there is no reason they must donate to China,"" another wrote. Part of Lei's gift will help provide scholarships for Chinese students in the International Relations Program at the school's new Jackson Institute of Global Affairs, Yale said in a statement. The money also will support China-related activities at the university, including a program in cooperation with China's Ministry of Education to train Chinese university presidents. A poll question on chinaSMACK asked: ""What do you think about Chinese graduates donating large sums of money to Yale?"" Of the nearly 45,000 votes that the Web site said it attracted, nearly 49 percent indicated that there is nothing wrong with Lei's gift, while 39.5 percent indicated that he should have first donated money to his own country's education. More than 11 percent were undecided. Lei is the founder and managing partner of Hillhouse Capital Management, a Beijing-based investment fund overseeing an estimated $2.5 billion.","Gift is the largest ever pledged to Yale's management school .

"Boston (CNN) -- The ""Green Monster,"" a wall that looms 37 feet over left field in Fenway Park, may just about sum up the kind of pride Bostonians have for their city: It's old, immense and helps guard against cheap shots. So when two bombs tore through the crowds at the Boston Marathon last week, the city's response was so instinctive and full-throated that it made even the most ardent of Yankees fans a little proud. ""We pride ourselves on this family-community way of being,"" said Mariah MacFarlane, a North End resident tending bar downtown. ""Any person who attempts to disrupt that, there's no chance we're not going to take it personally."" Natives often tout their Boston bona fides when traveling outside the city, added resident Stephen Tang. And when there's trouble, ""everybody helps out."" That played out in the heart of the city last week as first responders rushed to help scores hurt in the smoldering aftermath of a rare terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The April 15 bombings killed three people and injured more than 170. From backpacks to 'flash-bangs': Boston's week of terror . But by nearly all accounts, it could have been much worse. ""Moments like these, terrible as they are, don't show our weakness; they show our strength,"" said Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley. Days later, Boston transformed into a virtual ghost town as authorities fanned out across the region and honed in on one of two surviving bombing suspects in a quiet suburb roughly 10 miles west of the attack. How to help in Boston . When the lockdown was lifted and the suspect in custody, residents poured out onto city streets to cheer on police and chant, ""We love Boston!"" ""It's in your blood,"" said Colleen Bergeron, a Massachusetts native who has since moved to Richmond, Virginia. ""Even my grandmother's a Red Sox fan."" A week later: Boston honors victims . ""I've lived all across the country and there's nothing like it,"" she added. The city, New England's biggest, anchors a half-ring of suburbs that make it the nation's 10th-largest metropolitan area. But Boston is the quintessential little big town, with a deep reservoir of history that includes often embellished tales of Samuel Adams and Paul Revere. Its brick-bound patchwork of ethnic enclaves and blue-collar neighborhoods give the place both a sense of community and a don't-mess-with-us air. Still, last week's attacks likely will leave an indelible impression on its time-honored traditions. On the third Monday of April every year dating back to 1897, Massachusetts has celebrated Patriot's Day with the running of the Boston Marathon. ""Here's what you usually do on marathon Monday,"" explained 30-year-old Damian Barreiro. ""You go the Red Sox game to catch a good buzz, and then you head over to the finish line to see everyone cross."" ""Now, it's a day of sadness and remembering."" While much of the region has since edged back to normal, a six-block area downtown remains a barricaded crime scene. But this week an ailing Mayor Thomas Menino, who's been a fixture in office for nearly two decades, defiantly stood from his wheelchair to announce plans to reopen Bolyston Street. ""It's time to move this city forward,"" he said. Did one brother brainwash the other?","Boston bartender: ""We pride ourselves on this family-community way of being""

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. (CareerBuilder.com)  -- Rachel Weingarten is hesitant to admit how long it's been since she took a ""real"" vacation. More than 31 percent of college-grad working men regularly put in 50 hours a week, according to a study. ""(It was) over eight years ago,"" the thirtysomething finally confesses. She travels often, but her getaways always turn into work, she says. ""Even if I'm going to a spa, I'm usually reviewing it."" Weingarten has plenty of work to keep her occupied. She's president of Brooklyn-based GTK Marketing Group, an author and the founder of a successful networking venture. ""I probably work about 10 hours a day, seven days a week,"" she says. The tally gets even higher when she's planning an event. Rachel Weingarten is a self-admitted workaholic -- and an insomniac. ""I really don't know how to unwind,"" she says. ""I'm always excited when I get jet lag, because it's the only time I get tired and forced to relax."" More than 31 percent of college-educated male workers regularly work more than 50 hours per week, according to a recent study from the University of California, Santa Barbara. For some, these long hours lead to burnout, but for others, they can become an addiction. Support groups like Workaholics Anonymous chapters are popping up all over the United States to help workers cope. Workaholism, or compulsive working, takes many forms, according to Workaholics Anonymous literature. These include: ""deriving our identity and self-esteem from what we do; keeping overly busy, neglecting our health, relationships and spirituality; seeing everything as work-related; having no desire to do anything (work avoidance or burnout); procrastinating; postponing vacations and rest; doing unnecessary work; perfectionism; avoiding intimacy and being controlling."" Constant working isn't always a bad thing. Weingarten admits her social life has suffered a bit, but her work schedule has helped advance her career. ""What I do is so much fun, it doesn't feel like work,"" she says. But not all compulsive workers share this passion for their jobs, says Kerry Sulkowicz, MD and founder and principal of The Boswell Group, a New York-based firm that provides business psychology consulting services. ""Workaholics, interestingly, don't necessarily enjoy their work,"" he says. ""To the contrary, they just feel compelled to be doing it all the time, and some even complain about it incessantly."" This compulsion can actually diminish productivity and sour work relationships, Sulkowicz warns. ""Workaholics tend to downplay the impact their habits have on those around them, including making peers and subordinates feel they have to maintain the same breakneck pace,"" he says. ""...They set a terrible example for maintaining a reasonable work-life balance."" Working constantly can also make an employee seem inefficient, says Ben Dattner, president of Dattner Consulting, LLC, a New York-based organizational consulting firm. Workers putting in constant face time may seem like they're more focused on effort than results, he says, and overworked managers could look like they can't delegate efficiently. It's not just office workers taking their jobs to the extreme. Jen Singer, author and creator of www.MommaSaid.net, a Forbes Best of the Web community for at-home moms, says she is a recovering workaholic herself: ""A stay-at-home mom-aholic."" Singer says during her children's early years, she tried to devote every waking hour to quality bonding or educational time with her children. ""Somehow, I thought that if I took time to fold the laundry or vacuum, it was taking precious time away from my children,"" she recalls. Eventually, Singer became so frazzled and exhausted she nodded off at Dragon Tales Live, a musical show held in an area with tens of thousands of screaming preschoolers. ""My head starting bobbing soon after the bubbly announcer asked, 'Do you know why we're so happy?' And I answered, 'Too much Prozac?'"" she recalls. ""I was so punchy that I was heckling a show for three-year-olds."" Singer found recovery in taking some time off while her husband took the kids, slowly teaching her kids to entertain themselves, and hiring a babysitter once a week to allow herself some time to write. Other workaholics may find respite by negotiating alternative work schedules, scheduling additional time with their families, or even exploring new career options. For more severe work issues, however, a support group may offer relief. For more information on Workaholics Anonymous, visit www.workaholics-anonymous.org. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009.

"(CNN) -- Federal agents can't account for more than 1,400 guns after a widely criticized operation aimed at tracing the flow of weapons to Mexican drug gangs, sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN. Of 2,020 guns involved in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives probe dubbed ""Operation Fast and Furious,"" 363 have been recovered in the United States and 227 have been recovered in Mexico. That leaves 1,430 guns unaccounted for, the sources said. The ATF operation was intended to build cases against Mexican drug cartels by allowing firearms to go from the United States into Mexico. The hope was by tracing the guns in Mexico, agents would be able to determine the structure of various cartels and then bring them down. The problem was that once the guns were allowed to ""walk,"" there was no way to recover them until they turned up at crime scenes. The operation has been widely criticized in Congress, with the chairman of a House committee that investigated the issue calling it ""felony stupid."" Rene Jaquez, the ATF's former attache in Mexico City, told CNN the operation never should have happened. ""Guns traditionally are just not allowed to leave the undercover operation for fear that it will enter into the criminal element and then be subsequently used in a crime at a later date,"" Jaquez said. ""And the last thing any one of us as law enforcement officers wants to have attributed to us is the death of an innocent individual by a gun that was lost during one of our operations."" But the ATF knowingly allowed individuals to purchase weapons that they knew would end up in the hands of criminals on both sides of the border. And when Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed in Arizona in December, two AK-47 variants that were allowed to ""walk"" under the program were found at the scene. In Mexico, the operation drew sharp criticism from top officials, who have long said that U.S. weapons are fueling the country's bloody drug war. And ATF agents in Arizona told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in June that they cringed every time they heard of a shooting after the program had been under way for some time. Over the past several months, questions have arisen regarding who in government knew about and sanctioned this operation. Even though the operation was run out of the ATF's field office in Phoenix, Jaquez said it is highly unlikely that officials at the Department of Justice in Washington were not informed. ""You have to understand, this program was in operation 18 months or more before we had any idea it existed,"" said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. ""And as I look back on it now, it was a, it's a big joke"" -- one Grassley says isn't so funny since the guns have turned up in the hands of criminals. In late June, President Barack Obama said ""appropriate action"" would be taken once an investigation of the program is completed. But so far, details about who knew what and when have been scarce. Last week, the embattled acting director of the ATF, Kenneth Melson, was interviewed by congressional investigators in a closed session. While the content of the interview remains confidential, Melson's personal attorney was at his side. Grassley has stated he plans on seeing this investigation to its conclusion. ""There's a basic principle of government here that the people in the Justice Department are forgetting -- the public's business should be public,"" he said.","""Operation Fast and Furious"" involved more than 2,000 guns, sources tell CNN .

"(CNN) -- Some observers have been careful not to name the violence in Syria a civil war, lest it become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Well, the child has to be called by its name. The violent turmoil has turned into an asymmetric civil war, where the Syrian military and pro-government militias on one hand and opposition forces on the other are using extreme violence, not only against each other but also against civilians suspected of being sympathetic to one camp or the other. The civil war is asymmetric because government forces are far better equipped, organized and mobilized than the opposition. The latest expression of the unfolding brutality of this civil war is the massacre of more than 100 unarmed civilians, half of whom were children, in the Sunni village of Houla, a center of anti-government activity. Reports are unclear as to whether the culprits were Syrian military units or pro-government militias, the Shabeeha, as they are called in Syria. The United Nations has also been careful not to point a finger at any side. But the U.N. stand is a result of Russian and Chinese support for the Syrian government, which compelled the Security Council to draft a diluted statement acceptable for all members of the council. But the kind of weapons, the systematic mode of operation and countless testimonies all point to Bashar al- Assad's regime, which is upping the ante in its war against the opposition forces and civilians suspected of being their supporters. The civil war is asymmetric for another reason. First, although the Syrian government has been put under extreme international pressure, it still receives unconditional logistical support from Iran and Hezbollah. Its diplomatic support from Russia and China -- some reports also indicate that Russia sends arm shipments to the Syrian army -- provides assistance for al-Assad's regime to carry on with its onslaught. The opposition, on the other hand, does not have the same unconditional international backing. Although Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have committed to support the opposition by arming its forces, their support is not yet a match to the kind of assistance provided by al-Assad's allies. Other international supporters of the opposition, including Western countries, have been reluctant to take the support a step further and commit themselves to the kind of military operation that brought down Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, or even less so, to the establishment of a humanitarian corridor along Syria's borders. As long as al-Assad continues to receive regional and international support, his regime will be able to stay in power and have the upper hand in this civil war. The civil war is asymmetric for a third reason. Al-Assad's regime still enjoys a cohesive leadership and is in full control of its military. Its objectives are also clear -- surviving politically and personally and maintaining control over the country. Conversely, Syrian opposition is divided into rival groups that do not share an organized agenda, have different objectives and have been unable to coordinate their efforts. So, nearly a year and a half after the start of the uprising, the opposition still does not pose a serious challenge to the regime. The U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan, who is in Damascus, was also careful not to put the blame on any side, again reflecting the political dynamics in the United Nations between supporters and opponents of al-Assad. Annan believes that his six-point plan is still the only workable road map to stop the violence. Because it is the only plan on the table, Annan is probably correct. But since the conflict in Syria has evolved into a full-fledged civil war, the questions are no longer about political reforms or cooperation between the opposition and the government to stop the violence and rebuild Syria. Rather it is the actual physical survival of al-Assad, his family and his supporters. It is also about a complete overhaul of the power structure that has been in place in Syria for more than 40 years. Given this bleak reality, the only way to put an end to the violence in Syria is by working with those who support al-Assad's regime from the outside. Russia and China need to be convinced that it is in their best interest to bring down the regime and that this is the only way to move forward in this crisis. Once this happens, Iran may also be willing to give up on its ally. Time is running out, with the beginning of spillover to Lebanon, as indicated in ethnic clashes last week in Tripoli tied to the strife in Syria. It is crucial for the two powers to recognize that with the global leadership that they claim to possess comes responsibility to interfere proactively in such cases of humanitarian crisis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Asher Kaufman.","Asher Kaufman: It's time to call turmoil in Syria a civil war, with extreme violence on each side .
But regime's forces are far better equipped and organized than the opposition, he says .
Kaufman: Bashar al-Assad gets heavy-duty support, especially from Russia and China .

"(CNN) -- In 2012, a strong Web presence must be part of every political hopeful's strategy. On the eve of Tuesday's Iowa caucuses, the first official contest of this year's presidential campaign, we take a look at how the seven Republican hopefuls are presenting themselves in the digital world of social media. This includes everything from tallying their Twitter followers and Facebook likes to comparing what kind of information they're most likely to share online. We also compare their scores on Klout, a site that aims to measure someone's influence based on their popularity on social media (a number some consider dubious, but that more folks online are starting to pay attention to). Of course, these numbers may have no bearing on how the candidates actually fare with Iowa caucusgoers. Some of the candidates may have departed the race by Wednesday night. And whoever survives the grueling process to presumably face President Barack Obama in November may change digital strategies multiple times between now and then. But for now, here's a snapshot of the current GOP field online (in alphabetical order; numbers current as of Monday evening): . Michele Bachmann . Twitter followers: 36,262 (a heartier 126,842 for her Congress account) Facebook page ""likes"": 460,290 . YouTube channel views: 1,323,985 . Klout score: 68 . Style: Bachmann tweets only sporadically from her Congress account but several times a day from her campaign account, which is full of upbeat messages and quotes from the candidate (""I fight, I fight hard, and I fight for you""). Both her Twitter feed and Facebook page -- which seems to exist just to promote her campaign -- are full of pics of her on the stump in Iowa, waving from her bus and greeting voters. Sample tweet: ""Happy New Year! In 2012, we're resolving to make Barack Obama a one-term President. What's your resolution?"" Noteworthy: A gallery of Facebook pics shows Bachmann attending the Iowa-Iowa State football game in true politician style -- wearing a jersey that says ""Iowa"" on one side and ""Iowa State"" on the other. In another photo, she has autographed a bald man's head. Newt Gingrich . Twitter followers: 1,385,524 . Facebook page ""likes"": 224,267 . YouTube channel views: 6,310,555 . Klout score: 78 . Style: Gingrich's Twitter feed is largely made up of routine posts like photos from campaign events, links to newspaper endorsements and the like. The feed is sprinkled with few posts that appear personal, though, thanking supporters and responding to follower's questions, for example. His Facebook page appears to strictly be official campaign posts. Sample tweet: ""Newt's economic plan is 'the most aggressive now, and it shows you how timid Romney's is in comparison.' http://bitly.com/sZSz38"" Noteworthy: Gingrich, whose Twitter follower count far exceeds any other GOP candidate, had a bit of a kerfuffle when a former staffer told reporters in August that the campaign had hired an agency to inflate that number with phony accounts. Gingrich denied it, although one analysis suggested that as few as 8% of his followers were actually human. Jon Huntsman . Twitter followers: 66,699 . Facebook page ""likes"": 30,785 . YouTube channel views: 635,793 . Klout score: 70 . Style: Thanks in part to tweets and video clips from his daughters, Huntsman has definitely injected some personality into his online presence. In August, after Perry made comments that appeared to call the theory of evolution into question, Huntsman tweeted: ""To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."" Sample tweet: ""Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. Family tradition to serve at a homeless shelter in Salt Lake City on Christmas day."" Noteworthy: Huntsman's best social-media moment might have been in late November, when he fielded questions from followers live on Twitter. The event got some unexpected attention when ""The Daily Show"" playfully pranked it, using its own Twitter account to urge ""Mad Men"" fans to tweet questions to star Jon Hamm using Huntsman's identifying hashtag -- #QforJon.

"(CNN) -- Looks like it could take awhile for new Twitter user Rupert Murdoch to get the hang of things. For starters, the 80-year-old media mogul, who signed up for Twitter over the New Year's holiday, might want to make sure the people he follows are real. As of Monday, the oft-controversial Murdoch was following a grand total of four people on the social networking site. One of them, at first glance, appears to be Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page. Except that it's not Larry Page but a parody account that's part of a university project. ""This is a fake account - part of a series created for @plaidavenger's class at Virginia Tech,"" the owner of the account tweeted Monday in reply to a follower asking about it after seeing an interaction with Murdoch. It wasn't clear Monday whether the News Corporation CEO was aware of the misunderstanding. The Twitter chat started with ""Plaid Larry Page"" welcoming the magnate to the site. ""Welcome @rupertmurdoch to Twitter! Could Google+ be next?"" he wrote Sunday. Murdoch's reply: ""Maybe soon, but I'm getting killed for fooling around here and friends frightened what I may really say!"" Indeed. Less than a day into his Twitter tenure, Murdoch had been publicly chastised by what appeared to be his wife (fellow Twitter newbie Wendi Deng) for a tweet saying that ""maybe Brits have too many holidays for [a] broke country."" He quickly backed down, deleting the tweet in question. [UPDATE: Both Twitter and the account owner have acknowledged that the Deng account is a fake not really run by her. Twitter had mistakenly given the account ""verified"" status shortly after it was created.] . Murdoch tweets support for Rick Santorum . It's hard to figure out what to make of Murdoch's other three follows, other than that he appears to be taking his new venture into Web and social-media culture seriously. Some have ventured it's part of a ""charm offensive"" after a year in which he was embroiled in a phone-hacking controversy at his now-defunct ""News of the World"" newspaper. Alan Sugar, a British magnate and reality-TV judge, as well as Twitter nemesis of CNN's own Piers Morgan, is one of them. The other two are Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Zynga CEO Mark Pincus -- the man behind such online time-killers as ""FarmVille"" and ""Mafia Wars.""","News Corporation's Rupert Murdoch starts Twitter life by following fake ""Larry Page""

"(CNN) -- The cries of pain turn into cheers of joy as the long-awaited finishing line finally looms on the horizon, stretching along the foot of an enormous desert dune. Mohamad Ahansal has already run more than 220 kilometers in the baking heat of the Sahara, but he still has the stamina to pull one last stunt. The Moroccan runner is met with applause and awe as he crosses the line with a joyous cartwheel to be crowned winner of this year's Marathon des Sables (MDS), billed as the world's toughest footrace. ""I'm really very happy with this victory,"" said Ahansal, whose triumph Friday means he's now won the men's iconic race for an astonishing five times. ""This edition has been very difficult as the competitors are increasingly strong and have a lot more experience with every passing year."" Ahansal's remarkable success was followed by the feat of Meghan Hicks, who took her first victory in the women's category. ""Winning an initial victory here is just incredible,"" said the American runner, who first took part in the ultra-marathon four years ago. Read this: 'The toughest race on Earth' Overall, 980 out of the initial 1,024 participants started the fifth leg of this year's MDS, a grueling adventure challenging participants to test their bodies and minds as they take on whipping sandstorms and blazing temperatures of up to 50C in their epic journey across the Southern Moroccan desert. Starting last Sunday, men and women of all ages from nearly 50 countries had to cover the equivalent of five and a half marathons over six stages -- including a non-stop leg of some 75 kilometers. To toughen the ordeal, competitors were provided with just their water supply and a tent to sleep in at night. They were also required to carry all their equipment for the duration of the ultra-marathon -- from food and sleeping gear to an anti-venom pump and glow sticks -- as they battled with weariness and dehydration whilst snaking their way past rolling dunes, steep-sided uplands, dried-up lakes and abandoned settlements in the hostile heat. Three runners have died in the 28 consecutive years the race has been taking place. Read this: Sahara explorer taming the desert . The roots of the MDS can be traced back to 1984, when Patrick Bauer decided to embark on a self-sufficient journey across the Algerian desert on foot, covering a distance of 350 kilometers over 12 days. That expedition had a major influence on the adventurous Frenchman, who realized that other people would be interested in taking on similar challenges. So in 1986 Bauer returned to Africa to organize the very first edition of the ultra marathon, completed that year by 23 pioneering runners. Twenty-eight years and more than 12,000 participants later, the MDS has grown to become a major endurance event whose model has been copied by several other races. ""Some runners come here to push back their limits and brave the extreme to write their tale,"" says Bauer. ""For a lot of participants, the Marathon des Sables is an opportunity to break with everyday life and feel a sense of timelessness. There is even a spiritual dimension, a quest for answers to what are at times very personal questions,"" he adds. ""The desert magnifies the soul."" Putting the race together requires months of preparations and a plethora of resources: 120,000 liters of mineral water, 6.5 kilometers of Elastoplast, 400 support staff, 270 berber and Saharan tents, 100 all-terrain vehicles, 52 medical staff, 23 buses, 19,000 compresses and 6,000 painkillers. In addition, the organizers have two helicopters, one Cessna plane and six commercial planes at their disposal. The MDS continued Saturday with its sixth and final, untimed, stage -- a 7.7 kilometer charity leg for UNICEF.","Mohamad Ahansal and Meghan Hicks are the winners of this year's Marathon des Sables .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A week after AEG's lawyer refused to concede for legal arguments that Michael Jackson is dead, he acknowledged the pop icon's death in court. The stipulation -- an agreement between two parties in a case that something is a given fact -- could save time in a trial that is expected to last several months. Michael Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter is liable for the pop icon's death because it negligently hired, retained and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death. While acknowledging Jackson died on June 25, 2009, AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam is still reluctant to stipulate what killed him and that Murray was the cause. Here's the courtroom exchange between Jackson lawyer Brian Panish and Putnam Wednesday: . Panish: ""I'm asking for a stipulation that Michael Jackson died and the cause of death. Are you willing to stipulate that Michael Jackson died?"" Putnam: ""Absolutely."" Panish: ""Are you willing to stipulate that the cause of his death was Dr. Murray?"" Putnam: ""That you've never asked before. Let me look at what that means."" Putnam refused to stipulate that Jackson was dead at a pretrial hearing last week, later explaining to CNN that he did not want to concede any elements that are needed to prove the case against AEG. AEG organized and hosted a massive public memorial service for Jackson at the Staples Center in Los Angeles 12 days after his death. Prosecutors said Jackson's death was caused by a fatal combination of the surgical anesthetic propofol and sedatives Murray gave him in a desperate effort to treat his insomnia. Detective: Money woes may have led doctor to ""break the rules"" Los Angeles Police Detective Orlando Martinez delivered testimony this week that Jackson lawyers believe boosted their argument that Murray's negligent treatment that killed Jackson was spurred by his deep financial trouble -- something they contend AEG executives should have known. Martinez, who led the department's probe of Jackson's death, testified that he suspected Murray's ""severely distressed"" financial situation -- including having his home in foreclosure, delinquent taxes, student-loan liens and unpaid child support -- could have led him to give Jackson unsafe treatments. One contention in the lawsuit is that the concert promoter should have known that Murray's financial stress could have been a problem for the doctor. After interviewing Murray two days after Jackson's death, Martinez's ""thinking at the moment was the crime was negligence,"" he testified. Martinez, who will return to the stand for a third day of testimony Thursday, showed documents that said Murray's Las Vegas home had lost $500,000 in value and was in foreclosure; his Las Vegas medical clinic faced eviction for non-payment of rent; he had a long list of loan defaults; and his expenses outweighed his income by $2,700 a month. Murray, who initially asked AEG for $5 million to work for a year as Jackson's personal physician, eventually agreed to take $150,000 a month. ""That's a lot of money for anyone,"" Martinez said. ""Seeing the scene and talking to him about what he had done and how he did it raised questions."" ""Focusing on the financial aspect may have been important for Dr. Murray's willingness to disregard his Hippocratic Oath for financial gain,"" he testified. What he learned about Murray's financial troubles led him ""to opine that he may have, for this easy money -- the $150,000 a month -- may break the rules, bend the rules, to do whatever he needed to do to get paid."" Dr. Christopher Rogers, the deputy medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Jackson, will be called to testify after that questioning of Martinez concludes Thursday. No court is scheduled for Friday.","AEG's lawyer refused to stipulate Michael Jackson is dead at a hearing last week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It was billed as a ""coming out party"" for one of the GOP's most promising young stars. Gov. Bobby Jindal seemed ""over-coached and over-rehearsed,"" CNN's Candy Crowley said. But after nearly universal criticism was heaped on Gov. Bobby Jindal's high-profile response to President Obama's address to Congress Tuesday night, the Louisiana Republican may be wishing he had stayed home. The criticisms came from all sides of the political spectrum, including from those in conservative circles who have promoted the 36-year-old governor as the GOP's most likely advocate to bring the party back from the brink of irrelevance. Republicans who have followed Jindal's upstart career from standout congressman to popular Louisiana governor know him to be an articulate and confident spokesman for the party's fundamental principles of limited government and fiscal responsibility.  Watch ""Is Jindal prime-time ready?"" » . But that's not the man many saw delivering the GOP's formal prime-time rebuttal to President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress. ""The Bobby Jindal you see on the Sunday shows was not the Bobby Jindal who showed up to give this speech,"" said CNN Senior Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. ""He seemed over-coached and over-rehearsed.""  Watch Jindal deliver the GOP response » . Many conservatives say Jindal appeared at best off-balance and at worst downright amateur in his national debut. ""Some conservative needs to start a campaign to fire whoever wrote this cheesy response and coached him to talk like this,"" wrote conservative columnist Amanda Carpenter on the popular social networking Web site Twitter. ""I can't watch."" ""He should never be allowed near a teleprompter again!"" declared the National Review's Kathryn Jean Lopez on Wednesday, while noting the governor had a much stronger performance on NBC's ""The Today Show"" the morning after his speech. Of course, to follow the oratorically skilled Obama in any setting is no enviable task, especially when the president had the benefit of incessant applause lines and the pomp-and-circumstance associated with a presidential address to Congress. The contrast between the settings couldn't be more stark, a challenge that even the most skilled politician would have difficulty confronting. While the president had the benefit of the ornate halls of Congress as his setting and numerous camera angles to give a sweeping view of the grand House Gallery, Jindal had to deliver his speech in a solitary room amid an almost deafening silence. ""So much about it is perception,"" said Eliot Shapiro, partner with EMS Communications, a firm that specializes in public speaking. ""The response is one person, face-to-face with a camera, and you can never generate the same kind of buzz and energy as when there are 500 people in a room applauding."" To be sure, an opposition party's response rarely wins wide praise: Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius' rebuttal last year was widely viewed as flat, and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine was panned for appearing particularly awkward in his 2006 rebuttal. ""Everybody thinks [the response] is a great launching pad,"" said CNN political contributor and White House veteran Ed Rollins, ""I wouldn't recommend to any of my clients, whatever you do don't take the honor."" The Louisiana governor may also be a victim of overhype and outsized expectations. Jindal's impressive resume and compelling background have been touted to make him a natural fit to compete against Obama and rescue a Republican Party that many fear is in danger of becoming confined to the South. But if conservatives are looking for Jindal to compete with the president stylistically, they should think again, sad Matt Lewis, a conservative blogger for AOL's Political Machine. ""Conservatives are looking for the conservative version Obama, a great orator,"" Lewis said. ""Bobby Jindal is many things -- an intellectual, a son of immigrants and a policy wonk. But if conservatives are looking for someone who is going toe-to-toe with Obama, he's the wrong guy."" iReport.com: Jindal's tone 'insulting' Some Republicans praised the content of the speech itself: namely a vigorous defense of conservative principles and an optimistic can-do outlook on the future. They also say the speech laid out a cogent rebuttal to the Democrats massive stimulus bill, articulated a way forward for the GOP and rightly refrained from overly criticizing the president himself. ""Jindal on Tuesday was likable, his personal story was compelling and he offered a positive vision of conservatism for America,"" Lewis said. Jindal can also take solace in the fact that in politics, there often is more than one chance to make a good first impression. After all, some of the most prominent politicians today floundered their first attempt in the national spotlight, including former President Bill Clinton, who was widely panned for his 32-minute speech at the 1988 Democratic Convention. The speech was immediately deemed disastrous by the political chattering class, and many predicted it would delay, perhaps even end, the his national ambitions. iReport.com: Jindal speech portrayed GOP as 'one trick pony' Four years later he was the Democratic nominee for president. ""Politicians often come back from moments such as these,"" Crowley said. ""It was perhaps not the most auspicious debut for Jindal on the national scene, but there is a lot of time left for rehabilitation.""","Critics say Jindal appeared at best off-balance, at worst downright amateur .

"(CNN) -- Whatever the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case, it will be viewed less as a determination of the shooter's guilt or innocence and more as a victory or loss for civil rights, George Zimmerman's lawyer fears. Mark O'Mara said he has been busy trying to dispel the racial overtones in the case by getting out more evidence about his client. His hope, he said, is that people will divorce a verdict from the real civil rights questions. The civil rights issue . ""The more people that consider an acquittal of George Zimmerman to be a loss for civil rights, the worse for civil rights,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan. A year ago, Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, shot Martin, an African-American teenager returning home after walking to a convenience store for a drink and a snack. Public documents pertaining to the case . Zimmerman said he acted in self-defense. Prosecutors say he ignored a police dispatcher's advice and was guilty of racial profiling. The case drew national attention because police did not bring charges against Zimmerman for more than a month after the shooting, saying the circumstances required further investigation. 'Absolutely no racism' O'Mara said the evidence will show that Zimmerman wasn't profiling. He said the FBI investigated the shooting and found ""absolutely no racism."" ""As a matter of fact, they found a lot of events and instances where George was what you might call an absolute nonracist,"" O'Mara said. On February 26, 2012, Martin was walking back to the Sanford, Florida, apartment of his father's fiancee after picking up some Skittles and an iced tea at 7-Eleven. That's when Zimmerman, then a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, spotted him walking through the complex. What happened between then and when Zimmerman fatally shot the teen is subject to dispute, one that could be settled by a jury starting June 10, when Zimmerman is set to go on trial on a second-degree murder charge. One night, two stories . The jury will have to decide between two starkly different versions of what happened that night. Zimmerman told police that the two exchanged words and Martin went after him. According to his account, the teen -- who was unarmed -- punched him, forced him to the ground, and slammed his head on a sidewalk. Letters to Zimmerman show split opinions . Zimmerman then shot Martin in self-defense, he claims. Martin's family and supporters, though, have long had a different story. One of the first to tell it was his father, Tracy Martin, who initially addressed reporters last March 8, trying to raise the case's profile and hike pressure on authorities. He and, soon, others suggested Zimmerman had targeted his son, an African-American youth wearing a hooded sweatshirt, because of his race. A year later . During a vigil in New York City on Tuesday night to mark the first anniversary of his son's death, Tracy Martin pledged to continue the fight for justice. ""This is the one year anniversary of his death. It's a somber day for us, but its also a day of peace for us, because we know as parents we've done all that we can do to make our children's lives right,"" he said. ""The wounds have not been healed, but we're working on healing the wounds."" Parents ready to let jury decide fate of son's killer . Up to the jury . O'Mara indicated at trial he will dissect the recording of Zimmerman's 911 call and point to evidence of the wounds Zimmerman said he suffered that night. ""I believe, you know, again, the evidence is what it is and that's for a jury to determine,"" O'Mara said. ""But a close reading or looking at that tape and all the evidence that followed, particularly George's injuries and Trayvon's lack of injuries but for the fatal gunshot, suggest that George did not begin the fight, did not continue the fight and actually was the victim of the attack rather than the other way around."" But a lawyer for the Martins said the fight against ""senseless gun violence"" will continue. ""He went home and slept in his bed the night he killed Trayvon,"" attorney Benjamin Crump said. ""And that wasn't equal justice."" Crump then led a chant of ""Hoodies up! Hoodies up!"" at the vigil. Martin family Website: Justice for Trayvon Martin .

"(CNN) -- In 2004, a bullet ripped away Connie Culp's nose, cheeks and upper jaw. Metal fragments sprayed into her skull and stripped her face away, leaving nothing except for her eyes, her chin and forehead. Culp, an Ohio mother of two, lost the mid-portion of her face after a gunshot wound in September 2004. Without her nose, she could not smell. She breathed through a tracheostomy  -- a surgical opening in her neck. Without lips, she could barely speak. But Tuesday, when Culp, 46, the first recipient of a face transplant in the United States, stepped in front of the cameras at a news conference, she was whole. In a soft voice, the Ohio mother of two repeatedly thanked the medical staff and the deceased donor whose nose, upper lip, cheekbones are now hers. ""I want to focus on the donor family that allowed me to have this Christmas present,"" she told reporters gathered at the Cleveland Clinic, where her surgery took place.  Watch Culp talk about the surgery » . In December, Culp underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery. Although the hospital announced the facial transplant at that time, the patient had remained anonymous until the news conference. During the surgery, tissue from a deceased donor's face was shaped and fitted into position. Multiple layers of tissue, bone, muscle and blood vessels, nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected. Culp received a nose, lower eyelids and upper lips, as doctors filled in the missing components of her face. Culp could not yet move her facial muscles to form a smile, but she laughed. ""Well, I got me my nose."" she quipped. Two months after the surgery, Culp was discharged from the hospital and returned home. Before the surgery, Culp could not eat solid foods. She could not taste. ""Connie can now enjoy her food,"" said Dr. Maria Siemionow, who led the transplant operation. ""She eats hamburgers and enjoys her pizzas, she's drinking coffee from the cup."" Her new face allows her to ""blend with society."" ""As you can see we have now a healthy person and happy person,"" Siemionow said. ""She has reduced dramatically her pain and also she's able to walk on the street without being called names."" Since the operation, doctors say Culp's new face has developed more movement. The new facial nerves are growing slowly, about an inch a month.  See before and after photos of Connie Culp » . ""While Connie can do several things now that she was unable to do in the past, as time goes on more and more of the facial nerves will grow,"" said Dr. Frank Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. ""She will become more animated."" For years, Culp lived ""in tremendous pain, chronic pain, over the entire time,"" said  Siemionow, director of plastic face transplant surgery research and head of microsurgery training at the hospital. Culp told a local television station in a 2008 interview that she had been shot in the face from just eight feet away in an attempted murder-suicide by her husband. In 2005, Culp came to the Cleveland Clinic for treatment. After 30 surgical procedures, none had restored her basic functions. ""The last resort and the last option was to consider face transplantation,"" said Siemionow. Transplant recipients have to take immunosuppressing, anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their life. After the hospital's surgeons, ethical committee members, psychiatry and psychology specialists met with Culp, they decided ""that Connie is the right patient,"" Siemionow said. Doctors involved in Culp's treatment said the surgery was not about aesthetics, but to restore Culp's basic abilities. ""We are actually overwhelmed by how great she's doing functionally,"" Siemionow said.  ""And I'm re-emphasizing that this is all about functional outcome. Someone who couldn't breathe through the nose, who couldn't eat solid foods, didn't have a palate or not able to drink from a cup. ... So if she can do all these functions that are taken for granted on a daily basis, this is amazing."" Although there is a risk Culp's body could still reject the transplant, the doctors said they have not seen such signs. Some critics say face transplants are unnecessary, because they are risky procedures involving a lifetime of immunosuppressants, that do not save a person's life, but improve an individual's appearance.  Previous face transplants performed in Europe and Asia generated controversy. A Chinese man whose face was disfigured in a bear attack died of unknown causes two years after receiving the face transplant. The fact that Culp regained some of her basic functions highlights that ""this is not cosmetic surgery in any sense of the word,"" said Dr. Eric Kodish, the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Bioethics. ""We remain convinced about the ethical justification for the face transplant in this and potentially in other cases in the future."" Ultimately, the face transplant affords an individual's ""right to decide what kind of life they want to live.""  Many with facial disfigurements are called names, can't go out in public or wear masks to hide their face, said Siemionow. In Culp's case, it was a matter of restoring basic physical abilities. ""If you can breathe through your nose in the spring in Cleveland, isn't that amazing?"" said Siemionow. Culp will require a few more cosmetic procedures, for example to remove excess skin from her face. Culp read a statement and did not take questions. She told reporters in the news conference that she had been shot and said, ""I don't want to go into it."" Then she asked the public to have empathy for people with facial disfigurements. ""When somebody don't look as pretty as you do, don't judge them,"" she said.  ""You don't know what might happen to you. Don't judge the people who don't look the same way as you do. You never know when it may be taken away from you.""","An Ohio woman who suffered gunshot wound is first U.S. face transplant recipient .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Be it Iran or North Korea, economic sanctions are a well-used weapon in the diplomatic arsenal for dealing with international disputes. But do they work? Workers at TOTAL's project in Burma unload pipe for the 1996 construction of the Yadana pipeline. Consider the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar. Ruled by the military since 1962, the state (formerly known as Burma) has been under sanctions from Western nations for more than a decade. Despite years of tightening economic pressure, military rule in Myanmar continues. ""I think sanctions have very little effect on the economy (of Myanmar) because they have very little in the way of international trade,"" said Sean Turnell, author of Fiery Dragons: Banks Moneylenders and Microfinance in Burma and an economics professor at Macquarie University in Australia. While the U.S., European Union and Australia have banned new investment, non-sanctioning countries are taking advantage of business opportunities in Myanmar, which is rich with natural resources like natural gas, timber, jade and rubies. China, Thailand, India and Singapore already have lucrative deals in place with Myanmar's military government.   Neighboring Thailand depends heavily on Myanmar's offshore natural gas and hydroelectric dams to provide power to the Thai population. China has signed a deal to build a natural gas pipeline from the west coast of Myanmar into western China. Thailand buys about 30 percent of its gas from Myanmar and uses gas to generate about two-thirds of its electricity.  Watch the history of Myanmar sanctions » . Despite the American and European sanctions currently in place, U.S.-based Chevron and French-based TOTAL are doing business in Myanmar today because their contracts were signed with Myanmar's military government before international pressure was tightened. The Yadana natural gas project, off the coast of Myanmar, involves three foreign firms: TOTAL, Chevron and the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT). TOTAL has the biggest investment with a 31% stake in the project. TOTAL told CNN it paid $250 million in taxes to the Myanmar government in 2008.   Chevron did not respond to repeated phone and email requests for comment on this story, but Chevron's Web site said the company's local community projects benefit the people of Myanmar. Western corporations have faced criticism for doing business in a country run by a government accused of human rights abuses. But these companies go to where the oil and gas lie -- often in unstable regions of the world. ""What we provide is a different example of work, of business and what good governance should be about,"" said Jean-Francois Lassalle, vice president of public affairs for Total. ""Our employees have benefits from social pensions, employee representation, holidays and good contracts. We function in Burma the same way we do in Europe. In that sense, we're trying to be an example."" The company employs 250 permanent and more than 600 subcontracted workers in Myanmar, Lassalle said. TOTAL provides free medicine and education to the local population, along with funding for hospitals and orphanages. The company estimates its community projects affect 50,000 people in Myanmar. Yet Myanmar remains one of the poorest countries in Asia. According to some estimates, more than 30 percent of the population live under the poverty line.   The military regime has suppressed democracy movements for the past several decades. Myanmar's most famous citizen, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi -- whose party won the majority of seats in the 1990 election -- has been kept under house arrest and is currently on trial for alleged violations of her detention. It is another indication of the military's tight grip on power, despite sanctions. Some experts say more should be done to hit the military regime where it hurts: their personal bank accounts. The Myanmar military elite have millions in overseas bank accounts, experts say. Southeast Asia expert Jamie Metzl of the non-profit Asia Society, said freezing personal assets of the military generals was a good idea but cautions it would be an uphill battle. Metzl believes that any such move would need the support of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which includes Thailand -- a major trade partner -- and Singapore. ""If sanctions [of freezing personal assets] were put in place and if ASEAN states including Singapore were on board, then conceivably, there could be a way to reach some of those assets, although the generals could move them elsewhere."" Metzl noted that ASEAN tends to favor a policy of engagement with Myanmar: In other words, soft diplomacy rather than the harsh bite of economic sanctions. Unless all countries play ball, it is clear that economic sanctions can only do so much.","China, Thailand, India, Singapore have lucrative deals with Myanmar's junta .

"New York (CNN) -- The winner of the $338 million Powerball jackpot paid $30,000 in back child support to the mother of three of his children Monday and had the warrant cleared during a hearing in a New Jersey family court. The payment clears Pedro Quezada's record, probation officials said during the hearing in Paterson. The warrant for Quezada was originally issued in 2009. He owed a total of $29,000 in child support, according to William Maer of the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. Quezada has five children, ages 5 to 23. It is not clear which children are covered by the payments or why he paid more than the original warrant required. Quezada told Family Court Judge Ernest Caposela that the children will now live with him. The judge warned Quezada that he'll be approached with a lot of investment offers, but the best investment would be in his children. ""This is now behind him, and his children are with him,"" said Paul Fernandez, Quezada's attorney, while leaving the courthouse Monday. ""He plans to do what's conservative and what's right for his family."" Every person who wins more than $600 in the lottery is checked for outstanding taxes, liens, child support payments and the like, according to Judith Drucker, public relations manager for the New Jersey Lottery. The funds owed are taken out of the final payment from the lottery winner, she added. Quezada has chosen a cash payment of his lottery prize that will amount to approximately $152 million after taxes. The $30,000 for the child support was taken from this sum.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- ""When the cat's away, the mice will play,"" is a term most people can relate to. When the manager is gone -- be it on vacation or just away from her desk -- some employees act like a teenager whose parents are out of town. They sneak out early or come in late. They chitchat with co-workers more frequently, usually about nonwork-related things. They make personal phone calls, take extra-long lunches -- heck, maybe they'll even enjoy a cocktail with their meal. Many employees do it -- but why? ""The answer is simple: It's a direct reflection of the boss's leadership. When a workplace isn't compelling to people -- where employees lack the desire and ability to be accountable for their own success -- misbehaving or slacking in the boss's absence is merely a mask for boredom. It's also important feedback for the boss: ""Raise your game,"" says Linda Galindo, a consultant specializing in individual and leadership accountability and the author of ""The 85% Solution: How Personal Accountability Guarantees Success."" We asked employees what they do when the boss isn't looking. They had some very entertaining stories: . ""At the time I was an assistant manager at Publix Supermarkets of Florida. Not content with the absolute misery of the hourly employees I was responsible for, I tried to inspire and entertain them. It worked; those under me had the highest productivity rate, got the best raises, were promoted faster and would do just about anything in the world for me because they knew I would do anything in my power for them. While this usually meant me working alongside them or personally training them for continuous quality improvements, it occasionally took on a slightly wilder side. Riding a motorcycle through the store aisles after closing, bowling for two-liter soda bottles with frozen turkeys, baseball in the stockroom, laser tag on the roof, contests to see who could catch the most shoplifters, hide and seek, a chess tournament, foot races, pizza parties, karate training, book club and a few hundred practical jokes.""  -- J.Olson . ""I've been building my life-coaching business for over a year while I've held down an executive assistant job from 9-6, Monday through Friday. The boss works across the street from the office that I'm at, and I spend the majority of my day (at least four hours, maybe more) building my coaching business -- posting to my blog, tweeting, communicating with clients, writing newsletters, even doing sessions during my lunch -- break -- you name it!. Thankfully it's paid -- off -- I'm giving notice in about a month to coach full-time.""  -- M.W. ""When I worked at this pizza shop, myself and two fellow employees would try to make each other laugh by making faces behind the boss. For example, I would be running the oven and the boss would be right next to me, so if I laughed I was screwed. So my friend X would be at the cook line, about 2 feet behind my boss so I can see him and the boss couldn't. And the facial expressions and motions he would make were hilarious. I must say I never [saw] him get caught.""  -- M.W. ""[My] story has more to do with a colleague who always has some very important thing to do at home/with the baby/his elderly mother-in-law, or has a sudden urgent need to deliver something to one of our member organizations that takes him out of the office for long stretches of time when the executive director is away. Recently, when the boss went on an extended holiday around Christmas/New Years, I and another colleague kept a spreadsheet of this slacker's arrivals, lunch breaks and departures, and then averaged out the numbers. All told, he was in the office an average of 5.5 hours a day while the boss was away. And, given all the adorable postings I see on Facebook from him every night, I imagine there's at least another hour in there taken up in Facebook upkeep and Web browsing.""  -- D.C. ""To be honest, before I became a boss and I worked for someone else, I did some of everything when the boss was a way.

""I know what one of my employees was doing when I was out of the office or at meetings. She was on Facebook! A few vendors told me about it privately, so I set out to bust her in the act. I invited her to become my Facebook friend, and she took the bait. Then, I wrote her up and attached the summary of the days and times she was commenting on her Facebook page, which was during business hours, while I was away. I don't particularly like writing up employees, but I loved this write up with the Facebook evidence attached!""  -- K.P.W . ""When our bosses aren't looking or even better when they walk away and leave their computers unlocked, someone sneaks in and sends a short e-mail to someone else in the office.

""I work in a small doctor's office with only one doctor. My office manager is very cool and participates in our slacking. When the doc or his wife are not around and we don't have any patients ... we make fun of the doc and his wife.

We also order food during lunch and eat it in the waiting room where we have a TV, computers and Internet (something that is not allowed during work hours). We snoop on the doc's computer. We always catch him on the Internet so we like to see what he does on the computer all the time. Needless to say, we found porn in his favorites! Also, his wife forgets to sign out of her e-mail (don't ask me why) but everyone uses the computers so we saw in her e-mail a message that read 'Thank you for signing up to lesbian porn.'""  -- Vanessa . ""For the past two years I've been self-employed, but before I started my company I always enjoyed reading news articles on the Internet during the day. My project managers often frowned upon us surfing the Internet during the day, but I found a creative way around this. At the beginning of the day I'd find interesting articles online and copy and paste the text into a word document. The word document had the company logo in the header, so if somebody walked by my cube it would appear that I was reading an official work-related document rather than the top sports news of the day.""  -- S.M.

Most of our team was out of town, including our boss. Apparently he thought he was going to be the only one in the office, and didn't even come in to work. He'd occasionally send out an email to make it seem like he was there. Finally, on the Wednesday after Christmas, he strolled in around 11:00 am. When he saw another team member was here, he turned beet red, and stammered how he thought she was out for the week. No one has said anything to our boss yet, but we are dying to.""  --J.J.

I pulled out the first pair (light blue thong), lifted up my skirt, and pulled the panties over my leggings. They were cute! Unfortunately, just at that moment my boss arrived at my door -- a 60-year-old man face to face with a 28-year-old female employee. It wasn't good.

"(CNN) -- Several years ago, Satwant Singh Kaleka put a large American flag in the front of his yard, raising the eyebrows of his children, who thought it might be considered an eyesore. Kaleka pointed out there were no homes nearby with flags, and he wanted to show that the United States was a land of opportunity, said his son, Amardeep Kaleka. The elder Kaleka, 65, served as president of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Milwaukee, scene of Sunday morning's mass shooting. He was one of six community members killed. Sikhs react to the Wisconsin temple shooting . ""He lived the American dream,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN. His father brought his family to the United States with little money but a strong work ethic in the early 1980s. The flag also was a form of protection for the family, Satwant Kaleka told them. It stood at half-staff Monday evening as the family grieved. The six killed in Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Kaleka; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and a woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. ""She was a good woman. She was a great mom,"" said Kaur's son, Harpreet Saini, 18. Kaur and her family immigrated to the United States eight years ago. ""She lived for us. She worked for us. Anything she did, it was for us,"" said her older son Kamal Saini, 20. ""If there wasn't enough to eat it was always us before she ate."" When Kaur was in the temple praying on Sunday, ""My aunt told her that there was a shooting going on outside, we need to get up and leave,"" said Kamal Saini. ""Rather than just getting up and leaving, she wanted to just bow down and pray for the last time and then get up and leave. She was just getting up. She was shot in the back."" Her dream was for her sons to be educated. ""She told us education is everything here,"" said Kamal Saini. His mother's death ""took my world away,"" he said. Both young men plan to pursue careers in law enforcement. ""I wanted her to see me in uniform,"" Kamal Saini said. Another victim, Suveg Singh, spent every day at the temple, said his granddaughter, Sandeep Khattra. ""He is always there, and he's with the community and anybody who is willing to listen,"" said Khattra. ""He educated them about our religion."" Belief blog: Who are Sikhs? The victim's family told CNN they will return to their temple. His son, Baljander Singh Khattra, said Suveg Singh was friendly and a ""very strong person."" Prakash Singh was a priest who recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children, said Justice Singh Khalsa, a temple member since the 1990s. Amardeep Kaleka said people called to tell him that his father saved many lives Sunday. The son said he was not surprised his father tried to stop the gunman at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. ""It's an amazing act of heroism, but it's also exactly who he was,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN Milwaukee affiliate WTMJ. ""There was no way in God's green Earth that he would allow somebody to come in and do that without trying his best to stop it."" Remembering the victims . Amardeep Kaleka said the FBI told him his father attacked the shooter in the lobby, resulting in a ""blood struggle."" A knife close to the victim's body showed blood on it, he said. ""From what we understand, he basically fought to the very end and suffered gunshot wounds while trying to take down the gunman,"" said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, Satwant's nephew. Satwant Kaleka's wife, Satpal, hid with several other women, telling them to remain quiet during the horrific incident. The gunman came into the kitchen and shot and wounded two women, she told CNN. ""I grabbed everybody and said run, run to the pantry."" Amardeep Kaleka said his father worked hard and was an honest man. ""I would love for them (the public) to know that he lived his life with the principles that he knew and he was taught at a young age. It made him highly successful in America."" President Barack Obama signed a proclamation honoring the victims, ordering that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff at federal facilities and buildings. Vigils were held Monday night, and one is set for Tuesday. The Sikh temple in Brookfield, northwest of Oak Creek, was to hold a candlelight vigil late Monday. The Rev. Paul Armstrong of Oak Creek Community United Methodist Church, site of a Monday evening prayer vigil, said the diverse array of faiths in the community have an opportunity to further deepen bonds.

"(CNN) -- Pakistanis headed to the polls Saturday for what could be a historic vote in terms of establishing the country's democratic bona fides as well as determining its future as it faces an array of issues from high unemployment to overpopulation and terrorism. This year's election has been hailed as one of the most democratic to date for a nation that for much of its 66-year existence has had military rulers. According to the Election Commission of Pakistan, there will be 36 million new voters among the 86 million registered to vote. Plus, more than double the number of candidates will be women, with 161 running versus the 64 who contested the 2008 poll, according to U.N. Women. Yet the economic, political and security situation in Pakistan isn't especially stable. Beyond high inflation and poverty rates, Pakistan has also seen spurts of violence, in some cases engineered by Islamic extremists. Since April, the Taliban in Pakistan has killed dozens of people in attacks on the three main political parties. Many urban voters and parties regard resurgent fundamentalism as one of the biggest threats to Pakistan. More than 600,000 security personnel have been deployed nationwide to safeguard the election, Information Minister Arif Nizami said Friday. Pakistan's army, which helped deliver 650 tons of ballots to polling stations, will have 75,000 troops out around the country, a military spokesman said. The governing Pakistan People's Party is led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated former prime minister and party leader Benazir Bhutto. But in an indication of the danger facing politicians, Bhutto Zardari won't be out for Saturday's vote because of security threats, according to Pakistan's Dawn newspaper. While his party became the first civilian government to complete a full five-year term -- the three governments after the death in 1988 of military strongman Zia ul-Haq were all brought down by the army -- its legacy is a deeply fractured country with a faltering economy. The PPP's main opposition comes from the Pakistan Muslim League-N, led by one of the country's leading industrialists and richest men, Nawaz Sharif. He's been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup and exiled when Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999. Viewed as a religious conservative, his party -- Pakistan's second largest -- believes it would have won elections in 2008 had the assassination of Bhutto not given a massive boost to the ruling PPP. Another contender for leadership is Imran Khan, the former star cricketer and heartthrob who leads the Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party. Not in contention is Musharraf, who returned in March from four years of self-imposed exile to take part in the elections. But he's been banned by a court from taking part in politics and his party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, has announced a boycott. Musharraf and his allies weren't the only ones upset with Pakistan's leadership ahead of the election. The New York Times ""strongly protested"" the expulsion of its Islamabad bureau chief -- an order that Declan Walsh received at 12:30 a.m. locally, at his home. The Committee to Protect Journalists joined the Times in slamming the move, with its Asia program coordinator Bob Dietz writing that the move suggests ""a need to intimidate foreign and local journalists."" ""The expulsion of Declan Walsh shows just how much the authorities fear independent media coverage,"" said Dietz. CNN's Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","Several parties jockey for leadership as Pakistanis head to polls .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A southern Baghdad marketplace became a scene of carnage for the second time in a month when a car bomb exploded Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and wounding 40, an Interior Ministry official said. Iraqis look at damage from a bombing at a produce market in Baghdad on Wednesday. A second car bomb killed two people in central Baghdad, while a roadside bomb wounded seven people on the city's east side, authorities reported. They were the latest in a string of attacks that are stoking fears of renewed warfare as U.S. troops prepare to withdraw from Iraqi cities. The deadliest of the three attacks came during the busy morning hours at the Alwat al-Rasheed produce market in the capital's Dora district. The market was the scene of one of seven attacks on April 6 that struck mainly Shiite Muslim districts of Baghdad.  Watch gutted cars after bombing » . One angry survivor of the blast blamed the continued American presence in Iraq for the violence. ""The Americans are responsible for what is happening,"" he told CNN. ""It is because of the occupation that every day we have killings and wounded people."" Another car bomb was later found in the market and safely detonated by a munitions team, the Interior Ministry said. That bomb was set to explode as emergency response teams arrived at the scene, officials said. Security at the market seemed to be lax. Vehicles in the area were not checked by security forces, who said they did not have equipment to detect explosives. In the central district of Karrada, where a bomb in a minibus killed two people Wednesday morning, news vendor Jumaa al-Qureishi said the latest bombings have left Iraqis ""afraid of a return to violence and terror."" ""The Iraqi army and police are still not ready to take over security responsibilities,"" al-Qureishi said. ""You can see that on the streets. People have no confidence in them. Car bombs are getting through checkpoints."" The third bomb exploded as a traffic police patrol was passing by. The blast wounded four officers and three civilians, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. The latest attacks follow an April uptick in violence that made it the deadliest month this year for Iraqi civilians and American troops. The U.S. military blames al Qaeda in Iraq for the attacks, which have been concentrated in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul, the jihadists' last urban stronghold. Recent attacks by the Sunni Arab jihadists have targeted Shiites in an attempt to rekindle the sectarian warfare that ravaged Iraq in 2006 and 2007, Perkins said. But the attacks have so far failed to generate retaliation by the country's Shiite majority. U.S. troops are slated to pull out of Iraqi cities at the end of June as part of an agreement that will see all American troops leave the country by the end of 2011. Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, the Iraqi military's spokesman in Baghdad, said the government remains determined to take over security for the cities when the Americans withdraw. But he said he would not paint a ""rosy picture"" of the situation Iraqi security forces face. ""The battle with what is left of the terrorist groups and former regime members is ongoing,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Police have identified a suspect in a fatal shooting and crash on the Las Vegas Strip that left three people dead. The suspect is 26-year-old Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Saturday in a press release. He is at large, though a black Range Rover police said he was driving early Thursday morning has been impounded. Police consider Harris to be armed and dangerous, and said in a statement that he has ""an extensive and violent criminal history."" He has several tattoos, including a small heart -shaped one below his right eye and a large one of an owl that covers his neck and part of his chest. Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati around 4:20 a.m. Thursday when someone in a Range Rover shot at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. Cherry, who was shot in the chest and arm, later died at a hospital. The Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, CNN affiliate KVVU said. A passenger in the taxi -- identified by the Clark County coroner's office as Sandra Sutton-Wasmund, 48, of Maple Valley, Washington -- also died. Her death and the deaths of Boldon and Cherry have been ruled homicides, according to the coroner's office. See an iReporter's video of the fire . The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws: Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Police collected surveillance video from the casinos. The shooting took place two blocks from where rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in 1996. The 27-year-old Cherry leaves behind three children, the oldest being 2 years old and the youngest just 2 months, his father said. Kenneth Cherry Sr. blasted news reports and social media messages about his son, claiming some had falsely characterized him as a person ""involved in the rap life."" He also disputed accounts that his son exchanged gunfire with the Range Rover's driver, saying he wasn't even armed at the time. ""I don't like the way that some of the media stations are portraying my son, because he was black, (like) he's a criminal,"" the elder Cherry told reporters. ""My son was a good boy.""

"(CNN) -- An explosion tore through an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, triggering a fire and injuring at least 11 people, authorities said. Rescue planes and helicopters are searching for at least two crew members who are still missing. The incident happened roughly 20 miles off the coast of Grand Isle, Louisiana, on a platform used for production, not drilling. About 28 gallons of fuel spilled into the region, according to Coast Guard Response Division Chief Ed Cubanski. A half-mile oil sheen reportedly stretched near the area. The 11 injured were airlifted off the platform, and nine additional crew members were safely evacuated off the platform, according to the Coast Guard. Four of the injured were taken to West Jefferson Medical Center in Louisiana where they were listed in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN. Once they stabilized, they were scheduled to be transferred to the Baton Rouge General Burn Center. The fire has been extinguished, according to a spokesman for Black Elk Energy, the Houston-based firm in charge of the platform. Federal authorities are investigating what triggered the explosion. The incident comes a day after the Justice Department announced that oil company BP would plead guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Family of killed rig workers react to BP settlement . The London-based oil giant BP has agreed to pay $4.5 billion in government penalties. Working in the oil industry is a dangerous business. The fatality rate for oil and gas workers is 15.8 deaths per 100,000 employees, according the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's nearly five times the national average. In 2011, there were 11 fatalities in the oil and gas industry, according to BLS. Most of the deaths were accidental, and criminal charges are never filed. The manslaughter charges brought against BP and two of its employees Thursday were rare. Only a handful of all workplace deaths in the United States result in criminal cases, according to the union AFL-CIO.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Democratic-controlled Senate passed legislation on Thursday extending the federal government's ability to borrow new money through mid-May, delaying a partisan standoff that some analysts warn could derail a fragile economic recovery. The bill, which passed in a 64-34 vote, cleared the Republican-run House of Representatives last week. It now advances to President Obama's desk to be signed into law. While the measure suspends Washington's $16.4 trillion debt ceiling through May 19, some budget analysts estimate it will give the U.S. Treasury the ability to meet all federal spending obligations through at least the end of July. In exchange for temporarily suspending the debt ceiling, the bill requires lawmakers in both chambers of Congress to pass a budget by mid-April or have their pay withheld. The requirement was added at the insistence of congressional Republicans, who wanted to highlight the failure of Senate Democrats to pass a budget resolution since 2009. Democrats note that such resolutions are not binding, and insist they would have been superseded by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which established budgetary restrictions for the last two fiscal years. Top Capitol Hill Democrats have been divided over the bill. Some railed against the pay withholding provision -- calling it a political gimmick -- while others supported the measure as a whole because it removes an immediate threat of default and at least temporarily divorces the debt ceiling from GOP spending cut demands. For their part, top Republicans have essentially conceded that a fight over raising the debt ceiling is not the best political avenue for achieving their twin deficit and spending reduction goals. Most political analysts believe that a 2011 debt ceiling fight, which led to the passage of the Budget Control Act, did not play to the GOP's political advantage. That partisan fight led to a downgrade in the gold-plated U.S. credit rating and was thought to have slowed the fragile economic recovery. Beyond the debt ceiling, the House and Senate will be forced to grapple shortly with two other polarizing budget-related deadlines. If Congress fails to act by March 1, a pending sequester will trigger roughly $1 trillion in new defense and non-defense cuts over the next decade -- cuts generally disliked on both sides of the aisle. In addition, federal funding for the current fiscal year is currently set to expire on March 27, forcing a government shutdown unless Congress can agree on at least a new temporary spending package.

And the stars in the audience were grooving along during a tribute to Bob Marley led by Bruno Mars, Rihanna, Sting, Ziggy and Damian Marley. Even Taylor Swift won us over when she took to the stage dressed as a ringmaster and surrounded by circus/carnival types to kick off the ceremony with her hit ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together."" Grammy coverage on Marquee . But one of the most eagerly awaited performances was: . 2) The return of Justin Timberlake to the stage . The Grammys went sepia-toned for Timberlake's performance of his new single ""Suit and Tie,"" which offered plenty of homage to the Rat Pack era with Timberlake in a tux with a bow tie and a big band with similarly suited backup singers billed as ""JT and the Tennessee Kids."" Jay-Z left his seat in the audience to run up on stage for his rap portion of the song. And Timberlake was cooler than cool as he segued into his new single ""Pusher Love Girl."" The performance marked the return of Timberlake to music since he took a four-year break to focus on acting. Welcome home JT. 3) LL Cool J pulls triple duty . Sure, he's a big acting star now, but don't forget that LL, aka James Todd Smith, got his start in the hip hop game. So it felt right when the Grammy host donned a knit cap, a black T-shirt and some subtle bling to perform alongside Chuck D, Travis Barker, Tom Morello and DJ Z-Trip. They closed out the show with ""Welcome to the Terrordome"" and shouted out the late Beastie Boy, Adam ""MCA"" Yauch, with a ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" chant. He also kept the audience informed of what folks were saying on social media, reading tweets and responding to some. The Grammys got its monies worth with him. 4) Adele didn't wear black . You can't not love her as she sings like an angel, is hilarious and just seems so normal. But just like you can always count on a practically flawless performance when she grabs the mic, we thought she was also a sure bet to show up in a black frock. It's kind of been like her thing. But no. When Adele took to the stage to claim the first award of the night, best pop solo performance for ""Set Fire to the Rain,"" she was wearing a flowery, red and black Valentino dress. New life as a mom and clearly new fashion choices: It was almost as surprising as Prince showing up to present Gotye and Kimbra the record of the year award for ""Somebody That I Used To Know. 5) The somewhat anticlimactic appearance of Chris Brown with Rihanna . Despite a few cutaways of the pair sitting together in the audience and Brown standing and clapping following her performance, seeing the two together was not as big a deal as the run up felt like it should be. Friday marked the fourth anniversary of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred before that year's Grammy ceremony. The pair had been a huge focus of this year's Grammys as fans waited to see if they would arrive at the ceremony together and how much ""togetherness"" they would exhibit. But in the end it felt like really no big deal. More surprising was six-time nominee Frank Ocean not winning any of the big awards he was up for. Ocean scored best urban contemporary album and shared best rap collaboration with Kanye West and Jay-Z for ""No Church in the Wild,"" but lost best new artist to Fun. and album of the year to Mumford & Sons. 55th Grammy Awards: The winners list . It was also more fun checking to see which artists ignored the reported Grammys memo asking them to cover up (we are looking at you and your rather exposed bosom Katy Perry). Jennifer Lopez even joked about it while presenting. ""As you can see I read the memo,"" Lopez said, wearing a black dress cut extremely high and fully exposing one leg.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Angry supporters of a Bangladesh Islamist party leader, given the death penalty for a war crimes conviction, continued clashes with police Friday in different districts, pushing the death toll to 45 since demonstrations began, police said. Dhaka, the capital, was largely peaceful except for small clashes. An uneasy calm prevailed there, with little traffic on the usually bustling city roads. ""We see a long tailback (traffic backup) here in Dhaka almost everyday, but a wave of fear forced people to stay back home at the weekend,"" said businessman Ariful Islam in the Dhanmondi residential area. A huge contingent of police and paramilitary troopers was deployed to ward off further violence. Anti-riot police guarded major mosques in Muslim majority Bangladesh on Friday, the weekly holiday. ""The situation is very much under control,"" the inspector general of Bangladesh police, Hassan Mahmood Khandker, told CNN. Besides the police, the Rapid Action Battalion and paramilitary troopers from Border Guards of Bangladesh patrolled. Road and rail communications were seriously disrupted as the protesters blocked highways and rail tracks in many places. Local police said at least three people were killed in Friday's violence outside Dhaka and five others injured on Thursday succumbed to their injuries. The 45 dead included five on-duty policemen, according to authorities. Police feared that the trouble might escalate next week because the Jamaat-e-Islami party announced a 48-hour general strike to begin Sunday. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party called a countrywide general strike on Wednesday in protest of what it said were ""the killings by police firing"" in the recent wave of unrest. Thirty-seven of the 45 dead were killed Thursday as Jamaat-e-Islami movement supporters clashed with police after the court sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayedee, one of the party's top leaders, to death. Sayedee, 73, was found guilty of eight counts out of 20 charges involving killings and rapes during the country's war of independence more than four decades ago and was sentenced to hang. Two International Crimes Tribunals set up by Bangladesh in 2010 were dealing with cases against 13 people. Separated with the help of India, Bangladesh had been the eastern part of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971 in a war that claimed between 1 million and 3 million lives. Jamaat-e-Islami opposed East Pakistan's struggle for independence and has decried what it calls a smear campaign against it. The movement called the trial against Sayedee politically motivated.","Clashes continue in country .

"(CNN) -- An airport in New Orleans has received approval to join the ranks of U.S. airports hosting flights to and from Cuba, officials said Wednesday. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport received permission from the Cuban government, ""the final step in the approval process for launching direct flight service from New Orleans to Cuba,"" airport officials said in a statement Wednesday. This year the U.S. government loosened restrictions, allowing the New Orleans airport and other international airports in the United States to apply to host flights to and from the island nation. Previously, charter flights to Cuba flew out of airports in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. ""We don't actually have the airplanes, but this just provides another opportunity, another avenue for private industry to build those flights or maybe citizens in the community to enjoy the benefits of those flights,"" airport spokeswoman Michelle Wilcut told CNN affiliate WGNO. Travel to Cuba from the airport ""will be restricted to 'purposeful' travel, the airport's statement said. That means passengers must have close relatives in Cuba, must be involved in the medical or agricultural business sectors, or must be traveling for educational or religious activities. Alina Fernandez of Cuba Travel USA in Metairie, Louisiana, told WGNO she was thrilled by what she called a historic decision. ""It's opening up ... my country, which makes me very happy,"" she said. ""I'm completely against the embargo. I think that's something that should have been removed. We've been having an embargo for over 50 years and there's been no change, so I think it's time for new change."" Earlier this year, the White House announced it would allow more academic, cultural and religious travel to Cuba, and would pave the way for more airports to service flights to Cuba. The longstanding U.S.-imposed trade embargo and travel restrictions on Cuba were intended to pressure the communist nation and its leaders to move toward democracy. This year the Department of Homeland Security announced its approval of 12 additional airports to provide passenger air service between the United States and Cuba, according to an August report from the Congressional Research Service. That brought the total number of airports approved to 15, the report said. ""It is uncertain how many of these airports actually will end up handling flights to and from Cuba,"" the report said. Direct flights to Havana from Tampa, Florida, began last month. On September 8, the first commercial flight between the two cities in nearly 50 years was sold out, Tampa International Airport said in a statement.","Plans for specific flights at the airport are still in the works .
This year the U.S. government said the airport could host Cuba flights .

"(CNN) -- When riots broke out in London on August 6, Charmaine Scott watched as a diverse group of people took hold of her hometown, smashing glass windows and setting buildings and automobiles ablaze. Amid the chaos, she noticed that talk about a racial backlash surged. The widespread discontent was being painted black by the media, even though it involved people of various races and ethnicities. ""The depiction of rioters has been disproportionately black and surprisingly female as well,"" said Scott, 31, as she described large-scale photos appearing in newspapers. ""There has been a pernicious representation of black women even in the riots, and an overall depriving image of black people in general."" The images and conversation that followed the three-day looting spree still remind Scott, a black woman of Caribbean descent, of the constant battle the black community faces in the UK: negative stereotypes brought on by inaccurate representation in the media. And she is not alone in believing that unfair depictions and constant scrutiny plague black women especially, belittling them in the public eye and forcing them into subordinate social positions. ""We can't talk about Jim Crow or apartheid. But like blacks globally, we are both visible and invisible,"" said Heidi Mirza, a professor at the University of London who teaches equalities studies in education. ""We are let into desegregated spaces and constantly watched. We remain totally ignored and excluded."" Stereotypes and pressures to 'act white' Mirza said she believes social barriers, discrimination and sexism keep some black women from succeeding. ""Minorities aspire and have bought into the American ideal that if you work hard, you can reach the top. But in Britain, it doesn't always work that way,"" said Mirza, author of ""Young, Female and Black."" With few black leaders in Parliament, the lack of representation in the social sphere is becoming more of a concern among black British females who consider themselves future mothers and the cornerstones of their society. ""In many of the places where I have worked, I was one of the few women of color, and I felt like I needed to play a certain role in order to fit in,"" said Kehinde Olarinmoye, 37, a former music industry professional of Nigerian descent. ""It was the only way to survive."" Zena Tuitt, a 37-year-old British Caribbean, said that for some, the black British experience is tainted by stereotypes that inhibit black women from being their true selves. ""The British stereotype of black women is that we are the loud ones and we are overly sexualized or eroticized,"" Tuitt said. ""We don't want to be seen as that, so in Britain we have a tendency to try to fit in and not stand out. In quite a conservative society, in order to get on, you need to fit in and to keep your head down."" Mirza said there is a strong social need ""to act white"" to be accepted. ""To some extent you have to put on a mask,"" she said. ""With the added dimension of gender and sexualization, black British women are seen as exotic and not as clever. If we 'act white,' we make the majority comfortable, and it becomes one of the few avenues to progress socially."" Black women's need to mold into the Eurocentric ideals of society, Tuitt said, stems from not having many positive black images or leaders to look up to in her country. ""Growing up, I was looking at people like Oprah Winfrey and women on 'The Cosby Show,' "" she said. ""Those examples of American women that I saw were all aspirational but were quite removed from my experience. Trying to role model these women created another struggle for me, because that type of woman wasn't recognizable in the UK."" This lack of public representation has been slowly coming to surface. Hannah Pool, a columnist in the UK, has heavily criticized the European beauty industry for its ignorance toward black women. ""Black women spend up to six times more on hair and makeup than their white counterparts, yet much of the industry still ignores us,"" Pool said in the 2010 issue of Grazia magazine. ""Many brands still don't have (foundation) bases suitable for anything darker than a light honey."" A 2009 Mintel report revealed that while 12% of the UK's population is nonwhite, ethnic beauty products represent just 1% of all new hair care, skin care and makeup launches. ""The ethnic market has a long way to go to be brought in line with the demographic makeup of the UK population,"" the report said. Mirza suggests the media is partially to blame. ""We are bombarded by white images here in the UK, and only Eurocentric forms of blackness are acceptable,"" she said. ""The UK has a Neolithic view of beauty that marginalizes the rest of black women, leaving them feeling unwanted on a shelf. ""Not only does it make you question your worth as a black British woman, but it also makes you wonder if that Old World theory of the British empire still holds true: to divide and conquer."" A champion for change . Simone Bresi-Ando, a black British woman of Ghanaian descent, has worked in the public relations field for nearly 20 years. Throughout her life, the 39-year-old said she has been aware of black women's minimal recognition in social arenas. ""We have had situations in our history where we've seen conducts that have been based on race or on unequal treatment of people from other races -- unfair health policies or lack of access to education,"" Bresi-Ando said. ""Some people don't like to use the word (racism); they like to call it something else. But in my eyes, it is what it is."" Bresi-Ando created the ""I'm Possible"" group in 2009 as a platform to help push black British women's voices into the public domain and highlight achievements for women of color in Britain. In June, Bresi-Ando hosted an event -- sponsored by Mizani cosmetics -- in which leading black figures in British society, including Bonnie Greer and Angie Le Mar, gathered for candid discussion of issues that affect black females. ""As black women, we are also partially responsible for what image is portrayed,"" said Desiree Banugo, a member of ""I'm Possible."" ""We have the opportunity to share and educate others about our culture and experience so they can see it for what it really is -- rather than from the voices of people who don't know, or from the media, which distorts what we're saying, thinking and how we live. ""The important thing in terms of diversity is to engage in the conversation on race. We are a long way off from being in a place where the issues are tackled head on."" African-American history, Bresi-Ando said, has had a strong impact on black British women in helping them realize the inner strength to band together in social movements and fight for racial and gender equality. When she created ""I'm Possible,"" she was inspired by two American enterprises -- ""Oprah's Legend Luncheon"" and ""Black Girls Rock"" -- that seek to recognize achievements made by minority women. ""I admire the black experience in the States because of the sense of community and ability to sing together from the same song sheet on important political issues,"" Bresi-Ando said. ""We lack those networks here, and we don't know how to connect in a positive way because we don't want to openly address the issue."" Social invisibility is a struggle that African-American women deal with as well. In a 2010 study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers found that African-American women are more likely than black men, white men and white women to go unnoticed by others in a group or social situation. But it is African-American women's ability to alter and push toward change that gives hope and inspires black British women, said Olarinmoye, the ex-music industry professional. ""I think the struggle is similar and different,"" Olarinmoye said, speaking of black America's history of social change from Harriet Tubman to the election of President Barack Obama. ""America has experienced racism a lot longer than we have. And (American) women have a platform set for women of color, and that's what we are trying to create. ""We've had to dig deep in order to find our history, and we've had to look up to African-Americans to see what models we can replicate here and give a British identity."" Bresi-Ando's project, the University of London's Mirza said, is one example of how black women can reclaim their image in Britain: by getting out there and talking about it. ""We have high rates of mental health issues amongst black women in Britain. We are underrepresented and underfunded. But it stems from a nonspoken history that lives in our communities past and present,"" Mirza said. ""We need to talk about this skeletal past, the racism, the misrepresentation. We need to build networks that will reinforce and promote social ideals. We need to invest the knowledge into our daughters to make sure the lessons we learn do not vanish as we move ahead."" Bresi-Ando agrees. ""It may take time and may be difficult,"" she said. ""But my American sisters have shown me that it can be done.""","Some black women feel like they are seen, but not heard in UK society .
They say they're underrepresented in the workplace, social arenas .
The media is partially to blame, one expert says .
Some British women view African-American women as a model for change ."
"(CNN) -- YouTube on Wednesday announced it was restricting access to a controversial video that has been blamed for inciting violence in Libya and protests in Egypt. The video, a film trailer mocking the Muslim faith, will not be accessible via YouTube in Libya and Egypt, the company said in a statement issued to CNN. ""We work hard to create a community everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different opinions,"" YouTube said by e-mail. ""This can be a challenge because what's OK in one country can be offensive elsewhere. ""This video -- which is widely available on the Web -- is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries. ""Our hearts are with the families of the people murdered in yesterday's attack in Libya."" The video, a 14-minute movie trailer that many view as an insult to Muslims and their faith, was blamed for setting off a wave of violence in Libya and protests in Egypt on Tuesday and Wednesday. An attack on a U.S. consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi left the U.S. ambassador and three other embassy staffers dead. President Obama strongly condemned the violence, calling the attack ""outrageous."" Mystery surrounds film cited in attacks . Afghanistan banned YouTube in response to the video, according to reports. ""We have been told to shut down YouTube to the Afghan public until the video is taken down,"" Aimal Marjan, from the country's ministry of information and technology, told Reuters. The events raise what's becoming a familiar question at a time when the Internet has become the world's major medium of communication: When should websites that display user-generated content take down material that is deemed to be offensive? This sort of debate comes up with some frequency. Some people were outraged this year when Facebook decided not to take down pages that supported the man accused of opening fire on moviegoers in a Colorado theater. YouTube also has been criticized for taking down videos showing police brutality and other acts of violence that could have political or journalistic significance. Some of those videos were reposted by the site after further review. YouTube's online guidelines ban pornography and ""graphic or gratuitous violence"" and ask the people who upload videos to respect copyright laws. On the subject of controversial speech, the site says, ""We encourage free speech and defend everyone's right to express unpopular points of view. But we don't permit hate speech (speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, and sexual orientation/gender identity)."" Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said YouTube should not take down the video worldwide but should consider blocking it in specific countries where it's causing violence. Reaction to anti-Islam film fuels debate on free speech versus hate speech . ""Is it good in the short term? Probably not,"" she said of leaving the video online. ""But for the long term and what it means for corporate free expression, yes, I think it's good to keep it up. It's a difficult balance."" The video could been seen as having news and documentary value, she said, potentially putting it in a category of videos that are allowed to stay on YouTube even though they show, for example, drug use or violence -- acts that would violate YouTube's terms if they weren't newsworthy. This clip probably wouldn't break U.S. rules about inciting violence, York said, because it does not directly call for people to engage in violent acts. In a 2010 lecture at a human rights conference, YouTube's Victoria Grand offers further details on how the site policies itself. With 72 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every minute, the site relies on its audience, employees and computer programs to address and sometimes delete content that is deemed to violate its terms. To be removed from YouTube, a video first must be flagged by one of the site's users. Computers scan the clip for certain traits -- the first scan, she said, is for flesh-colored pixels -- and then prioritize the videos in a queue, Grand said. A group of YouTube employees, who are positioned all over the world, then reviews the queue of flagged and computer-prioritized videos to judge them against YouTube policy. ""Their job is to spend every single day looking at a queue of what I would define as the dark underbelly of the Internet,"" Grand said in a video posted by the group Global Voices. ""So you're going to see a lot of masturbation videos in that queue; you're going to see animal abuse. You're going to see some pretty, pretty horrendous things. I would say the vast majority of flags we get are for things like pornography."" The film in question is considered offensive to Muslims and depicts the Muslim prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and killer. The video had about 55,000 views as of 11 a.m. ET Wednesday. It had a mostly unfavorable rating on YouTube, with more than 8,000 ""dislikes"" to 2,600 ""likes."" Nearly 9,000 people had commented on the video, and several versions of it appeared to have been uploaded to YouTube. The 2-month-old film trailer is in English, but it has been dubbed into Arabic. The New York Times reports that an Arabic-language version of the video was taken down from YouTube, apparently for reasons of copyright infringement. New York magazine called the video ""absurd"" and ""Islamophobic."" The video also reportedly has been shown by means other than YouTube. Part of the film was broadcast on Egyptian TV, according to the Times. Witnessing protests in Libya or Egypt?

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer's preparations for the French Open came to a shuddering halt after he was stunned by Japan's Kei Nishikori at the Madrid Open Thursday. World No.2 Federer, who was playing his first tournament since losing to Rafael Nadal at Indian Wells in March, suffered a 6-4 1-6 6-2 third round defeat by the 14th seed. The Swiss ace follows World No.1 Novak Djokovic in crashing out of the tournament with the Serb star losing to Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov on Tuesday . Federer, 31, has won 17 grand slam titles during his illustrious career, but has managed just one win at Roland Garros. This defeat will see him slip down below Andy Murray to number three in the world and Federer admits his performance came as something as a surprise. ""Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with my play,"" he told a press conference following the match. ""I'm not sure how well Kei thought he played. I didn't think he had to play his very best either, which is even more disappointing. ""It doesn't change my mindset going forward. I'm going to go back to the practice court, train hard, and make sure I don't have these kind of days anymore."" But while the start of the French Open is less than three weeks away, Federer is adamant this latest setback will not affect his chances of glory at Roland Garros. He told reporters: ""We're not playing for the French Open. This is early. We're weeks away from the French Open. ""It's nice to have the French Open as a tournament on the calendar but not everything is sacrificed for that. ""For that particular player or for the media or the fans the French Open is the ultimate thing and the only thing they care about. ""Then clearly Madrid is the lead up tournament. ""That's not how I see it. For me, every tournament counts. ""So I'm as disappointed losing here as the French Open. There is no difference really."" But for Nishikori, who lost his only previous meeting in straight sets against Federer in Basel two years ago, this was possibly the greatest win of his career. ""He's my idol,"" the 23-year-old told reporters after seeing off Federer. ""Beating him was one of my career objectives. ""It's fantastic that this happened on a clay court. As you know, it's not my best surface."" ""I lost second or third round last week and I was struggling a little bit so I didn't have much confidence. ""But I played two good matches in the first and second round and to beat Roger, well, I'll need a couple days to celebrate."" Nishikori will play Spanish qualifier Pablo Andujar for a place in the semifinal. Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal is into the last eight after defeating Russia Mikhail Youzhny 6-2 6-3. The World No.5, who lost out in the third round last year, has won four titles since his return to action in February following a seven-month injury layoff. Nadal, who is hoping to win an eighth French Open crown in Paris, told Spanish television that he was happy with his current level of fitness. ""We are just doing what we can every day,"" the 26-year-old told La Sexta. ""I am in the quarterfinals and it makes me very happy to have another chance to play in Madrid in front of these magnificent fans. ""It's not the time to be talking more than necessary. I will try to enjoy every moment as much as possible."" Meanwhile, sixth seed Tomas Berdych sealed a quarterfinal place with a 7-6 7-5 win over Kevin Anderson. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, seeded seventh, came from a set down to defeat Spain's Fernando Verdasco 4-6 6-3 6-2. But there was bad news for Djokovic's conqueror, Dimitrov, who was beaten 3-6 6-4 6-1 by Stanislas Wawrinka. In the women's side of the tournament, World No.1 Serena Williams cruised into the last eight with 6-3 6-1 win over Maria Kirilenko. Williams, who suffered a shock opening round defeat at last year's French Open, has now won eight straight matches on clay this season. ""I think more than anything I learned not to become overconfident,"" she told reporters. ""I think I'll just take that with me to the French this year. I think I was a little confident last year and I felt really good; this year I'm going to take every moment like it's my last."" Maria Sharapova booked her place in the quarterfinals with a comfortable 6-2 7-5 win over Germany's Sabine Lisicki. And Sharapova, currently ranked second in the world, believes she's in great form going into the defense of her title at Roland Garros. ""I think when you win a Grand Slam on a surface, it would be pretty mean of me to say that I'm not comfortable on the surface,"" she told reporters. ""It took me many years to get to the level of where I am today. It certainly didn't happen overnight. ""I worked extremely hard on getting stronger and recovering better, moving better on the court, giving myself a better position on the court, especially after being on the defensive and trying to play aggressively as I always do on quicker surfaces.""","Kei Nishikori defeated Roger Federer in quarterfinal of Madrid Open .

"(CNN) -- HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways. The One is a top-notch, beautifully designed handset packed with the best specs and a ton of compelling features. It also runs a unique, fresh take on Google's Android operating system. And it's available in exactly the same configuration across the three major U.S. carriers. This is the phone that could close the gap between HTC's flagship and those from Apple and Samsung. We spent a couple of hours with the One before its big unveiling in New York today, and were thoroughly impressed by the luxurious materials used on the handset, the expert build quality holding it all together, and a slew of thoughtfully crafted software features. Although the phone carries the branding established last year with the One X, One S, and other HTC phones, the One amounts to a reboot of the company's vision for Android. The One X, HTC's previous flagship, won critical praise, but as an AT&T exclusive it failed to generate the sales the company had hoped for. ""We think about the One X and we think 'Wow, it was big, and it was one of the best phones we've ever done,'"" Scott Croyle, HTC's vice president of design, said. ""But if I were to compare it to, say, other stuff that was out there, I wouldn't say it was a step-change different."" The company set out to build a phone that could surpass, not just meet, the performance and quality of the Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy SIII. So it put a huge effort into nailing the Sense user interface, packing the phone with the best tech and broadening its reach across carriers. Sense 4, the previous generation of HTC's Android customization, has been thrown out. Every aspect of Sense has been rethought and redesigned. The result is a slick, clean user interface, full of artful icons that match the flat, understated look Google has been trying to push with its own stock version of Android. And there's a focus in the new Sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive — such as sifting through social media and news apps, or snapping photos and video. ""I think we came to this recognition that, 'Wow, there are these two other companies that are going to spend a lot more money than HTC,'"" Croyle said. ""This is the reality of the business. They have much deeper pockets and they can carpet bomb the industry and they have a tremendous amount of inertia there, particularly with Apple in the U.S. So, for the One, we really had to get it right, we really had to just go for it."" While it's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the One and think of the iPhone 5, the One is far from a copycat product. It has a massive — and gorgeous — 4.7-inch 1080p display with a pixel density of 468 pixels per inch. As with nearly every flagship phone out there nowadays, pixels are indiscernible on the One's generous display. Colors look vivid and crisp as well. The touchscreen dominates the front of the One, with aluminum capping each end. Rows of pinholes are machined into each strip of aluminum, serving as pathways for sound coming from a set of dual front-facing speakers. Every phone speaker we've ever heard has sounded like hell. While the One won't replace your Jambox anytime soon, its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we've heard from a phone. Inside, the One features a 1.7GHz, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, 2GB of RAM, and NFC chip, Bluetooth 4.0 and connectivity to both HSPA and LTE networks. Everything is packed into a sleek, aluminum unibody — shipping in either silver or black — that features a subtly curved back with inlaid antennas. The One weighs 5.04 ounces, and is just 0.36 inches thick. The One will also sports a beefed up camera, with a ton of photo and video features — which are so plentiful we've written a separate story focusing on the One's camera. Along with all new hardware, HTC is using the One to introduce an all new take on Android. Sense 4, HTC's last skin, was among the best versions of Google's mobile OS thanks to its simplicity and gimmick-free implementation. The latest version — now just called Sense — brings users from a lock screen to a new Flipboard-like app called BlinkFeed, which displays a feed of information, stories, photos and video from various sources of your choosing. HTC has worked in integration with a few news outlets, so news stories by topic or by outlet can show up in your BlinkFeed. And the app can be connected to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and other social networks as well. See a news story you're interested in reading? Just tap the tile in your feed and you're taken to a view that shows the story and its accompanying artwork in a presentation that makes reading clean and easy — again, very much like Flipboard, Pocket, Pulse and other ""read it later"" services. Tap a tweet or post from Facebook you'll be launched into that corresponding social network's Android app. You can even set up BlinkFeed to pipe in your photos and videos. Everything is displayed in reverse chronological order, just like your Twitter timeline, Facebook feed and everything else that's sorted online. While BlinkFeed is a pre-installed app, it's also the default view any One user will see once they unlock their phone. If you want to get to a traditional Android homescreen view — with apps, widgets and folders of apps — just swipe in from the right on BlinkFeed and Android as you know it will appear. ""If you want regular Android, it's there,"" Croyle said. ""But, everybody's snacking on information, whether it's from their social networks or some news source that they're just interested in. So [BlinkFeed] really is geared around that recognition of how people are actually using their phones."" AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile will sell the One, along with many smaller regional telecom companies. The significance of this can't be overstated. Currently, only Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S III are offered as widely. The iPhone is sold through AT&T, Sprint and Verizion — and it's on it's way to T-Mobile. The S III is sold by all four of the nation's top carriers. All too often, a great phone, like last year's One X, was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones. The fact that the One is joining it's biggest rivals in a new paradigm that bucks the idea of exclusive phones is a good thing for HTC — because they get to sell their best device in more places — and consumers — because you have more choice when you go to buy your next phone.

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Soldier. Singer. Skinhead. Investigators spent Monday trying to figure out what led 40-year-old Wade Michael Page from repairing missiles for the Army to a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, where he was killed by police at the end of a Sunday morning rampage. The shaven-headed Page, whose tattoos included the Celtic cross adopted by white supremacist groups, had been the front man for a white-power rock band called ""End Apathy"" for several years. Two former neighbors identified him from photos on the band's MySpace page. His path appears to have taken him from Colorado to Milwaukee, where he enlisted in the Army in 1992; back to Colorado; to North Carolina, where he started the band; and then back to the Milwaukee area, where he had been ""a short time"" before the shootings, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards told reporters Monday. The Army trained Page first as a mechanic for the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system, then as a psychological warfare specialist. He rose to the rank of sergeant before losing a stripe due to ""patterns of misconduct,"" according to a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity. In October 1998, he received a general discharge under honorable conditions, the official said. Community attempts to cope after Wisconsin shooting deaths . Christopher Robillard of Oregon, who described Page as ""my closest friend"" in the service more than a decade ago, said Page was pushed out of the military for showing up to formation drunk. He described Page as ""a very kind, very smart individual -- loved his friends. One of those guys with a soft spot."" But even then, Page ""was involved with white supremacy,"" Robillard said. ""He would talk about the racial holy war, like he wanted it to come,"" Robillard said. ""But to me, he didn't seem like the type of person to go out and hurt people."" Later Monday, Robillard told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that Page likely sought attention to his beliefs ""because he was always the loner type of person. Even in a group of people, he would be off alone."" Teresa Carlson, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Milwaukee office, said investigators have been told Page may have been involved with the white supremacist movement, but that hadn't been confirmed. No motive for Sunday's attack had been established, but the FBI was investigating whether the killings at the Sikh temple were an act of domestic terrorism, she said. Page moved back to Denver after his discharge, where he had a tough time in civilian life ""and was basically living on the street,"" Robillard said. It was during that period that Page joined a ""racist band"" and started to get his body inked, his Army buddy told CNN. Remembering the victims . ""I asked him why he was aligning himself with this stuff,"" Robillard said. ""He really didn't answer. He would duck it."" Page had a girlfriend who left him for another member of the band, which then kicked him out, Robillard said. The last time they saw each other -- more than 10 years ago -- Robillard said Page was on a motorcycle trip across the country. It was a trip Page recounted in 2010, in an online interview about his band End Apathy. He founded it in in the small town of Nashville in eastern North Carolina, where he ended up after bouncing around the country from California to West Virginia. ""I am originally from Colorado and had always been independent, but back in 2000 I set out to get involved and wanted to basically start over,"" he said. The band put out at least two recordings through a label that promoted them on the neo-Nazi website Stormfront. In a 2010 interview posted online, Page said his lyrics ""vary from sociological issues, religion, and how the value of human life has been degraded by being submissive to tyranny and hypocrisy that we are subjugated to."" End Apathy played gigs in North Carolina and in the Midwest, he said. While Page shared the stage with many similar bands, he wasn't a movement leader and doesn't appear to have been involved in any criminal acts, said Mark Potok, who tracks hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Alabama. White supremacist groups still strong . Nevertheless, Potok called Page ""a neo-Nazi skinhead in the very thick of the white supremacist movement."" In a statement posted on its website Monday, the band's imprint, Label 56, said it had removed ""all images and products related to End Apathy."" ""We have worked hard over the years to promote a positive image and have posted many articles encouraging people to take a positive path in life, to abstain from drugs, alcohol, and just general behavior that can affect ones life negatively,"" the company said. ""We do not wish to profit from this tragedy financially or with publicity,"" it added. ""In closing, please do not take what Wade did as honorable or respectable and please do not think we are all like that."" It wasn't clear Monday what brought Page back to Wisconsin, where he lived first with a girlfriend, then on his own. David Brown, a former neighbor in a South Milwaukee apartment building, said Page would frequently lift weights and occasionally leave home with a guitar. But every time he tried to talk to his neighbor, Brown said, he would just grunt and walk on by. Who are Sikhs and what do they believe? And a former landlord, Kurt Weins, told CNN that Page worked nights at a welding supply business and had recently broken up with a girlfriend when he signed his lease. ""He was quiet. I saw no violence in him,"" said Weins, who has been questioned by federal agents since Sunday's killings. ""The feds asked me how he paid, whether he had weapons. I had no idea he had weapons,"" he said. Robillard said he knows Page's name will now be inextricably linked with hate and bloodshed, ""but that's not how I remember him."" ""It's the racial holy war talk I always took as something he would vent about, and not act on it,"" he said. ""I never pictured him as someone who would do anything. I thought maybe he was just saying it for attention."" Share your thoughts and remembrances for the victims on CNN iReport.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The running mate of one of Kenya's two frontrunners in the presidential election said Thursday that the vote tallying should stop because it is '""doctored"" and lacks integrity. A day before the announcement, election officials had said the new electronic voting system broke down, snarling the process and forcing the tallying to be done manually. The running mate, Kalonzo Musyoka, described the transmission system as a failure. He said his Cord Coalition has evidence the vote is doctored, and his coalition is looking at other options, including a court injunction. Musyoka, who is the running mate of Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, said the announcement is not a call for protests and urged their supporters to maintain peace. Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta is ahead of Musyoka's boss in the vote count three days after the election Monday. Kenyatta, son of Kenya's founding father, has maintained a lead for the most part since polls closed. Odinga's team is not the only one expressing discontent. Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition on Wednesday accused Britain of interfering in the election, according to Kenyan media. The accusations prompted the UK Foreign Office to release a statement Wednesday. ""Claims of British interference, including by the High Commission, in the electoral process are entirely false and misleading,"" the statement said. Election officials have urged citizens to be calm and patient, hoping to avoid tension and distrust in the system, which contributed to post-election violence in December 2007. At the time, the nation plunged into ethnic violence after Odinga disputed results that declared the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki, as the winner, alleging the election had been rigged. At the time, protesters took to the streets, where supporters of both camps fought one another. More than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced -- the worst violence since the nation gained independence from Britain in 1963. Those clashes ended with the formation of a power-sharing government with Kibaki as president and Odinga as prime minister. Kenya's election carries significance far beyond its borders. As the largest economy in East Africa, it is a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent and provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudan and South Sudan. Kenya is also a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region and has remained relatively peaceful amid civil wars in neighboring nations.","Running mate of Raila Odinga says transmission system a failure .

"MODESTO, California (CNN) -- The photograph became an icon of the Great Depression: a migrant mother with her children burying their faces in her shoulder. Katherine McIntosh was 4 years old when the photo was snapped. She said it brought shame -- and determination -- to her family. Katherine McIntosh holds the photograph taken with her mother in 1936. ""I wanted to make sure I never lived like that again,"" says McIntosh, who turns 77 on Saturday. ""We all worked hard and we all had good jobs and we all stayed with it. When we got a home, we stayed with it."" McIntosh is the girl to the left of her mother when you look at the photograph. The picture is best known as ""Migrant Mother,"" a black-and-white photo taken in February or March 1936 by Dorothea Lange of Florence Owens Thompson, then 32, and her children. Lange was traveling through Nipomo, California, taking photographs of migrant farm workers for the Resettlement Administration. At the time, Thompson had seven children who worked with her in the fields.  See Lange's photos of the migrant family » . ""She asked my mother if she could take her picture -- that ... her name would never be published, but it was to help the people in the plight that we were all in, the hard times,"" McIntosh says. ""So mother let her take the picture, because she thought it would help.""  Watch a Depression-era daughter's recollections » . The next morning, the photo was printed in a local paper, but by then the family had already moved on to another farm, McIntosh says. ""The picture came out in the paper to show the people what hard times was. People was starving in that camp. There was no food,"" she says. ""We were ashamed of it. We didn't want no one to know who we were."" The photograph helped define the Great Depression, yet McIntosh says her mom didn't let it define her, although the picture ""was always talked about in our family."" ""It always stayed with her. She always wanted a better life, you know."" Her mother, she says, was a ""very strong lady"" who liked to have a good time and listen to music, especially the yodeler named Montana Slim. She laughs when she recalls her brothers bringing home a skinny greyhound pooch. ""Mom, Montana Slim is outside,"" they said. Thompson rushed outside. The boys chuckled. They had named the dog after her favorite musician. ""She was the backbone of our family,"" McIntosh says of her mom. ""We never had a lot, but she always made sure we had something. She didn't eat sometimes, but she made sure us children ate. That's one thing she did do."" Her memories of her youth are filled with about 50 percent good times, 50 percent hard times. It was nearly impossible to get an education. Children worked the fields with their parents. As soon as they'd get settled at a school, it was time to pick up and move again. Her mom would put newborns in cotton sacks and pull them along as she picked cotton. The older kids would stay in front, so mom could keep a close eye on them. ""We would pick the cotton and pile it up in front of her, and she'd come along and pick it up and put it in her sack,"" McIntosh says.  Watch ""we would go home and cry"" » . They lived in tents or in a car. Local kids would tease them, telling them to clean up and bathe. ""They'd tell you, 'Go home and take a bath.' You couldn't very well take a bath when you're out in a car [with] nowhere to go."" She adds, ""We'd go home and cry."" McIntosh now cleans homes in the Modesto, California, area. She's proud of the living she's been able to make -- that she has a roof over her head and has been able to maintain a job all these years. She says her obsession to keep things clean started in her youth when her chore was to keep the family tent clean. There were two white sheets that she cleaned each day. ""Even today, when it comes to cleaning, I make sure things are clean. I can't stand dirty things,"" she says with a laugh. With the nation sinking into tough economic times and analysts saying the current economic crisis is the worst since the Great Depression, McIntosh says if there's a lesson to be learned from her experience it is to save your money and don't overextend yourself. iReport: Are you worried about losing your job? ""People live from paycheck to paycheck, even people making good money,"" she says. ""Do your best to make sure it doesn't happen again. Elect the people you think is going to do you good."" Her message for President-elect Barack Obama is simple: ""Think of the middle-class people."" She says she'll never forget the lessons of her hard-working mother, who died at the age of 80 in 1983. Her gravestone says: ""Migrant Mother: A Legend of the strength of American motherhood."" ""She was very strict, but very loving and caring. She cared for us all,"" McIntosh says.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The streets of Bangladesh's capital rang with the sound of gunfire, explosions and tear-gas canisters Sunday as Islamist protesters demanding laws against blasphemy battled police, leaving four dead. Tens of thousands of supporters of the Hefazat-e-Islam movement blocked nearly all the roads leading into the capital, Dhaka, as they pressed a list of demands, including the anti-blasphemy statute. Clashes broke out when Hefazat activists tried to break a police cordon. Street battles went on for hours, with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas and the Islamists hurling crude explosives and chunks of brick. At least three bodies were left in the streets, and one more person was reported dead at a hospital. Police said scores of people were hurt, including police officers and journalists. Syed Ashraful Islam, secretary-general of the ruling Awami League and a government minister, said demonstrators set fire to the Communist Party of Bangladesh office and ransacked several other business establishments in Purana Paltan in central Dhaka. Islam warned that the government would go tough if did not end its program and leave Dhaka peacefully. But at a rally in the evening, Hefazat leaders said they would not leave the capital until their demands were met. Shahriar Shahid, the managing editor of the state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sanghstha, said the service had to suspend operations for the day after Hefazat activists set a fire at the entrance of its office. ""They didn't enter the office, but they also didn't allow us to go to the office,"" Shahid said. The protest was unrelated to the recent building collapse that killed hundreds of people and sparked demonstrations and clashes as well. Sunday's demonstrators called for tough laws against bloggers and writers who they believe insult the Prophet Mohammed. A similar demonstration in February left four other people dead. Hezafat's call for an anti-blasphemy law is aimed at a group of bloggers, online activists and authors they have called ""atheists"" and accused of denigrating Islam and Mohammed. Online activists who had a pioneering role in organizing the Shahbagh sit-in have denied they are atheists. The bloggers launched a sit-in campaign at Dhaka's Shahbagh Square in February, demanding a ban on Bangladesh's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami. They have also called for the death penalty for Jamaat-e-Islami leaders convicted of war crimes charges that date back to 1971, when Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan. The party opposed independence. Sunday's Hefazat protesters said they wanted the government to meet 13 demands, including the reinstatement of ""absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah"" in the constitution and capital punishment for those who would denigrate Islam and its prophet. The list also includes mandatory Islamic education, bans on the free mixing of men and women and on the public installation of sculpture and a declaration that Ahmadiyya Muslim sect is non-Muslim.

"(CNN) -- So, about all those experts and analysts who've spent the past year or so saying Facebook was going to make a phone. A new expert has stepped forward to say it's not going to happen. And his name is Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook's CEO on Thursday threw cold water on rumors that have simmered for months the networking giant has been working on its own smartphone. ""There are lots of things that you can build in other operating systems, as well, that aren't really like building out a whole phone, which I think wouldn't really make much sense for us to do,"" Zuckerberg said in response to a question about the phone during the site's first earnings report. His comments seem to fly in the face of the scuttlebutt that's made its way onto blogs and news sites across the Web (including this one) for some time now. As recently as two months ago, The New York Times was reporting that ""employees of Facebook and several engineers"" as well as (the, of course, anonymous) ""people briefed on Facebook's plans"" were saying the company hoped to release a phone by next year. These unnamed folks told the Times it was Facebook's third effort at phone-building, dating back to 2010. And The Wall Street Journal's All Things D blog sounded pretty sure of itself last year, letting us know the Facebook phone is real, the site was working with HTC to make it and that its code name was ""Buffy,"" after the noted vampire slayer. Alas. On the earnings call, Zuckerberg emphasized that mobile computing is key to the company's future strategy. So far, despite earning millions, Facebook does not sell ads on, or charge for, its mobile app. Increasingly, smartphones and tablets are becoming the most frequent way people access social media. ""Well, Facebook is the most used app on basically every mobile platform, right?"" Zuckerberg said. ""So when we think about what we want to do right now, we want to increase the depth of the experience in addition to just growing users. We want to not just have apps that people use but also be kind of deeply integrated into the systems as possible. We want to support a development ecosystem, where other apps can build on top of Facebook."" So what will Facebook's next move in mobile be? Stay tuned, Zuckerberg says. ""I think we're really much closer to the beginning here than the end in terms of what we can do,"" he said. ""If you use the apps today, they're relatively basic compared to what I think anyone can imagine they would want from their Facebook experience on a phone."" So that settles it, right? Not so fast. In the tech blogosphere, it's hard to keep a good rumor down. All Things D responded to the report with a post titled ""Why Facebook Might Really Be Doing Its Own Phone, Despite What Zuck Said."" The logic? Nobody ever said Facebook itself is building the phone. An existing phone maker would build it for the site. ""His comments still leave tons of room for the company to be doing most of the work on a phone, while working alongside one or many partner manufacturers to do the actual hardware,"" Mike Isaac wrote. ""Even Apple could arguably say it doesn't manufacture phones -- Foxconn builds the phones -- and Apple is the most profitable phone maker in the world."" So there you have it. Let the speculation resume.","Reports for years have speculated about Facebook making a smartphone .

"(CNN) -- Jazz fans, as with their counterparts in rock 'n' roll, tend to be enthralled with the outlaws, renegades and mystics in their artistic realm. The further ""out"" jazz musicians or composers are in their personal lives, goes the myth, the more visionary and transcendent their output. Who creates great, or even good art by playing it safe? Dave Brubeck, who died of heart failure Wednesday, one day short of his 92nd birthday, was the paradigmatic ""good guy"" of post-World War II jazz. But he was, of course, much more than that. He was one of the rare jazz musicians whose name and face were easily recognized by those who don't know much about jazz. The Dave Brubeck Quartet, which featured Brubeck on piano and Paul Desmond on alto saxophone, was one of the iconic jazz ensembles of the 1950s and '60s, making its reputation with college campus recitals, playing in festivals and concert halls all over the world and releasing albums that went platinum. The group even put out a single, ""Take Five,"" that climbed the pop charts, peaking at number 25 in 1961 on Billboard's Hot 100, rare air for any jazz artist, before and after the Beatles stormed the American pop firmament. ""Take Five"" was one of the few Brubeck hits the leader didn't write himself. (Desmond, who died of lung cancer in 1977, did.) But there were other enduring standards (""Blue Rondo a la Turk,"" ""Three to Get Ready"") introduced on the 1959 platinum-selling ""Time Out"" LP, along with ""Take Five."" These and other pieces did clever, unexpected things with time-signatures (""Blue Rondo"" has a 9/8 beat while ""Take Five' is in 5/4) that charmed audiences with their ingenuity while accustoming novices to jazz's capacity for surprise. Brubeck's piano playing was itself something of a rhythmic effect, striding, vamping, riffing with heavy chords and thick intonation. Desmond's wry, airy lyricism provided the counterpoint and some critics preferred his playing to Brubeck's. Still, not even the most discerning of these skeptics could deny Brubeck's gifts as a composer. Besides such durable standards as ""In Your Own Sweet Way,"" ""Summer Song"" and ""The Duke,"" a tribute to his hero Duke Ellington, Brubeck wrote suites for orchestras, oratorios for choirs and even the occasional theme for a TV series. (The lively ""Theme from 'Mr. Broadway'"" proved more enduring than the one-season wonder it was written for.). News: Jazz great Dave Brubeck dies at 91 . Through it all, he was, by all accounts, gregarious, self-possessed and generous in spirit. He was married to the same woman, the former Iola Marie Whitlock, from 1942 to the end of his life. He raised six children, four of whom followed their father into the music business, sometimes performing and recording on their own, sometimes with him. He and his family spent most of their lives in their Wilton, Connecticut, home where, despite a global touring schedule that, at one point had him doing 120 consecutive days of concerts in several cities, he always found sufficient time to write music, practice his piano and play with his children. In other words: No outlaw or renegade in this corner of the room. But Brubeck, as his multitudes of fans (and more than a few historians) attest, carried substantial artistic weight of his own while walking the straight-and-narrow. If ever there was an exemplar of the ""good guy"" as visionary artist, it was Brubeck, who leaves behind a radiant legacy of steadfast integrity, an open-hearted (and open-minded) worldview and an infectious sense of play that lured listeners at whatever level of musical appreciation into the simple joys of fiddling with time and space. This son of a Stockton, California, cattle rancher would reap many honors for not heeding his father's warning, recalled by Brubeck to me in a conversation a few years back, that there was no real life to be found ""playing in a smoky nightclub."" In 2009, he was honored for lifetime achievement by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, along with such diverse peers as Mel Brooks, Robert De Niro, Grace Bumbry and Bruce Springsteen. His 90th birthday was commemorated two years ago with a documentary produced by Clint Eastwood, featuring testimonials from sources as varied as President Bill Clinton, Bill Cosby, George Lucas and Stanley Crouch. In that documentary, Brubeck recalls not only his years of study under French composer Darius Milhaud (along with Ellington his greatest musical influence), but also his service in World War II, most of which he spent in Patton's Third Army in Europe. He would have fought at the Battle of the Bulge if he hadn't been asked to play piano at a Red Cross show. He spent the last year-and-a-half of the war leading ""The Wolfpack,"" an Army jazz band that was also one of the first racially mixed units in the armed services before the military's postwar racial integration. In Ken Burns' 2000 miniseries, ""Jazz,"" Brubeck spoke with quiet, impassioned eloquence of the difficulties his unit encountered both with segregated troops overseas and with home-front racists at a Texas restaurant who refused them service. In his breakout year of 1954, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Instead of being overjoyed at what was then a prestigious coup, Brubeck recalled his embarrassment over the fact that he had been so honored ahead of Duke Ellington, whom he felt was far more deserving. Being a ""good guy"" was no small thing to Dave Brubeck or his fans. It shouldn't be to anyone else. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: Dave Brubeck, a good guy and masterly jazz musician, died Wednesday .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- The new President of Egypt is taking the concept of getting work done in the first 100 days in office very seriously. Mohamed Morsy forced out the long-serving head of the military Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, his number two, and a handful of other generals. At the same time, Morsy nullified the constitutional declaration made by the military council before he took office June 30th. His message is clear. And while the military wanted to sustain its grip on power, Morsi was able to wrestle control after what was seen as a military lapse in the Sinai. Morsy is taking a bold stand, ordering counter attacks against militant hideouts over the weekend near al-Arish in Northern Sinai, after 16 border guards were killed in a surprise attacks when they were breaking fast at sundown during Ramadan. But the president is going down a tricky road. Mohammed Al Issis, a political economist at the American University in Cairo, said Morsy's strategy is particularly difficult since it is ""not clear who the enemy is. "" Recent events, he said, provided an early indication of where the Sinai is headed. The attacks, and changes at the top in the military, have far reaching implications -- not the least of which is the attempted rebuilding of the Egyptian economy. Nearly a year and a half after the uprisings against the 30 year rule of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt is struggling to find its footing. The Sinai may be vast, but scenes of attacks in the north have real potential to spook tourists who were just getting comfortable with coming back to Red Sea resorts in the south. Blog: Was Clinton's Egypt visit a mistake? Tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner in the country, but revenues dropped in 2011 to just under $9 billion, from $12.5 billion the year before the uprisings. The southern Sinai, especially Sharm El Sheikh, is the main foreign tourist destination. There is a genuine cash crunch, with foreign exchange reserves at roughly $14 billion -- half the level of early 2011. Strategists say the cash will last only four months if revenues don't start coming in at a faster pace. The Egyptian government is still pegging growth during the current fiscal year at 3.5% to 4%, but economists who closely track the Middle East and North Africa region, known as MENA, are beginning to mark down expectations. Alia Moubayed, of Barclays, says the security challenge ""not only puts the recovery in this particular region on negative outlook, but highlights the volatility of the challenges that this new government and president will face."" Strategically, it was thought that Morsy and Tantawi could work together against a common enemy in the Sinai. This was expected to include Bedouin tribal leaders who also want to bring their territory under control. That plan moves ahead, but Tantawi and his team are not part of it. Read more: With global instability, who wants to be a tourist? The new president wants to get this military challenge under control -- hence the strong and quick use of force -- so he can focus on the bigger picture, which remains hazy. The International Monetary Fund mission is still planning to visit Egypt this month to jump-start negotiations on a $3.2 billion loan program. Talks took place last spring but there was reluctance to push ahead with that program until a government was in place with a new plan of action. Knowing the importance of Egypt to the broader region, Gulf players with ample oil and gas revenues are stepping up funding. Qatar has said it would inject $2 billion into the Egyptian Central Bank, and Saudi Arabia earlier this year pledged a billion dollars. Candidate Morsy campaigned on delivering what he called a Renaissance Project for Egypt, an economic blueprint that engages wider swaths of society. One of the key criticisms of the Mubarak regime was that the reform program started too late in the middle of the last decade and then trickled down too slowly. London based Arabia Monitor, commenting after attacks in Sinai, said the new government ""faces the difficult challenge of striking the right balance between propping up the economy, achieving fiscal consolidation, and improving the socio-economic conditions that helped overturn the old order."" The budget deficit could top 9% this year, but most agree this is not the time for austerity. It is a time to wrest back control of the trouble spot on the volatile border with Israel and Gaza and get Egyptians back to work, and the economy growing again.","Morsy's actions towards the military show he is taking a bold stand .

"New York (CNN) -- A number of security lapses in an airport shuttle system in New York is raising concerns among some Port Authority officers and state senators. ""Among the cops it's commonly referred to as a possible weapons delivery system,"" said one Port Authority Police official of the AirTrain shuttle system that ferries thousands of passengers to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The official did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The lack of security on the system -- an eight-mile fully automated, unmanned railroad -- was discussed Friday at a state homeland security hearing to discuss vulnerabilities that still remain 10 years after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. ""There's no scanning of bags, there's no scanning of passengers,"" said state Sen. Greg Ball, who is also the chairman of the New York State Homeland Security Committee. ""We should have uniformed personnel on that transportation corridor, we don't."" Police Benevolent Association Vice President Robert Morris described it simply as ""a bad situation,"" pointing out that the airport shuttle trains enter the international arrivals building of the airport directly underneath departures where airlines such as El Al operate. Cleveland terminal, planes evacuated after screening glitch . ""Port Authority's own security study prior to the deployment of that system was for 18 police officers a day to police the system. Three tours of duty a day, 365 days a year,"" Morris told the panel. ""In the last 12 months we've had 40 tours, which is about two weeks' worth of coverage with one officer."" The hearing, requested by Ball, took place following a complaint in March by the New York division of the Police Benevolent Association, a nationwide union representing police officers. The union cited a lack of security on the airport shuttle in their complaint. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is responsible for security at New York City airports, bridges and tunnels. The Port Authority said in a statement Friday that there is no lapse in security. ""The way the PAPD is deployed, as well as cameras and the entirety of our security apparatus, means the traveling public should feel safe within all of the Port Authority facilities,"" the statement said. Bobby Egbert, spokesman for the Port Authority Police Benevolence Association, acknowledged Saturday that the Port Authority is a huge organization with many responsibilities. When it comes to transporting people and developing commerce in the bistate region, he said the agency does a great job. ""The problem is it doesn't take public safety and security concerns seriously,"" he said. According to Egbert, the biggest problem with safety on the AirTrain system is a lack of communication, noting specifically the lack of a central radio system in the new JetBlue Terminal Five. Morris also noted the lack of an operable radio system in the terminal, saying officers instead are issued cell phones -- a slower form of communication when officers need to quickly call for backup or relay information. While officers in the terminal do carry radios on their belts, they ""might as well be carrying a brick,"" Morris said Friday. Egbert pointed to the example of Steven Slater, the JetBlue flight attendant that pulled the emergency slide of a plane and ran from the airport. ""That's how he got away,"" said Egbert. ""The two cops on duty had no idea what was going on."" While Slater's stunt didn't injure anyone, Egbert believes his escape exhibits the real safety threat to people in the airport and terminals surrounding AirTrain. Ball's office said another hearing will be held in Albany next month to follow up on some of the concerns detailed in Friday's meeting.","The unmanned, unpoliced AirTrain system is raising concerns .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Riot police fired tear gas and water cannons Wednesday at hundreds of protesters trying to hold May Day demonstrations in Istanbul's iconic Taksim Square in defiance of a ban. The clashes came as police locked down all roads leading to Istanbul's main commercial district, after barring the annual Labor Day rally in Taksim Square for the first time in three years. Despite the shutdown, riots raged throughout densely populated parts of central Istanbul as demonstrators tried to reach the traditional May Day rally site. Activists and government officials traded accusations about who was responsible for the tensions. Istanbul Gov. Huseyin Avni Mutlu said 22 police officers were wounded from rocks and other objects thrown at them. ""We carried out a tremendously even-handed intervention,"" he said. Mutlu said police detained 72 protesters in connection with the day's events. Three protesters were injured, all of whom were members of ""marginal"" leftist groups, Mutlu said. But human rights organizations said that number did not reflect the real number of people injured and accused police of recklessness. ""It is irresponsible for the governor to make these kinds of statements about the number of people injured,"" said Umit Efe, head of the Istanbul branch of the Human Rights Association of Turkey. ""We are still gathering the numbers, but in just one hospital, we see 40 people have been admitted, mostly for head traumas and respiratory problems,"" she said. ""So many gas bombs were thrown in Istanbul today, we should be looking at this from the viewpoint of attempt on life."" According to the Human Rights Association of Turkey, a 17-year-old activist is in critical condition after a gas canister hit her in the head at close range. Video footage showed the young woman collapsed on a sidewalk amid a growing cloud of tear gas. Seconds later, police rushed to the fallen girl, who was later taken to a hospital. Authorities say they refused to grant permission to trade unions and youth groups for demonstrations in Taksim Square because of a large-scale construction project in the area. But unions and youth groups say that the square is the historic site of May 1 activities and that they have a right to demonstrate there. City shutdown . In a move that few Istanbul residents recall seeing before, authorities removed part of one bridge and raised a bridge over an estuary in an apparent effort to block demonstrators from approaching the traditional rallying ground. Groups carrying May 1 international workers' day banners and chanting ""Long live Workers' Day"" as they sought to get to the square were dispersed using water cannons and tear gas in the city's Besiktas district. Meanwhile, Istanbul is under a citywide shutdown. Authorities have closed roads and suspended public transportation to the square, including subways, buses and the ferry services that carry passengers between the city's European and Asian sides. Youth groups have been canvassing Istanbul with posters that read, ""Bring your anger, and come to Taksim."" Thirty-four people were killed on May 1, 1977, in Istanbul when gunmen fired on demonstrations during a time of political upheaval in Turkey. Later, the 1980 junta declared May 1 celebrations illegal in Taksim Square. The May 1 demonstrations of the past three years took place under a heavy police presence.","Riot police fire tear gas and water cannons at protesters trying to reach Taksim Square .

"(CNN) -- About 70,000 refugees who fled violence in Mali are living in ""appalling"" conditions in a camp in the middle of the Mauritanian desert, Doctors Without Borders said Friday. The situation has only got worse in Mbera camp since French forces entered Mali in January to help local forces take on Islamist militants, the humanitarian group said. About 15,000 more refugees have flooded into the camp since the fighting, and conditions are so bad there that many who were healthy became ill or malnourished after they arrived. Mauritania: Slavery's last stronghold . The number of children admitted to clinics in the camp for severe malnutrition more than doubled in that time, climbing from 42 to 106, Doctors Without Borders said. About 85% of the children under treatment arrived between January and February, despite the nutritional status of the new refugees being generally good when assessed on arrival. ""These statistics show that the refugees have grown weaker whilst in the camp, the very place where they should have been receiving assistance, including correctly formulated food rations from aid organizations,"" said Henry Gray, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. ""There has clearly been a lack of preparation for this new influx of refugees."" The camp was set up by the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, with the Mauritanian government 60 kilometers (about 37 miles) from the border when refugees started arriving in early 2012. The report, ""Stranded in the Desert,"" is based on testimonies collected from more than 100 refugees at the Mbera camp between February and mid-March of this year. The majority of the refugees in Mbera camp are pastoralists who lived nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles in northern Mali, according to the report. Some of the families left their young men behind to tend to their herds while they fled over the border into neighboring Mauritania. ""Most of the refugees are from the Tuareg and Arab communities,"" said Gray. ""They fled preemptively, often for fear of violence due to their presumed links with Islamist or separatist groups. Their home in northern Mali is still in the grip of fear and mistrust."" Limited water, poor hygiene facilities . While some improvements have been made at the camp since the mass influx of new refugees three months ago, Doctors Without Borders said, ""the challenge will be to continue to provide assistance that meets humanitarian standards."" Water is still in short supply in the desert camp, a situation made worse by daytime temperatures that reach 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). Refugees at Mbera receive just 11 liters of water per person per day, instead of the 20 liters recommended by humanitarian standards, the report said. Some of the families that arrived in January had to wait more than a month for materials to build shelters, the report said. They were forced to do what they could with sticks and scraps of cloth in the meantime. There is also a serious shortage of toilet facilities. When the camp was extended in January to accommodate the influx of refugees, there were four latrines for 12,000 people -- far below the recommended minimum of one per 20 people. More are now being built, but the hygiene situation remains difficult. Another problem is that the rations provided by the U.N. World Food Program, mostly rice and pulses, are very different from the pastoralist refugees' customary diet, which is based on meat and milk. Many new arrivals also suffer from delays in getting food supplies, the report said. And with the situation in northern Mali still volatile as French and African forces hunt down the remaining Islamist fighters -- and against a backdrop of complex ethnic and political tensions -- it's unclear when the refugees will feel able to return home. Mali: The long, troubled desert road ahead . 'This time, we left early' A 71-year-old Malian interviewed for the report, Ibrahimou, said three sons had stayed in their village to care for the livestock, but the rest of his family had left. ""With the other village chiefs, we took the decision to leave out of fear of the Malian army,"" he said. ""I lost brothers and cousins in 1992. I saw a lot of atrocities and I lost a lot of loved ones in the conflict. I almost lost all my animals too. This time, we left early. Nobody knows when we will be back but, at my age, I have no desire to go into exile every 10 years."" About a quarter of those interviewed said they'd fled direct fighting where their lives or family members' lives were in danger. A small percentage said they had fled because of the seizure of power by Islamist groups in cities such as Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal. Islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. Many of the most recent arrivals in the camp told Doctors Without Borders they had left Mali because of food shortages and other problems. ""Life has become very hard. I had nothing to give to my children. There was nothing to eat, shops were closed or empty. There was no market for cattle. I could not stay because I have small children to feed,"" said Halima, aged 24. Doctors Without Borders has been working at Mbera camp since February 2012, when the first groups of refugees from Mali began to arrive. Its teams have treated about 1,000 malnourished children since then and delivered about 200 babies. Even before the latest influx of refugees, the nutritional situation was critical, with a study by Doctors Without Borders in November revealing mortality rates above the emergency threshold for children under 2 years old. Since the French-led intervention in January, the number of consultations at its clinics in the camp has gone up from 1,500 to 2,500 per week, Doctors Without Borders said. UNHCR has said that it and partner agencies ""struggle to maintain minimum humanitarian standards in Mbera Camp.""

"Islamabad (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was remanded in custody for two weeks Saturday by an anti-terrorism court over allegations he illegally ordered the detention of judges in 2007. His appearance had been ordered by Pakistan's High Court, which on Thursday ruled that his alleged actions amounted to an act of terrorism. After a 20-minute hearing, the anti-terrorism court in Islamabad placed Musharraf on judicial remand for 14 days. His next court appearance in the case is set for May 4. As the former president left the court, there were clashes between anti-Musharraf lawyers and a small pro-Musharraf crowd. Authorities decided Musharraf will be held under house arrest at his farmhouse compound in Chak Shazad, outside the Pakistani capital. He will be moved from police headquarters, where he was whisked after his court appearance, to the farmhouse, police officials said. The farmhouse has been converted into a ""sub jail,"" Musharraf's lawyer, Ahmed Raza Qasoori, said Friday. Musharraf spent Friday night at police headquarters following his appearance before a magistrate earlier in the day, after which he was initially allowed to return to the farmhouse. Musharraf will continue to seek bail in the case, his lawyer said. An attempt on Thursday to appeal the High Court's decision at the Supreme Court appeared to have so far been unsuccessful. The former president denies the charges against him and never gave any order to detain or abduct the judges in 2007, said Mohammad Amjad, a spokesman for his political party. The development is the latest setback for Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections. His arrest highlights the increased willingness of Pakistan's judiciary, which clashed with Musharraf during his time in power, to pursue cases against high-profile figures previously considered to be untouchable. No former Pakistani army chief has previously been arrested and detained. Amid a long-running fight with the judiciary, Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan last month under heavy security. But so far, his return does not seem to be going according to plan. Last week, Pakistani election officials barred him from running for a seat in parliament in elections next month, a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge. The ex-military strongman still has to face two separate other cases dating from his time in power. The first relates to claims he did not do enough to protect the life of Benazir Bhutto -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan -- after she was assassinated in 2007, weeks before an election in which she hoped to return to office. Musharraf is also accused of ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Islamabad and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Aliza Kassim, Nasir Habib and Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","NEW: A court orders Pervez Musharraf to be held in judicial custody for two weeks .

"(CNN) -- Eurozone nations must follow the rules if they want to get out of the financial crisis plaguing the region, says Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen. In an interview with CNN's Richard Quest, Katainen said the crisis is serving as a ""very hard lesson"" to many countries inside the 17-nation single currency union. ""One of the reasons why we are in crisis at the moment is that everybody did not follow strictly the rule base and now we pay the price,"" Katainen said. Since the eurozone debt crisis began in 2010, five countries -- Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus -- have requested bailouts from Europe's rescue funds. But Katainen said a raft of new regulations within the next few months will make Europe ""much better, safer and sustainable."" This includes a banking union regulated by the European Central Bank that will become active in 2014 and the euro-wide rescue fund known as the European Stability Mechanism. Katainen highlighted falling interest rates of government debt for countries such as Ireland and Portugal as a sign that European confidence is returning. He added: ""I am a former finance minister and I have learned not to say that we have seen the worst."" The Finnish Prime Minister, who in the past has been an outspoken supporter of austerity for countries that have spent recklessly, said European nations must restore competitiveness to their economies. ""In Spain the competitiveness has been improving a lot they have done labor market reforms, they have done similar things in Ireland but it always takes some time to function.""","Five countries have all requested bailouts -- Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law Thursday that encourages people to report drug overdoses without fear of being arrested, a measure he says will help save lives. ""Leaders of this state want them to save a life first, not worry about anything else thereafter,"" he said. ""First to save a life and in return, the deal we'll make with them is we won't prosecute them, we won't arrest them."" The Overdose Protection Act applies to those who seek medical help for themselves or someone else experiencing a drug overdose. The bill was passed 24-1 in the New Jersey Senate on Monday and will also eliminate legal action against those who administer overdose antidotes in life-threatening situations. Singer Jon Bon Jovi joined Christie for the law's signing at a drug rehabilitation center in Paterson, New Jersey. Drug prevention advocates and family members of those who lost their lives to drug overdoses also attended. ""I hope that Gov. Christie's actions here will cause other states to stand up and to pay attention and also to follow in his footsteps,"" Bon Jovi said. Bon Jovi's daughter Stephanie reportedly overdosed on heroin in November 2012 in her upstate New York dorm. Misdemeanor charges of possession of a controlled substance or the use of drug paraphernalia were later dropped because New York has a similar protection law. ""On behalf of those individuals and their families whose lives will be saved by this important legislation, I want to thank Gov. Christie and the New Jersey Legislature for passing the Good Samaritan bill,"" Bon Jovi said. According to Drug Policy Alliance, New Jersey joins 11 states and the District of Columbia with similar protection laws.","Overdose Protection Act applies to those who seek medical help for themselves or someone else .

"(CNN) -- Three people were killed and more than 30 injured in back-to-back explosions near the headquarters of an anti-Taliban political party in Karachi, Pakistan, police told CNN on Saturday. The explosions, about 30 minutes apart, took place near the headquarters of Muttahida Quami Movement, or MQM, police spokesman Mureed Abbas said. One device was placed in a rickshaw, police said. The second was buried in the ground. The MQM, which is one of Pakistan's largest and most liberal parties, has been targeted by the Pakistani Taliban in recent weeks. The party is firmly opposed to the Islamist militant group. In a call to CNN after the explosions, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ihsan Ullah Ihsan said his group claimed responsibility. President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the bomb blasts and expressed sympathies for those killed and injured and their families. The MQM's coordination committee condemned the two bomb blasts and called for businesses and transportation providers in the province to shut down Sunday to observe a day of mourning. A candidate in this month's national elections was shot and killed Thursday by two gunmen on a motorbike, a senior police official in Hyderabad said. Candidate Fakhar Ul Islam was targeted on his way home from his office and was a member of MQM. Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud has told Pakistanis to stay away from the elections. On Friday, gunmen on a motorbike in Karachi shot and killed Sadiq Zaman Khattak and his 4-year-old son when they were leaving a mosque, said Zahid Khan of Awami National Party, another anti-Taliban liberal party. Khattak, representing the Awami National Party, had been a candidate for a seat in the National Assembly. On Saturday, Raza Haroon, a member of the MQM's coordination committee, deplored how terrorists have been targeting candidates and workers of his party, the ANP and the ruling Pakistan People Party. Haroon charged that the election commission, the government and law agencies were playing a role of silent spectators. But Haroon said his party wouldn't be cowed. On May 11, Pakistanis will go to the polls to elect a new civilian government for a five-year term.

"(CNN) -- The woman who scrambled to safety after a small plane crashed into her Florida home gave thanks to God on Saturday for allowing her to escape without a scratch and for keeping her family safe. Susan Crockett stood in front of her one-story Palm Coast home, which now has a huge black hole where the four-seater plane went down Friday afternoon, killing all three people aboard. ""God is good. He really is,"" Crockett told reporters. ""I got out without a scratch on me. A little bruise from taking a tumble through the window, but other than that, I'm fine. I'm blessed. Truly, God was with me."" The 1957 Bonanza H35 took off from Fort Pierce, Florida, and was on its way to Knoxville when the pilot reported engine trouble, officials said. ""From what we've been told, the pilot was having some malfunctions in flight,"" said Chief Investigator Terry Duprie of the National Transportation Safety Board. The plane was diverting to Flagler County Airport, near the coast about 30 miles north of Daytona Beach, when it crashed a mile east of the airport, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said. Killed in the crash were Michael R. Anders, 57, and Duane L. Shaw, 59, both of Albany, Kentucky, and Charissee M. Peoples, 42, of Indianapolis, Indiana, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A preliminary NTSB report on the crash is expected in about 10 days, Duprie said, but the full investigation is expected to take many months. Investigators will try to figure out why the plane made such a steep descent into the home and whether the weather conditions -- light rain and low clouds -- played any role, he said. Tall pine trees surround the home, which is in a rural residential area home to many retirees. The crash caused an intense fire that incinerated much of the plane, something that will make the investigation difficult, Duprie said. But the pilot was talking to air traffic controllers in Daytona Beach, ""and I think that will help us out quite a bit down the road."" Crockett said she was getting ready to leave her house when something told her to stop. A few more feet, she said, and she would have been hit. Her college-age daughter, Jessica, who was home for the holidays, would have been lounging on a bed that's now ""charred and mangled"" if she hadn't decided to head back to school a few days early, Crockett said. Crockett's grandson often comes over to her house, where ""he stands in front of the television that's now a big glob of metal,"" but his dad decided to take him to day care Friday, she said. Members of Crockett's church bought her clothes and shoes to wear, since she escaped the house with next to nothing. She did manage to rescue the folded flag she received after her sister, who was in the Army, died about three years ago. It's blackened, but intact, she said. ""I'm just praising God that I'm alive,"" Crockett said Saturday.","A small plane crashed into Susan Crockett's home on Friday .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Venezuela's first satellite roared into space Thursday from a launching pad in southwest China. The telecommunications satellite will let rural communities in Venezuela access educational and medical information that has been difficult for them to come by as a result of their relative isolation, said Rodolfo Navaro, technical manager for the Bolivarian Space Activity Agency. ""It is not focused on commercial ends, but on providing a service to the communities which have never enjoyed a modern communication system,"" he said, according to the Bolivarian News Agency. ""Aboriginal communities, for instance, would receive long-distance education, or maybe they would request medicines, air or river ambulance service, medical checkups, among other options."" A Chinese rocket carrying the satellite lifted off early Thursday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwestern China's Sichuan province, according to an account in China's state-run news agency, Xinhua. The satellite is designed to last 15 years, the agency said. President Hugo Chavez announced after taking office that Venezuela would send crafts into space, and the country spent $241 million in five years to develop the Simon Bolivar Satellite, named for the general whose military victories led to independence from Spain for several South American nations in the early 1800s. Chavez referred to the satellite's launch as a key step toward greater scientific and technological independence for Venezuela, the Bolivarian News Agency reported. The satellite will have the ability to cover the Caribbean, Central America and parts of South America, the agency said.","Telecommunications satellite will let rural areas access educational, medical info .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama unveiled Thursday a new military strategy. It calls for ""pivoting"" from the Middle East to the Far East, focusing partly on the military buildup of China. Without a major public debate of the kind we have about raising taxes, or a congressional vote, the U.S. government is moving slowly but surely toward characterizing China as an aggressive superpower and is preparing for war, should it become necessary. James Clapper, retired lieutenant general and current director of national intelligence, characterized China, ""growing in its military capabilities,"" as a ""mortal threat"" to the United States. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said, ""The Chinese military openly regards the United States as an enemy. We should not undermine our own security by thinking we can make friends with self-proclaimed adversaries with hospitality and open arms."" China's leaders tend to stress that they do not seek a confrontation. Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei stated that ""China from beginning to end pursues a defensive national defense policy, and sticks to the path of peaceful development."" Still, one can readily find belligerent voices from China. Gen. Zhu Chenghu expressed willingness to abandon China's ""no first use"" nuclear weapons poloicy, to defend its claim over Taiwan and argued that China should use nuclear weapons against the United States should its military interfere. A 2011 editorial in the Global Times (an English edition of the Communist Party of China's official newspaper) warned that countries involved in sea disputes with China ""need to prepare for the sounds of cannons."" Moreover, there were several incidents in which China exhibited provocative, troubling behavior. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that five Chinese vessels ""shadowed and aggressively maneuvered in dangerously close proximity to USNS Impeccable, in an apparent coordinated effort to harass the U.S. ocean surveillance ship."" In 2011, Chinese patrol boats cut a Vietnamese survey ship's cables. American hawks hold that the U.S. must build up its military, given China's rapid military buildup. However, American doves point out that China's defense spending is rather small. Chinese government-released figures say they spent $70 billion on defense in 2009, though U.S. DoD estimates place it somewhere between $122.5 billion and $175 billion. For comparison, the U.S. defense budget for fiscal year 2009 was about $687 billion. While China launched its first aircraft carrier in August 2011, the U.S. Navy has 11. As China's economic growth slows and the cost of its social and environmental problems rises, it is likely to curb the increases in its defense spending -- unless spurred on by American moves. The same doves point out that China's military modernization began from a low baseline. China's highly bureaucratic and inefficient military-industrial complex lags behind even its own nonmilitary and non-state-owned counterparts. Its nuclear submarines are poorly designed. It has few military communications satellites. China's nuclear-armed bomber fleet is woefully obsolete, and its military is reported to face major problems in its command-and-control systems. All but the most ardent Western hawks see no significant Chinese military threat to core U.S. interests in the near or even intermediate future. Robert Ross finds that ""the transformation of the PLA [People's Liberation Army] into a region-wide strategic power will require many decades ... The transformation of the PLA into a global strategic power is an even more distant prospect."" And Kenneth Lieberthal contends, ""There is no serious military man in China or in the United States who thinks that China has any prayer of dominating the U.S. militarily in the coming three or four decades."" Hence, the U.S. can safely continue to seek to turn China into a partner before concluding that a course of confrontation is unavoidable. The U.S. could work with China to secure pathways for energy and raw materials that are very important to China, and should not bother us. The U.S. could agree with China to settle in an international court or through negotiations differences about claims over the South China Sea; and stop calling on China's neighboring countries to get together to oppose China's legitimate interests. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","President Barack Obama unveiled U.S. military strategy which will focus more on Asia .

"(CNN) -- It's been a weekend of contrasting fortunes for American club owners in the English Premier League. The Glazer family can look forward to Manchester United's imminent record-extending 20th league title, and their fifth since a leveraged takeover in 2005 that left one of the world's wealthiest clubs saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars of debt. For Ellis Short, owner of Saturday's beaten opponents Sunderland, the prospect of losing top-flight status is all too real after a 1-0 defeat that left his team just one point above the relegation zone and marked the end of the reign of manager Martin O'Neill after less than two seasons. He was replaced Sunday by controversial former Italian forward Paulo Di Canio, whose previous managerial club job was with English third division side Swindon. One of O'Neill's former players, Paul Lambert, has been seemingly on the verge of the sack for most of this season but the Aston Villa manager seems likely to see it out despite Sunday's 2-1 home defeat by Liverpool, which kept his side in the bottom three but only four points behind 12th-placed Southampton. ""Yes, definitely,"" Lambert said when asked if his team could avoid the drop, with seven games to play. ""I think anybody who was here today would say the same. We're certainly playing well enough. We don't look like a team down the bottom at the minute. ""If we keep going the way we're going, we'll win more games than not. There will be so many twists and turns."" Lambert has been consistently backed by Villa's U.S. owner Randy Lerner, who has focused on Villa since ending his ownership of NFL team the Cleveland Browns in August 2012. Lerner, who in 2006 became only the second owner of an EPL club, fell out with O'Neill ahead of the 2010-11 season and replaced the Northern Irishman with Gerard Houllier and Alex McLeish before appointing Lambert last June. The Scot, with considerably smaller finances to work with than his predecessors, has stuck doggedly to his task of shaping a new team out of young talent -- the most notable being 22-year-old Belgium striker Christian Benteke, who struck his 18th goal this season to put the 1982 European champion ahead against Liverpool. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has, likewise, been backed by his club's American owners -- Fenway Sports Group -- to overhaul the team and try to return to the glory days of the 1970s and '80s in which the team won four of its five continental crowns and 11 of 18 English championships. The experiment is still a work in progress, but a mixture of youth and experience came up trumps on Sunday as 22-year-old midfielder Jordan Henderson and veteran captain Steven Gerrard -- with a 60th-minute penalty after Luis Suarez was fouled -- replied with the goals that lifted seventh-placed Liverpool to within five points of European qualification. If the Reds can't close that gap then Rodgers won't again have the distractions of the Europa League next season, so one of his main aims will be to keep 29-goal striker Suarez at the club. The Uruguayan heads the Premier League charts with 23 and has already suggested that he would consider any offer from clubs playing in top competitions such as the Champions League. ""We don't have to sell him for the money,"" Rodgers said. ""He's very happy. We're trying to build a group here and add to it. We want to keep striving forward."" Suarez returned to England from his country's midweek South American World Cup qualifier against Chile, a 2-0 defeat in which he was booked -- triggering a suspension for the next match in June against Venezuela -- and also seemingly punched an opponent in the face, which may result in further action by FIFA. ""He came back late on Thursday,"" Rodgers said. ""He was in training on Friday and I was thinking how tired he was -- his face, his body. He just looked totally shattered from all the travel and exertions from the game. ""But you look at him today -- his energy and willingness to work for the team, and then just his sheer quality. His imagination in the game is incredible. ""He really frightens defenders, and that led to a penalty.""","Steven Gerrard's second-half penalty gives Liverpool 2-1 victory at Aston Villa .

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Women and children were busy inside the Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, preparing for their traditional Sunday feast. Religious leaders gathered in the building's holy room, ahead of the hundreds set to arrive soon for the next service's 11:30 a.m. start. This peace was shattered, when what authorities believe was a lone gunman opened fire inside and outside the temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. By the time a police officer -- after his colleague had been ""ambushed"" and shot multiple times -- returned fire, the gunman and six others were dead, Oak Creek police Chief John Edwards said. Police on Monday identified the gunman as Wade Michael Page, 40, an Army veteran. FBI will investigate rampage as a 'domestic terrorist-type incident' Witnesses described the shooter as a bald white man, standing about 6 feet tall, wearing black pants and a white T-shirt -- with a tattoo marking the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States visible on one of his arms -- said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, a temple member who worked with police as an interpreter, talking to witnesses after the attack. The gunman entered the parking lot Sunday morning and soon opened fire, killing at least one person, Kaleka said. The first person to see a shooter was a 10-year-old child, Amardeep Kaleka -- whose father Satwant Singh Kaleka is president of the temple -- told CNN affiliate WISN. (Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka and Amardeep Kaleka are related, with the latter noting that he has a large number of extended family in the temple.) Soon thereafter, the shooter made his way into the temple building. He headed toward its holy room and shot ""mainly turbaned individuals"" there, according to Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka. He said that the casualties he knew of were ""the equivalent of priests,"" including Kaleka's uncle, who is one of the temple administrators. Women in the kitchen who were preparing the upcoming meal heard the gunshots. The shooter burst in, but those inside the kitchen ""were fortunate enough to basically duck down and dodge"" the bullets, Kaleka said. People did whatever they could to survive. Some managed to run to safety outside. Others sought refuge in the temple's basement, while others huddled together tightly in the pantry. Sikhs in U.S. and India react . The temple's top priest spent about one in a half hours in a bathroom stall, after being told about the shooter by its president Satwant Singh Kaleka, he later told Justice Singh Khalsa. ""Everybody pretty much said they saw a couple of people laying on the floor, and a lot of people just heard gunshots,"" said Khalsa, a temple member since the 1990s who helped translate witness accounts for authorities in Oak Creek. Amardeep Kaleka said his mother hid in a closet, shutting off her phone whenever anyone walked by. His father, meanwhile, got shot ""multiple times"" trying to tackle the gunman, the son. Amardeep Kaleka first learned of the fate of his father, who was being treated at an area hospital, in a phone call saying he was ""on the ground ... and he's bleeding bad."" By 10:30 a.m., 911 call after call had begun flooding into emergency dispatch at the Oak Creek police department, according to Brad Wentlandt, a police chief in neighboring Greenfield, Wisconsin, a spokesman on the case. The showdown between the police officers and the gunman occurred some time thereafter, finally ending the bloodshed. Still, it took several more hours for authorities to thoroughly sweep the building and the surrounding area, checking for clues and signs of additional gunmen, as some witnesses had suspected. Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka said temple members he'd talked to had never seen the gunman or had any idea who he was. The violence is antithetical to the Sikh religion and its custom of, literally, opening its doors to people of all faiths. ""It's really unfortunate that someone took advantage of this, the love that we try to give out,"" he said. ""It's disgusting, to say the least, that people would do this."" Sources name alleged gunman in Wisconsin temple shooting . ""Shock"" was a word several temple members used to describe their feelings after the shots had stopped, with the grief widespread given that everyone there knew everyone else well. There was also rampant confusion, with little known about the names of the dead or the whereabouts of the injured. Still, the tight-knit Sikh community took solace in the fact that they had one another to lean on for support, nourishment and love. Even so, they solicited help from the outside, too, to make sense of the terror and recover from it. ""I want everybody out there, whoever is hearing this, we would really appreciate your prayers your positive support,"" Amardeep Kaleka said. ""We're in a great time of need for that positive energy, so please send it."" Belief Blog: Who are Sikhs? Sikhism, the world's fifth most popular religion, is a monotheistic faith that believes in equality and service to others, Sikh officials say.

"(CNN) -- Imagine that you have made it to the United States from a country where economic opportunities are absent. You've found work in a laundry, a restaurant kitchen, a nursing home, or on a construction site. The pay is low by U.S. standards, but you save enough to send some every month to your family back home. Every day you put up with hazards and harassment, knowing that if you raise your voice in protest you risk, not only getting fired, but getting reported and deported. Some weeks you don't get paid at all, but you keep your mouth shut and live with the abuse. Hundreds of thousands of immigrant families across the country live this each day. Now, as Congress considers sweeping changes to a broken immigration system, we must press the case for a more humane approach to immigration -- and protections for all workers, immigrant and native-born alike. International Workers' Day, or May Day, started in 1887 as a day for workers to press their demands for an eight-hour work day. It commemorated a violent suppression of a Chicago labor rally the year before. Immigrants, their advocates and allies took the holiday observed on the first of May to another level in 2006, when they connected workers' rights to the need for repairs to a broken immigration system. On this May 1, the American Friends Service Committee will join them in cities from Concord, New Hampshire, to San Diego, California. It's not only workers without the right papers who suffer; when employers can get away with exploitation, the whole workforce suffers and deplorable conditions ripple through the entire labor market. Immigration reform legislation offers the prospect of ending such exploitation, by providing a path to citizenship for qualifying individuals and a provisional legal status along the way. This would enable workers to stand up for their rights without fear of deportation simply for being an unauthorized worker. That could be one of the outcomes of passing the ""Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act,"" the official name of the massive immigration bill now pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee. For future immigrants, the creation of a new visa category, the W visa, would provide opportunities for low-skilled workers to move from one employer to another without losing the authorization to work. This category would ensure that pay levels are set between minimum wage and medium wage for the particular job, and also would require that labor recruiters be registered and regulated. Additionally, holders of ""W"" visas would be able to seek Legal Permanent Residency for themselves and their immediate family members. The bill also would create a ""blue card,"" an improvement for agricultural workers. Those who qualify for these visas would be offered a faster track to permanent residency status. The bill is not without problems, such as the provision that mandates that all employers, public and private, use the federal E-Verify system, which checks workers' immigration status. This ties access to jobs to a massive data-management system with a long history of errors and abuses. Making participation in this flawed system obligatory as a condition for a immigration bill is misguided and wrong. About 8 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S are workers. They want what workers everywhere want: safe working conditions, fair wages, and protection from abuse. The American Friends Service Committee sees that as a reasonable desire, consistent with a belief that all work should confer dignity on workers, employers, and consumers. As we say in our policy paper, ""A New Path Toward Humane Immigration Policy,"" all workers are entitled to humane polices that protect their labor and employment rights. This year we must take the opportunity to set a long-sought pathway to protection for workers' and immigrants' rights -- so that May Day 2014 can be a day to celebrate the progress we have made together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: On May Day, we celebrate workers and press for fair, humane conditions .

"(CNN) -- Lady Gaga may have to disappoint a lot of her ""little monsters"" in Indonesia after Jakarta police recommended that her sold-out June 3 show not be issued a permit because of security concerns. ""Yes, it is for sure, the promoter will not get a permit to hold the concert,"" National Police spokesman Saud Usman Nasution said Tuesday. The concert promoter, Big Daddy Entertainment, declined to comment on the development. ""Please wait for further official information from us,"" spokesman Alif Ramadoni said. There has been an outcry against Lady Gaga performing among Islamists and conservative Muslims, who say her revealing costumes and sensual dance moves are ""haram,"" an Arabic term that means ""forbidden by Islamic law."" The chairman of the Islamic Defenders Front, Habib Rizieq, said his group could not guarantee what might happen, as far as security goes, if the concert were held. The pop star was given a thumbs-down in March by a ""high-ranking member"" of the country's highest Islamic authority, according to The Jakarta Globe. The report said that Indonesian Council of Ulema chairman Cholil Ridwan was urging Muslims not to attend the overtly sexy and controversial singer's upcoming concert in Jakarta. ""[The concert is] intended to destroy the nation's morality,"" Ridwan told the Globe. Ridwan is concerned that the singer's revealing outfits and sexy dance moves will set a bad example for Muslim youths. Newspaper reports said more than 25,000 tickets were sold in the first two hours after the concert went on sale in March. Police said the promoter should not have started selling tickets before getting a permit. This isn't the first bit of controversy during the singer's ""Born This Way"" tour. Gaga also ran afoul of Christian groups in South Korea, prompting the government to ban kids under the age of 18 from attending her show. Ahead of the concert in late April, detractors called it ""pornographic"" and a promotion of homosexuality. Yoon Jung-hoon, a reverend who helped organize the ""Civilians Network against the Lady Gaga Concert"" movement, told the Chicago Tribune that his group collected 5,000 supporters on Facebook. He also advocated a boycott of the show's sponsor, Hyundai Card, in addition to Hyundai Motor Co., Korea's largest automaker. ""Some people can accept this as another culture, but its impact is huge beyond art and debases religions,"" Yoon said. ""Even adults can't see her performance, which is too homosexual and pornographic."" The show went on as scheduled. CNN's Kathy Quiano and journalist Tasha Tampubolon contributed to this report.","The performer's show is under fire from conservative Muslims; police deny her a permit .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President and Mrs. George W. Bush reported taxable income of $719, 274 for the tax year 2007 and paid $221,635 in federal income taxes, the White House said Friday. The White House opened the door to Bush not attending the Olympic opening ceremonies this summer. They contributed a total of $165,660 to churches and charitable organizations. Some of the donations went to the following: the Crawford, Texas, Volunteer Fire Department, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Malaria No More Fund, Martha's Table and a St. John's Church, most likely St. John's Episcopal Church in the District of Columbia, where the Bushes sometimes attend services. Vice President Cheney and his wife earned $2,528,068, the White House said, and owe taxes of $602,651. The Cheneys paid $466,165 in taxes through withholding and estimated tax payments, and will pay the remaining $136,486 upon filing their tax return. Bush's income included salary earned as president and investment income from the trusts in which his and his wife's assets are held. The tax return also reports a $150,000 advance received by Laura Bush for the children's book she co-authored with daughter Jenna. Laura Bush donated all net proceeds from the advance to Teach for America and the New Teacher Project, the White House statement said. Cheney's income included his government salary of $212, 208 and a pension of $32,500 from Union Pacific Corporation, of which he is a former director. His wife, Lynne, earned a salary from the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, and reported book royalty income and a pension of $32,000 from Reader's Digest, of which she formerly was a director.

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- As community members sought emotional healing in the wake of the shooting spree at a religious service, police said Tuesday they had not identified a motive or found any telltale writings or note left by the gunman. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards also said family members of Wade Michael Page, 40, have not reported observing any warning signs. Page, an Army veteran who neighbors say played in a far-right punk band, was the lone gunman in the Sunday rampage at a Sikh temple, Edwards said. Page was shot to death by police responding to the attack. According to Edwards and the FBI, authorities have received tips that Page might have links to the white supremacist movement, but nothing had been confirmed. ""We may end up with just a lot of facts on what he is involved with, who he may be associated with, but we may never know that motive, because he died, and that motive died with him,"" Edwards told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" The chief also said, counter to speculation, Page did not have a 9/11 tattoo. While the FBI has said Page never was the subject of an investigation, he was mentioned in a small number of federal law enforcement reference files in cases going back seven years, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. The official said there is no information to suggest that investigators wanted to open a case on Page, but did not have the evidence to justify it. While Page might have been sympathetic to a certain ideology, there was no evidence he had committed a federal crime prior to the Wisconsin shooting, the official said. The official did not provide details about the nature of the cases in which Page's name was mentioned. For a third consecutive night, mourners and supporters held a vigil Tuesday night to remember the six victims, pray for the wounded and grapple with grief and shock. People lit candles in an Oak Creek park and stood together in solidarity. Remembering the victims . Tales of heroism, putting others first . The Sikh American community called for a national moment of silence on Sunday. A posting on the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund's website asked for observances at churches, mosques, synagogues and other places of worship. It said the community hopes such a gesture ""will send the message of blessings for all, and that we stand united against hate and intolerance and as part of a common humanity."" Bernard Zapor -- the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives special agent in the investigation -- said Monday that the 9mm semiautomatic handgun with multiple ammunition magazines used by the attacker had been legally purchased. Page bought the gun on July 28 at the Shooters Shop in West Allis, Wisconsin, and picked it up two days later. The shooter bought ammunition there and used the shop's range. Shop manager Eric Grabowski and owner Kevin Nugent told CNN Tuesday that surveillance video of Page buying the gun and using it in the range two days later has been turned over to investigators. The suspect did not exhibit unusual behavior while in the store, Grabowski said. The magazine for the handgun holds at least 17 bullets. Explainer: Who are Sikhs? According to a man who described himself as Page's old Army buddy, the attacker talked about ""racial holy war"" when they served together in the 1990s. Christopher Robillard of Oregon, who said he lost contact with Page more than a decade ago, added that when Page would rant, ""it would be about mostly any non-white person."" Page, born on Veterans Day in 1971, joined the Army in 1992 and left the service in 1998, according to Army spokesman George Wright. Page's service was marked by ""patterns of misconduct"" and he received a general discharge due to ""discreditable incidents,"" according to a Pentagon official. Robillard said Page was pushed out for showing up to formation drunk. John Tew, manager of a Harley-Davidson motorcyle store in Fayetteville, North Carolina, told CNN he fired Page from his parts coordinator job in 2004 because Page ""had a big problem with authority"" and with working with women. Tew said he found an application for the Ku Klux Klan on Page's desk the day he was dismissed. A University of Nebraska at Omaha professor told CNN's ""AC360"" on Tuesday evening that he knew Page while doing research on extremist groups about 10 years ago. Page told him he started identifying with neo-Nazis during his time in the military, Pete Simi said. The former soldier told him he believed the deck was stacked against whites, Simi said, adding he believed Page drank excessively. Two neighbors of Page identified him in photos that showed him playing in the far-right punk band ""End Apathy"" with Nazi flags hanging near him. The gunman's former stepmother spoke of a very different Wade Page she once knew before losing touch with him more than a decade ago, when she and Page's father divorced. ""It's like I don't even know that person,"" Laura Page said of more recent photos of Page. ""It is not someone I ever could possibly know or be associated with."" She told CNN that the Page she knew was gentle and loving and had black and Hispanic friends. Sikh community continues to blend in, stand out . Sunday's attack in Oak Creek occurred 16 days after a gunman killed 12 people and wounded scores at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The six victims of Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and one woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. A wake and visitation are scheduled for Friday morning. The wounded police officer, identified as 51-year-old Lt. Brian Murphy, also was in critical condition after suffering nine gunshot wounds, the police chief said, and had a ""promising,"" but long, recovery ahead. A Sikh human rights group said it would give Murphy a $10,000 reward. Sunday's attack occurred about 10:30 a.m., when temple members were reading scriptures and cooking food in preparation for the main Sunday service and community lunch. According to witnesses, the gunman started shooting in the parking lot, killing at least one person. He then entered the temple and continued firing, they said. Oak Creek Mayor Stephen Scaffidi said that he spoke with Aurora's mayor to get some advice on how to cope with the tragedy. ""He gave me some pointers and some suggestions on how to not only deal with the immediate, but how we deal with the next few weeks,"" Scaffidi said, pointing out that the Colorado town was in its third week of coping. ""We're not going to let this define us; we'll never let it define us,"" Scaffidi said. ""There are a lot of great people here, and we're not going to let this get in the way.""

"(CNN) -- The KCR train sped north through Hong Kong's New Territories, on its way to the city's border town crossing with mainland China. The spectacular towers and gates of Pingyao, which lie within the perimeter walls, are almost never out of sight. The Kowloon Tong to Lo Wu rail journey took just 35 minutes, and after clearing Hong Kong and Chinese mainland immigration, I stepped out into the bustling metropolis of Shenzhen and looked for a taxi to the airport. The wait was short; the city's full of red battered and tired-looking vehicles and I was soon negotiating with a driver. Forty minutes and 120 yuan ($15) later, I departed the cab and entered Shenzhen airport for my journey to Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi province. The flight had been uneventful -- check-in was a breeze and the Boeing 737 had taken off for the three-hour trip north on time. But just before we started our final descent, flight attendants stood in the aisle and took passengers through a bizarre mini aerobic program, all accompanied to Chinese opera. Arms flailed, necks stretched and torsos bent as every passenger attempted to reduce their chances of being hit by deep-vein thrombosis. By the time I checked into my hotel in Taiyuan, darkness had fallen. The three-star abode was passable, though the room's TV carried not one single English channel. How would I survive without CNN, I fretted. I headed out for a walk, on the way passing two female hotel attendants who gave me a city map and some basic information in broken English. Established during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty in 497 B.C., Taiyuan today is a fairly nondescript, industrial city known for its steel and coal production. But wandering into the town's heart, it soon struck me that I was in the ""real"" China, as opposed to expatriate-weary Hong Kong. A double-take here, an odd smile and nod there, confirmed that the slickness of Causeway Bay and the uppity pretensions of Lan Kwai Fong were now far behind. Upon checking out early the next morning I was greeted by the same two hotel workers from the previous night. Didn't they ever sleep? Thankfully not -- they proved true gems by writing a note in Chinese, which requested my train ticket to Pingyao. The written note worked a treat with the ticket master, and after paying just 8 RMB ($1) for the fare, I was following the hordes towards a stadium-like waiting room. Hundreds of passengers, sitting in plastic bucket seats, awaited the boarding announcement. Craggy-faced men passed the time by smoking; families by sharing a pre-prepared meal with their children; others by reading decaying newspapers that looked as if they'd gone to press months before. The boarding call announced, the throngs rushed for the non-air conditioned train carriages. I joined the crush and quickly found seat 084. My seat -- essentially a plank of wood with some back support -- placed me next to a window that, no matter how hard I tried, would not budge open. Thankfully, fresh air began circulating once the train got under way. Outside Taiyuan's city limits, the views quickly changed from harsh industrial wastelands to agrarian vistas of sowed fields and hard-grown crops of corn. Two hours and 100 kilometers (62 miles) later, the train neared one of China's most delightful attractions -- the magnificent World Heritage-listed city of Pingyao. The origins of the town date back more than 1,600 years, but it's the center's Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) layout, still largely intact, that greets the traveler. Ancient 12-meter (40 foot) high walls ring the city over a perimeter of six kilometers (3.7 miles). Thought to have been constructed in 1370, they are possibly the best-preserved example of this kind in China. The city's also known for its prominence as a past financial center. In the early 19th century, Pingyao boasted many money institutions, among them the Rishengchang -- considered China's first bank. A 20-minute taxi ride from the train station delivered me first to the perimeter walls, and then to the car-free town center. I was quickly struck by the laid-back vibe and friendly atmosphere, and was soon checking into one of the town's many 17th and 18th century courtyard-styled guesthouses. Guo Huili, a 19-year-old local who worked at the accommodation, checked me in and showed me my quaint digs -- a Ming-furnished room decorated with scented candles and plenty of choices of fragrant tea.  Listen to Guo Huili and view Pingyao's stunning streetscapes » . As impressed as I was with my initial introduction to Pingyao during daylight hours, it's at night that the city truly shines. If you've ever seen Zhang Yimou's wonderful ""Raise the Red Lantern"" (filmed near Pingyao in 1991), you'll understand. Red and other colored lanterns, small and large, blaze at every step along the cobbled streets, which are lined by shops selling all types of knick knacks. The spectacular towers and gates, which lie within the perimeter walls, are almost never out of sight -- all bathed in an atmospheric golden light. The absence of cars and hawkers, little tackiness and an incredibly relaxed atmosphere (at least for Chinese standards) means Pingyao hasn't turned into a tourist circus -- yet. I strolled around for hours, taking in the sites and losing myself in the historic ambience and classic architecture before the day's weariness began taking affect. It was time to retire back to my room to try that fragrant tea. Part 2: Pingyao to Xian .","One of China's best attractions is the World Heritage-listed city of Pingyao .

"(CNN) -- While the spread of assault rifles is fueling heated discourse in the United States, nations around the world are grappling with a similar debate involving weapons, particularly automatic rifles. Combat weapons are flowing with relative ease worldwide, intensifying bloody power struggles between brutal regimes and opposition groups, and leaving innocent civilians dead. This week, 193 nations will gather at the United Nations in New York City to negotiate a global treaty to limit their trade across international borders, a resolution supported by the United States. Agreement on the Arms Trade Treaty is not a sure thing. In July 2012, representatives left the negotiation table without one. An international rights group came out in support of the treaty Tuesday and issued a report depicting how the flow of arms in some countries escalates tensions into bloody violence. Small arms abound . An AK-47 may look like a big gun to most people, but in conflict regions, they are referred to as ""small arms."" The term includes most hand-held weapons such as hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. They are easier to transport and use than a tank or artillery. They are also cheaper to buy, and they have spread rapidly, according to the United Nations, which refers to them as the ""weapons of choice."" ""The illicit circulation of small arms, light weapons and their ammunition destabilizes communities, and impacts security and development in all regions of the world,"" the U.N. said. In many parts of the world, automatic assault rifles make their way at a dizzying pace into the hands of gangs, rebels, pirates and terrorists. ""They can all multiply their force through the use of unlawfully acquired firepower,"" the U.N. said in a statement. Widespread proliferation of such handy weapons fuel armed conflict, crime and violations of human rights, according to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Ivory Coast's arms race . Weapons buildups by factions within countries can drive nations to war with themselves, Amnesty International said in its report on the bloody conflict in the African nation of the Ivory Coast in 2010-2011. In populations divided by deep ethnic, religious or political tensions, easy access to arms can stoke distrust and paranoia, Amnesty said. This can put peace further out of reach and deepen divisions. The country's military split in 2002, dividing the nation politically into two sides: north and south. Then-president Laurent Gbagbo began stockpiling arms to raise his level of power over that of his opponents, Amnesty said. His purchases included small arms and heavier weaponry such as tanks, warplanes and drones. Despite a voluntary moratorium on arms imports, the rights group said, Gbagbo bought weapons from various continents, including Asia and the Middle East. Chinese, Bulgarian and Ukrainian weapons flowed into the nation. ""Those arms transfers were highly irresponsible, as they took place in the context of a fragile cease-fire,"" Amnesty said. The purchases fueled fear among Gbagbo's opposition, which also armed up. The opposition had Polish, Chinese and Russian small arms, Amnesty said, escalating the weapons buildup of both sides. In 2004, the U.N. attempted to stem the flow of weapons with an international embargo -- to no avail. Escalation to armed conflict . In November 2010, Gbagbo lost in a presidential election, to rival Alassane Ouattara, but refused to cede power. The government's weapons came out. Soldiers gunned down opposition protesters in the streets, and Ouattara and his loyalists started an armed campaign to oust Gbagbo. Hundreds died; many more were wounded, and hundreds of thousands fled to neighboring countries. Many women and girls were raped, according to the report. The United Nations intervened militarily and Ouattara's troops took power by force in April 2011. Both sides committed atrocities, Amnesty said, including the summary killings of ""men and boys who were singled out based on their ethnicity or political affiliation."" Widespread weapons problematic . Abuses still go on, partly because of the high number of weapons still in the country. They ""continue to fuel grave human rights abuses and violent crime in the country,"" Amnesty said. Amnesty supports the U.N.'s efforts and expressed hope that the world's nations will agree on the Arms Trade Treaty. Ban wants the treaty to cover all conventional weapons, ""from small arms to tanks to combat aircraft."" The treaty has been in the works since 2006, when the U.N. General Assembly requested all countries to submit their views on a binding arms trade treaty. That year, the United States, under the George W. Bush administration, voted against the resolution that started the process. But the Obama administration later reversed that decision. The U.N. estimates that in 2010, more than 27 million people were still internally displaced because of armed conflict.","193 nations meet in New York this week to discuss an arms treaty .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that a proposed ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons has no chance of passing the chamber, but he wants to ensure a vote on it will occur. The proposal to update a similar 1994 ban that expired a decade later was one of four measures passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to the Connecticut school massacre in December. Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters he won't keep the proposed ban in gun legislation heading to the full Senate for consideration because including it would guarantee the measure would be blocked by a Republican filibuster. The ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and fiercely opposed by the National Rifle Association, Republicans and some Democrats would get fewer than 40 votes, Reid said, far below the threshold needed to defeat any filibuster or pass the Senate. What's in Feinstein's gun bill? Instead, Feinstein could propose the ban as an amendment to the gun legislation on the Senate floor in order to get a vote on it, Reid said. President Barack Obama supports Feinstein's proposal. The other proposals passed by the Judiciary Committee would expand background checks on gun sales, toughen laws against firearms trafficking and straw purchases, and design steps to improve school safety. Reid's move doesn't come as a surprise as he has signaled for weeks he would only allow a vote on an assault weapons amendment. ""I have to get something on the floor,"" Reid said. Feinstein said she was ""disappointed"" with Reid's decision, which he told her about in a private meeting on Monday. Feinstein: NRA is 'venal' She acknowledged that other provisions of a gun-control package might have a better chance of passing without the controversial assault weapons ban. ""The enemies on this are very powerful,"" Feinstein said. ""I've known that all my life."" Nevertheless, Feinstein said the issue was very important to her and she would not stop pursuing it. ""I'm not going to lay down and play dead,"" she told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, told CNN the proposed ban would make crafting broader legislation harder to accomplish. ""Harry is trying to put together a base package that will get 60 votes on the floor,"" Durbin said. It is unclear, however, if any of the measures ultimately would clear the Senate. ""All these issues are important and I'm going to what I can to make sure we have a fair, sound debate on this,"" Reid said. ""I want something to succeed."" Reid said he would schedule floor debate shortly after the Senate returns from its upcoming recess in April. Feinstein describes feelings during exchange with 'arrogant' colleague .

"(CNN) -- In 2007, at the dawn of the app market, few would have predicted the industry would soon become a billion dollar business. But thanks to the popularity of Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and other smartphone platforms, the app business is booming. Mobile phone apps are expected to generate $25 billion in worldwide sales in 2013, up 62% from last year, according to new research from Gartner Inc. The study was first reported by the Wall Street Journal Monday. The exponential growth mirrors that of smartphones -- for the first time this year, more smartphones are forecast to be shipped globally than feature phones, according to a report released Monday by IDC, the technology market research firm. IDC projects that vendors will ship 919 million smartphones this year -- 50.1% of total mobile phone shipments. ""Much of the world's smartphone shipments were a direct result of demand in mature economies such as the U.S.,"" IDC wrote. ""The balance of smartphone demand is gradually shifting, however, to emerging markets where smartphone user bases are still relatively small and economic prospects are considerably higher."" China is leading the charge in the developing world, passing the U.S. last month to become the world's top country for Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets, according to Flurry Inc., a mobile analytics firm. That's helping to feed the app frenzy. Apple and Google now have more than 700,000 apps in their respective app stores. The time people spend using apps is growing, too. From December 2011 to December 2012, time spent by app users in the U.S. grew from 94 minutes to 127 minutes a day, according to Flurry. The new ""app economy"" has created about 466,000 jobs in the U.S. from 2007 to 2012, according to a study last year by TechNet. But the explosion of smartphone applications will likely decrease the odds for bedroom developers dreaming of app riches. ""You do still see the success stories but they are fewer and farther between,"" Mashable's Christine Warren told CNN. ""A lot of it has to do with luck,"" she said. ""Having a well-designed app, an app that works well with mobile so it takes advantage of the camera, it takes advantage of geolocation features, it can connect in with other apps and services -- that goes a long way. Catching the attention of the right websites and ""staying in the top 10, top 50 of the best selling list goes a long way toward long-term success,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Ireland's economic problems were expected to dominate Wednesday's regular meeting of European Union economic and finance ministers in Brussels, Belgium. Irish leaders have said their treasury is funded through the first half of 2011, but there are still fears its financial sector could collapse under the weight of its massive debt. ""We are now engaged in short-term and effective consultations with the Irish government, together with the European Central Bank and the IMF (International Monetary Fund) in order to assess the real situation of the banking sector and the needs of reorganization and potential consequences of that,"" said Olli Rehn, the EU economic and monetary commissioner, as he arrived for Wednesday's meeting. That Ireland shares the euro with 15 other European nations has raised concerns its financial problems could affect the common currency and the wider EU. External support to bail out Ireland is one option being considered, but the country must make a request for that to happen -- and Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said so far, he hasn't done so. The European Union and IMF were forced to bail out Greece in May, coming up with a three-year, 110-billion-euro (currently $150 billion) loan to save Greece from defaulting on debt. Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said Wednesday the ministers were ""ready to do something which is necessary"" to help Ireland. ""We start the negotiation with Ireland, with the IMF, with the European Commission, with the ECB and, if necessary, we are ready to act,"" he said as he entered the meeting. At the request of Irish authorities, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with the IMF, ECB, and European Commission to determine the best way for them to provide support. Britain is one of the most exposed European countries to the Irish financial problems, with ""very strong interconnection in the banking sector and financial system between the two countries,"" Rehn said Wednesday. Britain's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, said Wednesday the the country will do what is in its own national interests as regards Ireland. ""Ireland is our closest neighbor, and it's in Britain's national interest that the Irish economy is successful and we have a stable banking system,"" he said in a statement. ""So Britain stands ready to support Ireland in the steps that it needs to take to bring about that stability."" Cowen said he remains committed to reducing the country's deficit to below 3 percent of gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of a nation's economy -- by the end of 2014. Ireland is forecast to run a deficit of 11.9 percent of its GDP in 2010, and overall, the country is grappling with a running tab of debt that will total 98.5 percent of its entire economy this year, Cowen said. Since 2008, Ireland has enacted strict budget-cutting measures slashing about $20 billion off the country's budget. Cowen now plans to cut an additional $20 billion over the next few years. ""Our revenues and our spending are out of line to the tune of 19 billion (euros, or roughly $26 billion) and this is a gap that is presently being filled by borrowing,"" he said. ""This cannot continue. We must continue along the road of budgetary consolidation which we first embarked upon in 2008.""","Finance and economic ministers are meeting in Brussels .

"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- At 5 a.m. on any given day, Anne Mahlum could be found running the dark streets of Philadelphia -- with homeless men cheering her on as she passed their shelter. But one morning last spring, she stopped in her tracks. ""Running really is a metaphor for life,"" Anne Mahlum says. ""You just have to take it one step at a time."" ""Why am I running past these guys?"" recalls Mahlum, 27. ""I'm moving my life forward every day -- and these guys are standing in the same spot."" Instead of continuing to pass them by, the veteran marathoner sprang into action so they could join her. She contacted the shelter, got donations of running gear, and in July 2007 the ""Back On My Feet"" running club hit the streets. The first day, Mahlum led nine shelter residents in a mile-long run. Today, Back on My Feet has teams in three Philadelphia shelters, including 54 homeless members and more than 250 volunteers. The group has logged more than 5,000 miles. Requirements for shelter residents to join are simple -- they must live in an affiliated facility and be clean and sober for 30 days. Members receive new shoes and running clothes, and teams run together three times a week between 5:30 and 6 a.m. The runners are diverse -- doctors, janitors, students and shelter residents -- but such distinctions aren't apparent. ""All you can tell is who's the fastest,"" says Mahlum. ""You can't tell who's homeless and who's not."" For Mahlum and others, Back On My Feet is more than a running club. ""We're a community of support, love, respect,"" she says.  Watch how the group hits the predawn streets of Philadelphia. » . Runners greet each other with hugs and words of encouragement. While members say they've lost weight, quit smoking and have more energy, Mahlum believes they're also learning important life skills such as discipline and goal-setting that can help them get on the road to self-sufficiency. ""Running really is a metaphor for life,"" she says. ""There is always another mile. You just have to take it one step at a time."" That's something Mahlum herself has learned over the past 10 years as she's dealt with her father's alcoholism. Running has been her therapy, she says. ""I'm learning more about my life through all of this.""  Watch Mahlum recall a troubling moment when she turned to running. » . Back On My Feet also has a job training program for a partner. Three members are taking classes, learning computer and interview skills, while three others have found jobs. Mike Solomon, an original member, is one of the group's success stories. A former crack user who spent his youth in and out of trouble on the streets of Wilmington, Delaware, Solomon is employed, in school and training to run a marathon in his hometown. He considers Back on My Feet part of his support group.  Watch Solomon describe how he got off crack and on the run. » . ""Anne is helping people see the hero in themselves,"" says Solomon. Mahlum aims to have Back On My Feet in 10 local shelters by the end of the year and expand beyond Philadelphia in 2009. She believes her approach could be part of a solution to homelessness. ""Do we need homes? Yes. We need jobs? Yes,"" she says. ""But imagine if you didn't have anybody in your life who said, 'I'm really proud of you.' Back On My Feet does just that.""","Philadelphia marathoner found herself running past homeless shelter every day .

"(CNN) -- At 5.30 a.m. an urgent knocking jolted me from sleep. Standing at my compartment door, a frantic-looking female train attendant pointed out the window. The windows in my Turpan hotel room had distinct Islamic artwork and patterns. We'd halted at a station, and from the worried expression on her face, I knew it was my stop. Once again, a breakdown in communication had caused mischief. Not 12 hours before, the same attendant had told me, at least I thought she'd told me, I'd arrive at 7.30 am. Thankfully I'd packed before going to sleep, and was able to quickly depart the train into the cool dessert air in the small juncture town of Daheyan. My overnight train journey had taken me from Gansu into Xinjiang province -- China's most western region, and its largest, comprising almost 20 percent of the nation's area. It's also home to the country's ethnic Uighur population, a people of Turkic descent who follow Islam, giving the area a cultural flavor more attuned to Central Asia than anything lying east. In the station's parking lot I'd agreed on a fee of 80 RMB ($10.50) to share a taxi with three young Uighur men on the 60-kilometer (37-miles) journey south to the oasis town of Turpan, which was used as a stopover on the northern Silk Road for centuries. The driver pushed a cassette tape into the car's 1970s-era stereo system with pleasant results. Soothing Islamic folk music oozed out from the rear speakers -- a perfect mood setter as we traveled along the desert highway at dawn. The Turpan Basin, at 154 meters (505 feet) below sea level, is second only to the Dead Sea as the world's lowest depression. The descent wasn't noticeable as the taxi arrived into Turpan proper, but my first impressions probably were -- I was scowling. I'd expected dusty, rustic streets with wayward farm animals and quirky bazaars within a small town center. Instead, I was greeted by drab Soviet-era architecture and bustling traffic in what appeared to be a large, sprawling city. I immediately longed for Dunhuang. After checking in to a hotel and heading out to explore properly, I was glad to see the old adage of scratching beneath the surface ring true. Slowly but surely, Turpan began showing itself as a true gem. Walkways around the city were more often than not grapevine-lined trellises, making a stroll both picturesque and cool -- an important feature in China's hottest city. The people were intriguing; Chinese were evident, and of course Uighurs, who looked like a cross between Mongols and Afghanis. Uighur men often wore Islamic skullcaps, and women scarves, but there was no full-on head gear such as burqas. The fusion of over two millenniums of Silk Road trade has left an extraordinary melting pot of ethnicities and cultures. Islamic features appear both subtly and prominently throughout the town, including in its architecture (many buildings use domes as roofs), while the windows in my hotel room had distinct Islamic artwork and patterns (see photo). The day had ran away from me and since it was nearing dinner, I decided to head into one of the town's bazaars. I tried some tasty lamb samosas, and an interesting cold rice dish that was mixed with vegetables and fruit, for just 10 RMB ($1.30). I sat and ate my meal next to a Uighur man, whose initial look of sternness quickly gave way to a friendly smile and an offer to share some of his food. His traditional bread, covered in patterns as intricate as any 14th century mosaic, was delicious. After arriving back at my digs, I noticed a flyer advertising a Uighur folk performance for that night to take place just across from my hotel. I showered and headed over and experienced one of the best cultural performances of my life.  Listen to the show's music and look at the stunning photos » . The next morning I arranged a day's sightseeing with my hotel, and was almost immediately greeted by my guide, Omar. The tour, which included the Grape Valley, a karez (a subterranean water system), the Emin Minaret mosque, and the ancient Jiaohe Ruins, cost 100 RMB ($13). On our outward drive, Omar, an Uighur, told me about his great-great-grandfather who'd traveled from his homeland in Kazakhstan to Turpan to fight the Chinese. The battle was lost, but the heartbreak didn't end there -- he returned home, only to find Russia had taken over his country. Homeless, he traveled the region, finally settling in what is now far western China. A moderate Muslim (he hates extreme Islamic groups such as the Taliban, and laments how Sunnis and Shiites are killing each other in Iraq), Omar isn't upbeat about living under Chinese rule. ""I'd love to see an autonomous Uighur state,"" he says. ""But the Chinese have been too strong for centuries, and they're set to get even stronger."" For a few reflective moments, Omar drove silently. Then, as we neared the first part of our itinerary, he began telling me about his region's wonders.  View some of Turpan's best highlights, and read about their history in our photo gallery » . Totally spent after the day's tour with Omar, I conjured up enough energy to make the last of my travel bookings, from Turpan to Urumqi. I decided to use the taxi driver from Daheyan. The front desk of my hotel helped translate the deal, and we agreed on 300 RMB ($39) for the three-hour drive to Urumqi's airport. The next morning the driver brought along his sister and a friend for the journey. Neither had ever been outside of Turpan, and were excited about their trip. The road to Urumqi was excellent, with straight stretches as long as 30 km (18 miles). But as we hit the halfway mark, the sunshine and intense blue skies so prevalent in Dunhuang and Turpan gave way to gray ceilings once more. I knew from the research I'd done on Urumqi not to expect much, and as it turned out, it was correct. It was big and soulless, with its main claim to fame being the furthest city in the world from an ocean. Yet I was struck by just how close I was to other countries -- about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north to Russia and west to Kazakhstan -- and how far away I was from China's major cities such as Xian (2,500 km/1,550 miles) and Beijing (3,700 km/2,300 miles). From here, you could also proceed south to the ancient Silk Road trading town of Kashgar -- if you don't mind a 24-hour bus or train journey. But for me, it was a five-hour flight back to Shenzhen, and the normalcy of everyday life in Hong Kong.","Xinjiang province is home to the China's ethnic Uighur population .

"(CNN) -- Comedy scares people in power. We saw a disturbing example this week when Egyptian TV host and comedian Bassem Youssef, frequently described as Egypt's Jon Stewart, was charged with the crimes of mocking Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy and insulting Islam. If convicted, Youssef could be fined and sentenced to prison. Now, before you quickly categorize this incident under the catch all, ""They hate us for our freedoms"" crap, let's not forget our own history. Comedy legend Lenny Bruce was arrested not once but eight times, in the early 1960s for telling jokes that were considered obscene. However, Bruce's lawyer argued that the comedian was not being prosecuted for his profanity but rather for mocking political leaders and religion. In 1964, Bruce was convicted of violating New York's obscenity laws and sentenced to four months of hard labor. Being sentenced to hard labor is doubly painful since comedians go into comedy to avoid hard labor. Bruce tragically died of a morphine overdose in 1966 while the appeal to his criminal conviction was pending. Today, a comedian in the United States is unlikely to be criminally prosecuted for profanity, mocking elected officials or ridiculing religion. (If they could, Bill Maher and countless others would probably be on death row.) While some of our elected officials may hate being the target of comedians' barbs, none would argue that jokes are a threat to our nation. In the Arab world, however, stand-up comedy and satirical political comedy shows like the one Bassem Youssef hosts are a very new development. There's a great fear in the region that this form of entertainment will undermine political leaders. I have witnessed this anxiety firsthand while performing stand-up comedy across the Middle East. The crowds are usually amazing. But we comedians are advised by show promoters to avoid telling jokes mocking the political leaders and religions -- not just Islam, but also Christianity and Judaism. And of course, no sexual humor or profanity. I know many of you are thinking: So what's left to talk about? Actually, plenty. As comedians, we are accustomed to tailoring our acts to fit certain ""special"" shows. In fact, while performing at a corporate event in the United States -- such as for employees at an annual corporate retreat -- one will generally encounter similar content boundaries: No jokes about politics, sex and religion, plus, keep it clean. (Hmm, funny how U.S. corporations and Middle Eastern governments impose the same content restrictions.) But believe it or not, in the last few years the leash on comedians performing in the Middle East has loosened. For example, in certain countries, we had to write our comedy material out word for word so local government authorities could review it for appropriateness before a show. Those days are gone. No one asks for scripts any longer, because the people in power have apparently become more comfortable with stand-up comedy. Some comedians have started to push the boundary by using some profanity and sexually suggestive material. But Bassem Youssef did more. Inspired by Jon Stewart, he performed jokes about the president of Egypt by name, even mockingly dressing like him in sketches. To us, this is commonplace, but in Egypt this was unheard of. Keep in mind that until recently, Egypt was ruled by Hosni Mubarak, who limited public dissent in his almost 30 years of rule. I always knew an Arab Jon Stewart or Chris Rock would emerge and use comedy to skewer political leaders. Youssef has become that icon. But now he's paying for his boldness. The question is: Will Morsy move Egypt toward embracing democracy and freedom of expression? Or will he take a step back and follow the policies of Mubarak? Being a democratic nation entails much more than simply having elections -- it means vigilantly guarding freedom of expression, including the right of all people -- comedians, journalists, bloggers, critics -- to poke fun or disagree with the government. So far, early signs are not hopeful. The U.S. embassy in Cairo tweeted out a link to a segment from Monday night's ""The Daily Show"" in which Stewart defended Youssef. The office of Egypt's president responded swiftly via Twitter: ""It's inappropriate for a diplomatic mission to engage in such negative political propaganda."" President Morsy should make it clear that the revolution in Egypt truly ushered in democracy, and along with it freedom of expression. Otherwise, the new leadership will be perceived as just another oppressive government. The world awaits Morsy's response. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Bassem Youssef was charged with mocking Egypt's president and insulting Islam .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A Paralympic gold medal winner will not be allowed to compete in the Beijing Olympics later this year after athletics' governing body ruled that his specially-designed prosthetic limbs gave him an unfair advantage over other runners. Paralympic champion Oscar Pretorius competed in two able-bodied athletics meetings in 2007. The International Association of Athletics Federations ruled that Oscar Pistorius' shock-absorbing carbon-fiber prosthetics gave him a ""demonstrable mechanical advantage"" compared to able-bodied athletes. Pistorius, nicknamed the ""Blade Runner"" because of his prosthetics, won gold in the 200 meters and a bronze medal in the 100m at the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens. The 21-year-old South African, who lost his legs when he was a baby, has since competed in two able-bodied races in which he finished second and last. In November, the IAAF carried tests on Pistorius over two days at the German Sport University in Cologne to determine if his prosthetic limbs, known as ""cheetah"" prosthetics, could be considered a technical aid. A team of more than 10 scientists used high speed cameras, special equipment to measure ground reaction forces and a three-dimensional scanner to record body mass. The IAAF determined that Pistorius was able to run ""with about 25 per cent less energy expenditure"" than other sprinters, it said in a statement released on its Web site Monday. ""The positive work, or returned energy, from the prosthetic blade is close to three times higher than with the human ankle joint in maximum sprinting,"" the statement said. ""This means that the mechanical advantage of the blade in relation to the healthy ankle joint of an able-bodied athlete is higher than 30 per cent."" The IAAF completed its report on December 19 and had planned to release its findings last week, but it delayed the announcement to give Pistorius more time to look over the report, said spokesman Nick Davies. Pistorius, who holds the Paralympic world records in the 100m, 200m and 400m, was born without fibulae in his legs -- which were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. The runner finished second in an able-bodied race in Rome in 2007, then came last and was subsequently disqualified for stepping out of his lane in a race in Sheffield, England later the same year. The IAAF said that after the Italian race, evidence suggested an athlete with prosthetic limbs performed differently than an able-bodied athlete, and it agreed with Pistorius that more tests were needed. The IAAF does not prohibit prosthetic limbs in able-bodied sports, but it does ban technical aids. Pistorius is reported to be considering an appeal against the verdict. Athletics South Africa said it would immediately apply the decision which does does not affect Pistorius' eligibility for Paralympic events. ""It's unfortunate because he could have boosted team athletics at the Olympics at Beijing because he had the potential to qualify,"" said Leonard Chuene, president of Athletics South Africa. ""There's not much we can do,"" Chuene added. ""It rules him out with immediate effect. We use the IAAF rule book. If we had our rules and our own competition it would be easier. It is a huge problem."" E-mail to a friend .","Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius ineligible to run at Beijing Olympics .

"(CNN) -- So people are either surprised or snarky about Martha Stewart going onto Match.com to find a guy. What did they think she was going to do: Make a man out of paper machÃ© or cookie dough? Stars and celebrities are no different from anyone else. When they get over a certain age, they stop meeting eligible partners. If a woman does meet someone compelling at a party, she doesn't know if he's available or just wants to play. If she meets him at the office, it might be too complicated. But in general, when men and women get over 50, the odds of just bumping into Ms. or Mr. Right aren't in their favor. So the really committed ones go hunting where the odds are better, and that's online. Willie Sutton famously responded to the question of why he robbed banks by stating, ""because that's where the money is."" Well, that's why boomers are flocking to the web: Other 50 plusers who are looking for love are there. By the way, I don't use the verb flocking loosely; just about every site, Perfectmatch.com, Chemistry,com, OK Cupid and more, report the biggest jump in new people joining their sites are in the 50 and over crowd. But let's not stop at the rise in numbers on the Internet. Let's go to the more interesting fact: they are going online to find love, passion and sex. There, I've said it: Middle-aged men and women and people old enough to be thanked by Willard on the ""Today"" show still want it all. They want to cuddle, kiss, hold hands, get touched in erotic zones and have intercourse. And they don't want you to think that's cute or optional. Their sexual and emotional needs don't die before they do. In fact, a lot of medical evidence indicates that if they do have physical affection, love and sex they will live longer. But if most of these men and women waited for their friends to fix them up or for someone to approach them on the street, they'd most likely be alone forever. And they don't want to be. At 50 they could have another 50 years together. Or they could have 10 rewarding years. I have friends that have been together for four years, since she was 83 and he was 86. They go back and forth and stay with each other in their assisted living apartments. They are in love and no less in love, and in no less fabulous a manner, than when they were with their late spouses. So don't sneer at Martha, at least not for online dating. Applaud her for her bravery and knowing what she wants, without letting pride get in the way. I hope she serves as a role model for all those older men and women whose amorous and romantic ambitions have been stifled for fear of ridicule. ""'What will my friends say,"" they ask me, ""if they see me on Senior Friend finder or J Date?"" My answer is: They will say ""Good for you."" At least that's what my friends said when I went online. And then they said, ""Congratulations,"" when I fell in love and got engaged.

"(CNN) -- There's been a lot of talk lately suggesting that the era of taking your shoes off when you pass through airport security may be coming to an end. That sounds great, but I wouldn't get too excited just yet. This may be a ray of hope for those looking for a less burdensome air travel security experience, but it's really just a tiny piece of what needs to be fixed with security. If it happens, it will only have a very slight impact on the overall experience. The buzz was started by Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security. At an event recently, she said that when it comes to air travel screening, ""one of the first things you will see over time is the ability to keep your shoes on."" So, will this be happening soon? I doubt it. Note the part that says ""over time."" You'll remember that the rule requiring people to take their shoes off when they pass through security came after Richard Reid put explosives in his shoes and tried to light them in flight. He wasn't successful at blowing up an airplane, but he was successful at making security screening more miserable. Traditional metal detectors couldn't catch the explosives, so people were forced to put their shoes on the X-ray belt like everything else. Homeland Security gets mixed reviews ahead of 9/11 anniversary . Why is Napolitano now suggesting that this rule will end? The government has yet to find a technology it considers adequate for scanning shoes while they're still on people's feet. Until that happens, I simply can't imagine any change happening. Maybe this means that a new technology is on the horizon, but we've seen that song and dance before. (Remember the puffer machines?) This sounds like a lot of talk with no real timeline in sight other than some vague promises down the line. Even if it does happen, will it improve the screening experience enough? In the same breath, Napolitano also said, ""one of the last things you will probably see is a reduction or removing the limitation on liquids."" Sigh. So you might be able to keep your shoes on, but you'll still have to pull your laptop out of your bag, limit yourself to a quart-size bag filled with 3-ounce liquids and subject yourself to a variety of screening techniques that use multiple types of machines with seemingly arbitrary rules at every airport. Pistole: Airport security is safer, but no guarantee . Some believe that making security more pleasant will help spur more people to travel. That might be the case if the process speeds up enough to make it worth considering air travel for shorter flights that may not be as competitive with the car today. But just allowing someone to keep his shoes on won't make much of a difference. Until there is widespread belief that there is a convenient, non-intrusive security method that keeps our skies safe, then the number of people willing to travel won't change. Something tells me we aren't going to see any big changes like this for years and years.","Homeland Security secretary: Shoe rule may change ""over time""

"(Health.com) -- Your idea of a good time after a bad day is a scoop of dulce de leche ice cream piled high atop a fudge brownie.

You can comfort yourself with food and stay thin with these simple ground rules. Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat . Why we snack our way happy . ""We're hardwired to eat for emotional reasons,"" May says. ""From the moment you're born and your mother holds you close to feed you, there's an emotional connection between being fed and being loved. That's why it's counterproductive to say to people, 'Just don't do it.'"" The treats we crave most are packed with powerful natural chemicals that bring on pleasure. Chocolate, for example, contains serotonin and another happy-making neurotransmitter, anandamide. And once that double-fudge brownie makes its way to your stomach, your body responds with a rush of endorphins, giving you a kind of snacker's high. Health.com: How to make chocolate a healthy indulgence . Tip 1: Emo-eat only what you love . Before you crack open the Ben & Jerry's, though, do what May calls the ""Four-Really Test"": Ask yourself if you really, really, really, really want it. ""That will help keep you from grabbing whatever is in front of you,"" she says. ""Reach for something you don't really want, and you're likely to eat more of it because it isn't satisfying."" That's the danger of answering a craving with a lighter version of what you want or with something else altogether. Not only does it defeat the purpose of giving yourself a gooey treat -- with the bonus of taking you back to a happy time in a way that only food can -- but it sets you up for a pig-out. ""If I'm not hungry, but I need a little pleasure in my life, isn't it ridiculous to eat a rice cake?"" May asks. ""Not only do I not need that fuel, but it's not even going to give me the pleasure."" At all. Health.com: Boost your mood with these foods . Tip 2: Make it blow your mind . Step away from that laptop, TV, or iPad, so you can focus fully on the treat you want to eat. Here's why: If you don't take a moment to enjoy everything about it, ""then the real reason you're eating it won't be served,"" May explains, and you'll be more likely to give in to other high-calorie foods -- not to mention more of them. Tip 3: Don't eat it on an empty stomach . Even if what you're dying for is a slice of carrot cake, play the part of your mother and tell yourself, Not till you've finished your dinner. ""If you've had a good meal with protein, vegetables, and a healthy fat, your dessert has a better chance of being emotionally satisfying,"" says Julia Ross, director of the Recovery System Clinic in Mill Valley, California, and author of ""The Diet Cure."" ""But a lot of women skip meals to save calories and go straight to dessert, so their blood sugar spikes, then crashes, and they end up going back for seconds and thirds. Over time they aren't saving calories."" Going back for another and another also puts you scary-close to emotional eating's danger zone: overeating. ""There's no harm in meeting any need with food -- unless it becomes chronic or extreme,"" Ross says. Health.com: Eat (yes, eat!) to lose weight . Tip 4: Bag the guilt . It'll strip the pleasure right out of your splurge. ""Nobody should feel guilty if they use food to celebrate or feel comfort,"" Ross says.

"(CNN) -- Family members of two girls last seen riding bicycles near a lake in Evansdale, Iowa, put on a brave face Monday, saying they are ""bracing for the worst, but hoping for the best."" The girls -- 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins and 10-year-old Lyric Cook -- were last seen by their grandmother on Friday when the two, who are cousins, left to go on a bike ride, authorities said. ""We just want our girls home,"" Tammy Brousseau, an aunt to both girls told CNN's ""AC360."" ""We're bracing for the worst, but hoping for the best."" Sitting beside Brousseau during the interview was Misty Cook-Morrissey, Lyric's mother. She said she wanted people to know what the girls are like. ""They're very outgoing. They're very sweet, talkative, they're fun. They smile a lot. They're pretty persistent in the things that they want. They're great, they're really great. You know what I mean?"" she said. K-9s raise alarm while looking for signs of missing Arizona girl, 6 . A massive volunteer search over the weekend failed to locate the girls, and authorities have suspended the volunteer effort. ""Are we going to get answers? I'm not sure,"" Lyric's father, Daniel Morrissey, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""It's just baffling to try to figure out the pieces to the puzzle. Looking at it, it doesn't make any sense."" ""It's just been a nightmare,"" he said. ""It's been a challenge to hold everything together and continue to just keep believing and praying and trusting God that he's got this."" Brousseau, the aunt, also spoke to HLN's Velez-Mitchell, saying she believes her nieces must have been taken by a stranger. ""It's as though they disappeared into thin air in broad daylight,"" she said. Authorities began dragging Meyers Lake over the weekend for a sign of the girls. Their bicycles were located hours after they were reported missing near that lake. The search remains a missing persons case. ""We really have nothing new that I can tell you, other than the fact the search is continuing,"" Rick Abben, chief deputy for the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office, told reporters Monday. ""... We're still looking for both of them. There's no new evidence or anything that's been found."" Nearly 1,000 volunteers helped in the search Saturday, and nearly 900 on Sunday, he said. Calls are coming in to a tip line, he said, and each bit of information is being checked out. Police ask that anyone who may have seen the girls on Friday contact authorities. Abben said the volunteer effort was suspended because authorities did not feel there was a benefit in having more people search. However, he said, ""we can always call those folks back out."" Authorities: Tennessee girls 'within inches' of kidnapper who turned gun on himself . Agents from the FBI and the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation joined the search on Saturday, authorities said. Abben told reporters Monday there was no indication the girls were outside Evansdale, a town of about 4,700 located about 12 miles southeast of Cedar Falls. Nor was there any indication of foul play, he said. ""It's like they vanished,"" he told CNN affiliate KWWL. ""There's just nothing.""

"(Health.com) -- Don't let the ""former teen star"" description fool you: Hilary Duff is one young celeb who truly has it together. You won't find the ex-Lizzie McGuire star landing in the tabloids because of hard-partying ways. Instead, the 23-year-old actress/singer has made headlines by getting married (to pro hockey player Mike Comrie) and adding to her ridiculously impressive resume: In October, the actress/singer released her first book, a young-adult novel called ""Elixir."" Here, Hilary chats with Health about what she loves about writing, which workout she swears by, and her hard-earned secret to body confidence. Q: What's your definition of living healthy? A: Moderation is key. Eating healthily all the time can be boring -- you know, when you take apart the menu and ask for everything on the side? Balance makes me feel good: I feel most healthy when I enjoy small bites of the things I love. I used to feel bad about eating French fries -- I'd think that I had blown my diet. But you have to think, That's OK, I'll eat healthier tomorrow. Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat . Q: What are your favorite good-for-you snacks? A: Recently, I have been eating a lot of vegetables and hummus and fruit -- stuff I never really liked before. If I am hungry before bed, I will grab a handful of blueberries. Greek yogurt is one of my favorite things in the whole world. Sometimes I'll chop up a bunch of veggies and put them in a food processor with Greek yogurt and make a dip. It's better if I snack throughout the day, because if I get hungry, Mike says I get ""hangry,"" which is hungry-angry. It's not good. Q: Do you have any guilty-pleasure foods? A: I love cheese. I would probably eat any kind you put in front of me! And I like healthy things with a high fat content, like dark chocolate and avocado. Health.com: How to make chocolate a healthy indulgence . Q: You're into Pilates, right? A: I was a gymnast when I was little, so I think Pilates is really important to helping me stay long and lean. I try to do it three times a week. I also do circuit training. Before I wasn't doing much cardio -- just Pilates -- and I wasn't getting the same results, so I bumped up my cardio and do circuits probably twice a week. Q: You intensified your workouts (with trainer Harley Pasternak) before your August wedding. Have you kept that up? A: I was kind of burned out afterward, so I relaxed a bit, but now I am starting to feel the effects. I probably won't be as hard on myself, but I do want to stay on top of it. It's a constant battle. Q: What are your tricks for making workouts fun? A: Making sure I work out with people I can talk to. Sometimes my sister [Haylie] and I will work out together, and we laugh the whole time, so it goes by faster. I can also read a script or book while on the elliptical. I joke with Mike that I have better than 20-20 vision. Health.com: Get the body you crave with celeb-inspired workouts . Q: Do you have any health regrets? A: I got pretty skinny when I was between 17 and 19. I don't know what exactly made me get on that kick, but at the time I was starting to become aware of what people said about me and how I looked in pictures. I literally ate nothing but steamed vegetables and broiled or grilled chicken, with nothing else. I was touring at the time, traveling everywhere, and I felt so run down. Not giving your body enough of what it needs is really dangerous. I regret it because I don't think I was happy then. Q: You endured scrutiny about your weight when you were still a teenager. How did you handle that? A: It sucked. I was 16 and my body was still changing and people would say I was too heavy. And then I would lose weight and my face would get skinny and people would say I had done something to my face and that I was too skinny. It must have been really hard because I've blocked it out a little. At the time, I felt almost proud of being skinny, but one day the mother of a fan came up to me and said, ""Are you OK? Are they not feeding you?"" After that, all of a sudden, I stopped being as concerned about everything. It wasn't a big intervention or anything. I got off tour and changed. I started hanging out with my friends and cooking and had a more normal life. Health.com: How do you find your feel great weight? Q: You seem comfortable in your own skin now. What's the key to body confidence? A: I have issues and insecurities just like everybody else. It really helps to have a partner that loves everything about you and makes you feel really beautiful. Not that you should look for other people to make you feel good about yourself, but it does help. Other than that, I really do feel like working out has helped because you're working hard for something. You feel stronger and a little more powerful. There's no trick, though. I hate my arms. Nobody is ever perfect, but it helps to look for things to feel good about, rather than things to feel bad about. Q: Your first novel, ""Elixir,"" came out in October. What made you want to write a young-adult book? A: It was a few years ago, and I asked myself, ""What do I want to do? How can I spend time with Mike?"" I wanted to be able to reach out to my fans, and writing was something creative I could do, even when I was traveling with him. Health.com: 10 ways to make any hotel room healthier . Q: After releasing four albums, you put your music career on hold. Think you'll return to the studio? A: I want to act. That is what I want to focus on more, but it's all about timing and finding the right role. Q: Did any of the older Disney alums give you advice when you were starting out? A: I think people imagine it that way, that you have these deep conversations about how to manage your way through this craziness. I've met Justin [Timberlake] and Britney [Spears] a few times, but it's not like they've said, ""Here, sit down, listen to me kid."" Q: You filmed a threesome scene on ""Gossip Girl"" last season.

"Kaufman, Texas (CNN) -- The family of a Texas prosecutor and his wife who were gunned down in their home demanded Saturday that more be done to solve the killings, saying federal authorities should take over the investigation. Authorities have been tight-lipped about the investigation since the bodies of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were discovered March 30 at their home east of Dallas, two months after McLelland's chief felony prosecutor was killed in a brazen daylight shooting. ""Not enough is being done. They are on edge right now,"" said Chris Heisler, a spokesman for the McLelland children. ""If someone is willing to come out and shoot the district attorney and his wife in their home, their mindset is anything is possible."" Authorities have been working to determine whether the killings of 63-year-old McLelland and his chief felony prosecutor, Mark Hasse, are connected. They have been scouring their case files and interviewing colleagues for help with potential leads. Additional security, meanwhile, is being provided to county officials, including prosecutors. But the McLelland family believes it may be distracting from the investigation. 'Ambush' killings of lawmen in 4 states part of spike in slain police . ""If you're gonna put folks to secure officials, who's doing the investigation? Who's patrolling the streets? Who's keeping the rest of Kaufman County safe? They're just not available,"" Heisler told reporters at news conference. ""... So we need more. Specifically the family wants the federal law enforcement to take the lead on this. That is a specific request from the family."" Heisler said the family, including the five grown children of the McLellands, has ""some anger at this point"" that more is not being done. The family's criticism delivered by Heisler appeared to take Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood, who has described McLelland as a friend and colleague, by surprise. Hunt on for caller behind bomb threat at service for slain Texas DA . McLelland ""never expressed that to me ever,"" Wood said. Asked whether Kaufman County authorities were stretched thin by the two investigations as well as providing security, he said: ""There have been multiple agencies working on this from the beginning to find who is responsible. ... I feel everyone has worked together."" On Friday, one of the McLelland's daughters declined during an interview on CNN's ""AC360"" to comment on whether McLelland ever speculated on who killed Hasse. ""I can't answer that. We don't know anything,"" Christina Foreman, 29, told Anderson Cooper. But she said in the days after the shooting death of Hasse that her parents were concerned about the safety of friends and co-workers than their own. ""They'd want to be remembered that they stood up and that they stood for something,"" Foreman said. ""And they stood for their families, their friends, their neighbor, the rest of Texas, the rest of the country, and we can't let people discourage us from doing that."" Foreman declined to comment on whether McLelland ever speculated on who killed Hasse. Interim Kaufman County DA known as tough court opponent . A day before his body was discovered, McLelland voiced concern about the safety of his staff when he stopped by Helz Firearms, a local gun shop. ""He was in there ... asking about what he should get his co-workers as self-protection,"" said O'Neil Kidwill, the gun shop owner. ""I recommended the .38 Smith & Wesson snub nose and perhaps a bulletproof vest. He said he already talked to some of the people about the vest, and he would tell them about the revolvers."" The county district attorney didn't give any indication that he felt personally threatened, only worried for his employees. ""He was concerned for them. For himself, he was at ease,"" Kidwell said. But sometime after he left the gun shop, something happened. The couple's bodies were found inside their home in Kaufman County. They had been shot at least a dozen times, a law enforcement official, who had been briefed on the investigation, told CNN this week. The official was not authorized to publicly release details of the investigation. While authorities have not publicly named any suspects or a potential motive in the cases, Kaufman sheriff's deputies arrested two men this week and accused them of threatening the safety of public officials.

"Washington (CNN) -- Wayne LaPierre is not a large man. He does not move with the easy assurance of a skilled fighter. His head sits low on his neck, and he seems to turn from the shoulders. His swept-back, graying hair and rimless glasses make him look like a Central Casting accountant who sleeps with a tie on. Yet, in Washington, LaPierre is a heavyweight of the first degree, a brawler who can make even brave politicians toss in the towel at the first sign of a scuffle. The longtime executive vice president and public face of the National Rifle Association faced some of his toughest critics on Capitol Hill Wednesday -- including California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, author of the updated bill hoping to again ban military-style assault rifles -- as he testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing titled ""What Should America Do About Gun Violence?"" He argued that government should focus on enforcing existing gun laws rather than drafting new ones. ""Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals, nor do we believe that government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families,"" he told lawmakers. NRA official to Congress: More gun laws not the answer . The tough champion of the Second Amendment has been taking heat since the NRA came out strongly in favor of armed security in every public school in America, days after the deadly shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. But that's what makes LaPierre so formidable: his unflinching willingness to say aloud what many foes consider outrageous. ""Why is the idea of a gun good when it is used to protect the president of our country or the police, but bad when it is used to protect our children in our schools?"" NRA draws heat over shooting game . That was the head of the National Rifle Association speaking to a room packed with cameras and reporters a week after the Newtown school shooting. He was pushing the idea of armed guards in every school. Critics howled. A headline in New York proclaimed ""Gun Nut!"" while another called him the ""Craziest Man on Earth."" But LaPierre did not even blink, going on ""Meet the Press"" to say, ""If it's crazy to call for armed officers in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy."" For many of his supporters, that had the ring of common sense, and that's what makes Washington nervous. LaPierre has been the leader of the NRA for more than 20 years, turning it into a political juggernaut. The group boasts more than 4 million members capable of pouring money into political races at the drop of a hat. How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . More importantly, NRA fans have proved that they can be relied on to show up at the polls and savage any candidate, Democratic or Republican, who strays from the doctrine of the Second Amendment, as they see it. And LaPierre is the man who commands that political wrath, frequently by unleashing a torrent of scathing accusations against those who would oppose him. A few examples: . • In a 1995 fundraising letter, he referred to federal agents enforcing gun laws as ""jack booted thugs."" • After 1999's Columbine High School massacre, he complained that gun owners in general, and NRA members in particular, were being unfairly portrayed as ""... somehow a reckless, societal, pathogen; a mighty, extremist empire opposed to safety, caution and reason. That is a cruel and dangerous lie."" • In 2000, he suggested that President Bill Clinton was allowing gun deaths to pile up to spur anti-gun sentiment among voters. • When Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot, LaPierre noted that the gunfire came close to a school, a designated ""gun free"" zone, and again he ripped into gun opponents. ""That didn't make any difference. Their laws didn't work. Their lies don't ring true. And if Tucson tells us anything at all, it tells us this: government failed."" NRA clear on gun debate stance: Arm schools . Make no mistake: There is no indication that LaPierre is a loose cannon or someone who does not mind his words. To the contrary, they are chosen with the precision of a marksman. Even if his opponents hate to admit it, he follows an unswervingly clear course with his statements; always attacking, never ceding even an inch, and relentlessly portraying those who would infringe on gun rights as radicals. And he wins. Year after year, for all the bluster around gun issues, the NRA has emerged victorious, galvanizing millions of Americans who feel that government too often overreaches and intrudes upon individual freedoms. Simply put, it is the language of motivation. And when it comes to guns, no one speaks it like Wayne LaPierre.

""The FBI is executing search warrants at various offices at Trenton City Hall, pursuant to an ongoing investigation,"" said FBI spokeswoman Barbara Woodruff. It was not immediately clear why the raids were conducted and authorities declined to elaborate.

He could not be immediately reached Thursday for comment. Mack, a Democrat who began his term in July 2010, has been beleaguered by questions over public finance and accusations of cronyism. Last May, his deputy mayor, Paul Sigmund IV, was arrested and charged with heroin possession and assaulting a police officer, which led to his prompt resignation.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Supporters of a congressional resolution that would have declared the Ottoman-era killings of Armenians ""genocide"" dropped their call for a vote on the measure Thursday. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the resolution's consequences on the war in Iraq would be ""quite dire."" The resolution spurred fierce criticism from NATO ally Turkey, where officials acknowledge the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently object to the designation ""genocide."" Turkish leaders threatened to curtail U.S. access to bases vital to supporting the more than 160,000 American troops in Iraq if the measure passed. The Bush administration, which is trying to persuade Turkey not to launch cross-border raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq, had lobbied aggressively against the resolution as well. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a House committee Thursday that the resolution's consequences on the war in Iraq would be ""quite dire."" The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the resolution earlier this month. But Rep. Rahm Emanuel, the No. 3 Democrat in the House of Representatives, conceded last week that ""the votes are not there"" for the resolution to clear the full House. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, its major sponsors wrote that the measure would pass ""if the timing is more favorable."" Pelosi, D-California, had promised to schedule a floor vote if the resolution made it out of committee, but told reporters Thursday that she accepted the sponsors' request to set the matter aside. Though the sponsors, led by California Democrat Adam Schiff, suggested the measure could be brought back later this year, a senior Democratic leadership aide said the issue is off the table indefinitely. ""This is not going to be taken up until next year at the earliest,"" the aide said. Historians estimate about 1.5 million Armenians were killed by the Ottoman Empire -- the predecessor of modern Turkey -- during World War I. But Turkey, now a secular and democratic Muslim nation, and masses of its people reject the term genocide, viewing the deaths as part of a war that claimed lives among all peoples in the region. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the handling of the issue raises questions about the judgment of Democratic leaders -- ""a pattern that is undermining our national security."" ""Given Turkey's importance in the war on terror, the role it plays in the care of our troops on the ground, and their close alliance with us in NATO, attempting to force a vote on this resolution in the first place was just plain reckless,"" Boehner said in a written statement after the news emerged.

"(CNN) -- A 30-meter- turbine anchored to the seafloor off the Scottish coast is proving that tidal farms are a turn closer to being a viable renewable energy source. Scottish Power completed preliminary trials of the giant undersea turbine in the fast-flowing coastal waters off the Orkney Islands. It found that the turbine produced one megawatt of electricity, enough to power 500 homes and businesses. ""We're very pleased with the initial results and we've operated at full power already,"" says Alan Mortimer, head of innovation at Scottish Power Renewables. If the next stage of testing goes according to plan, Mortimer says that work will soon begin on a fleet of the turbines -- manufactured by Andritz Hydro Hammerfest -- and will be installed at another site in the Sound of Islay off the west coast of Scotland. Although there are examples of similar stand-alone operations in Norway and the UK, the Sound of Islay turbines would be the first large group of its kind anywhere in the world. When fully operational it is estimated to produce electricity for 5,000 homes. Other countries with strong tidal resources and potential sites for tidal power farms include Argentina, Chile, the U.S. and Canada. Compared to offshore wind farms, tidal energy devices like the turbine trialed in Scotland are completely hidden from view. They are criticized for being potentially harmful to marine life, but Mortimer contends that because the turbine's propellers move relatively slowly, the impact on fish and other forms of sea life is minimal. See also: World's oceans are 'plasticized' Scottish Power says that it already has planning consent and a lease for the seabed where the tidal farm will be built. However the main obstacle to the implementation of more tidal farms remains the cost. ""We have publicly stated that we expect the capital costs of the Islay project to be around Â£70 million ($110 million),"" says Mortimer, which equates to roughly $11 million per turbine. The 10 megawatts of power that will be generated by the Sound of Islay turbine farm pales into insignificance when compared to the output of a large nuclear or coal power station, which according to American hydro energy non-profit the Ocean Energy Council, can produce up to 100 times as much electricity. Mortimer is quick to point out that he believes such challenges are inevitable in developing new technologies and that costs would fall and efficiencies improve as the fledgling industry develops. ""The estimate for the UK in terms of wave and tidal is that it could eventually produce in excess of 10% of the country's electricity requirements,"" says Mortimer. ""That's definitely big enough to make it of interest for us to pursue it.""","Scottish Power Renewables has successfully tested a new type of underwater tidal turbine .

"Chicago (CNN) -- The family of a Chicago teenager killed just a week after she performed in President Barack Obama's inauguration supports using her death to help shape the debate over gun control, her father and godfather said Thursday. ""Yes, definitely,"" Hadiya Pendleton's father, Nathaniel Pendleton, said on CNN's ""Early Start."" Pendleton, 15, an honor student and band majorette at Kings College Prep School, died Tuesday after a gunman shot her at a park in what her godfather, Damon Stuart, described as an ""ideal community"" on Chicago's South Side. Giffords: 'Too many children dying' Police have told CNN affiliates that the teenager had no gang affiliation and likely was not the intended target. The issue quickly entered the national discussion over gun control, with White House spokesman Jay Carney referring to it in his daily press briefing and the issue coming up Wednesday in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin cited the girl's death as more evidence of the need for stronger gun control. ""Yesterday, in a rainstorm after school, she raced to a shelter. A gunman came in and shot her dead,"" he said during the hearing. ""Just a matter of days after the happiest day of her life, she's gone."" White House spokesman Jay Carney described her death as a ""terrible tragedy."" Watch: Chicago's 500 homicides in 2012 .

"(EW.com) -- Ben Affleck's C.I.A. thriller ""Argo"" is having quite the box office run. After debuting at number two with $19.5 million, Warner Bros.' Oscar contender dropped by just 16 percent last weekend to $16.4 million. This weekend, the film notched yet another impressive achievement: it climbed to number one with an estimated $12.4 million (a 25 percent drop) in its third frame, becoming the first film since ""True Grit"" to hop to first place in its third weekend. ""Argo,"" which cost $45 million to make, has now earned $60.8 million total, and thanks to terrific word-of-mouth (the film earned an ""A+"" CinemaScore grade) and early awards buzz, Argo is eyeing a $100 million finish. Though it is running a tad behind Affleck's last directorial effort, The Town, which had earned $64.1 million at the same point in its run en route to a $92.2 million finish, Argo is enjoying much better week-to-week holds. (""The Town,"" which opened higher ""Argo"" with $23.8 million, fell 38 percent to $9.7 million in its third weekend.) Sony Pictures Animation's $85 million Adam Sandler-voiced effort ""Hotel Transylvania"" jumped two spots into second place with $9.5 million in its fifth weekend. The film, which has scored slim drops since its robust $42.5 million debut in September, only fell 27 percent this weekend — the final frame before ""Halloween."" It will be interesting to see whether Hotel holds up in the holiday's wake, but it's already a monster hit. With $130.4 million total, Hotel is already Sony Pictures Animation's highest grossing film ever, above Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, which grossed $124.9 million in 2009. It's also given Adam Sandler a much-needed career boost following his back-to-back misfires, Jack and Jill and That's My Boy. The pricey novel adaptation ""Cloud Atlas"" finished in third place with a weak $9.4 million. Remarkably, that was the best start of any of this weekend's newcomers, which is a testament to the weakness of the frame. The heady drama, which follows six separate storylines and stars Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Hugh Grant in various roles, genders, and races, proved too difficult for mainstream audiences to latch onto. Audiences, which were 77 percent above the age of 25, issued the film a ""C+"" CinemaScore. For Warner Bros., ""Cloud Atlas' ""failure is not the worst news — the studio acquired domestic distribution rights for a reported $15 million and marketed the film — but the real losers here are the Wachowski siblings and the foreign investors who financed the project. ""Cloud Atlas"" cost a whopping $100 million, and it has no chance of making that money back — at least not in the States. Another loser? Tom Hanks, whose box office clout has all but disappeared in recent years. Cloud Atlas arrives on the heels of two other box office underperformers: ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" ($31.9 million) and ""Larry Crowne"" ($35.6 million). In fourth, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" dropped by a massive 70 percent — a high point for the Paranormal franchise (PA2 dropped by 60 percent in its second weekend. PA3 fell 65 percent) — to $8.7 million. After ten days, Paramount's $5 million found footage sequel has earned $42.6 million, which is still $10 million less than PA3 grossed in its first weekend. ""Taken 2"" took fifth place, sliding 40 percent to $8.0 million, which gives Fox's $45 million action thriller a $117.4 million total. Though the Liam Neeson vehicle is a huge hit, it's becoming clear that it will not surpass the final $145 million domestic gross of the original ""Taken."" In its fourth weekend, ""Taken,"" which opened with half of what Taken 2 made, earned $11.3 million. ""Taken 2"" is falling much faster. 1. Argo -- $12.4 million . 2. Hotel Transylvania -- $9.5 million . 3. Cloud Atlas -- $9.4 million . 4. Paranormal Activity 4 -- $8.7 million . 5. Taken 2 -- $8.0 million . Outside the Top 5, three new wide releases all performed embarrassingly. Open Road's $20 million videogame adaptation/horror sequel ""Silent Hill: Revelation 3D"" started in sixth place with $8.0 million. The original ""Silent Hill"" surprised analysts with a strong $20.2 million debut in 2006, but it clearly didn't leave enough of an impression on audiences for them to show up for a sequel six years later. Crowds gave the film an uninspiring ""C"" CinemaScore. Two other films did even worse. Paramount's surprisingly edgy Victoria Justice vehicle ""Fun Size"" grossed $4.1 million from 3,014 theaters. The $14 million film garnered a ""B"" CinemaScore grade from crowds, which were 67 percent female and 61 percent below the age of 18. Gerard Butler's new surfing drama ""Chasing Mavericks,"" meanwhile, tanked in twelfth place with $2.2 million from 2,006 theaters, giving it a $1,099 per theater average. Audiences issued the film a ""B+"" CinemaScore. Internationally, ""Skyfall,"" the 23rd picture in the James Bond series, got off to a massive start. The film grossed $77.7 million from 25 territories, including $32.4 million from the U.K. (where the film set a new attendance record on Saturday), $9.1 million from France, and $8.6 million from Russia. According to Sony, Skyfall's start was 76 percent bigger than the launch of Casino Royale, and 30 percent bigger than Quantum of Solace's debut. The film opens stateside on Nov. 9.

"(CNN) -- Solar energy in a suitcase is an invention saving lives around the world in places that lack reliable electricity. Dr. Laura Stachel discovered several years ago that many women and babies were dying during childbirth simply because there wasn't adequate light to treat them. So she and her husband came up with a portable solar energy kit to provide light and power when necessary. Since 2009, their nonprofit, We Care Solar, has given out nearly 250 free kits to medical facilities in Africa, Asia and South America. ""A lot of the clinics don't have any electricity,"" Stachel said. ""Midwives use kerosene lanterns; they may use candles; they use their cell phones to deliver babies."" The ""solar suitcase"" was designed to help during childbirth, but one recently came in handy when there was a cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On his first day with the kit, a doctor from the Congo delivered a woman with twins. The very next day, there was an outbreak of cholera, a deadly bacterial disease. ""Every man, woman and child who came to his clinic over the next 30 days were treated day and night,"" Stachel said. ""And he put 15 mats on the ground outside because so many people needed to be cared for and couldn't fit in the clinic."" At night, Stachel said, the doctor would take the solar suitcase outside and use it to tend to his patients and treat them with intravenous medications. ""For the first time in the history of (the doctor's) island, no one died of cholera,"" Stachel said. ""He told us that in the past, 50% of patients would die, and 80% of those deaths would happen at night."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Stachel says she cried when she heard the story, and she hopes her nonprofit can continue to help more people in need. ""One of the things I do whenever I bring a solar suitcase to a clinic in another country is, I really let the health-care workers know that there are people on the other side of the world who care about them,"" she said. ""I say: 'When you use this suitcase and it's late at night, don't think that nobody's caring about what you're doing. You have sisters and brothers on the other side of the world that cared enough to actually contribute to this and to bring you light. I don't want you to feel alone.""

"(CNN) -- My father was murdered. Shot down on the street in Philadelphia in the 70s. I never had a chance to know him. His name was Edgar Leonard, and he was in his 20s when he was killed. My grandmother, his mother, fell apart after he died. He was her only child. But kids are curious, regardless of the pain their questions may cause grown-ups. I always wanted to know more about my father. My mother wasn't talking. So at 9 years old, I asked my grandmother to tell me about my dad. The first thing she did was show me photos of her son stretched out in his coffin with bullet holes in his head. House Speaker John Boehner and those who support unrestricted gun rights should take a long look at photos like this -- or talk, just once, to mothers who've lost loved ones to gun violence -- before they utter one word about gun control laws. The experience doesn't have to change their position, but I guarantee it will help shape their perspectives and permit more intelligent conversations on the issue. Staring at those photographs, I was horrified. I had nightmares for years about getting shot in the head myself, or what my father thought about as he was dying. My grandmother only saw the handsome, charismatic young man her son once was. Fortunately for me, I have since seen photos of him in happier times: as a chubby baby boy; smiling with his prom date. Who knew why my grandmother showed me. Maybe she wanted me to see the violence that took his life. Or what guns do when not used responsibly. I know she wanted the person who killed her son caught and punished. That didn't happen. Coming from this tragic place has given me an awesome respect and healthy fear of guns. I know how one shot can change lives forever. In my 40-plus years, hardly a day has gone by that I haven't thought about my father and missed the man I never knew. Opinion: Gun control is on all of us . I have lived in a city for the past 25 years, where always I assume anyone can be armed at any time in any place. And I grew up in Connecticut, where is it common to hear gunshots echoing through the woods and see a gutted deer carcass hanging from a tree draining blood. Despite my father's violent death, I vigorously support our right to bear arms. Honestly, I've seen collector guns that are beautiful pieces of craftsmanship. And I'm quite convinced that if I ever felt my or my son's life was in danger, I'd use a gun to protect us both from harm. I pray that I will never have to make that decision. Guns are a part of my world. And it was the unanswered questions about my father's murder, in part, that drove me to become a journalist. I was determined to write about people like my father whose stories would never be told. I've spoken to neighbors, athletes and colleagues, those who own guns and those who never have, about the gun issue, and all seem to fall in the middle. So, I don't quite buy the hard line we're told exists between those Americans for and against gun control. We are not as far apart as Congress or lobbyists would have us believe. None of the people I've spoken to think like gun-crazed NRA lobbyists or gun-hating liberals. Real life is never black and white. The time has come for Americans to take over this conversation and demand sensible solutions that help keep us safe while protecting our Constitutional rights. We are smart enough to do both: to understand that gun ownership comes with huge responsibility. Not everyone is qualified to own or have access to guns, just as not all of us are qualified to drive a car, without some regulation. As President Obama said earlier this week in his news conference: ""with rights comes responsibility."" It's common sense, he said. As predicted, the backlash has begun over the president's executive orders, which call for strengthening current gun laws and taking related steps on mental health and school safety. He also called on Congress to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention. The president has begun a much-needed, difficult conversation. Congress should come up with its own common-sense solutions to curb gun violence if it doesn't like what's on the table. To do nothing would be a national disgrace. Do we really want to live in fear of one another, praying our gun is bigger than the next person's, or that we are quick enough to shoot first? There is no common sense in those gun-happy solutions. Time has come for us all to stop politicians and lobbyists from turning our great democracy into a nation where it is easier to buy a gun than to exercise our right to vote. Somehow, I think our forefathers had something greater in mind for us when they wrote the Constitution. We owe it to them, our children, our mothers and our fathers to try and live up to those great expectations.

"(CNN) -- When rock groups announce that they're going on ""indefinite hiatus,"" usually it's publicist-speak for ""don't hold your breath that they're ever coming back."" But Fall Out Boy beat the odds when they announced that they'd secretly recorded a new album, their first since going on ""indefinite hiatus"" in 2009. Tagged with the tongue-in-cheek title ""Save Rock and Roll,"" the disc promptly shot to the top of the Billboard 200 album chart and debuted at number one on iTunes in 27 countries. CNN recently spoke with singer Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and drummer Andy Hurley about their surprise reunion. CNN:  We thought you guys were on ""indefinite hiatus."" Pete Wentz:  Well, it's ended. It has become definite. Patrick Stump: We did just genuinely mean that we were just going to take a break, like it's supposed to be. Joe Trohman:  I think a lot of people don't understand that we were kids and that some of us grew up in this band, and we needed a little time away from the band. We may have been in our mid-20s or early 30s, but we still felt like we were 17, so we kind of needed to catch up to being whatever age we were by the end. CNN: How did you manage to record the new album in secret? Stump:  There weren't a lot of people knocking down our doors, going, ""When's the next Fall Out Boy record?"" That wasn't a thing that we were really getting pelted with, so we didn't really have any expectations to live up to. Andy Hurley:  Which is nice, because then you make something that you're happy with, and you don't have to do something for this group of people, which is a great way to do it. CNN:  Your first single is called ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark."" Wentz:  The video is pretty cool. It has our buddy (rapper) 2 Chainz in it, basically burning a lot of stuff -- which seemed apt in some way. Stump: 2 Chainz is in his second act, and I think he learned so much from the first time around that he has a total other perspective than a lot of others have. You don't see a lot of artists in any genre who are on time and prepared to work. I think that's something you get with the benefit of hindsight a little bit. CNN:  What are you doing differently this time around? Wentz:  I think that there was a lot of ""ready, fire, aim"" stuff that would go on. It was kind of like, ""Oh, we've got to the do this right now,"" and now I think that we realize it's not so much quantity and constantly saying, ""Yes."" There's the power of ""No"" and doing things the way that you want to do it and making sure quality is the most important aspect. I think at the end of the day, that's what determines your legacy. You can either be a fast food restaurant or you can be making art, and I don't want to flip burgers, really. CNN: How's the communication in the group these days? Trohman: Guys are notoriously bad at emoting and communicating, and I think we had to learn how to do that. But also taking that time apart to be with our families, do other projects, work with different people and experience different things allowed us to come back and realize that maybe we did this thing not so well; maybe we should have talked more; maybe we shouldn't have been so passive-aggressive; maybe this guy should have voiced his opinion more. I think we are better at that, and it has been very healthy for the band. CNN:  Joe, you and Patrick got married. Pete became a dad. How have your personal lives changed things? Trohman: It changes your perspective. We had to pay attention to these people who have been supporting us for so long, have been waiting for us while we've been on the road, and I think they've been waiting long enough. Wentz: I took my kid to preschool today, and he has a friend who is really into music there -- this little kid -- and he was like, ""I want to play Fall Out Boy right now."" And my kid was like, ""I don't. I want to play Justice League."" (laughter) That will keep you grounded. CNN: ""Save Rock and Roll"" just debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. It also went No. 1 on iTunes in 27 countries. Wentz: Wow. How mind-blowing is this? Coming back, we never thought something like that was even possible. At the end of the day, we just put the music out there in the world. We are humbled and thankful for the world's reaction. CNN: Fall Out Boy will be embarking on an arena tour later this year. Wentz: We just announced that we're taking our buddies Panic! at the Disco on tour with us this fall in arenas. A bunch of those -- like Barclay's in New York -- are almost sold out, so make sure you get your tickets so we can hang out and be weird together. Stump: On the subject of arena tours, it's interesting. Sometimes I'll talk to fans, and there's always these different perspectives of ""I like the big rooms"" or ""I like the small rooms."" Wentz:  If you're bummed about the arena tour, you're going to be REAL bummed about the stadium tour! (laughter)","Fall Out Boy has been on hiatus since 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Some foods sold in supermarkets across America contain tiny, engineered particles called nanomaterials. Our organization decided to test doughnuts after learning that the titanium dioxide used as a coloring in the powdered sugar coating likely contained nano-sized particles. The tests, conducted by an independent laboratory, found that both Dunkin' Donuts Powdered Cake Donuts and Hostess Donettes did indeed contain titanium dioxide nanoparticles. In response, a spokeswoman for Dunkin Donuts said the company was looking into the matter. You must be wondering: What are nanomaterials? They are microscopic in size. ""If a nanoparticle were the size of a football, a red blood cell would be the size of the field."" Nanoparticles have been heralded as having the potential to revolutionize the food industry -- from enabling the production of creamy liquids that contain no fat, to enhancing flavors, improving supplement delivery, providing brighter colors, keeping food fresh longer, or indicating when it spoils. But there are a few problems. One is that no one knows how many and which food products have them. Companies are not being forthcoming about whether they are using nanoparticles. To further complicate the issue, some companies may not even be aware that they are selling products containing them. Many companies are reluctant or uninterested in discussing the issue, and concrete information has been difficult to obtain. The majority of food companies are not responsive in providing information about their specific uses, plans and policies toward nanoparticles. There is also no law in the United States that requires disclosure. In contrast, companies in the European Union are required to label foods containing nanoparticles. The bigger issue with nanoparticles is that they might pose health risks, as they have been found to in tests on mice. There are not nearly enough studies that can adequately demonstrate the safety of nanoparticles in food additives or packaging. Scientists are still investigating how the broad range of nanoparticles, with their myriad potential uses, would react in the body. When ingested, nano-sized particles can pass into the blood and lymph, where they circulate through the body and reach in potentially sensitive sites such as bone marrow, lymph nodes, the spleen, the brain, the liver and the heart. Our knowledge about how nanomaterial food additives react in the body and their health impact is still in its infancy. While efforts are under way to understand them better, much deeper scientific inquiry should occur before nanoparticles are sold in food and food-related products. More companies and consumers need to be aware of the use of engineered nanomaterials in foods and the potential unknown risks of this technology. More food products like M&M's and Pop-Tarts should be tested as recent studies have identified them as likely to contain nanomaterials as well. Fortunately, a few companies have become willing to take a public position on nanoparticles. McDonald stated that it ""does not currently support the use by suppliers of nano-engineered materials in the production of any of our food, packaging, and toys."" Similarly, Kraft Foods said that it was not using nanotechnology. Some of the largest food companies in the world, including YUM! Brands, PepsiCo, and Whole Foods, need to know more about nanomaterials and check with their supplies to see if they are using them. Americans are becoming increasingly interested in what is in the food they're eating. No longer content with label information on daily allowances of vitamins and minerals, U.S. consumers are following the lead of their counterparts in many other countries by demanding more disclosure about where and how their food is grown and whether it is safe. Even though communicating risks to consumers can be challenging, the public's perception of safety will be paramount in determining the acceptance of nanomaterials. This is especially true for an emerging food-products technology the safety of which even the FDA has acknowledged a lack of understanding. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andy Behar.","Andy Behar: Some foods contain tiny, engineered particles called nanomaterials .

"Washington (CNN) -- Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive -- if not impossible. Such a ban became a rallying cry for victims' families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December. President Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities. However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns. Along with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands. The multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues. Gun violence plans: What's in the works . While her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said ""political reality"" dictated a different approach. ""Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence,"" she explained. That strategy reflects ""an understanding of gun crime in the country,"" she added. Opinion polls back up her assertion. A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%. However, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision. The poll also found that 46% of respondents believe the NRA better reflects their views on guns, compared to 43% for Obama. Newtown calls on Connecticut to 'show America the way' on gun control . Diverse views in America . Obama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live. ""There are different realities and we have to respect them,"" he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures. At the same time, the president called for action, saying ""there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them."" Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision. Carney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties ""the first progress we've seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence."" But none of the measures he mentioned -- expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing ""straw"" purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so -- included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons. Gun debate: Where is the middle ground? NRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because ""people are smarter than politicians,"" which means ""common sense ultimately prevails."" ""They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven't been able to achieve in the past,"" Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event. ""I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we're going to come out about where we have come out in the past,"" he added. His organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates. In the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue. Loaded language poisons gun debate . Vice President Joe Biden will take part in a roundtable discussion on gun violence on Monday in Philadelphia. Four days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation's second-highest civiian honor -- posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School. In Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban. According to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate. Weapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic -- meaning each shot requires a trigger pull. Supporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting. Opinion: Nothing stops a bullet like a job . Right to bear arms . The NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue. In recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls -- such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s -- to the incremental measures under consideration now. Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA's influence in the last significant gun legislation -- the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later. While the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn't apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said. How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . Obama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale. The issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check. Anderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been ""too easy."" ""I wish it had been more difficult,"" she said. ""I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check."" The 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush -- an outcome sought by the NRA. Keene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation's gun violence. They also contend the government isn't properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical. ""We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we're trying to solve,"" Keene said. To Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns -- either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases. Minor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said. ""How are they going to stop somebody who's a gun trafficker if there's no federal law against that now,"" she wondered. January's FBI gun background checks are second-highest . Limits on magazine rounds . A tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife -- former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. According to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said. Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . The NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower. They also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment's right to bear arms. Erickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama's proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people's guns. She praised the president's strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: ""It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it.""

Three other workers were injured, the cruise line said. The accident happened just before noon Sunday on board the Thomson Majesty while it was docked in La Palma, one of the Canary Islands. As part of the drill, a lifeboat was lowered into the water to test the evacuation procedure for passengers. ""Unfortunately, when the boat was being raised back up, one of the wires snapped, resulting in the boat falling back into the water,"" a Thomson representative said via e-mail Monday. There were 1,498 passengers on board. It is customary for crew members to get into lifeboats during a drill, Thomson said, but passengers do not board them. No passengers were injured. Investigations are being conducted by Thomson Cruises, Spanish maritime authorities, the ship's flag state of Malta and ship classification company DNV, the cruise line said. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of all those involved,"" Thomson said. CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Accident happened while cruise ship was docked in La Palma, one of Spain's Canary Islands .

"(CNN) -- Each year, about 30,000 people are killed and 300,000 violent crimes are committed with firearms. In economic terms, firearm violence -- for things such as medical care, police, criminal justice, lost productivity, pain and suffering -- costs $100 billion a year, according to studies by Johns Hopkins University and the Public Services Research Institute. This reality tears at the social fabric of the United States, and Americans pay the social and psychological consequences. But the gun debate will continue to be a one-sided fight until the American public chooses to take action. Most of the debate revolves around what government should do. But we can also look at the issue as a marketing problem. American consumers are the central part of a vast aggregate marketing system, and the central issue as it pertains to guns is power. The gun lobby has wielded its power effectively, but the potentially powerful American consumer market has not. The gun lobby influences how guns are marketed and under which laws. The only difference between the gun lobby and concerned Americans is that the gun lobby -- and thus the politicians supporting the gun lobby -- pays attention to details. Opinion: In the gun control debate, logic goes out the window . It has made its primary goal to vehemently block any change to gun laws for fear that passage of even one law could lead to the eradication of firearms for all. But that is not the issue here. Many concerned citizens are not advocating the abolition of firearms for responsible gun owners. The problem is that there are too few and very limited laws to force manufacturers to safeguard their distribution channels, and manufacturers are not putting these safeguards into place. Our research found that about 45% to 60% of the guns traced to crime came from about 1% of the nation's gun dealers and that implementation of safeguards is associated with a smaller number of guns being diverted to crime or used in crime. Interestingly, many of the common sense distribution laws that would force a safer distribution of firearms are in place for other industries that sell products that can cause harm. Opinion: A father's murder, a plea on gun control . Firearms product diversion involves the seepage of guns from legal channels of distribution into illegal hands. To prevent this from occurring, firearms manufacturers have the opportunity to implement distribution safeguards, common across many of the industries that manufacture products that can cause harm (such as explosives, fireworks, and pharmaceuticals). Such safeguards include manufacturers training their dealers and distributors to identify and handle illegal purchasers at the point of sale, developing a code of conduct for distributors, and requiring them to implement record keeping measures in order to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . The notion of safeguarding is important because a recent study found that 1 in 9 (11%) of handguns distributed into legal channels in 1996 were found to have been used in crime by 2000. It was also found that one manufacturer had 55% of its guns end up in crime during this time period (the range was 2% to 55% for all manufacturers studied). This study also found that the number of safeguards used across the studied firms (which accounted for over 90% of the U.S. gun sales) was very low, averaging less than one safeguard (.77) per firm. Only a slight majority employed any recommended safeguards during that time. One reason the public has not been paying attention is that they think the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives can address enforcement for us. But at this point, the bureau needs our help -- it does not have the resources to combat this problem, because gun lobbies and the politicians who support them have tied its hands. So, Americans must act. The National Rifle Association grades political candidates on their voting history, giving high marks to those who vote for its policies. These ratings influence how guns are distributed in the United States. In response, concerned citizens should do the same thing. We should grade firearms manufacturers on how well they address distribution and the diversion of their guns to criminals. Americans should look at these grades and buy firearms accordingly. The group Mayors Against Illegal Guns suggests that if manufacturers don't comply with set goals of safety, the nation's mayors and municipalities will not do business with them. Concerned Americans should follow suit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Bradford.","Kevin Bradford: Each year 30,000 killed and 300,000 violent crimes committed with guns .
It's also a marketing problem, he says. Manufacturers are not monitoring distribution of guns .
Bradford: Laws are minimal, manufacturers are not putting safeguards into place .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The Chinese public, especially those in the social networking community, are abuzz over the case of a man charged with killing a girl in a hit-and-run: He is the son of a local deputy police chief. Li Qiming, 23, is accused of ""perpetration of traffic accident,"" a charge punishable by three to seven years in prison. During the two-and-a-half hour trial Wednesday in the northern city of Baoding, Li admitted causing the death of Chen Xiaofeng, 20, according to Chinese media reports. It's more than just a tragic traffic accident. ""There is a lot of popular anger about 'guan er dai,' the children of officials who sometimes literally get away with murder,"" says Jeremy Goldkorn, founding editor-in-chief of Danwei, a China media website. He said the online uproar is focused on ""how likely it is that Li Qiming will get away with a light sentence, and whether blood money will secure his freedom."" Official media have reported that Li was drunk when he ran over two female students on the Hebei University campus, killing Chen and injuring fellow student Zhang Jingjing. Li allegedly tried to speed away from the scene. It was also reported that, when students and campus security guards stopped him, he shouted at the guards, ""My daddy is Li Gang"" -- referring to a local deputy police chief. When indignant Chinese Internet users got wind of the story, they blogged and reposted it widely. Before long, ""My-daddy-is-Li-Gang"" went viral. ""It spread on the Internet -- on blogs, forum websites and the Twitter-like microblog service Weibo,"" recalls Goldkorn, a long-time observer of China's social networking sites. ""The public expressed outrage on the Internet, and the traditional news media and the government reacted to the Internet coverage of the event."" Despite the government's efforts to contain the fallout, the incident drew widespread criticism among China's estimated 420 million Internet users. ""My daddy is Li Gang"" became one of the top search items on most popular Chinese search engines, a viral catchphrase synonymous to abuse of power. Some composed sarcastic poems and songs. Others parodied the father-son duo in videos posted in cyberspace. The case became a cause célèbre among Internet users who viewed it as an example of official abuse. It also put the spotlight on the growing gap between the rich and the poor. Chen Lin, the victim's 23-year-old brother, complained: ""In society they say everyone is equal, but in every corner there is inequality. How can you live in this country and this society without any worry? I feel like there should be deep reflection on this. This is the reality."" Beijing resident Yang Ning, a white-collar worker, agrees. ""The case is symbolic,"" he tells me. ""In China it's all about who your father is. Without a good father, you already lose at the starting line. Without a good father, you have to work 10 times harder than those born with good fathers."" The Chinese authorities have tried to assuage the public ire. Days after the accident, the China Central Television showed Li under police detention, profusely apologizing and expressing remorse. His father Li Gang also appeared in a nationally broadcast TV interview, breaking down and bowing deeply to apologize to the victim's family. ""As for my child's education, as a father I failed,"" he cried. ""I am very sad, very guilty, very ashamed."" He promised not to shield his son from the law. In November, according to Chinese media reports, Li Gang reached a civil settlement with the victim's families, agreeing to pay 460,000 yuan (US$67,700) in restitution for the Chen family and 92,000 yuan (US$14,000) to Zhang's family. He did not attend Wednesday's court hearing. The victim's brother Chen Lin attended. ""My family and I want justice,"" he was quoted by the Chinese media as saying. The state prosecutor asked for a three-to-seven year prison sentence for Li, according to the Xinhua News Agency, while the defendant's lawyer called for leniency, noting that he has expressed remorse and compensated the victims' families. It is not known how soon the court will render its sentence. Years ago, incidents like this would have been non-events. Victims would have been intimidated and forgotten. Not this time. ""This is another landmark example of the Internet playing a significant role in curbing official abuses,"" says Goldkorn of Danwei. With the Internet and social network sites at the disposal of millions of ordinary citizens, abusive officials and their children are now getting caught in the act more and more often. ""There have been enough similar cases over the last few years that -- according to Chinese media reports -- some government officials have now acquired 'Internet phobia,'"" observes Goldkorn. ""They fear of having their wrongdoings exposed by angry netizens."" But Beijing resident Yang Ning is enthused: ""I raise my hand and shout: Long live the Internet!""","Goldkorn: Web uproar focused on whether Li will get light sentence or freedom .

"(CNN) -- A British woman touring India dropped from her hotel room's balcony to the one below to escape the hotel's owner, who had been trying to enter her room, police said Tuesday. The owner was arrested on a harassment complaint, police said. A police official initially told CNN the owner was suspected of attempted rape, but Agra District Police Chief Subhash Dubey later said the woman was complaining only of harassment. Doctors say the woman, traveling alone in Agra, might have ligament injuries but no fracture from her balcony-to-balcony escape, according to Dubey. She will cut short the rest of her trip and return to the United Kingdom, he said. The woman locked the door of her room when the owner, Sachin Chauhan, offered her what he said was a preplanned massage, Dubey said. When Chauhan kept knocking on the door and insisted on the service, she left through her balcony, according to Dubey. The man has denied any intention to assault the woman, Dubey told CNN. He added the woman is feeling afraid, and the police superintendent and two female constables are staying with her. The incident comes amid a number of high-profile accusations of violence against women in India, and protests demanding that the violence end. Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013 . Last week, five men were accused of raping a Swiss tourist. Police said the men confessed to the crime, which allegedly took place in central India at a camping area near a forest in Datia district. Confessions in police custody are not admissible in court, however, and can be retracted. That incident sparked demonstrations demanding that lawmakers be held accountable for a lack of law and order. India was the focus of worldwide attention and national outrage in December after a 23-year-old student was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi. She died in a Singapore hospital from injuries she suffered in the attack. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.","Police: A hotel owner told a woman he had a massage for her .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan woman who won a million-dollar lottery but continued to receive welfare benefits is now charged with fraud, the attorney general said Tuesday. Amanda Clayton, 25, collected thousands of dollars in state assistance for months after she won $1 million in the 'Make Me Rich"" game sponsored by the Michigan lottery, a statement from state officials said. ""It's simply common sense that million-dollar lottery winners forfeit their right to public assistance,"" said Attorney General Bill Schuette. Mega Millions mystery winner about to emerge . Clayton, a Lincoln Park resident, faces two felony counts of welfare fraud after being investigated by the Department of Human Services and the Office of Inspector General. The inquiry revealed that not only did Clayton fail to report her lottery winnings and other employment earnings, as state law requires, she also ""allegedly collected approximately $5,475 in food and medical benefits"" she would have been ineligible for. According to Michigan law, welfare recipients must report any changes in assets or income to the agency within 10 days. ""I thought that they would cut me off, but since they didn't, I thought, maybe it was OK because I'm not working,"" Clayton, 24, told CNN affiliate WDIV when it asked whether it was appropriate for her to receive the money. Clayton bought a new house and car after winning the lottery in October 2011. According to state officials, she received public assistance from August 2010 through March 2012. After taking a lump sum and paying taxes, Clayton said she ended up with just more than $500,000. Asked if she had the right to the public assistance money, Clayton answered, ""I kind of do. I have no income, and I have bills to pay. I have two houses."" New legislation -- which includes Senate Bill 711 and 712, and House Bill 5033 -- will block lottery winners from receiving government benefits. Gov. Rick Snyder signed all the bills last Wednesday. ""That commitment to investigation and uncovering the truth, combined with the new law recently enacted by the legislature and signed by the governor, will make it easier to ensure that outrages involving instant millionaires on public assistance don't happen in the future,"" said Maura Corrigan, director of the state's Department of Human Services.","A Michigan woman who took state benefits after a lottery win faces criminal charges .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Some $700 million in economic stimulus money intended to upgrade baggage screening systems at airports will go further than originally expected, Department of Homeland Security officials said Wednesday. The new systems can process up to 500 bags an hour, compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour on the older machines, the TSA said. The DHS said the money will now upgrade systems at 10 additional airports. Earlier this year the DHS announced funding for baggage screening at airports in 15 cities. The money will be used to speed up construction of in-line baggage screening systems, which take advantage of the airline's existing conveyor belt systems to check bags, eliminating the need for minivan-size bomb detection systems now found in many airport lobbies. Government auditors have long complained about existing systems, which the Transportation Security Administration rushed into place to meet congressional deadlines after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At airports with in-line systems, airline workers at the ticketing counters place the bags on conveyor belts, which pass through explosive detectors on their way to the aircraft. That is more efficient than stand-alone systems, which the TSA employees must staff. In addition, in-line systems can process up to 500 bags an hour, compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour processed by stand-alone machines, the TSA said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement that DHS was able to ""stretch our resources"" by managing the recovery money and by negotiating with airports. In addition to the $700 million intended for checked baggage systems, $300 million is being allocated for checkpoint technology, such as new X-ray machines, ""whole body imaging"" technology and bottled liquid scanners. The new airports expected to get stimulus money for in-line explosive detection systems are: . • Washington Dulles International Airport (Chantilly, Virginia) • Lambert-St. Louis International Airport (St. Louis, Missouri) • Yellowstone Regional Airport (Cody, Wyoming) • William P. Hobby Airport (Houston, Texas) • St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport (St. Petersburg, Florida) • Gallatin Field Airport (Bozeman, Montana) • Little Rock National Airport (Little Rock, Arkansas) • Tulsa International Airport (Tulsa, Oklahoma) • Charlotte Douglas International Airport (Charlotte, North Carolina) • Colorado Springs Airport (Colorado Springs, Colorado) Earlier this year, DHS announced funding for airports in the following cities: Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Honolulu, Hawaii; Huntsville, Alabama; Jackson, Wyoming; Maui, Hawaii; New Orleans, Louisiana; Orange County, California; Orlando, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, Maine; and Sacramento, San Francisco and San Jose, California.

"(CNN) -- Each fall we return to our beloved TVs, ready for the favorites to ease into an autumnal slump while new series fight for a spot on our DVR. September sees the list filled up to about 70%, but that number dwindles as the season wears on. By the time winter finales are upon us, less than a quarter of the shows we committed to are left standing. Gone are the programs we were rooting for, cast aside in favor of old favorites like ""Sex and The City"" reruns on TBS. Everyone's going to give you the scoop on new fall shows, but we'd like to predict what will survive based on a good old-fashioned hunch. Why? Because we've watched far too much television in our time to sit idly by while our fellow viewers flip aimlessly between the networks. You can thank us later. ""Two Broke Girls"" (CBS) -- Written by ""Sex And The City"" producer Michael Patrick King and comedienne Whitney Cummings, this sitcom stars Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs as a modern-day ""Laverne & Shirley."" Max (Dennings) is a mouthy Brooklyn waitress who also works as a nanny. (How we miss New York and scraping to make ends meet.) Her new co-worker, Caroline (Behrs), is an heiress whose father is serving time for his involvement in a Ponzi scheme (too soon?). Caroline is now ""broke,"" and forced to move in with Max. Sounds like a predictable premise, but here's hoping that both the writing and comedic timing is good enough to make up for the tired formula. ""Pan Am"" (ABC) -- This little gem of a throwback, starring Christina Ricci, reminds us of what flying once was. Way before passengers were hauled off to airplane jail for not turning their phones off, travel was a privilege -- nay -- a joy. We'll get an all-access look at the glamorous lives of Pan Am's flight attendants, the prom queens of the jet-setting golden age. ""Up All Night"" (NBC) -- We cannot WAIT for this comedy, and pray to the gods of network heaven that it's a success. You've seen a few previews here and there of Will Arnett and Christina Applegate turning on each other after having their first baby. Relax, their relationship isn't in jeopardy. They're just new parents! Arnett + Applegate + Maya Rudolph and a baby = The second coming of ""30 Rock?"" Yes? No? ""Once Upon A Time"" (ABC) -- Jennifer Morrison and Ginnifer Goodwin star in this magical series about a town in Maine populated with characters (like Snow White) who have no recollection of their true identities. We are going to be straightforward with you: This program, which tells dual stories set in present day and in fairy tale land, confuses the dust out of us. No matter, we'll be tuning in to see how it all unfolds. ""Terra Nova"" (Fox) -- Produced by Steven Spielberg, ""Terra Nova"" sounds like a TV version of ""Jurassic Park,"" which is fine by us. The drama focuses on the Shannon family, who travel back to prehistoric Earth to save humanity. Dinosaurs both good and bad will cross paths with the Shannons, and we've been promised some dinosaur vs. man action. SOLD. ""Last Man Standing"" (ABC) -- Call us old-fashioned, but nothing gives us greater pleasure than to welcome Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor back to Sitcomville. How we miss watching the father-son camaraderie between Tim and his three boys on ""Home Improvement."" It's 20 years later and Allen has come home, this time to star as Mike, a ""manly married man"" with three girls. Allen said at this summer's TCA tour in Beverly Hills that he was pitched a number of television ideas, but refused to stray from the ""Home Improvement"" concept. He explained to USA Today that ""I just really wanted to investigate what it would be like to be around four women who are intelligent and strong. And I thought it would be kind of fun, literally, to flip-flop 'Home Improvement.' It isn't rocket science what I'm doing.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The young Georgia woman fighting a flesh-eating bacteria underwent a successful skin graft this week as she continues her astounding recovery. The procedure was performed Monday on a massive wound left open when doctors were forced to remove tissue last month from Aimee Copeland's abdomen, side and hip in an effort to prevent the spread of the bacteria, according to an update posted on her father's blog Friday. Georgia flesh-eating bacteria victim's condition upgraded . An additional skin graft was scheduled to be performed Friday, her father said, describing it as the ""final initial graft procedure to close the open wound."" ""I say 'final initial' because I understand that skin surfaces continue to break down over time and that Aimee will need follow-up surgeries to repair those areas in the weeks, months and years ahead,"" Andy Copeland wrote. ""Aimee's wound repair is a lifelong process that will require ongoing attention and medical care, however, the surgery today will bring her one step closer to her biggest challenge yet: rehab."" Earlier this week, Copeland, 24, was upgraded from critical to serious condition at Doctors Hospital of Augusta, where she has been receiving treatment. Aimee Copeland speaks, jokes, father says . The young Snellville woman's ordeal began May 1, when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila. In addition to the tissue removed from her abdomen, the bacteria led surgeons to amputate most of her hands, one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the disease. Copeland late last month began breathing on her own and talking for the first time in weeks, and even cracked jokes, her father said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Nadya Suleman says she is so determined to build a future for her 14 young children that she is now willing to act in a porn film, although she would not touch another ""human's flesh."" ""I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money,"" Suleman told HLN ""Showbiz Tonight"" correspondent Nischelle Turner. ""I would not kiss somebody. I wouldn't touch somebody."" Suleman invited Turner and a camera crew into her home on Friday to see firsthand how she's dealing with financial and parenting pressures. On Monday, Suleman filed for federal bankruptcy protection. ""I have had to make some very difficult decisions the year, and filing Chapter 7 was one of them,"" Suleman said in a written statement Monday. ""But I have to do what is best for my children and I need a fresh start."" Friday's interview was punctuated by frequent interruptions for potty training, discipline and cooking as Suleman, 36, single-handedly cared for her large brood. ""It's nonstop,"" she said. ""Everyone go pee-pee,"" she told her children. ""Stand in line to go pee."" The Orange County, California, home she bought after she gave birth to octuplets three years ago is in foreclosure, but she says she has no fears of becoming homeless. ""God forbid that we lose the house, I have a very good friend and her husband -- huge house, and they're offering,"" she said. But her goal is to raise enough cash to buy a new home outright, with no mortgage, she said. Suleman said no two years ago when an adult film company offered to pay off her mortgage if she would sign a movie contract, but she's open to another offer now, she said. ""If it's a job, and it's a well-paying job, and it's going to allow me to get us out of here and into a very safe huge home that they deserve, then I'm going to do it,"" she said. But she would allow no kissing and no touching. Although she said previously that she would never pose nude for money, she recently earned $8,000 for posing topless for a British magazine. ""You know, if the opportunity comes up, I'll be the first to admit I'm gonna eat my words, because all that matters is that I can take care of my family,"" she said. She pushed back at the negative media reports questioning how she's raising her children. ""Look at what's happened,"" she said. ""They're over 3, not one broken bone, not one injury, not one child with a disability."" Social workers visited her home recently to check on reports that it was filthy and unfit. But they found nothing wrong, she said. Graffiti on the walls, put there by her oldest son as a way of venting his frustration, and holes punched by a son who is autistic, do not mean its not a safe, happy home, she said. ""I'm so done,"" she said. ""You people, you keep your business to yourself, and I'll keep my business to myself. My kids are healthy, they're happy, they've got food."" The octuplets -- six boys and two girls -- are actually easier to care for than the six older children, she said. ""They're so, so good because I started from day one implementing structure and discipline,"" she said. Her main disciplinary tool is a ""time out rug,"" she said. ""It's a very important spot because most of them don't really need it anymore,"" she said. ""But at this point, all I have to do is just point to it."" Her children eat up to 10 meals a day, she said. ""They eat all the time, every hour, two hours, they get a meal, and we're talking meals that are vegetables, fruit, oatmeal,"" she said. She gets $2,000 a month in Food Stamp assistance to help feed them. Applying for the state aid was a low point for her, she said. ""I cried making that call, and you know what? I'd do it again,"" she said. ""But my goal, my goal is to get off this immediately."" Suleman dreams of building a business ""empire"" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children. She ultimately hopes to become a role model for other women facing major struggles, she said. ""In the future, and I've got to win the battle,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- There's a standing joke that if you play a country song backward, the singer gets re-hired, wins back his girl, finds whatever he's lost, quits crying and leaves the bar. Employed, happily married and sober? Doesn't sound much like America these days. Authenticity is what defines country music, says Karla Lawson, a morning host for Nashville's WSIX country radio station. ""It's so real and accessible and down-to-earth and relatable,"" she says. ""It's really the most honest music out there."" The Country Music Association's 45th annual awards show airs live on Wednesday, November 9, at 8 p.m. on ABC. The show consistently ranks in the top four among the most-watched awards shows on television, alongside the Oscars, Grammys and Golden Globes, says CMA media relations director Scott Stem. Joining favorites like Rascal Flatts and Kenny Chesney on stage this year will be rock singer Grace Potter, pop artist Natasha Bedingfield and Motown mogul Lionel Richie, who has an upcoming country duets album called ""Tuskegee."" ""Country as a genre has changed ... and the audience has reflected that,"" Lawson says. To be fair, country music's popularity has been on a steady incline for more than 20 years, Billboard country chart manager Wade Jessen says. Singers like Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood broke down the barrier between plaid and pleather in the early 1990s. Even if you weren't stompin' your boots just yet, you were probably secretly humming Shania Twain's ""I Feel Like a Woman,"" Billy Ray Cryus' ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" or Faith Hill's ""This Kiss."" The list of artists who have gone country since then is lengthy: Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow, Bon Jovi, Uncle Kracker, Hootie & the Blowfish's Darius Rucker, Jewel -- even Jessica Simpson. But if the last year has shown us anything, it's that America's gone a little bit country and a little less rock 'n' roll. As Brantley Gilbert sings, ""Country must be country-wide."" Things really heated up in late 2010, when viewers tuned in to watch actress Gwyneth Paltrow make her live singing debut with ""Country Strong"" at the CMAs. Then Justin Bieber sent a million tweens into a frenzy when he announced that he'd be teaming up with country group Rascal Flatts to record a duet in 2011. In February, Lady Antebellum swept the Grammys, winning record of the year and song of the year. In March, Lady Gaga put out a country version of her single ""Born This Way"" (although I have to say, Little Big Town did it better). Even ""Footloose,"" originally pure '80s pop, got in on the action. The movie was country-fied in its 2011 remake. Blake Shelton sang the movie's theme song and was joined on the soundtrack by country artists Zac Brown, Big & Rich, Jana Kramer, Ella Mae Bowen and more. Shelton has invited Kenny Loggins -- the original ""Footloose"" singer -- to perform with him at the CMAs. But wait, the roundup is not done yet. The first three national anthem singers at the World Series were country artists: ""American Idol"" winner Scotty McCreery, Trace Adkins and Ronnie Dunn (of the former Brooks and Dunn). Bieber added a song featuring The Band Perry to his new Christmas album. Jason Aldean and Lady Gaga were the first artists announced for the Grammy nominations concert. Oh yeah, and Adele wants in on the country action as well. The 23-year-old reportedly plans to go country for her next album, saying discovering American country musicians was ""like (being) a 4-year-old in a candy shop who's discovering sweets again."" CMA's Stem isn't surprised. ""I always claim that everyone likes country music -- they just don't want to admit it,"" he says with a laugh. Artists like Taylor Swift have certainly added a ""hip"" factor to the country music industry. But it's the stories and the soul that keeps fans coming back, Stem says. ""We are a very real-life music, based on real-life experiences. Who among us hasn't had our hearts broken? Who hasn't lost a loved one, found love or not gotten the job we wanted? It covers (everything from) the sad to the happy to the silly."" Now that sounds more like America.","Authenticity is what defines country music, radio host says .
Grace Potter, Natasha Bedingfield and Lionel Richie will perform at CMA Awards .
Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and Adele have all gone country this year ."
