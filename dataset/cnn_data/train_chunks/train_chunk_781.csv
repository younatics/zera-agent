"By . Andy Dolan . and Jill Reilly . The former partner of a mother who was battered to death by her teenage son in a killing he copied from Coronation Street, has today blamed horror films and violent games for his violent behaviour. Daniel Bartlam was just 14 when he hit mother Jacqueline Bartlam, 47, seven times with a claw hammer at their detached cul-de-sac home. He . then padded her body with paper, doused it in petrol and set fire to it . in a bid to destroy evidence and commit the ‘perfect murder’. Mrs . Bartlam had to be identified using dental records. Bartlam, a former public schoolboy, who was jailed for life yesterday, had also been fascinated by violent video games rated 18 and DVDs, including Nightmare on Elm Street and the Evil Dead series, since the age of eight. Horrific: Daniel Bartlam, left, butchered his mum Jacqueline, 47, right, with a claw hammer as she slept after becoming obsessed with Coronation Street killer John Stape . He watched the torture-themed film . Saw just hours before murdering Jacqui at their home in Redhill, . Nottingham, on Easter Sunday last year. Today the 47-year-old's former . partner, Simon Matters said: 'I was quite disturbed at the things he . had in his bedroom - the Halloween movies, the Saw movies, the Evil . Dead movies, Final Destination. They are all 18 and beyond, and some . would probably scare adults, let alone children. But he seemed to thrive . on it. 'It shocked me, and I said to Jacqui, ""These are inappropriate for him"". He was only 13 at the time. Violent obsession: Bartlam, a former public schoolboy, who . was jailed for life yesterday, had also been fascinated by violent 18+ . video games and DVDs, including Nightmare on Elm Street, left,  and the Evil . Dead series, right,  since the age of eight . 'It must have had an impact because any normal thinking person wouldn't . have done what he did unless he got something imprinted in his brain . from what he watched,' he added. Mr Matters of Hucknall, Notts, also believes measures need to be put in place to prevent 18 rated films and video games being sold to young people. He added: 'The only thing I would like to see come out of all this is the fact that if the games and DVDs are a contributing factor, which I'm sure they are, then the people who sell them should be looking at themselves and saying, 'Next time I sell one, make sure the people buying them are of the age to buy them'. Shocking: A scene from Coronation Street, with killer character John Stape on the right . Ablaze: After killing his mother, Daniel set fire to the modest family home in a bid to conceal her body . Bartlam was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, with a . recommendation he serve at least 16 years in custody before he is . considered for release. A court heard the teenager rescued his . younger brother and the family pet before fleeing from the burning . house, telling police that Mrs Bartlam, a Land Registry worker, had been . killed by an intruder. But Bartlam was charged with murder . after police discovered video footage on his computer of Coronation . Street’s killer character, John Stape. Last night ITV was forced to defend . the soap’s ‘pre-watershed’ storylines, which have become increasingly . lurid in the past couple of years. Influenced: Daniel Bartlam was obsessed with the Coronation Street killer John Snape, played by actor Graeme Hawley . Nottingham Crown Court heard Bartlam . was ‘obsessed’ with Stape – who battered a woman with a hammer before . leaving her body in the wreckage of a tram crash to cover up his crime – . and stored files relating to the plot on his computer. When police examined the rest of the . hard drive they discovered he had searched for web pages about ‘people . who get away with murder in shows’. He posted violent scenes from television soap EastEnders on YouTube and had a fixation with crime drama Trial and Retribution. He also penned a soap opera-style plot . in which he fantasised about a character called Daniel Bartlam killing . ‘Jackie’, his mother. A source close to the case told the . Daily Mail: ‘He comes across as being very mature but there is a . distinct lack of emotion. If he was an adult he could be considered a . psychopath.’ The product of a broken home, Bartlam . had been obsessed with horror films since the age of eight and watched . the gruesome Saw 3D movie hours before the murder. He was convicted of his mother’s . murder in February following a two-week trial, but it was only after his . sentencing yesterday that Mr Justice Flaux lifted reporting . restrictions which prevented him from being named. Sentencing Bartlam to life with a . minimum of 16 years for the ‘senseless and grotesque killing’, the judge . said the murder involved a high degree of planning, and Bartlam . remained ‘extremely dangerous’. During his trial, the jury were told . he was a ‘young man who immersed himself in a fantasy world; fantasy . words he wrote, television drama, films he accessed by the internet and . other internet sites’. Dreadful: The remains of Jacqueline Bartlam's bedroom following the blaze caused by her son . Murder weapon: The lump hammer recovered from the Bartlam family home and used by killer Daniel . Prosecutor Sean Smith added: ‘The boundaries between real life and fiction became very, very tragically blurred.’ Bartlam, who is now 15, initially told police he had a good relationship with his mother. On the night of the murder he claimed . to have been confronted by a masked intruder at the property in Redhill, . Nottingham, when he got up to use the toilet. He said the man threw a . hammer at him before fleeing and that he then found his mother’s body on . the floor of her burning bedroom. He said he panicked and fled with his . brother and their dog. Bartlam was charged two days after the . killing. In an outburst at the secure unit he was remanded to soon . after, he threatened to ‘kill’ a fellow patient, ‘like I killed my mum’. He denied murder, offering to admit . manslaughter on the basis that he snapped after being branded a ‘f****** . freak’ by his mother. Prosecutors refused to accept the plea and . Bartlam will begin his sentence in a young offenders’ institution. Bartlam’s father Adrian, a successful businessman, separated from his . mother in 2005, shortly after the birth of their other child, a boy who . is now six. Until then, Bartlam had attended . Greenholme, a Nottingham preparatory school which closed last year, and . Dagfa, a private boys’ school. But financial pressures meant that . following his parents’ separation, Bartlam was sent to a Roman Catholic . state school, where he failed to settle. In 2010, he was referred to a school . counsellor after telling pupils his tie, which he named ‘Fred’, was . trying to hurt him. But just six weeks before the killing, mental health . assessors concluded that Bartlam posed little or no risk to himself or . others. A Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust . spokesman said: ‘Due to patient confidentiality we are unable to . provide any further comment.’ Mrs Bartlam’s parents, who asked not . to be named, said in a statement: ‘There are no winners here because not . only have we lost Jacqui, but we have lost Daniel too.’ Coronation Street has been nicknamed . ‘the most violent place in Britain’, with ten characters killed off in . the past two years. A tram disaster in December 2010 took the lives of . four characters, while rapist Frank Foster was murdered last month. An ITV spokesman said the channel took ‘careful steps to ensure that pre-watershed drama was appropriate for a family audience’.","Daniel Bartlam butchered mum .

"By . Rachel Reilly . A retired electrician has been awarded £187,500 after his wife died from exposure to the asbestos dust on his work overalls. Mother-of-three Yvonne Moaby, 66, contracted the incurable lung cancer mesothelioma while husband John was repairing and stripping out storage heaters for four years in the 60s. She was diagnosed in 2009 and died at her home in Quenington, Gloucestershire, in May 2010. Retired electrician, John Moaby,  71, has received £187,000 in . compensation because his wife died of mesothelioma after being exposed . to asbestos on his overalls . Mr Moaby, 71, secured the payment after the case went to the High Court.  He said: ‘It is nice [to have the money] but you can't put a value on someone's life. It's taken such a long time and a lot of heartache.' The Moaby's  case was eventually . settled out of court, with SSE plc (formerly Scottish & Southern . Energy) agreeing the compensation figure. Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral that became a popular building material in the 1950s. Widely . used as insulation and a fire-deterrent, it also found its way into . products such as ceiling tiles, pipe insulation, boilers, sprayed . coatings and garage roof tiles. Mesothelioma . has a very strong association with exposure to asbestos. The disease . affects the lining of the lungs and is almost always fatal, with . survival from point of diagnosis is usually just 18 months. There were over 2,300 deaths from mesothelioma in the UK in 2009 – more than from cervical cancer or malignant melanoma. Deadly: Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral that became a popular building material in the 1950s . Twice . as many people die from asbestos exposure in Britain as are killed on . the roads, according to a recent All Party Parliamentary Group report. And . mesothelioma incidence is still rising due to the long ‘time lag’ between exposure and the development of the disease – typically between . 30 and 40 years. Mesothelioma . is much less common in women – men account for 80 per cent of cases - . they tend to work less in industry so have had less exposure. ‘Asbestos . fibres seem to alter the way in which cells multiply and divide,’ explains Dr John Moore-Gillon, an Honorary Medical Adviser at the . British Lung Foundation. ‘Even a small amount of asbestos exposure – . from clothes, for example – is enough.’ Indeed, . secondary exposure is increasingly becoming a legal and insurance . wrangle, says Christine Winter of the Independent Asbestos Training . Providers, which champions safety and awareness when working with . asbestos. She said: ‘Unfortunately there is a real injustice of compensation pay outs for this area.’ Describing his wife as an unsung hero . who worked tirelessly for the community, Mr Moaby said three years on he . had still not recovered from losing her. He said: 'Yvonne was an angel. She was my rock.' 'Long before her illness she said to me ""If I go first,  don't sit around and vegetate - find someone else"". 'She was always there for me and it's only now I realise what she did.' He . added they had managed to secure a £50,000 compensation payment while . Yvonne was alive, which the couple spent on two exotic cruises before . she became too ill to go away. John said: 'She never complained once. She just kept saying 'I'm not going anywhere"". 'She kept her looks and looked just as young as she did before she was ill.' Although Yvonne spent some time at a hospice in Swindon, she spent her last days at home surrounded by her family and friends.","Yvonne Moaby died of lung cancer mesothelioma in May 2010 .

"By . Damien Gayle . Five Indian airmen died today when their Hercules cargo plane fell out of the sky during a training mission in the heart of the south Asian country. The C-130J Hercules plane plummeted to the ground near a village in Madhya Pradesh state, 72 miles west of Gwalior air base, sparking an emergency rescue mission. But when air force personnel, police and firefighters reached the scene they found that all those on board had perished in the crash. Tragic: Indian villagers crowd around the debris of an Indian air force cargo plane that crashed while on a training mission near the village of Karauli in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh today . Expensive: The plane that crashed was one of six C-130J aircraft that India bought from U.S. arms company Lockheed-Martin at a cost of £1.1billion three years ago . It is the latest in a series of accidents that have hit the Indian military, which has embarked on a modernisation programme that has made the country the world's biggest arms importer. The plane that crashed was one of six C-130J aircraft that India bought from U.S. arms company Lockheed-Martin at a cost of £1.1billion three years ago. Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha told the Associated Press that the plane had been used in tough situations since then, including rescuing people from floods in the Himalayan foothills and landing in harsh terrain on the border with China. India also sent two C-130J planes to participate in the search for a Malaysia Airlines plane lost in the southern Indian Ocean. It was not immediately clear if the plane that crashed had been involved in the search. Marshal Raha, who is head of India's air force, dismissed the possibility that the crash might have been the result of a mistake by a pilot. 'Needless to say, the best pilots have been chosen to fly these aircraft,' he said. Sameer Patil, a security expert with the Indian Council on Global Relations, a Mumbai-based think tank, said the crash would be a major setback for the Indian air force. 'After years of delay, the fleet is undergoing expansion in critical airlift capabilities. Hence, a loss such as this is particularly worrisome,' said Patil. India has become the world's biggest . arms importer as it pushes to modernize its military and replace its . obsolete Soviet-era weapons. The . purchases were also spurred by crashes of almost 55 per cent of its . frontline MiG fleet acquired from the former Soviet Union. 'The best pilots have been chosen to fly these aircraft': Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, head of India's air force, dismissed the possibility that the crash might have been the result of a mistake by a pilot . An Indian air force helicopter buzzes around the wreck of the plane, which had been in service for three years . The . Hercules crash today comes after navy chief Admiral D.K. Joshi resigned . last month to take responsibility for a string of accidents at sea. Days later, a gas leak on a destroyer being built at a Mumbai dockyard killed a navy commander and sickened two workers. Last . August, another Russian-made diesel-powered submarine caught fire after . an explosion and sank at port in Mumbai, killing all 18 sailors on . board. In December, the INS . Talwar, a Russian-built stealth frigate, slammed into a trawler off . India's west coast, sinking the boat and tossing 27 fishermen into the . sea. All of the fishermen were rescued. Another . navy frigate ran aground near the Mumbai naval base in January, . damaging some equipment. And the INS Airavat, an amphibious warfare . vessel, ran aground earlier last month. With national elections starting in less than two weeks, opponents were quick to attack the government for the accidents, saying it had to investigate if there was any negligence involved. 'This is absolutely a shocking incident,' said Prakash Javadekar, spokesman of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. 'The Hercules is such a sturdy aircraft it doesn't meet with such kind of accidents. The government needs to own responsibility for this state of affairs,' he told reporters.","Cargo plane was one of six bought from Lockheed-Martin three years ago .

"By . Associated Press . A 14-year-old boy digging a trout pond in the backyard of his father's Salt Lake City, Utah home stumbled across a surprise: the remains of an American Indian who lived about 1,000 years ago. Experts from the Utah Department of Heritage and Arts spent Friday removing the remains, which were confirmed by medical examiners as those of a person from a millennium ago, and investigating the site for archaeological clues after ninth-grader Ali Erturk's discovery earlier in the week. 'Humans have occupied this valley for up to 10,000 years,' department spokesman Geoffrey Fattah told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'We do run into situations where progress runs into the ancient past.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ali Eurturk, 14, made a shocking discovery of the remains of an American Indian that's about 1,000 years old . Eurtuk was digging a trout pond in this area of his father's backyard in Salt Lake City, Utah . A forensic anthropologist will analyze the remains to try to learn more, including the person's sex and cultural affiliation. A report will go to the state Division of Indian Affairs, which will try to determine whether the remains are linked to current tribes, Fattah said. A tribe may claim the remains and perform interment rites. Other private property in Salt Lake City has occasionally yielded Native American graves. The department typically receives about six reports of ancient remains statewide each year, Fattah said. Erturk said he had been working on the trout pond for a couple of weeks until he discovered what he initially thought was just an animal bone. 'When I saw it looked like a human skull, then it definitely was a bit creepy,' he told KTVX-TV. 'I really do think there's other bones nearby, and I don't think that it's that unlikely or that lucky that I stumbled across this.' Fattah urged the public to contact law enforcement authorities if human remains are unearthed so they can be removed professionally and respectfully. Erturk's father notified Salt Lake City police after his son's discovery.

"By . Lydia Warren . A 13-year-old boy has returned to school nine months after being struck by lightning and suffering a devastating brain injury. Ethan Kadish was left unable to walk or talk after the freak accident last June, but he is now making promising progress since returning to Loveland Middle School in Ohio three days a week. In a wheelchair and with a nurse by . his side, Ethan, who is still unable to speak, attends class in a special education room and gets regular . visits from his siblings, friends and former teammates. 'It's been more amazing than we could . have imagined,' his mother Alexia Kadish told ABC News. 'We initially . thought any sort of schooling would be homebound initially.' Scroll down for video . Back to school: Ethan Kadish has returned to Loveland Middle School (pictured with a staff member) 9 months after he was struck by lightning. He is still unable to speak but has started laughing again . In class: Ethan, pictured with Loveland School teacher Rachael Angel, is being taught alone 3 days a week . Support: Friends, including Ethan Missar and Cooper Smellar and  (pictured), visit him regularly at school and read to him, in the hopes that their familiar voices will help his brain heal . Ethan's improvements come nine months after he and two other children were struck by lightning as he instructed them how to play Frisbee at a Jewish summer camp near Indianapolis. His heart temporarily stopped and he suffered a hypoxic brain injury after his brain was deprived of oxygenated blood. The teenager spent five months in hospital and when he finally left last November, a life-threatening gastrointestinal perforation put him back in the hospital just 10 days later. But following surgery, he returned home again in January and three weeks ago, carers suggested that he go back to school to see if the recognizable faces and rooms would help his brain heal. Before the accident: Ethan, pictured left and right with his siblings, was struck by lightning last June . Injuries: Ethan's mother visit him in hospital in January following emergency surgery . 'That's not much of a life for any of us,' Saunders told WCPO. Ethan, who eats through a tube in . his abdomen but breaths on his own, attends school for just a few hours a . day, three days a week, and his friends and former baseball teammates . visit to read to him. Two friends, Cooper Smellar and Ethan . Missar, said they are struggling to come to terms with what happened to . their friend, who sometimes falls asleep while they read. 'It breaks my heart,' Cooper told ABC9. 'It's hard to see him like this. We really have to get used to this . too. It's going to be weird not having him on the team . again.' Back home: Ethan is pictured returning to his parents' home in Loveland, Ohio last November . Getting stronger: Physical therapist Shannon Brausch encourages Ethan during a tough portion of his session at the Daniel Drake Center for Post-Acute Care in Cincinnati on March 20 . But Ethan's mother, who left her copy editing . job to care for her son, said that since returning to school her son now sleeps better and he is now laughing. 'He laughs a lot,' she said. 'He . even accesses the sad side... He's accessing the emotional areas of his . brain. We're hopeful that it indicates that he's becoming more . present.' Chad Saunders, Ethan's daytime nurse, had encouraged the family to take him to . school, aware that his days were largely confined to their home. She said . that the community has rallied around the family - cooking them three . dinners a week and helping them raise money as they face steep medical . bills. Her husband, Scott Kadish, has returned to a normal work schedule . at his group manager role at Procter & Gamble Co. Family: Ethan (pictured second right with his family) loved playing baseball before the freak accident . Support: His mother Alexia now cares for Ethan (pictured left) around the clock with the help of nurses . But even with insurance, the Kadish family have to pay up to $250,000 for Ethan's medical care every year, WCPO reported. An overnight nursing service will cost an additional $150,000 per year.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A 20-year-old man, named as Zikarious Jaquan Flint, was shot dead by authorities on the campus of Columbus State University in Georgia yesterday. Flint's family members say that the 20-year-old was seen running away when he was shot but campus authorities said that they responded to reports that someone had been seen loading a gun. Campus authorities said that the man was not a student at the school and that the campus, some 100 miles southwest of Atlanta, was not put on lockdown. Scroll down for video . The area outside the student residence on University Avenue in Columbus was cornered off by police today after a 20-year-old was shot dead yesterday . The shooting took place outside student university housing on University Avenue (pictured) The man has been named by local newspaper, Ledger Inquirer, as Zikarious Jaquan Flint. The paper said that Flint was confirmed dead at 3:29 p.m, local time, on Sunday in the Midtown Medical Center in Columbus by Muscogee County Coroner Buddy Bryan. University Police Chief Rus Drew told . The Associated Press that officers were called at 2:35 p.m. Sunday and . arrived three minutes later to an area near some campus apartments and . began chasing the man on foot. 'There . was a short foot chase and at some point the suspect turned and faced . the officers and shots were fired,' Mr Drew said by phone. He added that . while there were some student witnesses, no lockdown was ordered because . events unfolded rapidly and authorities had determined that an 'isolated threat' had been removed. Today, in an official statement to television channel WTVM, he said: 'A person in our housing area, our student housing area, who had a gun out, loading the gun. 'Officers were dispatched, when officers arrived there was a brief foot chase. Police are still investigating at Columbus State University after community police officers at the university shot a 20-year-old dead . Pictured here is one of the buildings at Columbus State University. A 20-year-old man was shot dead by university officials at Columbus State outside a student residence. University police alleged that there had been reports of a man loading a gun. They claimed that the man then lifted his arm, which is when police decided to shoot . 'When they did confront the suspect there were shots fired.' A spokesman for the university, John Lester, told the Ledger that officers confronted the suspect but when they ran after him, he faced the officers and lifted his arm - at which point the officers shot the man. Yesterday, a tweet from the . university's Twitter page read: 'Police shot a man (NOT a student) today . after responding to CY1 of a report of a man w/a (sic) gun. The man ran . but turned threateningly' But the Flint family have told the paper, through their attorney Stacey Jackson, that three witnesses said Flint was still running when he was shot. Mr Jackson also said that some witnesses had alleged that Flint was not armed. The Ledger has reported that the parents have not been allowed to see their son's body. Mr Jackson said that Flint had been with a group of friends visiting students at the university. Mr Jackson told WTVM that there are cameras near the scene and he hopes that CCTV footage of events will be available. Mr Drew added that no students appeared to have been placed in potential danger though he said there were some student witnesses. Campus officials declined to say how many students were in the apartments or nearby at the time. Bill Sutley, a university spokesman, later told AP in a statement that campus police had received a report of a man seen loading a gun near the apartments before the chase and that he had been shot by officers. He said he had no further details about the shooting or why the man was on campus. The university statement added that a local coroner's office had confirmed to campus police that the man was later pronounced dead at a hospital where he had been taken by ambulance at 3:15 p.m. The university said it was cooperating with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, a state law enforcement agency that routinely investigates police-involved shootings.  It also said counselors would be made available to students if needed. 'This is a terrible tragedy,' CSU Tim Mescon said. 'We'll cooperate fully with the investigation ... Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved in this as well as their families.' The university, situated near the Georgia line with Alabama, said on its online site that it has more than 8,200 students enrolled in numerous degree programs. The campus is located in downtown Columbus, some 100 miles from Atlanta.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 58-year-old Nebraska woman was sentenced to 30 days in jail after admitting killing her own family dog. Judy Lloyd, from Columbus, was sentenced on Friday for animal mistreatment. Prosecutors said Lloyd intentionally ran over the 15 to 20 pound dog last July. Jailed: Judy Lloyd, 58, (right) is serving a jail sentence for killing a family dog she contended was aggressive and posed a threat to young children. She ended up running over the dog deliberately. Here she is pictured with her oldest grandaughter Samantha . How could she? Lloys told the judge she was fearful of the family dog getting loose. The 15- to 20-pound dog had a history of attacking children and behaving aggressively on previous occasions . Lloyd apologized at her sentencing saying she was worried the dog would attack a child. She told the court the dog had a history of behaving aggressively. 'I just want to tell the court I'm very very sorry. I couldn’t cope,' she said, wiping tears from her eyes. 'I just didn't know what else to do.' She said she knew her actions in killing the pet had caused pain to the members of her extended family. Lloyd is the owner of several dogs including a black cocker spaniel, but that pet apparently did not show anywhere near the same level of aggression as her other white cross-bred dog. Does this dog look aggressive? The defenseless pooch was tied to a wooden pallet in the woods and then deliberately run over. Lloyd ran over the dog multiple times with her car, put the body in a sack and disposed of it in the Lost Creek drainage canal . Apology: 'I couldn't cope', Lloyd said. 'I just didn't know what else to do.' Here Judy Lloyd is seen holding one of her other dogs which is still alive . An investigation by Platte County . Sheriff’s Deputy Tom Brandl described Lloyd as being 'very concerned' about the dog’s aggressiveness and that the city woman decided to . euthanize the animal herself. Prosecutors said Lloyd took the 15-to-20 . pound dog to a rural area and tied it to a wooden pallet before running . over the dog several times. She disposed of the body in a drainage . canal. The dog's body was never found. Lloyd could have been sent to jail for up to year along with a $1,000 fine so her 30 day sentence is light when compared to the possible maximum penalties she could have faced.","Judy Lloyd says she killed her family dog because it was aggressive and posed a threat to young children .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . The prominent Aspen family of slain socialite Nancy Pfister - whose body was mysteriously found in the closet of her home last month - are now under watch by the sheriff's department amid concerns other suspects in the murder case have not been apprehended. While three people have already been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree in connection to the case, authorities say the investigation is not over and are not taking any precautions when it comes to the victims relatives. The first homicide investigation in Aspen in over a decade, Pfister was the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister, who developed the Buttermilk Mountain Ski Area. While both parents are dead, Page Six have reported that her sisters, Suzanne and Christina, as well as her daughter Juliana, have been assigned security by the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office. Ongoing: The badly-beaten body of Nancy Pfister, 57 (left), was found stuffed in a closet on her Aspen home on February 26 and now at least three of her relative, including daughter Juliana (right) have been placed under security guard . 'They’re not sure if they’ve got them all,' a source told the column. 'There could be others lurking. Nancy’s relatives have been assigned security by the sheriff’s department. 'They are very grateful for that, and the support of friends and loved ones.' Police and prosecutors have been tight-lipped about what they believe happend to Pfister, essentially releasing no information about the case, however the three accused have all separated appeared in court. Pfister, 57, who was briefly engaged to actor Michael Douglas, was found severely beaten in her mountain home on February 26, just four days after returning from an extended trip to Australia, authorities said. Pfister's assistant and friend, Katherine Carpenter, 56, who discovered her body, is the latest to be arrested and charged with her alleged murder. Latest suspect: Katherine Carpenter - a friend of victim Nancy Pfister, who paid her to overlook her home while Pfister traveled - has been formally charged with first-degree murder. However details about the case remain scant . The tenants: Nancy Christine Styler, 62, and husband William Francis Styler III, 65, have been charged with allegedly killing Pfister, their landlord, and shoving her in a closet . The tenants staying in Pfister's home, William F. Styler III, 65, and his wife, Nancy Styler, 62, were the first to be formally charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they haven't paid utilities'. Over the years Pfister had paid Carpenter, an employee at two Apline bank branches in Aspen, to manage her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month lease. On February 6, Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that anyone interested should contact Carpenter. She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter. William Styler, wearing an orange jail outfit, kept his head down as he was brought into Pitkin County District Court in a wheelchair. earlier this month. Nancy Styler entered the courtroom in handcuffs immediately after her husband. The Stylers are represented by separate lawyers and did not acknowledge each other. Evidence: Posts put on Facebook by Pfister detailed the problems she was having with her home in Aspen, where she was inevitably found dead. Investigators spent weeks at the home gathering evidence . Juliana Pfister attended those proceedings surrounded by friends, telling ABC News that she couldn't believe someone would kill her fun-loving mother because of an alleged rent dispute. 'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house?' she said. 'There's got to be something more. It's hard to understand that.' Investigators spent weeks at Pfister's house, which remained an active crime, removing many boxes and files as evidence. County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo has released few details about the resort town's first murder investigation since 2001. 'This is a very important case,' he said. 'It just doesn't happen in Aspen.' Police have not ruled out making more arrests the Pfister's death remains an open investigation. The autopsy report has not been released and all records in the case have been sealed. Bail has not been set for any of the defendants. Old life: William Styler, a former physician, and his gardening expert wife Nancy look relaxed as they smile for a photo. The couple have been charged with murdering Nancy Pfister . Carpenter worked as a bank teller at two Alpine Bank branches - the Aspen Business Center and East Hopkins Avenue. The bank recognized her 20-year service in November. According to public records, she kept a post office box in Woody Creek . and had lived in various towns throughout Colorado. She also filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in . 1999, according to federal court records. Two Alpine Bank customers told The Aspen Times that Carpenter was friendly. 'I would have bet the farm that she didn’t do it,' one of the customers said. Friends of the Stylers say they have been shocked at the arrests. 'They never demonstrated any kind of edge,' Dr. Joel Cooperman, a former neighbor, told the Denver Post. 'Neither of them displayed any kind of behavior that would indicate they would do anything like this.' 'I would laugh to think that that’s what they were involved in. They can't be,' Ned Ingham, a former neighbor, told CBS. 'I am totally floored. It would the last thing I’d ever think.' Dr . Styler, known as Trey, was an anesthesiologist and the chairman of St. Joseph Hospital's Department of Anesthesiology in the 1990s. The couple, who have a son, lived in . the Greenwood Village area until about eight years ago, when Styler was . hit by a chronic illness. He quit his medical practice and his license . expired in 2005. Afterwards, he turned his attentions to helping his wife in her full-time gardening career. She . founded the Victoria Conservancy and provided lilies to gardening . entities around the world, becoming known as a leading expert on the . variety of an 8-foot species called Victoria. They also welcomed school . children into the garden to look at the flowers and their pond. 'They would have people from all over the world over there,' neighbor Ned Ingham said. 'They were known famously for their flowers.' A . photographer, Povy Kendal Atchison, spent time photographing the . Stylers' gardens and the couple for business shots at the time 'things . were going south for them'. Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at his Colorado motel room . Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found . She . told the Denver Post that they seemed like they were good people until . their money started running out. Court documents reveal the extent of . their troubles. In . 2003, Styler had taken his previous company, Colorado Anesthesia . Consultants, to court in a dispute over software Styler had co-created, . but he lost the case. He . accused his lawyer John Powell, whom he had paid $600,000, for . overcharging him for legal services - and in 2010, Styler sued Powell . for the debt, the Aspen Times reported. He . won and Powell was put on probation and ordered to pay $800,000. But . before the Stylers got the money, Powell filed for bankruptcy, . protecting him from having to pay the . debt. The report in the . Aspen Times says that the scandal led Styler to express suicidal . thoughts, including telling an attorney that he wanted to commit . 'suicide by cop'. In court: Nancy Styler is escorted by two deputies to Pitkin County Courthouse during her first appearance earlier this month . Locked up: Styler - who had been suffering various illnesses before his arrest -and his wife are being held without bond . 'It was very devastating to him,' said Paul Gordon, a Denver attorney who represented Styler. Last summer, Powell complained to the state's Attorney . Regulation Counsel that Styler was observing his house - and Styler responded that he was trying to find out if Powell still lived there . As . recently as November last year, Styler had written to the . court’s Attorney Regulation Counsel about his frustrations in collecting . money - the same time he was renting the property from . Pfister. When she returned from Australia and . evicted the couple nearly two weeks ago, they had been staying at the . Aspenalt Lodge in Basalt, where rooms cost $119 per night. William Styler was taken . from the motel still wearing his bathrobe, while his wife was seen with . tears streaming down her face. Missed: Pfister, pictured right with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills . Well-connected: Nancy Pfister was once briefly engaged to actor Michael Douglas . Nancy Pfister's remains were cremated on Monday and relatives and residents are holding a memorial service for her on March 15. Her murder has rocked the small ski resort town, where residents said Pfister had been a popular, well-connected resident. 'She'd been one of the golden girls of Aspen, seriously into the party scene [in her youth],' a source told Page Six. 'She hung out with the Kennedys, Jack Nicholson, Cher, Michael Douglas.' The source added that Pfister was even once briefly engaged to Douglas. Pfister's . daughter said she is waiting to find out more details on the case. Juliana added that her mother had been a beloved member of the community. 'I . have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to . her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or . hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' Pfister said.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A New York woman has died getting discount cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic. Beverly Brignoni was seeking a less expensive way to enhance her appearance and she did what many other people are now doing: travel abroad for cosmetic surgery. But it went horribly wrong. The 28-year-old died February 20 from what the doctor told her family was a massive pulmonary embolism while getting a tummy tuck and liposuction at a clinic in the Dominican capital recommended by friends. Family members have serious questions about her death and want local authorities to investigate. 'We want to know exactly what happened,' said Bernadette Lamboy, Brignoni's godmother. 'We want to know if there was negligence.' Sad: Beverly Brignoni, pictured, died after cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic . The district attorney's office for Santo Domingo says it has not yet begun an investigation because it has not received a formal complaint from Brignoni's relatives. Family members say they plan to make one. Shortly after Brignoni's death, the Health Ministry inspected the Vista del Jardin Medical Center where she was treated and ordered the operating room temporarily closed, citing the presence of bacteria and violations of bio-sanitary regulations. The doctor who performed the procedure and the clinic have not responded to requests for comment. Brignoni's death is unusual, but it is not isolated. Concerns about the booming cosmetic surgery business in the Dominican Republic are enough of an issue that the State Department has posted a warning on its page for travel to that country, noting that in several cases U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued an alert March 7 after health authorities in the United States reported that at least 19 women in five states had developed serious mycobacterial wound infections over the previous 12 months following cosmetic procedures in the Dominican Republic such as liposuction, tummy tucks and breast implants. There were no reported deaths in those cases, but treatment for these types of infections, which have been caused in the past by contaminated medical equipment, tend to involve long courses of antibiotics and can require new surgery to remove infected tissue and drain fluid, said Dr. Douglas Esposito, a CDC medical officer. Excited: Brignoni's last Instagram picture showed her passport and boarding pass on her way to the Dominican Republic . 'Some of these patients end up going through one or more surgeries and various travels through the medical system,' Esposito said. 'They take a long time typically to get better.' The Dominican Republic, like countries such as Mexico, Costa Rica and Thailand, has promoted itself as a destination for medical tourism, so-called because people will often tack on a few days at a resort after undergoing surgery. The main allure is much lower costs along with the promise that conditions will be on par with what a patient would encounter at home. In 2013, there were more than 1,000 cosmetic procedures performed in the Dominican Republic, 60 percent of them on foreigners, according to the country's Plastic Surgery Society. The Internet is flooded with advertisements and testimonials from people who say they have had successful procedures in the Dominican Republic, and an industry of 'recovery houses' has sprung up to serve clients, along with promoters who canvass for clients in the United States. The price is often about a third of the cost in the United States. Dr. Braun Graham, a plastic surgeon in Sarasota, Florida, says he done corrective surgery on people for what he says were inferior procedures abroad. He warns that even if a foreign doctor is talented, nurses and support staff may lack adequate training. 'Clearly, the cost savings is certainly not worth the increased risk of a fatal complication,' said Graham, past president for Florida Society of Plastic Surgeons. Brignoni was referred to the Vista del Jardin Medical Center by several acquaintances in the New York borough of The Bronx where she lived, said Lamboy and Lenny Ulloa, the father of the 4-year-old daughter she left behind. Probe: Brignoni's family are pushing for an investigation into the clinic and doctor . 'Supposedly, it was a high-end clinic, one of the best in the city,' Ulloa said. The doctor who performed Brignoni's procedure, Guillermo Lorenzo, is certified by the Plastic Surgery Society, but there are at least 300 surgeons performing cosmetic procedures who are not, said Dr. Severo Mercedes, the organization's director. He said the government knows about the problem but has not taken any action. 'We complain but we can't go after anyone because we're not law enforcement,' Mercedes said. The number of people pursuing treatment in the Dominican Republic doesn't seem to have been affected by negative reports, including a previous CDC warning about a cluster of 12 infections in 2003-04. In one recent case, the Dominican government in February closed a widely advertised clinic known as 'Efecto Brush,' for operating without a license. Prosecutors opened a criminal case after at least six women accused the clinic of fraud and negligence. The director, Franklin Polanco, is free while awaiting trial. He denies wrongdoing. There was also the case of Dr. Hector Cabral. New York prosecutors accused him of conducting examinations of women in health spas and beauty parlors in that state in 2006-09 without a license, then operating on them in the Dominican Republic, leaving some disfigured. Cabral pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized practice of medicine in October 2011 and returned to the Dominican Republic, where he still practices. In 2009, Dominican authorities charged Dr. Johan Tapia Bueno with illegally practicing plastic surgery at his apartment after several women, including a local television personality, accused him of malpractice that left them with infections. Awaiting trial, he has pleaded innocent to charges that include fraud. Juan Linares, a lawyer hired by Brignoni's boyfriend, said he is still awaiting an autopsy report. Because she arrived in the country late at night on a delayed flight and was on the operating table early the next morning, a main concern is whether she received an adequate medical evaluation before the procedure. Graham, the Florida surgeon, said sitting on a plane for several hours can cause blood to stagnate in the legs and increase the risk of an embolism. Brignoni paid the Dominican clinic $6,300 for a combination of liposuction, tummy tuck and breast surgery. Lamboy said she had decided not to have the work done on her breasts and was expecting a partial refund. The woman, who worked as a property manager, had lost about 80 pounds about a year earlier after gastric bypass surgery. Brignoni was clearly excited about the procedure. Her final post on Facebook was a photo she took of her hands holding her passport and boarding pass for the flight from New York to Santo Domingo. 'She wanted it so bad,' her godmother said. 'It felt like she was going to have a better outlook on life, getting this done.'","Beverly Brignoni traveled to the country seeking a less expensive way to enhance her appearance .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . After the twin bombings at the Boston Marathon last April, mourners began leaving thousands of items at a makeshift memorial near the finish line to honor the victims of the attacks. Some left teddy bears, signs and marathon bibs while others draped running sneakers to commemorate the three people killed and more than 260 injured during the April 15 attacks. A cross was set up for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer fatally shot three days later amid a search for the bombing suspects. To mark the anniversary of the bombings, the material will be curated into an exhibit called 'Dear Boston: Messages from the Marathon Memorial'. It will be hosted by the Boston Public Library from April 7 to May 11. Scroll down for video . 'Keep on running, Boston': Running shoes and other items left at the original memorial for Boston bombing victims last year will be on display at the Boston Public Library . Among the numerous heartfelt messages left at Copley Square was one from a Sandy Hook mother that reads, 'We understand. Sending love and support.' Other notes urged resilience: 'Don't let this stop you. Stay Boston Strong' and 'We will run again'. One colorful sign had more than 10 towns in Massachusetts forming the shape of a heart, saying 'Stands with Boston!!!' underneath. And multiple messages of 'I love my city' and 'Boston Strong' memorabilia were scattered throughout the square. Messages were sent from across the world, including Israel, South Korea, Turkey and Venezuela. But the long-term home for these artifacts is still in flux. Until then, any paper tributes will be held in the Boston archives and the other artifacts will be kept in storage. Heartbreaking: Thousands of items were left at a makeshift memorial near the Boston Marathon finish line in Boston's Copley Square, including this teddy bear dropped off by Bostonian Kevin Brown last year . An online catalog called 'Our Marathon' is hosted by Northeastern University and features 18,000 cards addressed to the mayor's office. Photos of other objects that can't be scanned will also be included. The city has also lent out a few of the items for exhibits at the Cambridge Public Library, Northeastern University and the mayor's office. John McColgan of the City of Boston Archives said collecting and preserving the material was a collaborative effort. Various companies helped by fumigating, gathering and storing the material at no charge, he said.

One volunteer, Kevin Brown, trekked almost two hours from his home in Brockton to the memorial site for a month to help maintain the grounds and protect the memorabilia by sweeping and putting up tarps when it rained. 'Boston needed a place to heal and someone had to do it,' said the 59-year-old Brown, who stayed at the memorial from 10am to 10pm daily.  'It just became a piece of me, and I loved to do it.' Brown, a self-employed carpenter, constructed the cross for the fallen MIT police officer. 'I did all this for the people of Boston,' he said. 'I just love this city.'

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A Florida city dubbed the most corrupt in the state has won its battle for survival after lawmakers tried to have it wiped off the map. The bid to have Hampton, Florida, stripped of its city status came after a scathing audit which revealed that city hall workers had run up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and committed 31 violations of the city's charter, as well as violations of . federal codes and laws. And the audit came just months after the city's Mayor was accused of allegedly dealing drugs. There are just 477 residents in sleepy Hampton, where a scathing audit found that the city had run up hundreds of thousands in debt . Hampton in the state of Florida is located in Bradford County and lies between Savannah and Orlando . Now, Hampton, a town of 477 residents, with a size of just one square mile, has been granted a final lifeline after being ordered to change its ways. And the conditions imposed on the city are severe: included disbanding the 19 person strong police force and handing over power to the County Sheriff's office as well as the resignation of all elected officials currently in power. The decision to save the city and strip it of its corrupt structure came after it was agreed that recommendations by State Representative Charles Van Zant and Senator Rob Bradley would be followed, First Coast News reported. After the meeting at Victory Church in the city centre, the state officials agreed to keep Hampton and withdrew the bill to dissolve it. During the campaign to keep the city alive, a Facebook group 'Save Our Town of Hampton, Fla', was set . up. On Saturday, a post on the site read 'Hampton lives!!'. Another, today, said: 'I'm so glad to see things turned around.' The city's limits were stretched so that funds could be boosted from the speed trap . Hampton came into the limelight after a notorious speed trap was set up on a road on its outskirts on Highway 301. In order to create the trap, the city limits were extended 1,260 feet down the width of the busy highway. Some of the money raised from the fines, $600,000 in three years, was then used to hire more police officers until the total number reached 19 - one for each of the 25 residents in Hampton. One of the officers was nicknamed 'Rambo' because he carried a gun to write out a speeding ticket. It was unclear how the rest of the funds were used, triggering a criminal investigation by the state of Florida in February. Beginning of the end: The town became infamous for all the speeding tickets it issued between 2010 and 2012, the city collected over $600,000 in fines . The town with just 477 inhabitants had 19 police officers until the ruling - one for every 25 inhabitants . Once the investigation was underway, . auditors found that $132,000 had been charged to a convenience store - . through a city account. It . was also revealed that a number of city employees were paid excesses, . on top of their salary, of $9,000 and the city credit card had $27,000 . of unexplained spending for 'no public purpose'. Hampton had already become the focus of criticism after Mayor Barry Layne Moore was accused of selling oxycodone, an opiod pain medication, following an undercover sting. Moore is now behind bars and has resigned. Resigned: The city's mayor Barry Layne Moore was arrested for allegedly trying to sell an oxycodone tablet to an undercover officer around Thanksgiving. He remains in jail unable to cover the $4,500 bond . But former Mayor Jim Mitzel, who left office two years ago, still has faith in the city. He told CNN: . 'The government bailed out General motors, the government bailed out . Chrysler, why can't the state of Florida bail out Hampton?' State Senator Rob Bradley, whose . district includes Hampton, and who conducted the investigation into the . city's books told Time: 'It’s like something out of a Southern Gothic . novel.' Former mayor Jim Mitzen agreed that the town should have been saved. He told CNN: 'The government bailed out General Motors, the government bailed out Chrysler, why can't the state of Florida bail out Hampton?' A decision was made at Victory Church, Hampton Florida to keep the city on the map . A state audit found the town had violated state and local laws with 31 misdeeds, some of them egregious and some of them just unbelievable. Some of the most shocking are as follows: .","Hampton remains on map after state decision-makers gave city last chance .
Changes to be made include resignation of all elected officials .
State audit in February found corruption and unexplained use of funds .
Former mayor in jail accused of selling oxycodone pill for $20 in November .

"By . Associated Press . Hobart 'Hobie' Alter, who helped popularize surfing and sailing with the development of the foam surfboard and the 'Hobie Cat' sailboat, has died aged 80. Alter passed away on Saturday at his Palm Desert home, according to a statement on the Hobie sporting goods website. A cause of death was not disclosed. The Orange County Register said he had been battling cancer, which he was diagnosed with about five years ago. 'He wanted to make a living without having to wear hard-soled shoes or work east of California's Pacific Coast Highway,' the statement said. Scroll down for video . Pioneer: Hobart 'Hobie' Alter (center), pictured with his sisters Carolyn Wise (left) and Lillian Spencer (right) in December 2013, has died aged 80 . 'By 'making people a toy and giving . them a game to play with it' he was able to realize this dream. And in . the process, he introduced the world to an outdoor lifestyle and . collection of products that made things just a bit more fun for all of . us.' A true ocean lover, Alter was a champion surfer who conquered the Makaha International Surf Contest in 1958 and 1959, and won a trio of tandem surfing championships from 1961-’63. But Alter’s legacy will always be as surfboard and sailboat production pioneer. He was dubbed 'the Henry Ford of the surfboard industry' by Steve Pezman for his contribution to the large-scale manufacture of surfboards. Champion: Hobie Alter (pictured) was a champion surfer before he went on to create foam surfboards, becoming the face of California's surfing culture . Where it all began: Hobie Alter opened his first retail shop in Dana Point, California (pictured) in 1954 and revolutionized surfing with his foam boards. An original Hobie long board is pictured . Pioneer: Alter developed skateboards (pictured) in addition to catamarans and surfboards . The self-taught innovator and surfer . had his start in the early 1950s carving wooden surfboards in the garage . of his family's Laguna Beach home. When . the balsa wood used for the boards became scarce, he and his friend . Gordon 'Grubby' Clark created surfboards out of polyurethane foam. The . boards were durable, but had better flexibility and were less expensive . than wooden boards. The invention revolutionized surfing, and Hobie . became a top surfboard brand. Clark went on to launch Clark Foam, which . had a virtual monopoly on the unshaped foam blocks that were used for . custom-made boards. In the late 60s, Alter turned his focus to sailing and designed a lightweight sailboat inspired by the twin-hulled Polynesian catamaran. The more affordable Hobie Cat, which could be launched from the beach, is credited with bringing high-performance sailing to the masses. For his contribution to the sport, Alter was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011. He was survived by his wife, Susan, a daughter and two sons.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The youngest daughter of director and writer Orson Welles is giving film buffs a chance to buy some of his personal possessions, including a camera, scripts and photos from the set of Citizen Kane. Beatrice Welles said her screen legend father would have approved of selling his possessions to film buffs rather than giving them to a museum because 'he did not believe in academic things.' 'It's about the last thing he would've wanted. He just did not believe in schooling,' Ms Welles from said from her Sedona, Arizona, home. 'And museums kind of have that connotation and I thought 'No, this is not right for him.'

She is handing more than 70 items over to Heritage Auctions, which will stage the auction on April 26. Margaret Barrett, director of entertainment-related auctions, declined to speculate on any possible bidding amounts but said she expects huge interest. 'People are still talking about him decades after his death,' Barrett said. One of the enduring signs of fame is when young people know who someone is — someone who might have passed away decades ago.' Barrett said she thinks Welles' old Bell & Howell movie camera will be one of the bigger sellers. According to his daughter, he used the camera for home movies. In fact, one of the photos in another lot up for bidding shows Welles using the camera to record a bullfight in Spain. Other items are reminders of Welles' more painful Hollywood experiences. Two scripts for 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' a 1942 film he wrote and directed, reveal two different endings Welles had in mind; neither ended up in the film. Two scrapbooks filled with newspaper clippings about the nationwide panic from Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of War of the Worlds . The movie, which centres on a spoiled heir's attempt to keep his mother from marrying her first love, was famously re-edited by someone else. 'They kept on changing his pictures around and not letting him finish them. That hurt him,' Beatrice Welles said. 'The only one he was allowed to do completely from start to end was 'Citizen Kane.'' Long considered Welles' masterpiece for its innovations in editing and cinematography, the 1941 'Citizen Kane' follows the lonely life of wealthy publishing magnate Charles Foster Kane. Not among the auction cache is any Rosebud-type childhood memento of Welles'. Rosebud was the name of the sled mourned by the titular character in 'Kane' that burns at the end of the film. According to Beatrice Welles, director Steven Spielberg bought a version of the sled in 1982, also at auction, and was later teased by her father about its authenticity. 'My father and Steven were having lunch and my father said 'I hate to tell you something, but there was only one sled in Citizen Kane. Do you remember the ending?''

Her mother, Italian actress Paola Mori, died less than year after Welles. The double loss was devastating. 'When they died ... I just couldn't even look at the stuff,' she said. Celebrity interactions and globe-trotting made up Beatrice Welles' unconventional upbringing, where her father's 'Moviola editing machine was like part of our luggage.' By the age of three, Beatrice Welles was getting an education any film student would have loved. She often sat on her father's lap while he cut movies in the editing room. As she got older, she even pitched in. 'I'd get the two pieces of whatever celluloid film it is on the machine. ... He would tell me where to cut and I would cut and do it for him,' Beatrice Welles said. Her father wasn't always comfortable with being revered as a film genius, she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police are thought to be close to making an arrest in the high-profile murder case of Menachem Stark but, despite the Orthodox Jewish real estate developer owing as much as $40 million debts at the time of his death, his killers could have been following up an unpaid bill of just $20,000. According to The New York Post, investigators are focused on a contractor and several of the 40-year-old's relatives, almost three months after the discovery of his charred body in a Long Island dumpster on January 3. Stark was abducted outside his office at 331 Rutledge St in Brooklyn about 11.35pm the night before. The biggest development in the case since has been location of the van used in his abduction, which was caught on CCTV cameras parking on the street at 5pm on the day of his kidnapping. Scroll down for video . Breakthrough: On January 14 police located the Dodge minivan (center) used in the kidnapping of Menachem Stark, which was carrying Ohio numberplate and is believed to have lead them to man of interest . A contractor who allegedly murdered slumlord Menachem Stark was owed $20,000 by the Brooklyn developer, it has been claimed . A suspect in the kidnap and murder of Stark is seen on security camera footage on the night of January 2. The man arrived at the scene in the minivan at 5pm and allegedly abducted Stark at 11.35pm . The same man who parked the van had been seen lurking in the area since December 19. When Stark left his office he was confronted by two men in the snow, whom he spoke to for two minutes before being pulled into the car. The 2002 Dodge minivan, which was carrying number plates from Ohio, was located on  January 14 in Brownsville, 10 days after Stark's murder. Stark's DNA was found inside the van, whose owner was questioned by 90th Precinct cops at the time it was located. The contractor at the center of the investigation is said to have a connection to the van. Investigators also have been able to track the cellphone of one of the suspects in the area where the body was dumped, a law-enforcement source told The Post. Complicating the case has been what sources described as Stark's long list of possible enemies, ranging from jilted business associates to tenants. Stark's autopsy revealed he died of compression asphyxiation - which likely happened when his kidnappers sat on him during the brutal attack. Sources believe his kidnappers probably did not intend to kill him. His body was likely then set on fire to conceal its identity. Murdered: The charred body of Menachem Stark, a father-of-eight, was found in a dumpster . Investigation: Footage shows the suspect parking the white minivan believed to have been used in the kidnap . Detectives are telling the family that an arrest is imminent - before Passover on April 14, or immediately after the eight-day holiday, a source said. Detectives believe that the intent of the abduction was to scare Stark into paying off his debt. According . to public records seen by The Post, Stark and his business . partner, Israel Perlmutter, owed more than $40 million to creditors. Tenants in the rental properties he owned in Brooklyn allegedly had lists of complaints about conditions. A member of the ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidic sect - which separates itself from secular society and believes that Jews should not have a homeland in Israel until the arrival of the Messiah - Stark and Perlmutter began buying up properties Brooklyn in 2000. Between 2003 and 2005 they shelled out $18 million - money raised from investors, family and friends - on 12 properties. Between 2006 and 2008 they spent even more - $39 million on 17 properties. Grief: Hundreds of mourners carry the coffin of Menachem Stark through the streets of Brooklyn during his funeral. Stark was a member of the ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidic sect, which separates itself from secular society and believes that Jews should not have a homeland in Israel until the arrival of the Messiah . In total, by 2008, they spent a staggering $61 million on 37 Brooklyn buildings, a combination of large apartment buildings and industrial properties, according to a Real Deal analysis. But he was far from an ideal landlord, with his properties garnering 233 complaints and 148 violations, according to the city Department of Buildings, and nearly 200 Environmental Control Board violations. By 2009 he had fallen behind a slew of mortgage payments following the market crash, owing as much as $60 million in soured loans. Stark and Perlmutter sold off what they could and were soon hit by nine fore­closure lawsuits on 17 of their properties. They filed for bankruptcy protection in six cases. Documents also show Stark withdrew $1 million in checks in the month before he died.","Menachem Stark, 40, was a real estate developer in New York City .

Eight days later, she was fired. The woman sued for invasion of privacy and wrongful termination. Sterling won a court fight that kept her case in private arbitration. The case went to mediation and was settled.

"By . Tara Brady . A curious cheetah shocked safari visitors when it jumped onto their car and poked its head through an open window. The young male jumped onto the bonnet to look for prey but with nothing in sight turned its attention to the front seat passenger Lee Whittam, 39.

'But once we'd recovered from the initial shock we enjoyed the extremely close views and inquisitive looks from this young male as he sniffed, licked and chewed bits of the vehicle that intrigued him.'

'Young animals are often inquisitive but it's not often that they actually make physical contact with a vehicle - and it is certainly not common to actually jump up on one. 'What will probably happen in this case is that the young male will outgrow his inquisitive nature and stop jumping onto vehicles - but it's very likely that he'll remain totally relaxed in their presence.'

"By . Tara Brady . Japan has been temporarily banned from killing whats after the International Court of Justice ruled it is not for scientific purposes as the Japanese had claimed. Australia had sued Japan at the UN's highest court for resolving disputes between nations in the hope of ending whaling in the Southern Ocean. Reading a 12-4 decision by the court's 16-judge panel, Presiding Judge Peter Tomka, of Slovakia, said Japan's program failed to justify the large number of minke whales it aims to catch under its current Antarctic program - 850 annually. Scroll down for video . In this photo taken in January 2014 three dead minke whales lie on the deck of the Japanese whaling vessel Nisshin Maru in the Southern Ocean . It also failed to catch nearly that number and didn't come close to catching the 50 fin and 50 humpback whales it also aimed to take. All that drew into doubt whether Japan's whaling is for scientific purposes, he said. 'The evidence does not establish that the program's design and implementation are reasonable in relation to achieving its stated objectives,' Tomka said. The court ordered Japan to halt any issuing of whaling permits until the program has been revamped. Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Noriyuki Shikata told reporters that the country 'regrets and is deeply disappointed' by the decision. But 'as a state that respects the rule of law ... and as a responsible member of the global community, Japan will abide by the ruling of the court.' Greenpeace activist Mikey Resato on top a harpooned whale as crew members aboard a Japanese whaling vessel hose him down in the Southern Ocean . The decision is a major victory for Australia and environmental groups that oppose whaling on ethical grounds although it will not mean the end of whaling. Japan has a second, smaller program in the northern Pacific. Meanwhile Norway and Iceland reject a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission and conduct for-profit whaling. Nevertheless, environmental groups rejoiced. The ruling 'certainly has implications ultimately for whaling by Iceland and Norway as well,' said Patrick Ramage, director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare's whale program, outside the courtroom. 'I think it will increase pressure on those two countries to re-examine their own whaling practices and the various reasons and pretexts given for that whaling activity.' Workers on a Japanese whaling vessel dragging two whales which are tied to the side of their ship in the Southern Ocean . Japan had argued that Australia's suit was an attempt to force its cultural norms on Japan, equivalent to Hindus demanding an international ban on killing cows. Though consumption of whale meat has declined in popularity in Japan in recent years, it is still considered a delicacy by some. Japan has pledged to abide by the court's ruling. Monday's ruling found that killing whales for scientific purposes would be justifiable under international law in the context of a better-designed study. Japan's program was supposed to determine whether commercial whaling of some species can resume without bringing them in danger of extinction. The ruling noted among other factors that Japan had not considered a smaller program or non-lethal methods to study whale populations. In its defense, Japan cited only two peer-reviewed scientific papers relating to its program from 2005 to the present - a period during which it has harpooned 3,600 minke whales, a handful of fin whales, and no humpback whales at all.","Australia sued Japan in the hope of ending whaling in the Southern Ocean .

"By . Tara Brady . These are the adorable first images of newborn octopus hatchlings, which, even with their eight legs, are still smaller than a penny. The octopi hatched overnight between March 17 and March 18 at the Mote Marine Laboratory, in Sarasota in Florida. The species of octopus - a Caribbean pygmy - are typically nocturnal, with the babies often hiding in order to avoid predators. Little sucker: A newborn Octopus hatchling which even with its eight legs is still smaller than a penny . According to staff, the mother octopus arrived at the marine lab after she had already mated. The octopi are born fully intact and can hunt almost immediately. This particular species of octopi will grow to about the size of a silver dollar and eat small benthic invertebrates which live at the bottom of the sea. Octopi reproduction is rather unique - males have a specially adapted arm which they use to transfer sperm packets into to a female's mantle cavity. Teeny: The baby octopus puts its tiny tentacles next to a rubber on the end of a pencil . Octopi lead short, solitary lives of one to two years, and males and females do not remain together. Males die within a few months of mating. The female at Mote laid around 50 eggs, which took around two months to hatch. After eggs are laid, the female devotes the rest of her life to caring for them. She will guard the eggs and keep water circulating around them so that the developing offspring receive enough oxygen. The mother stops eating after her eggs are laid, and dies soon after they hatch. The Caribbean pygmy will grow to the size of a silver dollar unlike a common octopus which is a lot bigger .","Octopi hatched at the Mote Marine Laboratory, in Sarasota in Florida .

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson . Relaxed: Geri Halliwell and Christian Horner enjoy a springtime stroll together . Walking arm-in-arm down a London street, Geri Halliwell and Formula 1 team boss Christian Horner look every inch the happy couple. Rumours of a relationship have surrounded the pair for some weeks, but it is only now they seem ready to declare themselves ‘an item’. But behind this happy picture lies a very upsetting domestic drama. For the head of the Red Bull team and heir to Bernie Ecclestone’s throne has cast aside his long-term partner, Beverley Allen, who only gave birth to his daughter, Olivia, six months ago, in favour of the former Spice Girl. And while the couple have only been seeing each other for a matter of months, The Mail on Sunday has learnt the pop star has been keen to strike up a friendship with Horner for years – as these pictures show. In 2009, Geri attended the Monaco Grand Prix and was pictured on the arm of Bernie Ecclestone with Horner hovering in the background. Ginger Spice, 41, is nothing if not determined and two years later she was in Monaco again. This time she had one arm flung around the flamboyant former team owner and BBC  commentator Eddie Jordan and the other clasping the back of a clearly nervous Horner. Leaning away, with at least a foot between them, his expression is something between a smile and a grimace. But what a difference another two years and a sense of purpose makes.  At the 2013 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the couple are virtually holding hands. Geri smiles straight into the camera while a much slimmer Horner seems happy and relaxed.  Perhaps worryingly, Beverley was six months pregnant with their daughter at the time. It’s not clear how the relationship between Formula 1’s best-loved  couple descended into difficulties at what should have been a time of such joy. But sources says Geri had clearly set her sights on the talented and successful  sporting boss. Last night, a friend of Horner’s said she had been following him 'for a few years’. Yesterday, Beverley, a former pub landlady, was closeted behind the gates of the couple’s sprawling Oxfordshire mansion where in happier times the couple kept chickens, ducks, dogs and miniature ponies. History: Geri Halliwell poses with F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone in 2009 - as Horner looks on in the background . The 46-year-old, who must surely be devastated at being supplanted by Geri, refused to comment. The couple have now separated. One crew member who saw Geri and Horner together at the British Grand Prix last summer said: ‘It was really weird. Geri just sort of appeared – I mean appeared everywhere. 'So after the race, Christian was giving an interview and she just wandered into the shot. She wasn’t supposed to be there and no one was expecting her, but then she was given a microphone and just sort of gatecrashed the interview.’ According to those who know him, Horner is charming, polite and unfailingly calm – despite being the boss of a 650-strong workforce and in charge of one of the most high-profile racing teams in the world. One colleague said: ‘He’s always well mannered, very nice. He doesn’t swagger around, although Beverley’s a bit more aware of her position. ‘Red Bull always have parties after the race and she’s been known to tell people off for carrying a Coke in the Red Bull area. You often see him just sitting quietly in a corner. He seems older than he is.’ Horner raced in Formula 3000, the series one rung below Formula 1 before taking over Red Bull in 2005 aged just 31. Under his stewardship, the Milton Keynes-based team has enjoyed a spectacular rise, winning virtually every title going in the past four years. More recent: A crew member claimed the way the former Spice Girl (centre) 'wandered into shot' was 'really weird'. Also pictured are Horner, right, and BBC F1 commentator Eddie Jordan (left) Once asked about the key to his success, Horner said: ‘I never struggle for motivation. Motivation is something that burns within. I think winning becomes addictive. ‘It’s the fear of failure that drives all of us at Red Bull. Formula 1 is such a competitive business that you can’t afford to miss a beat. I’m still relatively young and there’s still an awful lot I want to achieve.’ If he does inherit Ecclestone’s empire, Horner’s power will extend far beyond the sporting arena. One commentator said: ‘You’ve got to understand how much influence Grand Prix has. ‘Bernie is the man that shakes Putin’s . hand and says yes, we’ll bring a race to Sochi. Politicians, Arab . princes, the world’s richest businessmen, they all flock to Formula 1.’ Before the split: Horner with Beverley in 2012 . The high-octane world of motor-racing is no doubt one that appeals to Geri, who experienced global fame with the Spice Girls in the 1990s but has never enjoyed the same success since. One friend explained: ‘It’s as though she can’t really accept the Spice Girls days are behind her. She’s pretty self-obsessed. 'She talks about herself in the third person and still thinks she’s super-famous. She was in the South of France with a friend of mine and as they were getting on the yacht, she clicked her fingers at one of the guests and said, “Get rid of that man, I can’t have paparazzi around.’’ ‘Apart from the fact he was a guest, not some minion, and she shouldn’t have been speaking to him like that, it wasn’t a paparazzo. It was a tourist taking a picture of one of the superyachts.’ Geri has now been telling friends that ‘Christian’s the one,’ although she is notoriously unlucky in love, once admitting: ‘I think we all know that relationships haven’t been one of my strong points.’ Previous boyfriends have included Chris Evans, Russell Brand and Robbie Williams, who became exasperated by her demands and once said, rather ungallantly: ‘She turned into a demonic little girl playing with dolls and a tea set. She started speaking like a psychotic child and developed this possessed look. It was genuinely scaring me.’ Geri was once engaged to the Italian shipping tycoon Fabrizio Politi and had brief relationships with coffee entrepreneur Bobby Hashemi and screenwriter Sacha Gervasi, father of her seven-year-old daughter Bluebell. The friend said: ‘The problem with Geri is that she’s sweet but she’s incredibly intense. Everything has got to have a meaning. She reads a lot of self-help books such as The Secret and Feel The Fear and Do It Anyway. And she’s always on some mad diet or health kick, which is fine but she expects everyone else around her to do it too. ‘The only time she’s not so ‘‘mad’’ is when she’s around her daughter. She is an absolutely devoted mother. And I know she wanted a sibling for Bluebell. She was with her last boyfriend, Henry Beckwith [cousin of Tamara Beckwith] for about three years and when he finished it she was absolutely devastated.’ F1 fan: Geri Halliwell pictured again with Horner last June at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone . Geri and Horner apparently split for a short while last December while he attempted to rescue his relationship with the mother of his only child. Geri was said to be devastated. But the couple are now back together again and were recently spotted going for a walk with Bluebell near Geri’s London home. It must undoubtedly be a difficult time for the Formula 1 figure. He had been with Beverley for 14 years. Six years his senior, she had been by his side throughout his astonishing ascent while he acted as a stepfather to her two sons from a previous relationship, Kieron, now 25 and Liam, 21. Beverley gave birth to Horner’s child last October, at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, while he was away at the Japanese Grand Prix. He later explained he had hoped to fly home in time but Beverley went into labour earlier than expected. He told reporters at the time: ‘Olivia arrived about 3.30am Tokyo time. We went out for some karaoke on Wednesday and wetted the baby’s head. Fatherhood will probably be my biggest challenge.’ Although that was before he began dating Geri Halliwell.","Red Bull team chief Christian Horner seen walking arm in arm with Halliwell .

"By . Gabrielle Donnelly . She may have been a wife for only 18 months, but actress Anne Hathaway thinks she has found the secret of a happy marriage. So sure is she of her relationship rules that she’s had them laminated and stuck on the wall of the home she shares with husband Adam Shulman. One is to have a regular ‘digital detox’ day, away from the constant demands of the outside world. Anne Hathaway's to a happy marriage - keep the phones at bay for at least 24 hours and don't spend more than two weeks apart . ‘We try to have a period of at least 24 hours when we’re off our phones, unplugged from technology and concentrating on being together,’ she says. ‘It is surprising how hard it is, because if you’re doing business in the modern world you have to be accessible. ‘But I do try not to be available to absolutely everybody 24/7, and those times when it’s just Adam and me are the times I treasure.’ Then there is the two-week rule which means she and Adam – also an actor – never spend longer than a fortnight apart. ‘We have a laminated contract on the wall,’ she explains.  ‘I can’t say we work very hard at it, but we prioritise each other. ‘And if I have to travel we have the rule which means we can’t go more than two weeks without seeing each other. The Les Miserables actress also revealed that children are next on the agenda. She said: 'Now I’ve met the person  I want to spend . the rest of my life with, motherhood  is the next challenge.  It’s . definitely my No 1  goal' 'Because then you start picking on each other – I think you get so annoyed about not having the person you love there,  that you end up fighting about silly things.’ The Oscar-winning star of Les Miserables says that,  at 31, children are next on her agenda. ‘I’ve known since I was 16 that I wanted to have children,’ she says. ‘Now I’ve met the person  I want to spend the rest of my life with, motherhood  is the next challenge.  It’s definitely my No 1  goal. I would like to raise beautiful human beings.’ The actress said: 'But I do try not to be available to absolutely everybody 24/7, and those times when it's just Adam and me are the times I treasure'","Anne Hathaway has been married to Adam Shulman for 18 months .

"By . Ted Thornhill . As Malaysia mourns the victims of flight MH370 - which included 38 Malaysians - the nation's queen was photographed enjoying a round of golf. Her Majesty The Raja Agong Tuanku Hajah Haminah, The Queen of Malaysia, laughed heartily at Glenmarie Golf & Country Club in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday during a pro-am event prior to the EurAsia Cup. The pictures emerged as search teams from several nations continued to scour the southern Indian Ocean for debris from the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines plane in a bid to bring the relatives of the passengers some closure. Sheer joy: Her Majesty The Raja Agong Tuanku Hajah Haminah, The Queen of Malaysia, looks happy and carefree as Malaysia endures some of its darkest days . Tragic days: Pictures of the Queen enjoying herself on the golf course came as search teams continued to scour the oceans for MH370's wreckage . New satellite images have revealed 122 . objects in the southern Indian Ocean that could be debris from the . Malaysian jetliner, missing since March 8 with 239 people on board, . Malaysia's acting transport minister said on Wednesday. The . find has dramatically narrowed the search zone, with the debris spotted . across an area measuring just 155 square miles (400 square kilometres). In . the past few days the search area has measured around 622,000 square . miles - six times the size of the UK. On Wednesday around 31,000 square . miles was scoured. Delight: The Queen of Malaysia and Miguel Angel Jimenez, the Team Europe Captain, on the first tee during the pro-am event . Concentration: The Queen of Malaysia watches her shot on the second hole . Grief stricken: A relative of the Chinese passengers aboard the Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight grieves after being told that the missing plane might have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean . Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the images were captured by France-based Airbus Defence and Space on March 23. They are the fourth set of satellite . images to show potential debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in a . remote part of the Indian Ocean roughly 2,500 km (1,550 miles) south . west of Perth. The objects are believed to be solid and range from one metre to 23 metres (three to 75 feet) long. It . is understood some pieces of debris are 'bright' but authorities have . not confirmed whether they are from missing Malaysia Airlines flight . MH370. Anguish: Relatives of the passengers have been tortured by a lack of concrete information about the fate of MH370 . Flight MH370 vanished . from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from . Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing, and investigators believe someone on the . flight may have shut off the plane's communications systems. Partial . military radar tracking showed it turning west and recrossing the Malay . Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot. Malaysia's . air force has released few details of its radar tracking beyond saying . the plane was last detected off the northwest coast heading towards . India. But . the country's deputy defence minister, Abdul Rahim Bakri, told . parliament that no action was taken when the unidentified plane was . spotted because it was assumed it had been ordered to turn back, local . media said. 'It was detected by our radar, but the . turn back was by a non-hostile plane and we thought maybe it was at the . directive of the control tower,' he was quoted as saying. Asked . at the news conference whether air force radar operators thought the . plane had been told to turn back by air traffic controllers, . Hishammuddin, who is also defence minister, said he could not confirm . it. A dozen aircraft from . Australia, the United States, New Zealand, China, Japan and South Korea . were once more scouring the seas southwest of Perth in the hunt for . wreckage on Wednesday, after bad weather the previous day forced the . suspension of the search. But the area is renowned among mariners for high winds and big waves and the good weather is unlikely to last. ‘This . is only going to be a narrow window of opportunity by the looks of . things, because another weather system is moving in for Thursday, which . looks like that will bring an increase in winds again and also lead to a . reduction in visibility through the rain associated with the cold . front,’ Neil Bennett, a spokesman for Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, . told Reuters. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak this week confirmed Flight MH370 had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean.","Malaysia's queen was pictured playing golf in Kuala Lumpur .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They have never been the most tantalising of snacks – due in part, no doubt, to their use as a natural constipation remedy. But now sales of prunes are soaring, driven by their growing popularity with health-conscious Britons, according to a report. Endorsements by celebrity chefs such as Heston Blumenthal have also helped boost demand for the dried plums, which have recognised medical benefits due to high antioxidant levels. Prunes, often written off as a cure for constipation, have become popular with British diners . The volume of prune sales has risen by 8.8 per cent to 5.5million tonnes over the past year, with the value of sales up 5.4 per cent to £26.2million, data from analysts Kantar Worldpanel shows. Imports from California, the world’s largest producer of prunes, rose to 664 tonnes during January and February, 14 per cent up on  the same period in 2012. Trade magazine The Grocer  said: ‘Brits are developing a serious taste for prunes. ‘Sales are soaring and retailers and manufacturers are putting the once-unfashionable dried plums into a growing range of products.’ Waitrose used Californian prunes in its Heston Blumenthal Christmas Cake. The chef often praises the snack . Much of the increase was  down to Brits snacking more on prunes, but sales have also been boosted by retailers using them  as an ingredient in an increasingly wide range of products, according to a spokesman for the California Prune Board. She cited the example of M&S launching a prune-based brioche and a cheese containing the fruit  in 2012, and Waitrose using California prunes in its Heston Blumenthal Christmas Cake – one of its  top festive sellers. The spokesman added: ‘Prunes are a versatile product, illustrated by their increasing use in food manufacturing over the last year.’ She said retailers such as Aldi and health food chain Holland & Barrett reported that they had seen ‘significant increases’ in prune sales in the past year. Previous research has found that post-menopausal women can protect themselves against osteoporosis and bone fractures by eating around ten prunes a day.","Health benefits have seen a spike in demand for maligned snack .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Police investigating the apparent car attack at Beijing's Forbidden City searched Tuesday for information on two ethnic Uighur minority suspects, a hotel employee said, a day after the vehicle plowed through a crowd and crashed, killing five people and injuring 38. Police released no public information about a possible motive for the incident at one of China's most politically sensitive and heavily guarded public spaces, and it was not immediately clear if the two suspects were among the three people killed inside the vehicle. Two bystanders, including a Filipino woman, also were killed when the sport utility vehicle veered inside of a barrier separating a crowded sidewalk from a busy avenue and then drove toward Tiananmen Gate, which stands opposite the sprawling Tiananmen Square. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Five people have been killed after the flaming car sped into crowds at Tiananmen square . Beijing government officials are unsure if the incident at the busy tourist site  was a terrorist attack . Government officials held meetings in the wake of the incident to assess the city's security . Any incident in the area is sensitive . because the square was the focus of a 1989 pro-democracy movement that . was violently suppressed by the military. The . 38 injured were among the crowds in front of the gate, where a large . portrait of Mao Zedong hangs near the southern entrance to the former . imperial palace. Three other Filipinos and a Japanese man were among the . injured, police said, but there were no immediate details on their . conditions. Zhao Fuzhou, a . security official at Beijing's Xinjiang Dasha hotel, said police had . circulated a notice searching for information about two suspects with . Uighur names in the aftermath of Monday's deaths. Unconfirmed copies of . the notice also were widely circulated on the Chinese Internet. One . of the men, identified in the notice as Yusupu Wumaierniyazi, was . listed as living at the address of a town in Xinjiang in which 24 police . and civilians and 13 militants were killed in an attack on June 26. The square normally is under heavy security given its proximity to the Zhongnanhai compound of the central leadership . The car veered off the road at the north entrance of the square before ploughing into pedestrians .

Beijing police said on their microblog that they were taking ‘effective measures to ensure the capital's safety and stability.’ A . police statement said the vehicle had burst into flames after crashing . at about noon Monday into a guardrail for one of the ancient stone . bridges leading to the gate. The adjacent Chang'an Avenue was closed as . police and rescue services converged, but police said traffic was . restored just over an hour later. The square was the site of 1989 student-led protests which led to mass violence at the hands of military forces . A policeman walks past in front of the giant portrait of the late Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China . The . incident had every appearance of being deliberate, since the driver . apparently jumped a curb and traveled about 400 meters (yards) to the . spot where the car was said to have caught fire. Along the way, it . avoided trees, street lights and at least one security checkpoint.

"'I said it (the laptop) had a bit of porn or something like that,' he told jury . By . Martin Robinson . Rebekah Brooks' husband hid a stash of lesbian porn behind some bins to avoid police finding it and leaking details of his 'smut' to the press, the phone hacking trial heard today. Charlie Brooks told the Old Bailey he wanted to avoid a 'Jacqui Smith moment' for his wife - a reference to the former Labour Home Secretary's embarrassment when her husband watched a sex film later claimed on her expenses. The race horse trainer, his wife and former News International head of security Mark Hanna denies conspiracy to pervert the course of justice between July 5 and 19 2011 - by allegedly trying to hide evidence of hacking at the News of the World. Mr Brooks told the jury he 'incredibly stupidly' decided to hide a bag containing explicit DVDs and a case with a laptop inside, but claims it was not cover to up a crime. Admission: Charlie Brooks (pictured centre today with his wife Rebekah behind) told the hacking trial he hid lesbian porn and his laptop containing 'smut' to avoid police leaking details to the press . The trial heard previously the films included Instant Lesbian, Bride of Sin, and Lesbian Psychodrama volume 2 and 3. Brooks said he had hidden the items behind the bins of an underground car park at the couple's flat in Chelsea, west London. Asked by his counsel Neil Saunders why Brooks acted in this way, the witness said: 'The DVDs are of an embarrassing nature. 'On the Sony Vaio, the main reason was it (the laptop) had some important book ideas that weren't backed up anywhere else, but it also had a bit of smut on it. 'When I got back to the flat, I envisaged 20 policemen coming in and emptying every drawer and looking under every nook and cranny. 'I did think about my DVDs and I had my Jacqui Smith moment - a Home Secretary who was implicated by her husband's porn. 'I didn't want the same thing to happen to Rebekah.' Protection: Mr Brooks said he wanted to avoid a 'Jacqui Smith moment' for his wife, right. This is a reference to a former Home Secretary whose husband watched a porn film claimed on her expenses . Support: Ms Brooks arrived at the Old Bailey with her mother today, which heard about an alleged conspiracy to hide evidence of hacking . The incident happened while his wife was being interviewed by police in Lewisham. The court heard Rebekah Brooks had described her arrest that day as police making 'a PR point'. Star: Top Gear presenter and Chipping Norton resident Jeremy Clarkson watched from the public gallery today . Her husband went back to retrieve the bags later but they had gone, having been picked up by a caretaker and handed to police when the bins were emptied. Brooks told the court his motive to hide the belongings was the result of an 'instinctive reaction' that police could 'leak this sort of material to the press'. He told the court: 'Ever since Operation Weeting (the phone hacking investigation) had been at the buildings at News International, a lot of stuff had been leaked, particularly to the Guardian. 'A lot of stuff had been leaked and I was very aware of that.' He said: 'Incredibly stupidly and rashly, I thought I would just put these to one side. They (police) wouldn't take it away and I wouldn't lose my material.' Brooks told the court that his wife 'went ballistic' when he informed her he had hidden some of his belongings from police. He said: 'I said it (the laptop) had a bit of porn or something like that.' Brooks, wearing a dark suit and light blue shirt, spoke loudly and clearly from the witness box as he described the day of his wife's arrest. The court heard of one text from Rebekah Brooks to her husband in which she asked him to contact News Corp chairman James Murdoch and inform him of her custody status, following her resignation from News International hours earlier. The text from the tabloid editor to her husband on the morning of July 17 read: 'Police going to arrest me to make a PR (public relations) point before the Select Committee appearance.' Evidence: CCTV images allegedly showing Charlie Brooks hiding evidence while wife Rebekah was being questioned by police were shown to the jury in the hacking trial in January . The pair then went from their home in Oxfordshire to London where the former tabloid boss met with lawyers and went to Lewisham police station. Former head of security: Mark Hanna, 50, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice . Charlie Brooks said he spent the rest of the day at the couple's London flat waiting for news of his wife's arrest. He told the court a friend, Chris Palmer, arrived and they drank wine before ordering two pizzas. He said: 'At that point we wanted a bit of blotting paper. We had drunk six bottles of red wine that night. 'I was glued to Sky News. There was precious little information coming out of the police station.' Brooks also described his security team - before being cut short by Judge Mr Justice Saunders - as 'incredibly bored and complete fantasists'. The court heard that Rebekah . Brooks returned to the flat that night, where she described her husband . as 'several sheets to the wind'. Her husband told the court: 'I think she was being quite charitable. 'I was pretty wobbly. It had been a stressful day and I had probably drunk more than was wise.' The . following morning, Brooks said he felt 'pretty rough' and thought about . getting the bags back - which he said he believed were still in the . garage. Brooks . said the garage was secure and he was 'pretty confident' that the cargo . would be there somewhere. He said he then 'went downstairs to help the . search party'. But it had been handed to police. Prosecutor Mr Edis said the Sony laptop was 'useless', having been only used to access four files in 2010, and then not once since. One of those files was an image, named CharlieBrooks.jpg, which was a portrait of the defendant posing with his chin resting on his fist. Brooks said, to ripples of laughter in . the court: 'That is the photo the Telegraph used of me. That's not the . greatest picture in the world, is it?' Shown to the jury: A brown leather satchel handed into police by a building manager after being discovered by a cleaner on July 18 2011. It was found to contain a laptop and porn belonging to Charlie Brooks . Brooks, who said he was 'useless' with technology, said there had been an issue with the machine ever since it 'blew up' when he 'cleaned it with some water'.Mr Edis said the laptop was a 'really useless old machine'. But Brooks said it was useful as it had some 'incredibly important information on it', relating to his novel ideas. 'Some of the best ideas lay dormant for years,' he said. Brooks, 51, and his wife, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, and 50-year-old Hanna, of Buckingham, . Buckinghamshire, deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. All seven defendants deny all charges in the hacking investigation. The trial will continue tomorrow.

"The number of stay-at-home fathers in Britain has reached a record high, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. There are now 229,000 men who stay at home with their children - up from 111,000 in 1993. Meanwhile the number of women at home has fallen in the past year by 45,000 to 2.04million.

Adrienne Burgess, joint chief executive of the Fatherhood Institute, said: 'The number of women who earn as much or more than their partners is increasing, so it makes economic sense in some families for the father to be the primary carer. 'The public increasingly accepts that mothers can be employed and still be good mums - and that fathers can be good fathers without being the primary breadwinner.' Nick Wilson, 45, who has four children, gave up his job as a primary school teacher in Hull. 'We decided one of us should stay at home and as I earned a bit less I decided to leave my job,' he said.

"By . Richard Spillett . and Kieran Corcoran . and Wills Robinson . A pilot killed as he reportedly attempted a mid-air somersault in a light aircraft was named today as a British Airways officer. Andrew Sully, 50, a serving senior first officer with British Airways, died with passenger Simon Chamberlain, 29, when their Yak 52 plane crashed in a field in Crooksmill Green, Essex, on Saturday afternoon. Witnesses described seeing the plane attempt a 'loop the loop' 100ft in the air before it nosedived into the ground shortly before 3pm. Andrew Sully, left, was flying the plane when it crashed, while Simon Chamberlain, right, was his passenger . Fuselage: Wreckage of the crashed Yak 52 was being removed from the airfield near Writtle, Essex . Debris: The plane had taken off from the nearby North Weald airfield before getting into trouble, police said . Two teenage army cadets ran to the burning wreckage in a brave attempt to rescue the two men but were beaten back the flames. Fire crews arrived shortly after and doused the burning aircraft . with foam, but the two men inside were killed . Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray today named the pilot as Mr Sully, from Writtle, Essex, and confirmed the identity of the passenger as Mr. Chamberlain, a father-of-one, who had been at nearby North Weald airfield with his family. Scene: Forensic experts were pictured examining the site of the incident which killed two people . Fire crews at the scene where a Yak 52 aircraft crashed near Chelmsford, Essex this afternoon . As a senior first officer, Mr Sully would be the second pilot on a British Airways flight. When a person becomes a pilot for the company they start off as a first officer and then have the chance of promotion to the rank of senior first officer and then eventually captain. A spokesman for British Airways said: 'Andrew was a highly respected and popular member of our pilot team. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time.' Mr. Chamberlain, who was a regular at the airfield and a flying enthusiast, was not intending to fly that day and only went up after accepting an impromptu invitation from Mr. Sully. His family released a statement saying they loved him 'more than anything in the world'. It read: 'Lizzie, his wife, has lost her best friend and soul mate. His son, Charlie, who will be two years old in August, has lost his father. 'And his parents, Paul and Steph, have lost a loving son. We love him more than anything the world. 'Our hearts also go out to the other person involved in this tragedy. The aircraft's tail can be seen at the crash scene. Fire crews said it was fully alight when they arrived . A team from the Department of Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch are now at the scene . 'We know that you will respect the fact that we now need time to grieve and give us the space to heal.' Alan Crouchman, from the Squadron flight club, based at North Weald airfield, said: 'We are all deeply saddened and shocked at the loss of the two very close friends of ours. 'The thoughts and condolences of everyone at the Airfield go out to their families at this very difficult time.' Tristram Taylor, 27, saw the crash while driving and stopped to call 999. Fire crews, who were called from three nearby fire stations to the crash scene, later covered the wreckage, which will now be examined by investigators .

He . said: 'We saw it dip behind a hedge and usually they come up, we see . stunt planes carrying out moves around here quite a lot, but this time . it didn't. 'We went a bit further down the road and I could then see the tail end of the plane on the ground and a lot of smoke. 'I . got out and ran towards it with a couple of Army cadets that were in . the car behind. They were probably only about 15 or 16 years old.

Another eyewitness Lee Sifford, 42, said: 'I was driving home when I noticed a plane in the sky. 'It went right up in the air like it was doing a stunt then it just turned sharply and nose dived straight down. A couple of seconds later it was on fire in the field.

Then it came down so fast that it couldn’t have turned. I didn’t know if I was dreaming it or not. I just kept thinking ""maybe it wasn’t a real plane"". 'There wasn’t a lot left of it. I could just see the tail of the plane and the rest of it was on fire. I just thought to myself there’s no chance that anyone is coming out of that alive.' Police closed part of the A414, which . runs from Chelmsford to Harlow, in both directions while they dealt with . the incident, but reopened it shortly before 6pm.

'Despite the . best efforts of crews the casualties were sadly pronounced dead at the . scene. Ambulance resources have now been stood down.' Two . men, instructor Simon Hulme, 33, and his student Spencer Bennett, 43, . were killed in a similar accident in 2011 when another Yak 52 crashed . into a lake near Maldon, Essex. Mr Bennett was on a three-day flying course when the plane he was being trained in came down.

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Jason Groves . Britain’s grieving families face the second highest death duties in the world, a new report has revealed. Only Ireland has a higher rate of inheritance tax, with the treasury grabbing, on average, more than 25 per cent from someone with an estate worth £1.8m, according to a report by accountants UHY Hacker Young. Britain has an inheritance tax threshold of £325,000, which may seem fairly high – but an increasing number of people are having the value of their assets diminished as the threshold hasn’t been kept in line with house price rises. Taxing issue: Death duties in Britain are the second-highest in the world . Tax rates by the numbers . Over the next five years the taxman will rake in over £24.3billion from death duties. The average global rate is 7.7 per cent, but it’s just one per cent in Brazil, Russia, India and China, while death duties have been abolished in Australia, Israel and New Zealand. The Tories said they will raise the threshold to £1million at the next election. David Cameron said recently that the threshold should rise to ensure only the rich pay death duties. Without action, the number of families paying the 40 per cent levy will double to one in ten over the next five years. Mr Cameron said the issue was ‘something we’ll have to address in our manifesto’. ‘I believe in people being able to pass money through the generations and pass things on to their children,’ he said. ‘You build a stronger society. Inheritance tax should only really be paid by the rich – it shouldn’t be paid by people who’ve worked hard and saved and who bought a family house.’ Mr Cameron’s statement of intent will cheer many traditional Conservatives. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘It is very encouraging. The Prime Minister is starting to show us what a proper Conservative government would look like. ‘This is becoming a big issue again because rising house prices mean that a lot of people who are not rich are being caught up by a tax that was meant for the very wealthy. ‘It is a natural urge to want to leave something for your children and it is wrong that people of average means who have worked hard all their lives are facing these punitive tax rates.’ Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood gave a more cautious welcome to the announcement, warning that other tax cuts, such as raising the 40p threshold or reducing capital gains tax, might take priority. He said: ‘All tax cuts are good news, but there will be plenty of competition for which will be the best tax cuts.’ Ladislav Hornan, Managing Partner of UHY Hacker Young, said: ‘Big inheritance tax bills can reduce the incentive to keep creating wealth in order to pass it on to your family.  They can also deprive the next generation of capital that traditionally has been key to funding the establishment of new businesses. ‘That is why dynamic developed economies like Australia have scrapped inheritance taxes altogether, and some emerging economies have never imposed them. ‘By contrast in the UK, the Exchequer has become increasingly reliant on the substantial income streams generated by inheritance tax.  It has been seen as a lucrative way to extract tax revenues from a relatively ageing population: retirees frequently have lower levels of taxable income, but substantial assets such as mortgage-free homes. ‘As more and more UK families are caught in the inheritance tax trap, pressure for major reform is growing.’ The Office for Budget Responsibility . warned recently that the proportion of estates hit by death duties was set . to double from almost one in 20 to nearly one in ten during the next . five years. Pledge: Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to raise the inheritance tax threshold from £325,000 to £1m .","Only Ireland has a higher rate of inheritance tax than Britain .
Countries such as Australia and New Zealand have abolished death duties .
The Tories said they will raise the threshold to £1million at the next election ."
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Barely a quarter of Tory voters think David Cameron is in touch with ordinary people, according to a damning poll of public attitudes towards the Prime Minister. Just 28 per cent of voters who backed the Conservatives in 2010 think Mr Cameron understands the lives of normal people. But among all voters the figure falls to just 14 per cent, with the only positive for the PM being 44 per cent of people think he gets up earlier than other party leaders. Just 28 per cent of people who voted Conservative in 2020 thik David Cameron is in touch with normal people, according to a new poll . Prime Minister David Cameron is seen as the least in touch leader, but most likely to get up early . Labour’s poll lead over the Tories has narrowed in recent weeks, with Mr Cameron buoyed by strong economic growth and the positive reaction to the Budget. However attempts to appear to be in tune with working class voters have backfired, most notably with an advert claiming drinking beer and playing bingo is what ‘they’ like to do. The new YouGov/BuzzFeed survey shows how far the Prime Minister has to go to reassure voters that he understands their lives. Among 1,900 people surveyed, just 14 per cent thought Mr Cameron was ‘in touch with normal people’, compared to Ed Miliband on 31 per cent and Ukip leader Nigel Farage on 30 per cent. Even Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg out-polled Mr Cameron on 16 per cent. Among all voters only 14 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is in touch, less than half those who say the same of Labour's Ed Miliband and Ukip's Nigel Farage . Most voters think Mr Cameron gets up earliest, but back Mr Farage in a fight . Among people who voted for the Conservatives at the last general election, only 28 per cent said Mr Cameron is in touch, falling to 9 per cent among 2010 Lib Dem voters and 7 per cent with people who voted Labour last time round. Mr Farage fares much better with his own party. Despite being a privately-educated former stockbroker, 77 per cent of people who plan to back Ukip say he is in touch. The Tories have been gripped by the threat posed by Ukip, promising an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union and tougher measures to tackle immigration. This week Mr Farage and Mr Clegg will go head-to-head in their second live TV debate on Europe. Fight! The poll also asked voters who would win a fight, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) expected to triumph over Lib Dem Nick Clegg (left) and Labour's Ed Miliband (centre) The latest YouGov poll for the Sunday Times puts Labour 7 points ahead of the Tories . A snap poll after their first confrontation last week found that 57 per cent thought the Ukip leader had performed better, with 36 per cent backing the Deputy Prime Minister. During the debate Mr Farage defended employing his wife using public money, insisting: ‘I very much doubt that anybody else in British politics has worked the hours and had so little fun as me over the course of the last few years.’ But voters actually think he is most likely to have a lie-in. Just 4 per cent of people think he is the party leader who gets up earliest in the day, compared to 44 per cent for Mr Cameron, 12 per cent for Mr Miliband and 6 per cent for Mr Clegg. However, 25 per cent of voters think Mr Farage would win a fight between the party leaders. Mr Cameron can also take comfort from the fact he is the party leaders most voters would like to sit next to on a long journey (26 per cent), is most likely to have a greatest legacy (34 per cent) and likely to leave the biggest tip (24 per cent).","Tory leader David Cameron under pressure to show he is tune with voters .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Tragic: 'Fit and healthy' Kelly Tarpey, 36, was found dead just seven weeks after the death of her father John Thompson . A 'fit and healthy' bride died in her sleep aged just 36 after being left devastated by the sudden death of her father, an inquest has heard. Supermarket assistant Kelly Tarpey was found dead in bed by her husband John when he went to wake her up for work. In the run up to her death, Mrs Tarpey had suffered two mysterious seizures - but had urged her husband to keep them a secret so as not to worry her grieving family. Just seven weeks earlier her father John Thompson, 65, had died suddenly from a heart attack just two years after he gave Kelly away at her wedding to Mr Tarpey. Mrs Tarpey, the youngest of three girls, had been in good health prior to the fits and would regularly go walking with her 44-year old husband and their pet dogs. An inquest in Manchester was unable to establish how the active 36-year-old died. After the hearing Mrs Tarpey's mother Mary Thompson, 63, said she hoped her daughter was now at peace with her father John. She said: 'Without a doubt the two of them are now together. She died seven weeks to the day after him. 'We had always said she was in charge of looking after his grave and she took it to heart. You couldn’t get her away from there. 'I had been staying with my other daughters following John’s death. It was my first night home and when I got the news Kelly had died. 'It was absolutely devastating news. Kelly had such an active life, walking, there was never a question of anything being wrong.' Mrs Tarpey and her husband John, a window cleaner, married in August 2010 at the Inn on the Lake pub in Ullswater in the Lake District. Mr Thompson was a proud father of the bride and gave a touching speech about his youngest daughter and her new husband. But in November 2012, Mr Thompson died suddenly of a heart attack, leaving the family heartbroken. His daughter passed away seven weeks later on January 2, 2013. Close: An inquest in Manchester heard Mrs Kelly Tarpey, pictured with her father John Thompson on her wedding day in 2010, was left devastated by his death from a heart attack at 65 . Mrs Tarpey's sister Yvonne Thornley, 44, said: 'My dad’s death was very sudden. He and Kelly were close as she was always the baby. 'My dad gave Kelly away on her wedding day and walked her down the aisle. It was a beautiful lovely day at Ullswater. 'He did the usual father of the bride speech and was very proud that his youngest of his daughters was getting married. He was a joker and he always said he must have done something right because all of his daughters were happily married with lovely husbands. 'It is quite unbelievable and surreal what happened as they were both so fit and well. We had just spent the first Christmas without dad and mum had gone home on the 2nd January and then Kelly died. It’s devastating.' Mr Tarpey, 44, from Blackley, Manchester, told the inquest that he and his wife, who were together 19 years, enjoyed an active life holidaying around England and walking in the Lakes. He told the hearing he had first become concerned about his wife when she had a fit in November 2012. Unexplained: Mrs Tarpey, pictured from left to right with her mother Mary, husband John and father John, had two mysterious fits in the weeks leading up to her death . It lasted around 20 minutes and an ambulance had to be called but despite having tests at hospital, nothing was found and she was sent home with Vitamin D tablets. But she had another fit in bed the following December. Mr Tarpey added: 'It lasted three or four minutes but she would not go back to the doctors and wouldn’t let me tell anyone especially her mother. Kelly had only just lost her father seven weeks before.' On the evening before she was found, Kelly had decided to stay in the spare bedroom as she wanted to stay up later than  her husband. Mr Tarpey said: 'I went to bed around 11pm. Kelly stayed up, she was fine and her usual self she was watching a television programme she had recorded earlier. 'I’m not sure what time she went to bed. Kelly was sleeping in a different room that night because she wanted to read, that wasn’t unusual. I have since found out that she was on Facebook. 'That morning I got up at 6:30am and looked in on Kelly, she was in bed lying on her left side. I didn’t go in because she started work later than I did. Mystery: An inquest in Manchester was unable to establish why Mrs Tarpey, pictured with her husband John and father John, died but a pathologist said she may have developed heart problems . 'At 7:30am I went in, she was lying as before with top part of her back showing. It looked mottled. I tried to wake her. I couldn’t get a response, I turned her onto her back and she felt cold and stiff. Her lips were blue. 'Kelly was my soulmate, we would do everything together. We used to enjoy holidaying around England, boating around England. We got married in the Lake District and then spent our honeymoon there. 'We met when she was 19. She was as fit as a fiddle, she always had a smile on her face and was very well loved.' Pathologist Dr Stephen McGrath told the inquest he hadn’t been able to ascertain a cause of death and said it was 'probably' natural causes. He said: 'It was a very challenging case. I probably do between 80 and up to 130 post-mortems a year and there is a very small number where we can’t detect why a person died.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Energy companies have admitted giving dire service and baffling customers with confusing bills designed to hide the true cost of heating and lighting out homes. Energy bosses say customers have been ‘taken for granted’ and treated badly, with charges that were ‘never transparent’. The astonishing admissions, delivered anonymously to pollsters for a new report this week, sparked warnings from Downing Street that increased competition to take on the Big Six energy firms was needed to improve customer service. Energy bosses say customers have been 'taken for granted' and treated badly, with charges that were 'never transparent' Industry watchdog Ofgem last week announced it was referring the entire energy market to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for investigation. It found ‘possible tacit co-ordination’ on prices, with the Big Six firms - British Gas, SSE, Eon, Npower, Scottish Power and EDF - apparently moving tariffs up and down at the same time. Specifically, there is new evidence that they are quick to raise prices when costs rise but slow to reduce them. Now it has emerged that behind closed doors the bosses of some of the country’s biggest energy suppliers acknowledge they have been treating their customers badly. They spoke to pollster YouGov for a report to be published at a conference this week entitled Energy, Politics and the Consumer. According to The Times, the remarks reveal a disregard for the customer and admit public anger at their treatment has fuelled Ed Miliband’s radical plan to impose a two-year freeze if Labour wins the 2015 election. The combined annual profits from the Big Six companies . Bosses from firms including SSE, E.ON UK and RWE npower took part in the survey, along with senior figures from smaller companies. Leading energy figures told YouGov interviewers: ‘Customers were taken for granted, service was poor, and no one bothered to explain the situation to them’ The report adds: ‘The industry broadly accepts it helped to create the political opportunity that Miliband seized. ‘As one would expect, there is moaning at politicians: practitioners believe that behind closed doors the politicians understand and even admit that a price freeze would be disruptive and unrealistic, and it’s been mere opportunism to invent an ogre that they can then pretend to slay.’ But it adds: ‘The industry also accepts that it has itself “prepared the ground” for what happened: billing was often confusing, never transparent, and complaints were handled badly.’ Downing Street said the problems could only be tackled if the power of the Big Six was broken up through more competition in the market. David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'There is not enough competition in this area. Competition is at the heart of the way we improve service across the board be it in terms of cost pressures, in the wider customer service, we want more competition.' The Prime Minister 'wants cost pressures coming down for all families,' the spokesman added. Soaring: This graph shows how average energy bills have risen over the past few years . Richard Lloyd, the executive director . of Which?, said: ‘It would be deeply worrying if energy industry leaders . didn’t recognise the dire state of distrust they face. ‘Our . latest consumer survey shows satisfaction in this market has plummeted . to a new low and only one in five consumers trusts suppliers to act in . their best interest. That is why it is right to refer the energy market . to a full-scale competition investigation — but suppliers should not . wait to be forced into action and should start now to put customers . first, keep costs as low as possible and trade transparently.’ Static: Fewer people switch energy suppliers after apparently giving up hope of getting a better deal . Labour’s shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex said: ‘These comments vindicate everything Labour has been saying for the last two years on the dysfunctional nature of the energy market. ‘It is unsurprising that people don't trust the industry and won't until the market is clear fair and transparent.’ ‘The only way to restore trust is to reset the energy market by freezing prices until 2017 and reforming the market to make it more transparent and competitive, as Labour has proposed.’ According to YouGov opinion polls, energy firms are less trusted than bankers. More than two-thirds of people – 67 per cent – say the energy industry operates as a cartel while 51 per cent say rising bills has forced them to turn their heating down or off in the last year. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said: 'The findings released last week by Ofgem and Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) demonstrate the need to rebuild trust and confidence in the energy market. 'Ofgem announced last week tough action based on a detailed, independent expert assessment of the state of competition in Britain’s energy markets - leading to the first ever market reference for the energy markets. 'This is just too important for people to rely on guesses about how to fix the energy markets. If we get it wrong, consumers will pay the price. 'We will give Ofgem and the CMA whatever support they need to get this done as quickly as possible. 'In the meantime, we’ll keep working to help people pay less for the energy they use - continuing to drive the competition that has seen people switching supplier in record numbers, simpler tariffs and bills, getting energy companies to give back direct debit balances, taking £50 off the average bill and making switching faster and easier than it's ever been.'","Speaking anonymously, energy bosses admit to giving poor service .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Council chiefs have come under fire for spending £2,000 of taxpayers’ money on a new lamppost that leaves the pavement below in darkness - because it's been erected behind a conifer tree. Not one beam of light can escape from the 20ft-high lamppost, which has left baffled pedestrians completely in the dark. It was installed by Birmingham City Council highways contractor Amey as part of its upgrade of the city’s 95,000 street lamps. Dim installation: A woman looks up at the new lamppost on Eastern Road in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, that was recently installed, but disappears behind a conifer bush . Plan: Council contractor Amey are now contacting the homeowner who owns the trees to discuss trimming the foliage back . The council, the largest local authority in Europe, paid Amey around £2,000 to install the new lamppost which is part of a major upgrade project. Old fashioned and costly fluorescent lights are being replaced with energy-efficient LED models. Birmingham City Councillor Rob Pocock, who represents the Sutton Vesey ward, expressed his anger at the lamppost, which was erected on Eastern Road in Boldmere, last week. Expense: Birmingham City Council paid Amey around £2,000 to install the new lamppost, which is part of a major upgrade project . He fumed: ‘It’s a real shame, as most of the street lights have made a big improvement to the area. ‘I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw what the contractors had done. It must have taken a super-human effort to get it so well hidden inside those trees. ‘Not one luminous ray can escape to light up the highway, it’s so perfectly concealed. Not so bright: Light from the lamppost doesn't reach the ground . ‘The contractor should have ensured the foliage was removed first. ‘This sort of thing gets the contractors and the council a bad name. People have good reason to question the plain common sense of a public service that can do things like this without a word of explanation to the residents, who are the ones being left in the dark.’ Resident Joan Callum, 54, who lives on the road, said: ‘It beggars belief that the contractors didn’t use even a tiny piece of common sense when they put up the lamppost. ‘It’s an obvious thing to say but whoever thought it was a good idea to put a lamppost behind a tree clearly isn’t very bright themselves. ‘The old lamppost protruded out from the trees so despite the conifers being quite thick the light still reached the pavement. This new lamppost is utterly pointless.’ Amey are now contacting the homeowner who owns the trees to discuss trimming the foliage back. Amey’s highways network manager Eddie Fellows said: 'All our highways work is carried out to agreed timescales and designed in line with national standards. This includes the position of street lighting columns. We are aware of the obstruction caused by the overgrown tree and we are working closely with the property owner to ensure this is removed.' This is not the first time Amey has encountered protests while installing lampposts. In 2012, residents in Selly Park Avenue Conservation Area successfully got lamps upgraded to heritage-style design and relocated at alleyway entrances to maximise security. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council refused to comment.","Birmingham residents left in the dark after blunder by contractor Amey .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A brewery has told its pub landlords they should limit drinkers to just one-and-a-half pints a night, and that they should keep a calculator to hand to help them count that far. Bedford-based brewer Charles Wells has . warned tenants that customers should not drink more than the Government . guideline of three to four alcohol units a day. And the company sent out 'Drinkaware' leaflet . telling bar staff to 'grab a calculator' and . work out when people have reached the limit. Drink aware: Bedford-based brewer Charles Wells sent a leaflet to publicans advising them that drinkers should be limited to three to four alcohol units a day - meaning they should not drink more than one-and-a-half pints of flagship beer Bombardier, advertised by Rik Mayall . A Charles Wells leaflet describing how many units are in some of their products in comparison to the number of units consumers should not regularly exceed . The leaflet also spells out that . Bombardier - Wells' flagship beer, which is advertised by comedian Rik . Mayall - contains 2.7 units a pint while strong Erdinger lager contains . three. This means that a pint and half of either brand would push a drinker over the recommended daily level. Publicans at some of the brewer's 200 pubs have said they will not follow the new guidelines. 'It's absolutely crazy,' said one publican, who runs a pub in Bedfordshire but does not wish to be named for fear of suffering repercussions from the brewery. 'If I followed their recommendations and limited people to just one pint, I'd soon lose all my customers. 'Takings would slump and the pub would go bust within a month.' The Wells leaflet is headed: 'Help your customers be Drinkaware'. The leaflet also suggests drinkers 'grab a calculator' to work out how many units they are drinking . Limit: According to the guidelines - originally issued by the Royal College of Physicians in 1987 - women should not exceed more than two or three units per day, equivalent to around one standard glass of red wine . It goes on to say: 'As a responsible alcohol retailer, you'll want to make sure you can offer help and advice to your customers so they can make an informed decision as to what they should or shouldn't drink to stay within the recommended daily guidelines. 'There's vast amount of information and material to call upon, but we thought it would be helpful to have a reference sheet.' According to DrinkAware, women should not regularly exceed 2-3 units per day and men 3-4. The number of units in alcohol, according to NHS Choices is as follows - . 1 alcopop (275ml 4% ABV)  - 1.1 units . 1 pint ale (568ml 4% ABV) - 2.3 units . 1 pint low-strength lager(568ml ABV 3.6%) - 2 units . 1 small glass of wine (any variety)(125ml 12% ABV) - 1.5 units . 1 standard glass of wine (any variety) (175ml 12% ABV) - 2.1 units . 1 large glass of wine (any variety)250ml 12% ABV) - 3 units . Single shot of Gin, rum, vodka, whisky, tequila, sambuca(25ml 40% ABV) - 1 unit . The leaflet spells out that one alcohol unit is equivalent to half a standard glass of red wine, a single measure of whisky or a third of a pint of beer. According to the guidelines - originally issued by the Royal College of Physicians in 1987 - women should not exceed more than two or three units per day, while men should limit themselves to four. The brewery leaflet adds: 'To work out the units for any particular drink, grab a calculator and use this sum: Strength (ABC) x Volume (ml) divided by 1,000 = Number of units.' The publican said: 'What nonsense. As if on a busy Friday or Saturday night, I've got the time to grab a ruddy calculator and do some complicated sums before I serve anybody a drink. 'I'm seething about this. It's political correctness and health and safety gone absolutely berserk.' A Charles Wells spokesman said: 'We have signed up to the Department of Health's Public Health Responsibility Deal and pledged to provide licensees with simple and consistent information to raise awareness of the unit content of alcoholic drinks and the national drinking guidelines. 'The leaflet we produced was designed to amalgamate information about the Government's recommended daily allowance for alcohol consumption, how units are calculated and the units per pint in each of our beers into a helpful reference sheet for our licensees and their staff to advise customers appropriately so they can make an informed decision.'","Brewer Charles Wells warns landlords that customers should not drink more than three to four alcohol units a day .

"By . Rachel Billington . Shocking news: That enchanting friend of the British gardener, the robin, is disappearing and an insalubrious monster, the pigeon, is taking over. If you do not believe me, just look at the figures from last week’s RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch survey. In the past 35 years, sightings of pigeons in our gardens has increased sevenfold, or a horrible 743 per cent, while robins have reduced their cheeky, inquisitive appearances by 45 per cent. Disgusting: In the past 35 years, sightings of pigeons in our gardens has increased sevenfold, or a horrible 743¿per cent . I suppose there’s someone who welcomes a pigeon into their garden. Probably the same person who feeds them in Trafalgar Square before retiring out of range. But the truth is, pigeons are stupid, irritating, destructive and ugly. The ugly part is worth pursuing because, objectively, they should be rather handsome — imagine one stuffed and put into a glass case, with its tightly packed blueish-grey feathers, its smart white collar and pink-tinged waistcoat. In life, however, they somehow end up being quite hideous. Words like brutish come to mind — their lumbering walk, their heaving take-off into flight, their bullying of smaller  feathered friends on the bird table, their uncouth approach to building nests, their coarse cooing which can only appeal if heard from faraway woods on a good-tempered evening. A faraway wood is just the place for them, but they think they should be in the garden. I concede this does show a certain amount of intelligence — they like seeds and young greens, which, in one form or another, are found in gardens, so they opt for the easy life. But in doing so they drive us gardeners mad. How often does the conscientious, hard-working, home-owner in his veg patch find his spring plantings descended on by large fat birds unafraid of scarecrows or even waving arms! I no longer have a vegetable garden. My pigeon problem is closer to home. Decline: Robins have reduced their cheeky, inquisitive appearances by 45¿per cent . The stone walls of my house in Dorset are decorated with many different climbers. There is a wisteria, now more than 100 years old, growing along half the south-facing front of my house, which gradually gives way to a 40-year-old vine. On another side there is a Banksia rose and jasmine. Elsewhere there are climbing hydrangeas and cotoneasters, which all add to the beauty of the golden stone. The only trouble is that pigeons firmly believe that these climbers are there to provide support for nests. Their approach to architecture is to throw random twigs at a couple of branches, and hope they turn into something to hold their eggs — and their lumpy, ungainly selves. At least this scatter-shot approach gives warning of their arrival. I keep a stick handy to poke out the nests before they become cosy. Sometimes, if I have been away for a week or two, it may become a close-run thing between my stick and the arrival of the pigeon’s eggs. My conscience has allowed me to evict eggs, but never chicks. Last year, the pigeons were on the winning side in this  eternal battle. Now I know why. According to the RSPB, there are 5,400,000 breeding pairs of wood pigeons in the UK. Worse still for us pigeon non-fanciers, they are quite capable of having several families, with two or three eggs per nest, in the course of the year, particularly when the weather is mild. Problem: According to the RSPB, there are 5,400,000 breeding pairs of wood pigeons in the UK . I do not assert that the pigeons are intrinsically bad. They do not stick their eggs in other birds’ nests like the cuckoo. Nor do they behave like the top bird varlet, the jackdaw, which takes a malevolent pleasure in stuffing chimneys or any unsuitable cracks it can find with a massive cascade  of twigs. But those birds have not risen to fifth place on the RSPB list. How long will it be before pigeons knock the blue tit off its perch at Number 1? I didn’t always dislike them. In my childhood, I used to go out in the field and woods with my brothers who were shooting pigeons, and felt quite sad when they downed one. I was fond, too, of reading stories about brave carrier pigeons that were such heroes in both World Wars. Even this year I was moved by the story of a World War I pigeon named Cher Ami that delivered his message despite being gravely wounded. He was patched up and given a wooden leg, but died a year later — when it was discovered he was actually a hen, so should have been called Chere Amie. I also understand that many people like pigeons — and not just on their dinner plate. My husband grew up in the North of England where there were always men breeding racing pigeons alongside their  allotments, and the racing business is still thriving. Growth: They are quite capable of having several families, with two or three eggs per nest, in the course of the year, particularly when the weather is mild . The Queen has some of the most impressive racing birds in the country at her loft in Sandringham, and there is a multitude of internet sites offering well-bred racers for sale. It strikes me that this may be a clue to the problem of the pigeons in our gardens: they are under-employed, under-exercised, used to loafing around and getting what they want without having to make much effort. They should be bravely fighting for their existence, roosting in high trees far from predators — if only there were some — or, even more commendable, saving men’s lives in wars, or entertaining fans with their swift flight. Instead they are spoilt, over-weight and greedy, barging their way onto bird tables and gobbling up everything in sight. Even if you hang a pigeon-proof bird feeder from a bough, they still cause chaos, stomping about beneath it for any pickings and trampling everything underfoot — a disaster if that feeder happens to hang over a flower bed. Moreover, they regularly steal my morello cherries before I can turn them into jam (I know I could use a net, but they always beat me to it). Flying high: The Spotted Woodpecker has risen in the RSPB list of birds which are thriving in British gardens . In the summer I only have to take a deckchair and sit under a tree in a quiet corner of the garden for a pigeon or two to arrive over my head, clattering and banging among the leaves before embarking on a frantic cooing routine, which sounds more like a pneumatic drill. The saddest thing about this rant is that I really do love birds. I would be prepared to love pigeons if there weren’t so many of them and they didn’t invade my garden. I even planted a little wood to invite in birds and was thrilled to see in the RSPB list that the Great Spotted Woodpecker has moved up in the ranks. I suppose if there were hundreds of them tapping at every tree I might begin to be less keen on them. I am sorry that the sparrow and the song thrush are decreasing in numbers. I am happy to say that in my garden there is no shortage of robins and it’s quite common to  see two of them fighting over territory on my wall. My week is made if I hear an early cuckoo as I did last year, and I easily forgive its wickedly irresponsible behaviour. So my pigeon problem is essentially about numbers and habitat. The only place I am able to admire pigeons nowadays is in Chinese paintings whose artists somehow manage to turn their annoying plumpness into stateliness. They are often paired with peonies or flowering cherry trees, which they inhabit with a proprietorial air, little round eyes gleaming complacently. I think I could just about hang one of these. But in the end I have to agree with that discerning writer Gertrude Stein who penned the one line that succinctly sums up my attitude to pigeons in the garden: ‘Pigeons on the grass, alas.’","Sightings of pigeons in gardens has increased by 743 per cent in 35 years .

"By . Laura Clark . Plans: Douglas Alexander, the party's election co-ordinator, said the current system was 'simply not working' Labour will pledge in its next manifesto to scrap £9,000-a-year tuition fees and introduce a new system with lower charges. Douglas Alexander, the party’s election co-ordinator, said the current system was ‘simply not working’ and would be axed under a Labour government. Party leader Ed Miliband unveiled plans to cut student fees to £6,000-a-year in his speech to the 2011 party conference but stopped short of making it a manifesto pledge. Now Mr Alexander, also the shadow foreign secretary, has disclosed that tuition fees policy will be ‘addressed’ in the party’s next manifesto. Plans being considered would reduce the maximum fee to £6,000-a-year through taxes on banks and the wealthiest graduates paying a higher interest rate on their student loans. A more radical proposal put forward by John Denham, a universities minister in the last government, would reduce fees further, to £4,000-a-year. A third option would involve scrapping tuition fees altogether and replacing them with a graduate tax. The Tories claimed that cutting fees would leave Labour with a huge university funding ‘black hole’. Labour’s plans emerged amid a growing row over the cost to the public purse of the system of £9,000-a-year fees and loans introduced by the Coalition in 2012. Ministers originally believed that only 28 per cent of student loans would never be repaid but new calculations put the figure at 45 per cent. Experts say that when the figure reaches 48 per cent, the new system will cost taxpayers more than the one it replaced. Questioned about tuition fees on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Alexander said: ‘This seems to be another Con/Dem policy that simply is not working. The rate of default emerged this week and it’s very high. ‘Ed Miliband has gone on the record in . the past in saying this is a policy that we are looking at. I expect it . is a policy that we will address in our manifesto and I hope that we are . able to offer a better solution to the students of this country and to . the finances of this country than that which we have seen from the . Conservatives.’ Plans: Ed Miliband outlined proposals to scrap the current system during the Labour party conference in 2011 while higher education spokesman Liam Byrne has also backed reform . Asked if Labour could simply get rid of the fees, he said: ‘We are dealing with this as part of our policy review process, I expect it’s an issue we will address in our manifesto but it’s very clear that even on the Government’s own evidence this is not a policy that’s working.’ Defence: Universities Minister David Willetts said: 'A graduate repayment system is the only sustainable way of financing higher education' One plan expected to put forward by Mr Denham this week would see students given an ‘entitlement’ of £15,000 they could take to any university - or £5,000-a-year for a typical three-year degree. Universities would be able to charge more - up to around £4,000-a-year - if the costs of teaching exceeded the value of the entitlement. Meanwhile Liam Byrne, Labour’s higher education spokesman, has revealed the party is considering reform in two stages - first a cut to fees and then a graduate tax. ‘What we’ll have to do in our manifesto is take our starting point of £6k fees, explain how we see the situation for 2015 to 2020, and how we’ll see a long-term shift to a graduate tax,’ he said in a recent interview. Defending the current system, Universities Minister David Willetts said: ‘A graduate repayment system is the only sustainable way of financing higher education. ‘The question for Labour is that if they want to cut fees by £3,000 they will have a black hole of £3billion.’ The Conservatives are reportedly considering a range of measures to reduce the student loans bill including stripping some lower-ranked universities of their right to charge tuition fees if drop-out rates from courses are too high or graduates struggle to find graduate-level jobs. But elite universities would be able to raise fees above £9,000-a-year if they could show that their courses led to high-earning jobs which would allow student loans to be paid back in full. A further proposal reportedly being considered by the Treasury would involve imposing a minimum qualification for students to go to university, reducing the numbers in the system.","Labour leader unveiled to cut fees to £6,000-a-year in 2011 .

"By . Jason Groves . Recycling targets blamed for the death of the weekly bin round are being routinely ignored across Europe, a major study shows. While Britain is on course to meet the controversial goal of recycling half of all household waste by 2020, many other countries are barely out of the starting blocks. Successive governments have placed restrictions on household waste in a bid to meet European Union targets originally imposed more than 20 years ago, which say countries should recycle half of their rubbish by 2020. These are widely blamed for the scrapping of weekly bin rounds for millions of families. Yet other countries appear to have simply ignored the targets and are still dumping almost all of their waste in landfill sites. Romania, for example, does so for 99 per cent of its rubbish compared to just over a third in the UK. The new study by the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat shows that the UK’s efforts have been effective, raising recycling rates to 46 per cent. 'They're the same bunch he gave me last year' This is above the European average and is a huge increase from the 10 per cent recorded at the turn of the century. But the report also reveals that recycling remains a novelty in many parts of Europe. Romania is the worst offender, recycling just one per cent of its household waste.Croatia, the EU’s newest member, recycles just 16 per cent of its waste, sending the rest to landfill. But slow progress is not confined to Eastern Europe. Malta recycles just 13 per cent, while Greece achieves only 18 per cent. Even France lags way behind the UK, recycling 39 per cent of its waste. The figures will raise fresh concerns that the UK has been too quick to embrace inconvenient EU measures that other European nations appear to be able to ignore with impunity. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘We, as a self-governing country, should be free to decide how much we recycle and in what way. The figures from elsewhere in Europe are also instructive about how we deal with these things. ‘Every time we sign up to new regulations we create a rod for our own back because we have an army of officials to enforce them to the last comma.’ The European Commission defended the targets, saying increased recycling ‘protects the environment and human health and creates jobs and growth’. Recycling policy is governed by a number of EU directives dating back more than 20 years. The most important is the Waste Framework Directive which states countries must recycle a minimum of 50 per cent of household waste by 2020. Refuse: The targets are widely blamed for the scrapping of weekly bin rounds for millions of families . A Commission spokesman said the UK’s record was ‘about average’ compared to other long-standing EU members. He insisted that the worst offenders could even be fined if they did not up their game. But Taxpayers’ Alliance director John O’Connell said: ‘Arbitrary targets become even more useless when no-one else holds up their end of the bargain.’","While Britain toes the line, many other countries simply use landfills .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Scotland is in danger of sleepwalking into a split from Britain  unless the pro-UK campaign shows more ‘hunger’, a Cabinet minister has warned. Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish Secretary, cautioned that the Yes campaign was gaining momentum and could win the 18 September referendum. His warning came after a weekend when the No camp was thrown into self-inflicted turmoil on the key issue of whether an independent Scotland could keep the Pound. More hunger: Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem Scottish Secretary, warned that pro-UK campaigners could lose because they are less passionate than the nationalists . Polls . have also narrowed in recent days, with the nationalists whittling the . pro-union Better Together campaign’s lead down to just five points. Mr . Carmichael, a Lib Dem, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics that the Yes . campaign ‘have got an unprecedented war chest to pour into this . campaign’. He said: ‘We’ve got to realise what is coming and as a . consequence we’ve got to get our arguments in place and our campaign as . sharp as theirs.’ The . Better Together campaign suffered a blow after an unnamed senior . minister was quoted in the  Press as saying that an independent Scotland . could be allowed to keep the Pound if it agreed not to remove the . Trident nuclear deterrent from its base in Faslane. There was speculation that the minister was Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary. Much . of the No campaign’s argument for why Scotland should stay in the UK . has been built around it not being allowed to keep Sterling if it opts . to go it alone. Scottish . First Minister Alex Salmond seized on the admission, saying: ‘All this . bluff and bluster about not sharing Sterling is a campaign tactic, a . negotiating position, something to scare the natives up in Scotland.’ He . ruled out any deal that would let the UK keep nuclear weapons in . Scotland in exchange for a currency union. Mr Carmichael said that well-funded independence campaign could spend its way to victory, and had an advantage because its supporters are 'defined' by the issue. More support: Mr Carmichael said more figures from the Labour party should rally around Better Together leader Alistair Darling (left), who are the official opposition to the nationalists, led by Alex Salmond (right) Speaking to the Obserever. he said: 'We're never going to match them for the . spend, but in terms of the hunger I think we have to match them for . just how badly we want this.' He said that though he was not 'expecting to lose', a victory for the nationalists was 'not impossible'. 'For . nationalists this is the issue that defines them, whereas for a Labour . supporter, a Liberal or a Conservative, this can be an issue you care . about but is not one that defines you. 'So that is where we need to work harder at motivating our people in a way that their people come ready motivated. 'You . have in Alistair Darling a first-rate campaign head, but I would want . to hear and would expect to hear a wider range of Labour voices coming . into the debate as it gets closer to polling day.' A Government minister has allegedly said Scotland could keep the pound after all in exchange for housing the UK's nuclear arsenal. The unnamed minister, quoted by the Guardian, said 'of course' there would be a deal struck over the pound if Scotland votes for independence, hinting that it could be used as a bargaining chip in a deal to continue housing nuclear submarines in the Firth of Clyde. He said: 'There would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a Yes vote with many moving pieces. The UK wants to keep Trident nuclear weapons at Faslane and the Scottish Government wants a currency union - you can see the outlines of a deal.' However, both the SNP and the Westminster Government has denied such a deal could take place. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said negotiations on the pound would not include the Trident nuclear deterrent, to which he said the SNP was 'unambiguously opposed'. He said: 'Our opposition to nuclear weapons is not a campaign tactic or a negotiating position. 'Of course there will be negotiations around the currency zone but they won't concern nuclear weapons, they will be about debt levels.' Chancellor George Osborne and Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander also denied that a deal over the pound was possible. In a joint statement they said: 'The Scottish Government are proposing to divorce the rest of the UK but want to keep the joint bank account and credit card. 'The UK would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country and its banks. Parliament wouldn't pass it, and the people wouldn't accept it.

"By . Neil Sears . A Tory MP has resigned from a key post over claims that he asked a Brazilian rent boy to supply him with drugs. Rising star Mark Menzies, 42, left his role as a minister’s aide shortly after being asked about his relationship with 19-year-old Rogerio dos Santos Pinto – who told reporters that the MP had been paying him for sex. The Brazilian said they met on a gay escort website and claimed the politician had given him a tour of the Houses of Parliament before allegedly offering to pay him £250 for a two-hour session. Accusations: Rogerio Santos, pictured, claims that he was paid for sex by Mark Menzies and was also asked for drugs . Resigned: Mark Menzies, pictured in his constituency, quit his job as a ministerial aide . And he insisted that Mr Menzies, who has been involved in debates about the Government’s drug policy, asked him to supply him with methedrone – nicknamed ‘poor man’s cocaine’. Possession of the Class B drug became a criminal offence in 2010 and if a complaint is made to police then it could result in charges. Mr Menzies resigned from his post as aide to International Development Minister Alan Duncan on Saturday night after Santos, who has now returned to Sao Paulo in Brazil, got in touch with the Press. He claimed: ‘I have been having sex with a Conservative MP for money. Mark also asked me to buy methedrone. I have messages of him talking to me about drugs. ‘We met very regularly over the last 18 months. He took me to the Houses of Parliament. Recently, he has been asking me to buy drugs. I have SMS messages and photographic evidence.’ Mr Menzies worked for Alan Duncan, pictured . He added that he was in Britain illegally after overstaying a student visa, although it is understood that Mr Menzies was unaware of the rent boy’s immigration status. Santos is also reported to have a photograph of Mr Menzies next to a plate of mystery white powder. Discussing the picture Santos said: ‘There is a plate of methedrone. 'He asked me if I could buy methedrone. He had many drugs, a lot of drugs.’ He also claimed that he had received a text from Mr Menzies in which the MP asked ‘What underwear you have?’, and another in which he told the rent boy to meet him in south London and ‘Bring sexy underwear’. Mr Menzies has yet to discuss the claims in detail but said in a statement on Saturday: ‘I have decided to resign as a Parliamentary Private Secretary after a series of allegations were made against me. 'A number of these allegations are not true and I look forward to setting the record straight in due course.’ Last night spokesmen for the Prime Minister and Conservative central office refused to comment. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that no formal allegations had been made against the MP.","Rogerio Santos said Mark Menzies paid for sex and asked him for drugs .

"By . Jason Groves . Philip Hammond has said critics of his defence cuts, including outgoing deputy supreme commander of Nato Sir Richard Shirreff, are 'talking nonsense' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond yesterday accused top generals of talking ‘nonsense’, following a fresh warning that spending cuts are weakening the Armed Forces. In an interview yesterday General Sir Richard Shirreff warned that ministers were taking ‘one hell of a risk’ by replacing thousands of regular troops with part-time reservists. Sir Richard, outgoing deputy supreme commander of Nato, said a series of cuts had left the Armed Forces ‘hollowed out’. He said the Royal Navy had been ‘cut to the bone’, leaving it unable to take part in some Nato operations. His intervention is the latest in a series of warnings from senior military figures, both in this country and abroad. Mr Hammond insisted that the criticism was unfounded, pointing out that Britain still had the fourth largest defence budget in the world. He also revealed that British forces will be deployed on Nato war games in the Baltic states to help ward off the threat posed by Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. ‘Nobody should be in any doubt of our resolve to live up to our commitments under the Nato treaty,’ he said. Asked if he was listening to the concerns of Sir Richard and others he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘Of course I’m listening, and much of what I’m hearing is nonsense.’ Mr Hammond said Britain remained a ‘credible, capable and reliable’ ally to the US, despite a recent warning from former US defence secretary Robert Gates that defence cuts meant we could no longer be considered a ‘full partner’. ‘Of course we have had to make savings, of course we have had to take some very tough decisions,’ he said. Mr Hammond acknowledged concerns about cuts to the Navy, which have left Britain without an operational aircraft carrier until 2020. He said the Navy would ‘like to have more assets’, but insisted it was still taking part in regular Nato operations. Sir Richard’s criticisms are the most outspoken yet by a serving senior military figure. Although he stepped down from his Nato role at the end of last week he will remain the Army’s third most senior officer until he retires in August. The Government plans to slash regular troop numbers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 and replace lost numbers with up to 35,000 reservists . In an interview with The Sunday Times he raised concerns about the Government’s controversial plan to slash regular troop numbers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020. The so-called Army 2020 initiative involves trying to replace the lost capability by recruiting a 35,000-strong force of reservists. Over the same period, the Royal Navy and the RAF are each preparing to lose 5,000 regulars and gain 500 reservists. Sir Richard said it was still unclear whether the plan ‘is going to work or not’ and added that recruiting reservists on such a scale would require ‘a complete shift in culture’ among commanders. ‘It’s certainly a hell of a risk,’ he said. ‘The point at which a risk becomes a gamble is a subjective view. I think the jury is still out.’ But he reserved his biggest concerns for cuts to the Navy. ‘A hollowed-out navy means you can’t project power,’ he said. ‘I’ve heard this said in the Ministry of Defence, “The yardstick by which we measure ourselves is our ability to punch above our weight”. You can’t do that now. By that yardstick, therefore, we’re failing.’ In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: ‘With a restructured, more flexible and agile Army and with £160billion planned on new equipment over the next decade, we will ensure our Armed Forces retain their formidable range of capabilities and ability to project power across the globe.’","Philip Hammond has attacked critics of his Armed Forces reforms .

"By . Alan Roden . A hunt is under way to find the rogue UK Government minister who said that an independent Scotland could be allowed to keep the pound. Months of careful planning by the pro-Union campaign was undone this weekend after the unnamed Coalition figure said Alex Salmond's proposal for a 'currency union' remained a viable option. Chancellor George Osborne, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and other senior Westminster politicians have again denied that a deal would be done if Scots vote Yes in September. Chancellor George Osborne is understood to be furious about the off-the-record remarks which have been seized on by First Minister Alex Salmond to bolster his case for independence . But there is private fury at the damage caused for Better Together, which is already reeling from a bruising week. One high-profile MP told the Mail: 'When the source is found, he will be served up as a kebab for George Osborne.' The mole hunt is focusing on junior Tory ministers from England, although Defence Secretary Philip Hammond did himself no favours yesterday when asked if he had spoken to the Guardian newspaper which broke the story. 'I don't think so,' he meekly replied. One senior Lib Dem minister is also at the centre of on-going speculation. Yesterday, First Minister Alex Salmond could not hide his glee and said the unnamed minister was 'the man that was caught telling the truth'. Should Scotland be allowed to stay in a currency union with UK if it splits? He said the source had 'exposed' the . argument that voting No means leaving the pound as a 'campaign tactic', . adding: 'It is a new found tactic, a merry wheeze, dreamt up, as we know . from the Guardian report, by [Better Together leader] Alistair Darling, . and [Downing Street adviser] Andrew Dunlop persuaded the Treasury to do . it. 'Now it's been seen . through. The bluff has been called and the No campaign will have to take . the political consequences, which will be severe.' The Guardian quoted . the minister as saying: 'There would be a highly complex set of . negotiations after a Yes vote, with many moving pieces. The UK wants to keep Trident nuclear . weapons at Faslane and the Scottish Government wants a currency union - . you can see the outlines of a deal.' However, Mr Salmond yesterday . insisted he would not use Trident as a bargaining chip. 'The . negotiations will take place about share of debt, not about things like . Trident, which we are unambiguously opposed to,' he said. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie described the source of the original story as 'out of the loop'. The Mail understands Better Together's plans to pay for 'negative' adverts that would 'hammer home' uncertainties over currency issues have been revisited . There was fresh confusion today about the future of the pound, after Alistair Darling claimed a currency union between Scotland and the rest of the UK could be put to the vote. Tories, Labour and Lib Dems have ruled out any prospect of an independent Scotland continuing to use the pound in a currency union. But Mr Darling, the former Chancellor leading to Better Together campaign, suggested the idea could be resurrected in the event of a Yes vote in September's referendum. He told BBC Radio 4: 'I think people in the rest of the UK do need to have a say as to whether they go into a currency union with Scotland.' Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish . Secretary, said: 'I think most fair-minded observers will look at this . and they will say on the one hand you have got an anonymous source . speaking off the record, on the other hand, you have the Governor of the . Bank of England, and the very detailed advice of the Permanent . Secretary to the Treasury to the Chancellor saying this is something we . would not advise you to be part of. 'There . is no bluff, no bluster, there is no bullying.' However, according to a . YouGov poll published last week, before the unnamed minister spoke out, . 45 per cent of voters believe that Mr Osborne and politicians from the . other Westminster parties are bluffing about their decision to block a . deal to share the pound, while 40 per cent said they believe what they . said. In a joint statement, Mr Osborne and Mr Alexander said: 'There will not be a currency union in the event of independence. 'The only way to keep the UK pound is to stay in the UK. Walking out of the UK means walking out of the UK pound. A currency union will not work because it would not be in Scotland's interests and would not be in the UK's interests. 'Scotland would have no control over mortgage rates and would be binding its hands on tax and funding for vital public services. 'The Scottish Government are proposing to divorce the rest of the UK but want to keep the joint bank account and credit card. The UK would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country and its banks. Parliament wouldn't pass it and the people wouldn't accept it. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.' A senior Labour Party source said: 'Without being too melodramatic, they have a duty to find this person, explain that they don't speak for the Government and then put them up against a wall and shoot them. There is no bluff or bluster'","Unnamed coalition minister claimed currency union is a viable option .

"By . Ray Massey . The new boss of Network Rail has apologised to passengers for poor performance that has left the firm facing fines of up to £80million for missing punctuality targets. Mark Carne accepted that the company ‘must do better’ but pledged to make Britain’s trains the most punctual in Europe as part of his £38billion ‘five year plan’ which begins tomorrow. The former oil boss vowed to reduce overcrowding, free up the timetable, increase punctuality and reliability, and make the railways safer – while cutting costs by 20 per cent. Mark Carne accepted that the company 'must do better' but pledged to make Britain¿s trains the most punctual in Europe as part of his £38billion 'five year plan' which begins tomorrow . But he said: ‘I hold my hand up and agree that more than 50 per cent of delays are to do with failures of the network. 'We have to work on reliability so that there are fewer failures to the system. I want to get people there on time. 'Reliability is absolutely critical to the job I have to do.’ He also signalled that directors’ bonus payments are to be cut in favour of bigger basic salaries – a move which would in fact favour them if they miss future targets on which bonuses would be based. Mr Carne, a 54-year-old Cornishman, took over the role of chief executive last month after Sir David Higgins left to run HS2. Network Rail is on track to be fined up to £80million by the Office of Rail Regulation due to its failure to meet key targets over the last five years. The company is to blame for more than half of the delays on the railways. Just 86.5 per cent of long-distance trains are punctual – way below the target of 91.8 per cent. The rail watchdog imposes a penalty for every 0.1 per cent failure to meet punctuality targets on long distance routes. However, it may take account of mitigating factors such as the recent severe weather and flooding, which led to widespread chaos and cancellations. Meanwhile, Network Rail has confirmed that the storm-wrecked railway line at Dawlish in Devon will reopen as planned at the end of the week . Mr Carne has pledged to transform Britain’s railways with ‘more trains, more seats, reduced congestion and bigger, better stations’. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘A key part of this Government’s long-term economic plan is investing in world-class infrastructure. 'That is why we are putting record amounts of Government funding into our railways over the next five years. ‘That investment will generate growth, create jobs and boost business while delivering faster journeys, greater comfort and better punctuality for passengers across the UK.’ A spokesman for consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said: ‘The £38billion investment for Network Rail over the next five years is welcome, particularly during difficult economic times.’ But it warned: ‘Passengers should ultimately see an improved rail service bringing the things they tell us they want – improved punctuality, reliable trains with more seats.’ The coast-hugging stretch of  track was severely damaged in this winter's savage storms. It then suffered more damage in another violent storm on February 14 .

The line was shut and work carried out around the clock to bring it back into service. But the planned re-opening was threatened early this month by a massive landslip, involving the collapse of 20,000 tonnes of cliff-face near Teignmouth. Confirming that the reopening  was going ahead, Mr Carne said: ‘Dawlish has shown us at our best when we work in a planned, disciplined and innovative way.’","Mark Carne has said that he accepted that the company ‘must do better’

"By . Wills Robinson . A couple are offering a £1,000 'reward' to anyone who helps them to sell their 116-year-old converted chapel through social media. Eden and Lizzi Sutcliffe, who have lived in the property at Corris, near Machynlleth, mid Wales, for more than seven years, became frustrated when they received only one viewing after placing the £199,000 property in the hands of an estate agent last September. So the pair decided to try a new sales tactic, turning to Facebook and Twitter and offering a £1,000 incentive to any user who puts them in direct touch with whoever eventually buys the house.

"By . Ryan Gorman . An Arizona State University freshman fell 10 stories to her death from an off-campus apartment balcony early Sunday morning, police said.

"By . Ian Ladyman . At last a comprehensively good day for David Moyes. A come-from-behind victory — a rare thing indeed in this troubled season — and a pre-match show of bravado clever enough to earn  some new respect from the Stretford End. Moyes has at times shown himself a little awed by his first season at  Manchester United. Not on this occasion, though. The United manager’s pre-match walk down the touchline ahead of his team’s emergence from the tunnel could have backfired dreadfully. One-nil! David Moyes won a personal victory after receiving support from United fans at Old Trafford . Respite: Wayne Rooney (L) and a first goal from Juan Mata helped United to a 4-1 victory over Aston Villa . Damp squib: A fly-by protest calling for Moyes to be sacked was largely met with derision at Old Trafford . Moyes, though, had judged the mood of his crowd better than the media and certainly better than the classless goons who dug in to their pockets to hire a plane trailing a  banner denigrating their manager above the stadium at kick-off. The Stretford End’s applause was generous and genuine. They respect a bit of ‘front’ in Manchester. They got used to it during 27 years of Sir Alex Ferguson and here was a bit of Glaswegian gallus from their new man. Sign of the times: Calls to remove Moyes' The Chosen One banner were also ignored . Teenage kicks: Adnan Januzaj came on to unlock Aston Villa's defence with a through ball for the final goal . David Moyes is yet to name the same starting XI in two competitive games. This was his 47th different starting team. It made for superb theatre and United’s subsequent victory would have pleased Moyes, too. Trailing early, they could have capitulated, given their recent dismal efforts at home. Here, though, despite some more suspect defending, United muddled through. A 4-1 scoreline perhaps flattered them a little. Bayern Munich won’t be too worried ahead of tomorrow’s Champions League quarter-final game at Old Trafford but United left back Alex Buttner at least struck a positive tone. ‘If we lose a game we shouldn’t be looking at the manager, it is the team,’ said Buttner. ‘Today we fought for each other, the fans and for the gaffer. We have a very important game on Tuesday and it was great for our confidence that we beat Villa. If we had lost the confidence would have been low but now we have a good feeling.’ German engineering: United will be more severely tested when they face Bayern in the Champions League . Dutch courage: Alex Buttner (L) will line up to play against Bayern in the absence of Patrice Evra . With Patrice Evra suspended for the game, Buttner will start against the Bundesliga champions. This is where the bad news starts. Moyes’ team can score goals — they created some good ones on Saturday — but they look vulnerable through the centre of the defence and Bayern wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery will certainly be enthusiastic about getting at Buttner and the Brazilian Rafael, if he recovers from the thigh injury that forced him off at half-time on Saturday. United remain short of numbers at the back and the timing couldn’t be worse. Michael Carrick, supposed to be resting ahead of tomorrow, was forced on as an emergency central defender at half-time against Villa as Phil Jones shuffled across to replace Rafael. Injury blow: United defender Rafael (R) could also miss the game after being taken off with a knock . Wing men: United's defenders will have to deal with Arjen Robben (L) and Franck Ribery (R) Be afraid! Bayern Munich have already sewn up the Bundesliga with seven league games to go . Leading 2-1 at the time, United should have been pegged back on two occasions, Christian Benteke wasting both opportunities, and this is what will worry Moyes more than anything ahead of a two-legged tie against a team that has won 27 of its last 30 games. ‘I’ve never played against Robben before and I haven’t watched videos or anything like that to study him but I know enough from what I have seen to know how he plays the game,’ added Buttner. ‘This kind of big game is why you play football. It is what it is all about. It would be good for my career if I could do well against him.’ Whatever happens tomorrow,  Buttner’s career at United will end this summer. The Dutch defender is sadly not quite good enough. Clearout: Buttner is unlikely to remain at Old Trafford beyond this season as United begin plans for rebuilding . Headstrong! Christian Benteke missed several chances against United... the Germans will not be so profligate . Good luck with that! Paul Lambert (R) has warned United that they will not have much possession against Bayern . For Moyes, however, the next 10 days or so will be critical. Nobody expects United to get past the defending champions and, remarkable as it sounds, defeat with honour would be acceptable. Another pounding, though, may still prove fatal for the United manager. On Saturday Bayern’s scouts will have seen a typically determined performance from Wayne Rooney and some improvement from Juan Mata and Shinji Kagawa. Villa manager Paul Lambert, once a Bundesliga player, struck a salutary note, though. ‘United are going to be without the ball for a long time, that’s a big thing,’ he said. ‘It’s going to be really tough. You wouldn’t back against United but they are going to have to play — over two legs — one of the best teams in Europe.’","David Moyes earned a reprieve after United defeated Aston Villa 4-1 .

"By . Matthew Morlidge . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes Luis Suarez is on course to be the world's first £100million star. The Uruguayan has delighted the Anfield faithful this season in a free scoring side, knocking in 28 goals in the Premier League alone. And Rodgers insists that while there is no intention to sell the striker, he would be deserving of a record valuation.

Trust: Rodgers has built his improving Liverpool side around the Uruguayan, who has scored 28 PL goals . Suarez is reaching the heights of La Liga pair Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, according to the Northern Irish manager.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Grayson Clamp's parents tried everything to help their deaf 3-year-old son hear. But when a cochlear implant failed to fix his auditory disability, Len and Nicole Clamp turned to an untested method that had never before been used on children in the United States: an 'auditory brain stem implant.' After the chip was implanted, Grayson - who was adopted by the Clamps as a newborn after he was placed in foster care - could hear for the first time in his life. Scroll down for video . What's all that noise? 3-year-old Grayson Clamp hears for the first time . Clamp's face 'lit up' the first time he could hear his father . 'We don't know exactly what it's like for him,' Nicole Clamp told WBTV. 'We don't know exactly what he hears. His brain is still . trying organize itself to use sound.' Grayson is missing the cochlear nerves in his ears that allow humans to process the sounds that we hear. After the cochlear implant failed, the Clamps decided to participate in a research trial at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where doctors were researching the use of the implant on children. Auditory brain stem implants have been used on adults in the U.S. since 1979. But researchers have never before tested the device on children - although, it is approved for use on children in Europe. The procedure requires doctors to implant a microchip into a patient's brain. The microchip then helps him recognize and process sound. Medical breakthrough: Clamp was the first child in the Unites States to receive an auditory brain stem implant . Surgery: To implant the device that now allows him to hear, Clamp had to undergo brain surgery . The technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain, rather than the cochlea. To date, roughly 1,000 people have undergone the procedure, with varying degrees of success - most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound. It's described as being able to hear the beat, but not the melody. For Grayson, the device seems to be working - his parents say his face lit up when he heard his father's voice for the first time about three weeks ago. 'It's been phenomenal for us,' Len Clamp says.

"By . Phil Duncan . Felipe Massa was at the centre of a rather embarrassing team orders row in Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix after he ignored a direct instruction from Williams to move over for team-mate Valtteri Bottas as the two diced for seventh place. The message delivered from the Williams pit-wall was humiliating in its delivery, too – reminiscent of Ferrari infamously ordering Massa to allow Fernando Alonso to take the lead of the 2010 German Grand Prix – an instruction which ultimately lead to the end of the team order ruling. 'Felipe, Valtteri is faster than you. Do not hold him up,' was the instruction to Massa on Sunday – eerily similar to the 'Felipe, Fernando is faster than you' team directive from four years ago. Off track: Felipe Massa was ordered to allow Valtteri Bottas through - a directive he ignored . Massa subsequently defended his decision to ignore the order from the pit-wall, but Bottas argued he would have '100 per cent' caught Jenson Button who finished sixth. Either way, an uncomfortable moment for Massa, who, after spending almost a decade of playing second fiddle to Michael Schumacher and then Alonso at Ferrari, would not have expected the same treatment at Williams - particularly to a team-mate only in his second full Formula One campaign. Lewis Hamilton completed the perfect hat-trick of pole-position, race victory, and fastest lap for the first time since the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton's 23rd career win also moved him to 11th on the all-time list alongside the Brazilian Nelson Piquet and one better than 1996 world champion Damon Hill. Only Nigel Mansell (31), Sir Jackie Stewart (27) and Jim Clark (25) can claim to have won more races as a British driver. Jumping for joy: Hamilton celebrates the 23rd win of his Formula One career following a flawless display . It also marked the 100th points' finish of his career although Hamilton didn't wish to be reminded of that statistic afterwards. 'I don't want to hear that kind of stuff because it means I am getting old,' the 29-year-old quipped. Daniel Ricciardo appears to have inherited the appalling bad luck which plagued the career of the man he replaced. After being thrown out of the results in Australia, Ricciardo, the replacement for Mark Webber at Red Bull, saw an almost certain fourth-placed finish snatched from his grasp after a bumbled pit-stop. The botched job on the front-left tyre led to comical scenes in the pit-lane with his Red Bull crew then pushing the stricken Aussie back to the garage. Ricciardo then suffered a failure with his front wing which led to a puncture before then having to serve a 10-second grid penalty for Red Bull's unsafe release. all in a matter of laps. Red Bull's gaffe also means Ricciardo will serve a 10-place grid penalty at next week's Bahrain Grand Prix.  It never rains… . Bad day at the office: Daniel Ricciardo is wheeled back up the pit-lane after his left-front wheel came loose . Mercedes made history on Sunday with their first 1-2 finish since the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. The legendary Juan Manuel Fangio finished ahead of Piero Taruffi by just 0.7seconds at that race in Monza almost 60 years ago, but Hamilton's winning margin over Rosberg was rather more emphatic on Sunday. Hamilton finished over 17 seconds ahead of his team-mate, going some way to disproving theories that the British racer might not have the tactical nous to cement a championship challenge this year. Team effort: Hamilton and Rosberg lead the Mercedes post-race celebrations after their 1-2 finish in Sepang . 'Why is Benedict Cumberbatch' was tending worldwide on Twitter after the British actor was the surprise choice to conduct the post-race podium interviews. The job is one normally reserved for a Formula One legend, but Cumberbatch, known for his leading role in BBC drama Sherlock, turned in a credible performance.

"By . Grace Mccann . Toby . Hadoke has suffered with psoriasis since childhood. The condition, . which causes red, scaly patches of skin, is distressing and can be . painful. 'At its worst, I felt like I'd been stung by a thousand bees,' says Toby, a 40-year-old comedian and writer from north London. But . recently he's found a surprising treatment that has transformed his . symptoms. Much of his skin used to be covered in flaky patches. Today, . these areas are merely slightly pink and dry. Toby Hadoke, 40, from London has suffered with psoriasis since childhood and has recently found a treatment . The difference is not . down to a new ointment but, he says, it's thanks to a form of talking . therapy, known as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). 'I tried . everything - Chinese medicine, mud from the Dead Sea, bathing in . lavender,' says Toby. 'But CBT has helped massively - I finally feel I'm . in control of my psoriasis.' It may seem surprising that a . psychological treatment could have such a marked effect on a physical . condition, but it is increasingly being used outside the mental health . field. Talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy help . people make positive changes to their thinking and behaviour and have . been shown to be effective for a range of conditions including skin . complaints, gut disorders and chronic pain. What is striking is that . psychological techniques are actively helping to reduce symptoms, rather . than enabling patients to cope with having a long-term condition. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition where the skin renews . itself too quickly. It is thought to be due to a problem with the immune . system. Research has shown CBT can reduce its severity, an effect . maintained six months on, says Dr Alexandra Mizara, a specialist . psychologist who leads the psychodermatology service at the Royal Free . Hospital in London, offering support for conditions ranging from acne to . skin cancer. Psychological techniques are actively helping to reduce symptoms . About 60 per cent of psoriasis patients will find . stress makes their condition worse, adds Dr Sandy McBride, a consultant . dermatologist at the Royal Free. It's thought that this may partly be . because when stressed, people with psoriasis produce less cortisol - a . hormone that reduces inflammation. 'It's logical that if stress . makes many psoriasis patients worse, modifying your stress response . should make it better,' says  Dr McBride. Toby was bullied at school and says that his psoriasis would flare up as a result. He . has two or three sessions a month of CBT with Dr Mizara, plus . twice-monthly injections of an anti-inflammatory drug, and ointments for . his arms and scalp. The CBT sessions have helped to reduce his stress . levels by changing unhelpful ways of thinking. 'I might have a . conversation with someone that's gone perfectly well, then remember . something I said that the person didn't seem enthusiastic about and . worry about it,' says Toby. This tendency to fixate on such moments, . perceiving them as failures, is known in psychology as catastrophising, . in which unnecessary stress is generated. 'Dr Mizara's very good at offering perspective, such as the person I was talking to may just have been distracted,' says Toby. Much . of his stress is generated by psoriasis itself. 'I was once in a play, . which required me to take my top off,' he says. 'I heard a bloke in the . audience say loudly: ""Well, I hope that's not catching."" ' In the . past, Toby would have dwelled on the comment, but CBT has given him . techniques to get past it. Since starting sessions with Dr Mizara two . years ago, his Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score - which . measures the severity of psoriasis - has improved and he is using less . ointment.It is also accepted that CBT can be an effective treatment . for some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), says Dr Anton . Emmanuel, a consultant gastroenterologist at University College . Hospital, London. IBS refers to symptoms such as stomach cramps, . diarrhoea, constipation and bloating. It is estimated to affect up to a . third of the population at some point in their lives. Stress is a . trigger. 'We know psychological therapies can work for the symptoms . of IBS, as they have an effect on the autonomic nervous system, which . regulates automatic functions such as digestion,' says Dr Emmanuel, who . is also the medical director of the gut and liver disease charity, Core. Brain . scans of IBS patients have shown increased activity in parts of the . brain that process messages about pain. This appears to be reduced by . therapy. Michael Wyatt, an 18-year-old student from Surrey, . developed an irritable bowel last year during a severe case of . ulcerative colitis, an inflammation of the colon, which led to him . needing the loo up to 20 times a day. Michael had already been having . CBT for anxiety and to cope with his colitis. When his irritable bowel . developed, his phsychologists treated it with CBT, too. 'My therapist . looked at things I was doing to give myself more stress,' he says. Part of the problem was Michael's rigid ideas about how he should look and behave. CBT helped his accept his condition rather than focus on it . His . therapist encouraged him to challenge these rules by deliberately . breaking them. 'One of my rules was always to look classy, so instead, . when I had my driving theory test I wore tracksuit bottoms,' he says. 'CBT helped me accept my condition rather than focus on it, and my symptoms have died off.' It . has been established that talking therapy can help people who suffer . with chronic pain. Annabel Gray, 42, had suffered with a lower back . problem for ten years and had struggled to get a clear answer as to what . was causing it. 'I was told I had a prolapsed disc at one point; . another doctor said it was a muscular problem. When it's been bad I've . been either hobbling around or completely unable to move,' says the . mother-of-two. Last year Annabel, an administrator from Portsmouth, . took part in a study comparing the efficacy of contextual cognitive . behavioural therapy (CCBT), a new form of talking therapy that focuses . on mindfulness and accepting problems rather than obsessing about them, . with physiotherapy in people suffering chronic back pain. Mindfulness is a meditative technique to develop awareness of the present moment as an antidote to worry. Annabel received eight one-to-one sessions of CCBT with a psychologist. Professor . Tamar Pincus, a health psychologist at Royal Holloway, University of . London, who co-ran the as-yet-unpublished study, described how the . therapy is designed to help people who struggle to cope psychologically . with a physical condition. 'They tend to be people with negative thinking styles,' says Professor Pincus. Tensing  up against pain increases it,  he adds. In . her sessions, Annabel would be asked to close her eyes and focus on the . pain. 'To feel it for what it is, accept it and let it be,' she says. 'It's been amazingly helpful. A few weeks ago I had a bad episode with . my back. Whereas before I would probably have lain on the sofa, taken . painkillers and worried about the pain, I took my dog for a walk and . felt better.' Annabel credits CCBT for the change in her mindset and is in less pain now. 'It's turned my life around,' she says.","Toby Hadoke, 40, from London has suffered with psoriasis since childhood .

"NHS staff took away a four-year-old disabled boy's walking frame after hearing he and his family were moving house. Oliver McConnell, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was left unable to get around after the health worker confiscated the frame. Plucky Oliver is learning to walk after a pioneering operation in the US, paid for by community fundraisers. Cerebral palsy sufferer Oliver McConnell, pictured with his mother Danielle and brother Josh, left, had his walking frame seized by an NHS worker . But the walking frame was taken by an Oxford Health Trust worker who arrived at the McConnell’s home in Ambrosden, Oxfordshire, after hearing they planned to move to County Durham. Oliver’s mother, Danielle, said: 'He had just started getting on his feet and the NHS just came and took his walking frame because we’re moving. 'It (the frame) was something so minor - how many crutches go missing? But for days I was thinking how is he going to get about or get to school.' Yesterday, however, the trust did an about-turn, and returned the walking aid. An Oxford health spokesman said: 'This should not have happened and we sincerely apologise to this family. 'A suitable frame has been delivered and they can retain it for as long as they need it. We will issue fresh guidance to staff to try to prevent this happening again. 'Staff have contacted the family to apologise in person and we wish them well with their move.' Helped by a JustGiving page, Oliver¿s family raised thousands to take him for a pioneering operation in the USA two years ago . The family launched an appeal, Help Oliver Walk, in April 2012, to raise money for the life-changing operation. Friends organised events including auctions, cake sales, sponsored runs and walks and a skydive. Since his operation he has gone from strength to strength and the frame helps him walk around. His mother had feared Oliver's progress and confidence would have been knocked if he did not have a frame. So concerned were the family that Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer colleagues of her soldier husband Barry, a Staff Sergeant at Bicester Garrison, were planning to make Oliver a temporary frame. Oliver still has fortnightly physiotherapy and uses the frame to help him walk.","Oxfordshire four-year-old needs walking aid due to cerebral palsy .

"The Countess of Wessex has issued a plea for more people to learn first aid, after a close friend’s daughter saved the life of a stranger on the Tube. Honouring Britain’s lifesavers at the St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes Awards last week, run in association with The Mail on Sunday, she revealed that first-aid training meant the 19-year-old was able to treat a man who collapsed in front of her at a station. ‘She immediately rushed to see if she could help him, checked his breathing and put him in the recovery position. The Countess of Wessex is campaigning for more Britons to become livesavers and learn first aid. She is pictured here with Tess Daly who hosted the St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes awards. Sam Herbert saved the life of a man who collapsed in the street . 'Then she had to run to find someone to call for an ambulance. After this she went back to the man and stayed with him until help arrived,’ said Sophie, Countess of Wessex. ‘During all this time not one person stopped to offer assistance. Thankfully this girl had received first-aid training so she did all the right things. ‘So many people seem to walk on by when something happens; I think the biggest barrier is that without proper first-aid training we think that we might do more harm than good.’ Her call echoes The Mail on Sunday’s campaign for every schoolchild to be taught first aid. The awards were presented by Tess Daly at a star-studded ceremony at the Lancaster London Hotel. Ceinwen Morgans (left) picks up the High Street . Hero award. Staff at Parkland Primary School in South Wigston, . Leicestershire (right) collected the Top of the Class award . Restaurant team leader Ceinwen Morgans (pictured below) saved the life of 82-year-old John Ollerenshaw when he had a sudden cardiac arrest shortly after arriving for a meal. ‘I . watched him collapse and quickly ran over,’ says Ceinwen, who had been . sent on a first-aid course a few months before through her work at The . Princess Pavilion in Falmouth, Cornwall. ‘It . took me a few moments to work out what was going on and then I started . compressions straight away. The adrenaline kicked in and I was . completely focused on keeping going and saving his life. I carried on . for 35 minutes, which was pretty exhausting. Even when the ambulance . arrived I carried on as they set up the defibrillator.’ Ceinwen, . 26, adds: ‘It was a strange experience but I didn’t have time to stop . and think about it at the time. 'I’d only done my first aid training . really recently and never imagined I’d have to use it in real life in . such a serious situation.’ John went on to make a full recovery and the pair have kept in touch . Parkland Primary School in South Wigston, Leicestershire, won the Top of The Class award for its forward-thinking attitude to teaching first aid. All 500 children are given the opportunity to attend first-aid training – starting when they are just four. Pupils continue to receive refresher courses every term until they leave at 11. ‘We start with teaching them how to call 999 and by Year One they are learning basic CPR,’ says nursery nurse and first aider Alison Chapman. ‘At the beginning they are just bouncing around but they can do it quite competently by Year Six. 'So many adults don’t know how to do it but it’s an essential life skill and I’d love it to be part of the national curriculum.’ Alison, right, adds: ‘It’s really important to start teaching children first aid from as young as possible.’ The school is the first in the country to have an automated defibrillator, which is also available for use by the community. The TV presenter said the importance of first aid hit her after an emotive ad campaign by St John Ambulance which showed a boy falling from a tree with nobody nearby who knew first aid. She said: ‘As a mum to two young daughters, I’ve seen my share of cut knees and bumps to the head. But seeing the advert, I realised how serious some childhood accidents can be.’ Mail on Sunday readers voted 15-year-old Sam Herbert winner of the Guy Evans Award. He saved a man who collapsed in the street, despite himself having a congenital heart defect. Sam had received first-aid training as an Army Cadet so he immediately began CPR. ‘Because of my heart condition I was worried I wouldn’t have the strength to perform CPR for long so I showed a woman who was passing by how to do it,’ says Sam. Assistant head teacher Simon Underwood saved the life of a 15-month-old boy found face down in a stream. Simon, 40, had just arrived at a holiday park for a camping trip with his wife Tabitha, 32, and children Finlay, four, and Islay-Mae, two, when he heard the distressed cries of the toddler’s family and ran over. ‘He was limp and his skin was purple and he looked bloated,’ says Simon, who began CPR while everyone around him was panicking and shouting. ‘The family were clearly distraught so I stepped in. I  feel instantly calm in situations like that and I went on to autopilot; I knew we had  zero time to waste.’ Simon, right, had learnt CPR after co-coordinating and supervising first-aid classes for his pupils at Oxford Academy over several years. After three minutes of CPR, Simon had made no progress so he held the toddler upside down to allow some water to come out of his mouth and nose. Then he carried on with CPR for a couple of minutes until the boy vomited. He suddenly heard shallow, gurgling breaths coming from  the child. He explained: ‘I didn’t want to carry on in case I caused damage so we put him in the recovery position and put a blanket over him until the ambulance arrived.’ The toddler was taken to hospital from the Northamptonshire park and fully recovered after time in intensive care. Simon describes the events of that day as ‘the best and worst experience of my life.’ He still has flashbacks but imagines it is the lives of his own children he is trying to save. ‘Having young children myself has made it really hard to come to terms with,’ he says. ‘Not having seen the boy or spoken to the family since that day it’s been difficult to get any closure. It still feels very raw.’ ‘We do lots of practice at first aid in Army Cadets but I never thought I’d use it in real life.’ Sam, . who lives in Derby with lorry driver father dad David, 50, stepmother . Beverley, 44, who is a shop assistant, sister Katie, 17, step sister . Rebecca, 17 and step brother Dylan, 13, has Ivemark syndrome. This means he was born with a deformed heart and lungs and most of his internal organs are reversed. He has had countless operations and it has reduced his strength as a result. But he said: ‘I’ve never let my condition hold me back.’ Also presenting an award was former . footballer Fabrice Muamba, whose life was saved by first aid when he . suffered cardiac arrest at an FA Cup match in 2012. He said: ‘It doesn’t matter what car you drive or what’s in your wallet when you need first aid.’Here we feature four other winners and their inspirational stories. Fabrice Muamba (left) attended the awards ceremony. The footballer's life was saved by first aid when he suffered cardiac arrest at an FA Cup match in 2012 . Engineer Karen Lawrence and administrator Diane Fullerton saved the life of 33-year-old Chris Middleton who had a sudden cardiac arrest while visiting their workplace for a meeting. Ironically, Karen, 48, was standing next to the defibrillator in fellow first aider Diane’s office when colleagues at General Dynamics rang for help. Karen dialled 999 while Diane, 49, drove them – and the defibrillator – to the meeting room in a different building on the site in Pershore, Worcestershire. The pair could tell things didn’t look good for Chris, whose breathing was ragged and sporadic. The 999 operator stayed on the line the whole time and advised them to use the defibrillator. ‘I was surprised to have to use it because Chris didn’t look like heart attack material. He’s young, not overweight. The training kicked in though and we just got on with it,’ says Diane, who lives in Ledbury, Herefordshire, with husband Peter. After delivering the first shock to Chris, Karen carried on with CPR. They were then advised to give him a further shock, after which Diane took over with CPR until an ambulance arrived. ‘Seeing Chris looking so much better now is lovely,’ adds Karen, who lives in Worcester with her 13-year-old son Ben. ‘I still get very upset at the thought that he might have missed his first father’s day with his baby son if it hadn’t been for the defibrillator.’","Countess made plea at St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes Awards .

"By . Alice Smellie . As Sue Gordon lay frail and exhausted on a hospital bed following intensive treatment for stage three lung cancer, her daughter held her close, in a poignant reversal of the roles of mother and child. Losing a parent is always heart-breaking – yet, ever since that dreadful moment, actress Tricia Penrose has known that hers will be stolen from her far too soon. ‘We’ve always been more like sisters,’ says the 43-year-old from Liverpool, better known to millions across Britain as barmaid Gina in the series Heartbeat. Fomer Heartbeat actress Tricia Penrose (left) immediately gave up acting to care for her mother Sue Gordon who is suffering from lung cancer . ‘Mum is the first person I call whenever anything happens – when I met my husband Mark, got engaged and discovered I was pregnant. She even held my hand at the birth of both my children.’ With Sue’s support she rose from humble beginnings to stardom, and today she lives just a short drive from Sue in a beautiful barn conversion with businessman and property developer Mark Simpkin, 41, and sons, Jake, ten, and Freddy, five. But, for the moment at least, Tricia has turned her back on television to care for her mother, who at 60 has been told that the tumour in her lung will one day kill her. ‘I’m turning down acting and singing jobs to spend as much time as I can with Mum. There have been so many offers from telly, theatre tours and musicals, but I can’t even think about being away at the moment.’ Tricia’s modest upbringing might explain the pair’s incredibly close bond. Tricia says: ‘Mum was still living with her parents in a tiny house when I arrived. There was her, my aunt and myself all in one bed.’ Tricia Penrose pictured with her mother Sue Gordon featuring in Heartbeat in 2004 . Her mother adds: ‘She was a little . show-off. She was always doing shows in the garage, so we sent her to . the Elliott-Clarke Drama School.’ When . Tricia was 15 the pair of them formed a duo called Second Image and . sang in local nightclubs. ‘It was so much fun,’ says Sue. ‘Everyone said . how alike we looked.’ Later, Tricia got her a job as an occasional extra in Heartbeat. Sue adds: ‘I’d have my hair and make-up done and sit in the background in the pub. Tricia met Gary Barlow, you know.’ Tricia clarifies: ‘He did an episode of Heartbeat. It was great fun, and he did concerts for us back at the hotel in the evenings.’ The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation (freephone 0333 323 7200) has the following tips for carers of ill relatives: . Photographs dotted around Sue’s sitting room are testimony to their physical similarities through the years, and they both have the same startling bright blue-green eyes. To her regret, Sue had smoked from her teens – and, although she gave up more than a decade ago, she is now among the 85 per cent of lung cancer patients who are former smokers. She recalls: ‘We never thought about how it affected health in those days. There were no warnings on the packets. ‘I quit in my late 40s. I didn’t want my grandchildren to grow up with a granny who smoked.’ Unfortunately, giving up doesn’t mean you are exempt from lung cancer – and it is something of a myth that ex-smokers’ lungs completely return to normal. However, it is still true that the sooner someone kicks the habit,  the better. ‘If you give up smoking at 30, you have a 1.5 per cent chance of death from lung cancer, give up at 40 and it’s three per cent, at 50 it’s six per cent,’ says Professor David Baldwin, consultant respiratory physician at Nottingham University Hospitals. ‘Those who have never smoked only have a 0.5 per cent chance of death from lung cancer.’ More than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year and there are 35,000 deaths annually. It is the second most common cancer. A key reason behind the high mortality rate is late diagnosis. Symptoms are vague, including a constant cough, unexplained weight loss, chest infections and chest or shoulder pain. Once diagnosed, prognosis is generally poor. ‘The statistics are appalling,’ says Dr Jesme Fox, medical director of The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. ‘After diagnosis, around 30 per cent of people will live for at least a year.’ Long-term survival rates are low – only eight per cent will live for more than five years post-diagnosis. So it is nothing short of a miracle that Sue is sitting cheerfully in her sitting room in Oldham, Manchester. She is immaculate and slender and doesn’t look remotely ill. Her hair is swept into an elegant chignon and her skin is tanned. It was – unsurprisingly – Tricia who first noticed that there was something wrong. ‘I was doing her make-up for an event in Liverpool in spring 2010 and noticed that Mum’s eyes looked sunken. I suddenly realised that she had lost lots of weight.’ Sue dismissed their concerns. ‘Who complains about being slim?’ But a few weeks later she doubled over with a searing pain in her right side whilst the family were having Sunday lunch. ‘It was like being electrocuted. Tricia massaged it, but couldn’t alleviate the agony. The next morning my husband Danny took me to hospital.’ She was initially diagnosed with pneumonia but surgeons noticed a shadow on Sue’s lung. A bronchoscopy – where a tube was put down the back of her throat – revealed a 3½in tumour in her right lung. ‘The day of the results Mum was supposed to call me at 2pm, just after her appointment,’ says Tricia. ‘When she finally rang, her voice was just a whisper. She had an inoperable tumour on her right lung. I just sank to the floor crying.’ Tricia Penrose played barmaid Gina in ITV series Heartbeat . Every day for six and a half weeks, Tricia took Sue to The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester. ‘Standard treatment is 33 sessions of radiotherapy and two rounds – which is 12 days – of chemotherapy,’ says Dr Corinne Faivre-Finn, the consultant oncologist at The Christie. The radiotherapy Sue underwent was cutting edge. Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy, which is now standard at The Christie, allows the strength of the radiation to be adjusted. A higher dose can be delivered to the tumour but not to the surrounding and healthy tissue. Sue lived with Tricia and Mark throughout this gruelling time. ‘I washed her hair like she was my little girl,’ says Tricia. ‘Mark adores her and is very close to her as well.’ Dr Faivre-Finn adds: ‘We were conducting a clinical trial to see whether additional chemotherapy may help the final outcome. Sue was only able to undergo one further round.’ Tricia explains: ‘The treatment took its toll on Mum, and we had been told to prepare for the worst right from the start. During the long hours while the drugs dripped into her we planned her funeral. I blubbed the whole time.’ Sue wipes her eye: ‘But at least you know what I want – right down to the coffin.’ In fact, Sue frequently kept her family buoyant. ‘I got very depressed during her treatment  and had to go on antidepressants,’ admits Tricia. Sue seems to invariably see the humour in her bleak situation. She mock-sternly adds: ‘I had to tell her to snap out of it and get a grip. You know why I’m so brown?’ she whispers. ‘It’s because of the chemotherapy – it makes your tan last.’ In the series, barmaid Gina falls in love with policeman Phil Bellamy - who later dies . The family didn’t have any counselling. ‘We counselled each other,’ says Tricia. Following treatment, the tumour had shrunk to an inch. ‘Even the oncologist cheered,’ remembers Sue. Although she tries to lead as normal a life as possible, she is often exhausted. ‘Some days I sleep the whole time. Sometimes I have a cry to myself. But I firmly believe a positive attitude makes a difference.’ She is also on a near-liquid diet. ‘The radiotherapy damaged my oesophagus and I choke on solid food. It’s terrifying, so I’m on rice pudding and mashed potato.’ However, she takes no drugs. ‘I weaned myself off my morphine, though the doctor was a bit cross because I just stopped taking it  and then wondered why I had hallucinations.’ Tricia says: ‘The worry is that the tumour will relapse or that it will spread around her body.’ Should this happen, she can’t undergo any further radiotherapy, as her body won’t withstand further damage. Every three months Sue has a lung scan and blood tests. ‘Any symptoms – weight loss or pain – she has to call the doctor straight away,’ adds Tricia. However heart-breaking their situation may seem, Dr Faivre-Finn believes theirs is a story of hope: ‘She is enjoying a good quality  of life.’ That all important two year anniversary was celebrated with high tea at the Manchester Hilton. Next up is the five year landmark on July 1, 2015. ‘I think we’ll have champagne at that one,’ says Sue, and she and Tricia embrace and kiss.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . The dangers of ‘post-operative psychosis’ have been highlighted by an investigation into the suicide of British jewellery designer and philanthropist Sandra d’Auriol hours after she had a facelift. Ms d’Auriol jumped to her death from the roof of a Los Angeles clinic shortly after coming round from the operation in January. Now the details of the 53-year-old’s last hours have been pieced together in an investigation for US beauty magazine Allure by cosmetic surgery journalist Joan Kron. Sandra d'Auriol's brother said that he believed that her death was 'a direct result of post-operative psychosis' and that she awoke after the operation in a state of panic . Tragic: Sandra d'Auriol jumped from the top of this Los Angeles building, hours after her operation . The report reveals Ms d’Auriol’s brother-in-law Guy believes her death was ‘a direct result of post-operative psychosis’ and that she awoke after the operation in a state of panic. According to the Allure report, Ms d’Auriol ‘pulled at her hair under the surgical gauze dressings, tore off her clothes, and feared for her safety. “We’re all going to die,” she shouted.' When a nurse tried to restrain her, Ms d’Auriol pushed her to the floor of her 10th-floor room and ran up a stairwell to the roof of the 15-storey clinic. A ‘crisis negotiation team’, aided by Ms d’Auriol’s husband Yan, tried to talk her into moving away from the edge of the roof, but their efforts were in vain. Police spent three hours unsuccessfully attempting to talk the Hong Kong-based mother-of-two down as she sat naked with her legs dangling over a ledge (pictured) A family member said: ‘Yan was feeding [them] information he hoped would yank Sandra out of the psychotic state.’ Mr d’Auriol had not been allowed by the clinic to see his wife on the evening of her operation. Reports at the time said post-operative psychosis was a rare occurrence. But earlier this year Dr Martin Sandler, clinical director in elderly care at Spire Parkway Hospital in Birmingham, claimed up to one in ten older patients develops the condition – and that it is not necessarily a reaction to anaesthetic drugs. Reports at the time of Ms d'Auriol's death said post-operative psychosis was a rare occurrence . Ms d'Auriol is believed to have had a facelift at a clinic owned by 'surgeon to the stars' Dr Brian Novack (pictured) hours before her suicide . He said: ‘This is a reaction to trauma or unusual circumstances that can be brought on by an operation or by waking up in hospital. They become frightened and anxious.’ He added that the best way to preserve mental wellbeing is for patients to return home as soon as possible and be in a familiar environment among people they know.

"By . Sophie Goodchild . A rugby-playing schoolboy has become the youngest person in the UK to have keyhole surgery to remove a growth in his heart. Until now, such an operation would involve cutting into the breastbone, a traumatic procedure taking months to heal. It leaves the operation site delicate – which rules out a return to high-impact sports like rugby. Instead, doctors made just two small cuts and used a tiny wire- cage device to remove the growth from 17-year-old Terrence Nyahwa’s heart. Rugby-loving schoolboy Terrence Nyahwa from Orpingdon, Bromley, has become the youngest person in the UK to have keyhole surgery on a heart tumour . Cardiac tumours are a high-risk because fragments can break off and travel through the body. If they reach the brain or lungs, this can trigger a stroke or heart failure. The keyhole operation also meant a shorter recovery time, less risk of infection and no inches-long scar. Ranjit Deshpande, who led the team which performed Terrence’s operation at King’s College Hospital in Camberwell, South London, explained: ‘We not only kept Terrence alive but also his dreams of playing rugby. ‘Without this new approach, Terrence would never have been able to go on the pitch again and that has a huge psychological impact when you’re so young.’ Ranjit Deshpande, who led the team which performed the operation at King's College Hospital, explained: 'We not only kept Terrence alive but also his dreams of playing rugby' Terrence had been suffering chest pains and shortness of breath while playing sport for months. Hospital tests revealed the benign tumour and he was in the operating theatre just 48 hours later. First, doctors connected his heart to a bypass machine because surgery on a beating heart is too risky. Next, the team used a scalpel to make a 0.2in incision between his ribs then inserted a long thin flexible tube with a tiny high-definition camera at one end. The camera was positioned inside the heart, enabling doctors to get a clear image and assess the tumour close-up. A second cut was then made in the chest just above the first, and a long scalpel inserted until it reached the right-hand chamber of Terrence’s heart. No incision was made in the actual heart. Instead, the knife travelled through a natural opening in the heart. The wire cage, called a ‘snare’, was then inserted through the same hole. The snare opens like a flower then closes again around a tumour to hold it in place so the tumour doesn’t float away after the surgeon has cut it free. Once detached from the heart, the grape-sized tumour was removed from Terrence’s body in the grip of the snare. It took just a day for Terrence to be walking again and he was home within a week. In his first game back with his club Old Elthamians RFC, he scored a try and now wants to play rugby professionally. ‘This means so much to me and I feel so lucky to be back on the field again,’ says Terrence from Bromley, South London. ‘Before, I could only play for about ten minutes but now I’ve got my stamina back. And I’ve not got a huge scar on my chest.’ Terrence discovered his heart condition when playing rugby because he was experiencing shortness of breath .","Terrence Nyahwa, from Orpingdon, had been experiencing heart pains .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Han Solo from Star Wars was frozen in suspended animation for transport, but now scientists hope to perform surgery by 'freezing' patients . It sounds like something out of Star Wars - doctors are to attempt to save the lives of ten patients by putting them in ‘suspended animation’, when they are neither alive or dead. Medics in the U.S. will use the futuristic-sounding technique to buy themselves time to save knife and gunshot wound victims whose injuries would normally prove fatal. Surgeons at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, in Pittsburgh, will cool down the patients so their blood cells need less oxygen to survive. While the body is in this state, the team will work to fix the 'structural problems' caused by a blade or a bullet. The trial will take place later this month and the surgeons are already on call at the hospital, primed for when a suitable patient arrives, New Scientist reports. The procedure - which has been likened to what happened to Hans Solo in the Star Wars movie -  will see all of the patients’ blood being replaced with cold saline solution, meaning their bodies will quickly cool to 10C and almost all cellular activity will stop. ‘We are suspending life, but we don't like to call it suspended animation because it sounds like science fiction,’ Samuel Tisherman, a surgeon at the hospital, told New Scientist. ‘So we call it emergency preservation and resuscitation.’ Peter Rhee at the University of Arizona added: ‘If a patient comes to us two hours after dying you can't bring them back to life. 'But if they're dying and you suspend them, you have a chance to bring them back after their structural problems have been fixed.' It has long been known that there are benefits to cooling the bodies of some severely injured people. When the body is at its normal temperature, cells need a strong supply of oxygen, meaning that if the heart stops beating, the person will die rapidly. However, if the body temperature has been reduced, less oxygen is required, buying doctors time to save the patient. Previously, cooling of a body has been used during some operations but this involves circulating the blood through a cooling system. This is not an option in emergency medicine as it takes too long. As a result, doctors had to find a method of cooling the body much more quickly. In 2002 researchers at the University of Michigan tested a new technique on pigs. The creatures were sedated and then subjected to massive blood loss before their blood was replaced by cold saline solution. Once the pigs had been cooled to 10C, their injuries were repaired and they were warmed up again. A cell in suspended animation. Doctors face the challenge of freezing human cells without causing damage . The saline solution was replaced by their blood. The researchers noted that in most of the pigs, the hearts started again naturally and they suffered no long-term ill effects. The medics are now ready to try the technique on humans. However, they will need the right patient. It will have to be someone whose heart has stopped as a result of an injury and who cannot be successful revived using traditional techniques. Their body temperature will be reduced in just 15 minutes, they will temporarily have no blood in their system and they will not be breathing or have any brain activity. Technically, they will be dead. The doctors hope that the patients will then revive naturally but if they do not then they will be resuscitated.","U.S. medics developing the technique to buy time in treating lethal wounds .

"By . Luke Garratt . Hormone therapy can be medically legitimate, but it can also be used by those wishing to look younger . 'Anti-ageing' hormones could in fact shorten your life expectancy. New research suggests higher levels of hormones can reduce the effect of the body's natural defences against diseases. The study by scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York found that those in their 90s with naturally low levels of the hormone had a much better chance of living into their 100s than those with above-average levels. Anti-ageing hormones are a billion dollar industry based on the theory that replenishing hormones, which disappear naturally as you grow older, will restore youth. The hormones that are administered are mostly human growth hormone (HGH) which makes the body develop another hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and dehydroepiandrostersone (DHEA). Previous studies have found that using HGH, estrogen and other hormones has dangerous side effects like cancer, joint problems and cardiovascular disease. But the Albert Einstein study found that low IGF-1 levels might actually be a benefit and a way of predicting if someone is going to live for longer. The study examined 184 men in their mid-90s over the period of 11 years and found that the chance of living through the length of the study depended on their blood levels of IGF-1. Human growth hormone (pictured) can be used to stimulate growth in certain areas of the body, strengthening bone and increasing muscle - hence its cosmetic uses . It found a one nanogram per millimetre decrease in IGF-1 meant the person was going to live a week longer. In addition, scientists also found people with lower IGF-1 levels who were cancer survivors benefited more from the lower levels found in their blood. Three years into the study, 75 per cent of people who previous had cancer and low IGF-1 levels were still living, whereas only 25 per cent of participants with past cancer and higher IGF-1 were alive. Dr. Sofiya Milman, lead author of the study, said: 'In . light of insufficient scientific evidence [that] HGH in older adults . offers long-term anti-aging benefits, and with studies indicating that . low growth hormone levels may actually protect the elderly from ageing . diseases the risks of using HGH as an anti-aging strategy outweigh the . potential benefits.' Growth hormones began as an industry in 1990, in New England, when 12 men over 60 were given injections. The men found their muscle mass increased, their bone density grew and they had a decline in body fat. Entrepreneurs quickly took on the study and repackaged it as 'anti-ageing' and began offering it as a service. Administering HGH is illegal unless a patient has low levels of the hormone; but this diagnosis is subjective, which means some clinics can prescribe the treatment to those who don't need it. The research was carried out by the same group that found that many people over 100 have a mutation that keeps their IGF-1 levels below average. Another study in the journal Cell Metabolism said the benefits incurred from a lower level of IGF-1 could also extend to people in middle age, finding that people between the ages of 50 and 65 with a high animal protein consumption had high IGF-1 levels and were four times more likely to develop cancer. They were also 75 per cent more likely to die over the study period of 18 years. Dr Milman told LiveScience: 'Growth hormone administration causes ''melting'' of fat and tightening of skin, so one may look better. 'It may be beneficial for maintaining a Hollywood kind of longevity but . would not serve the public good, in general, as an anti-aging strategy.' But the relationship between HGH, IGF-1 and life expectancy is very complex, and low IGF-1 could be seen as a double-edged sword, as some studies have said low IGF-1 is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.","Albert Einsten College of Medicine in New York carried out study .

"By . Luke Garratt . A mother with an incredibly rare cancer had to have her entire forehead - including 85 per cent of her skull bone - removed, leaving her with huge scars. Pip Caliskan, 45, of Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, first went to the doctor complaining of a lump on her forehead and doctors said it was probably a cyst which would go away if she left it alone. But she was later diagnosed with a rare cancer called Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), which had spread to the soft tissue of the top her face. She eventually had to have her entire forehead removed, including a massive amount of skull bone, which was replaced with a skin graft made from animal collagen. Mrs Caliskan's forehead after 85 per cent of her skull bone, and most of her forehead skin, was removed following her lengthy treatment of the rare soft tissue cancer . Her forehead skin graft is a mixture of animal collagen and grafted skin, with a prosthetic laid over the top . DFPS, which affects just 1,000 people in the U.S, is rarely fatal but it is . incredibly difficult to treat because of the unique nature of the cancer's growth. During treatment, patients often have large amounts of tissue surrounding the growth removed, often leading to heavy scarring. Mrs Caliskan has started a support group, reaching out to other sufferers who are left to deal with the little-known condition. In her case, surgeons had to remove about 85 per cent of the thickness of her skull bone, as well as the skin around it, for fear that the tumour had spread to the bone. Mrs Caliskan said: 'I walk around for most of my life making sure I cover up my forehead. Mrs Caliskan's bandages and padding are removed after her procedure, before her skin graft is put in place . Mrs Caliskan's prosthetic is molded and prepared to help cover up the massive amount of bone and skin she has lost . 'I’m very self conscious and get very paranoid about it. Every so often I scratch some skin away from the graft, exposing some bone. 'But I want to be very open about DFSP, because it’s not a condition which is widely understood. 'It’s considered a good cancer to have because it rarely spreads to other parts of the body. It’s not a big killer. 'But the effect it has is quite devastating. It needs dramatic treatment. 'I am now in touch with hundreds of people from all over the world who have experienced the condition and at least 80 per cent of them carry significant scars.' Mrs Caliskan was diagnosed of DFSP in 1996, after she went to the doctor complaining of a bump in the middle of her hairline that had been bothering her for months. They said it was a cyst, and told her to leave it alone, but it was soon diagnosed as DFSP . Mrs Caliskan was diagnosed of DFSP in 1996, after she went to the doctor complaining of a bump in the middle of her hairline. The bump had been bothering her for months, and when she finally got it diagnosed, doctors did not originally suspect a tumour, telling her it would go away on its own. She said: 'The doctor said it was a cyst and suggested I leave it alone. 'Such things usually go away on their own and are usually harmless so I left it for six months. 'But it just got bigger, so I asked for it to be removed. 'The procedure was meant to be quite simple - a quick surgery and a couple of stitches. 'I got a phone call two weeks later to say tests had come back and had confirmed I had cancer. 'I was 27 years old and I didn’t have a clue what lay ahead.' Mrs Caliskan's scar heals on her forehead several months after her surgery, which consisted of removing the tumorous tentacles and soft tissue, followed by a major skin graft - she was originally told that the expansive tumour was a cyst that would go away on its own . The scar healed incredibly slowly, taking several months before the skin graft fully took hold and began to look like regular skin on her forehead, which now suffers a lack of about 85 per cent of the bone mass . She was told by doctors her tumour consisted of spindles and tentacles of cancerous cells spreading across her forehead and that surgery would be required. She underwent two rounds of surgery in 1996 and 1998, and then in 2008, as she was about to celebrate ten years of living cancer-free, the tumour returned. She said: 'The surgeon left just 15 per cent of the thickness of my skull bone. Mrs Caliskan now has no nerves, muscle or soft tissue on her forehead, and has to wear an NHS prosthetic and wig to cover up the scarring . 'I’ve got no muscle, nerves, soft tissue on my forehead. 'There’s nothing left. Over the top they laid animal collagen, and I had a skin graft over that. 'I now wear an NHS prosthetic under my hair to protect it, but I always need to be quite careful.' Mrs Caliskan is now in remission, but has to stay vigilant against the cancer returning. She started a Facebook page in 2008 specifically for other people who have been diagnosed with DFSP and are looking for answers. Mrs Caliskan with her surgeon, Mr Ciaran Healy, who performed the extensive surgery to remove, and then replace, 85 per cent of her skull bone and skin . Mrs Calliskan said: 'When I was first diagnosed we didn’t have laptops or smartphones. 'Finding information felt like an uphill struggle. 'So when the cancer came back I decided to launch a group to reach out to other people who might benefit from hearing about others’ experiences. Mrs Caliskan picture recently (left), following her successful surgery to remove the tumours. While she is positive about her recovery, she is worried it might return, and picture only a year after her surgery (right) 'For the first six months I was the only member. Then, a very anxious young woman from America found me and told me she had just been diagnosed. 'Now we have nearly 600 members and I’m assisted by administrators from America, Canada and Australia. 'Beyond a shadow of a doubt we have collected the biggest volume of information and personal accounts. 'Collectively we have access to more knowledge and information than any one doctor or hospital anywhere in them world. I feel very glad to be part of a group like that.' Mrs Caliskan with her daughter Leah, now 22, at her graduation (left) - Leah took care of her mother for most of the time she took to recover from the massive operation. (Right) Mrs Caliskan before the DFSP returned . The group, which is named ‘DFSP - DERMATOFIBROSARCOMA PROTUBERANS’ on Facebook, is currently planning awareness-raising through the design of a lapel ribbon and is seeking official charity status. She said: 'It’s an amazing feeling, as a one-in-a-million case, to meet another one-in-a-million case. 'You don’t feel as alone. I’ve made some amazing friends through the group.' Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans, or DFSP is a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissue and sometimes deep layers of the skin. It is named for the tendency to have tentacles that grow into surrounding fat, muscle, skin and even bone. It most commonly affects the torso, but can also be seen growing on the arms, legs, neck and head, and has a tendency to grow back in the same location after it is removed. However, it only spreads to another part of the body around 5 per cent of the time. It starts small, and usually grows slowly (over a period of months or years), and becomes raised and purplish or reddish. DFSP usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50, and there are about 1,000 diagnosed cases a year – with an incidence of about one to five people per million across the world. It can be treated with a course of radiotherapy, followed by extensive surgery to remove the tumours.","Hertfordshire mother has incredibly rare cancer - 1,000 known cases in U.S .

"By . Emma Innes . A woman is risking ovarian cancer to give herself a chance of motherhood. Pat Dowd, from North London, has the so-called 'breast cancer gene' which meant she had a terrifyingly high chance of developing both breast and ovarian cancers. She decided to have a double mastectomy and had her fallopian tubes removed but, despite the risk, opted to keep her ovaries until she has tried IVF treatment. Pat Dowd has the BRCA1 gene mutation which means her chance of developing breast cancer was between 70 and 80 per cent. She also had a 40 to 60 per cent chance of developing ovarian cancer . Already being in her 40s, Mrs Dowd was . advised to have surgery to remove her breasts and ovaries as soon as . possible as the threat of cancer was increasing with every passing year. But she wanted to try and fulfill her dream of motherhood first so will retain her ovaries for a few more years to give herself a final chance of IVF treatment. Mrs Dowd, who has the BRCA1 gene mutation, said: ‘I was haunted by the fact we hadn’t had children. ‘My husband is a very lovely man – he was just worried about my health. ‘He would rather know I was OK and forego having a family. Mrs Dowd (pictured with her husband and bridesmaids on her wedding day) was advised to have her ovaries and breasts removed to reduce her cancer risk . Mrs Dowd wants to try IVF treatment so she decided to risk retaining her ovaries. However, she has had her fallopian tubes and breasts removed to lower her cancer risk as much as possible . ‘My delaying the surgery made him upset. He was worried about me.’ She added: ‘For me it is a very sensitive topic because we were trying for children when I learned I had BRCA1. ‘If I had children I would have wanted to go for the surgery to ensure I would be there for my children.’ BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that are linked with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. If there is a fault, or mutation, in one of them, the risk of breast and ovarian cancer is high. The average woman has a 10 per cent chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime. People who have a fault in one of the breast cancer genes have a 50 to 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer. If a woman with the gene mutation has surgery to remove her breasts, she can reduce her risk of breast cancer by 90 to 95 per cent. Having a BRCA gene mutation also increases the risk of ovarian cancer to about 50 per cent. However, this risk can be reduced through surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Both men and women can carry the gene mutation and people can inherit it from either their mother or their father. If a person has a parent with the gene mutation, there is a 50 per cent chance they will inherit it. Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Dowd’s mother and father both suffered from breast cancer. Her father developed the disease when he was about 70 and her mother was diagnosed at 39. Tragically, . her mother died from a heart attack - associated with complication from . her cancer treatment - at the age of 59 but her father lived into old . age. Two of Mrs Dowd’s three paternal aunts also died of ovarian cancer in their early 50s. With such a strong family history of . cancer, Mrs Dowd was not surprised when, in July 2012, she learned she . had the BRCA1 gene mutation. However, she says what many people are surprised to learn is that she inherited it from her father – not her mother. She said: ‘I sort of knew I would get a positive result – it was a gut feeling. ‘I dealt with it by realising it wasn’t new – I had always had it, it just gave me the information I needed to help me make decisions about my future. ‘It helped me understand what we had been observing in the family.’ She added: ‘BRCA is not all bad because you can do something about it but it is vital that people realise it can also be passed down the male line. ‘This means women who have a history of female cancers on their fathers’ side of the family need to be aware that they are also at risk.’ When Mrs Dowd was told she had the gene mutation she learned that she had a shocking 70 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and a 40 to 60 per cent chance of developing ovarian cancer. Mrs Dowd said: ‘I had no knowledge of the ovarian cancer risk when I was told I had BRCA1 – I just thought it was about breast cancer. ‘I just sat on the knowledge for six months but it started to eat away at me.’ Mrs Dowd's mother and father both had breast cancer and two of her aunts had ovarian cancer. As a result, she was not surprised when she was told she had the BRCA gene mutation . Mrs Dowd (pictured with her nephew) inherited the BRCA1 gene mutation from her father - she says a lot of people do not realise this is possible as the gene mutation is associated with female cancers . She added: ‘I believe in using the information for the best for each person.’ As . a result, Mrs Dowd discussed her options with Adam Rosenthal, a . consultant gynaecologist at Weymouth Street Hospital, in London. She decided to go ahead with a double mastectomy – which took place in February this year – and surgery to remove her fallopian tubes – which took place in November last year. She says she found the decision about gynaecological surgery much more gruelling and says she was very grateful for Mr Rosenthal’s support. Mrs Dowd (pictured with her father) says she found it empowering to be able to chose which operations she wanted to have and to decide when to have them . Mrs Dowd said of learning she had the gene mutation: 'I dealt with it by realising it wasn't new - I had always had it, it just gave me the information I needed to help me make decisions about my future' Mrs Dowd was advised that many ovarian cancers in BRCA carriers are believed to start in the fallopian tubes and spread to the ovaries, so she may well have substantially reduced her cancer risk just by having her fallopian tubes removed. However, this has not yet been proved to be an effective way of preventing ovarian cancer and as she gets older the chance of developing cancer in her remaining ovaries is increasing. She told MailOnline: ‘Deciding which operations to have, and when, has been a very empowering experience – it has been a very positive experience.’ She added: ‘There are ways of managing the risks around your values and goals. ‘I told my gynaecological surgeon (Mr Rosenthal), “I can cope with being childless and penniless but I can’t cope with being childless, penniless and a cancer patient”.’ Mrs Dowd is considering having a special type of IVF treatment which would allow her to select an embryo that does not have the BRCA1 gene mutation . Mrs Dowd (pictured with her father) will probably have her ovaries removed once she had tried for children . Before having her ovaries removed Mrs Dowd is now considering IVF treatment. She is looking into the possibility of a special type of IVF which would involve selecting an embryo that does not carry the BRCA1 gene mutation - this is known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. Without this technology, any child she has would have a 50 per cent chance of carrying the gene mutation. Mr Rosenthal told MailOnline: ‘Pat’s story serves as an important reminder that this gene can pass equally through the male and female lines – a lot of people don’t realise this. 'It is important women don't ignore cancer history in their father's side. A family history of cancer on either side should be discussed with their GP, who can if necessary refer them to local Clinical Genetics services for more information and gene testing, if appropriate.'","Pat Dowd, who is in her 40s, has the BRCA1 gene mutation .

"By . Emma Innes . A grandmother has been left with a disfigured nose after doctors failed to notice she had a tumour the size of turnip growing on her nose - and nicknamed her ‘Pinocchio’. Golda Humphrey, 79, now has a hole in the centre of her face after a series of life-saving operations to remove a cancerous growth from the end of her nose. The problem developed when she was in hospital and over nearly five months a scab repeatedly formed on the tip of her nose before falling off. Golda Humphrey developed a large tumour on her nose (left) but it took doctors so long to diagnose it as skin cancer she eventually had to have a life-saving operation which saw surgeons remove most of her nose (right) Doctors initially dismissed the growth as a reaction to the medication she was given after breaking her leg. But each time it came back the sore got bigger and nurses jokingly nicknamed her ‘Pinocchio’. Mrs Humphrey, a retired bus conductor who does not want to name the hospital for legal reasons, said: ‘I understand they butchered my face to save my life, and I’m very grateful. ‘But during the time the tumour was growing on my face, I saw dozens of doctors and nurses - many of whom commented about it but did not even bother doing any tests. ‘When I was finally diagnosed with skin cancer, it was way too late. ‘The tumour was so big it had spread to my lip and I had to have two operations to remove it. Mrs Humphrey (pictured before developing the tumour) went into hospital with a broken leg and while she was there she developed a growth on her nose. Doctors dismissed it as a reaction to her medication . The growth grew so large that staff at the unnamed hospital nicknamed Mrs Humphrey Pinocchio . ‘By the end it was the size of a turnip. If they’d caught it sooner, I might be able to still smell the flowers in my garden. I’m so annoyed. ‘Now I’ve been left with a gaping hole in the middle of my face - I look like I’ve been shot.’ Mrs Humphrey’s ordeal began in July 2011 when she fell over in the garden of her home in Kent, and broke her femur and shattered her kneecap. She was hospitalised for 15 weeks after her leg failed to heal and she underwent surgery to repair her damaged knee. Midway through her stay she mysteriously began developing a scab on the tip of her nose. The widow said: ‘It would appear on a Monday, scab up through the week and then fall off on its own by the Friday. Mrs Humphrey was eventually diagnosed with malignant melanoma and was told she needed surgery. Image (right) shows the scab on her nose with stitches after an operation . Mrs Humphrey (pictured with her daughter, Golda, and granddaughter, Shannon) now has a large hole in her nose. She was given a prosthetic but she doesn't wear it as it is uncomfortable . ‘It was the strangest thing. The nurses and doctors said it was just a reaction to the medication I was on for my break, so I didn’t think anything of it. ‘I mean, you don’t, do you? You trust doctors to get it right and know when something is wrong.’ But just before she went in for her knee operation, in September 2011, the scab started to get bigger and refused to fall off. Her daughter Golda Helmsley, 54, of Rainham, Essex, said: ‘The nurses used to call her “Pinocchio”. ‘It was almost their pet name for her. ‘My mum hated it but she wouldn’t say anything about it, because that’s the type of lady she is. She’d never make a fuss. Granddaughter Shannon (pictured with her mother, Golda) said her grandmother wasn't the same person any more. She said: 'My nan has been knocked for six by all this. They've given her a prosthetic nose but she's self-conscious about it because her face is a complete mess.' ‘It was like she was growing a horn. ‘When she was recovering after her knee op, the lump just kept getting bigger and bigger. ‘And then when she was discharged it was still growing. ‘All the doctors and nurses we spoke to said it was just a cyst or a reaction to her meds, so they didn’t think it was anything to worry about.’ It was only when Mrs Humphrey saw a locum in December while staying with her daughter - around five months after the curious growth began - that she was told it could be more serious. The doctor referred her to a different hospital where she had a biopsy and was told she had a malignant melanoma in her nose and on her lip. Mrs Humphrey (pictured during treatment on her nose) is considering taking legal action against the hospital . Over the course of two operations, surgeons at an Essex hospital removed almost all of her nose, as well as a portion of her upper lip, and a slice of skin from her neck for skin grafts which did not take. She has also been fitted with a prosthetic nose, which she is reluctant to wear because it’s uncomfortable. Mrs Humphrey and her family are considering suing the hospital in Kent - which they do not want to name for legal reasons - for negligence, claiming it had ample opportunity to spot the tumour. Granddaughter Shannon Helmsley, 18, said her grandmother wasn’t the same person any more. She said: ‘My nan has been knocked for six by all this. ‘They’ve given her a prosthetic nose but she’s self-conscious about it because her face is a complete mess. ‘It looks like she was shot in the face. ‘I love her with all the world but I think the NHS has really let her down.’ Melanoma is a rare and serious type of cancer that begins in the skin and can spread to other parts of the body.The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole.These moles are most often found on the back, legs, arms and face.In most cases, the moles have an irregular shape and more than one colour. They may also be larger than normal and are sometimes itchy and bleed.Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people aged 15 to 34.More than 2,000 people die of the disease every year in the UK and it is becoming more common.Source: NHS Choices .","Golda Humphrey, 79, went to hospital with a badly broken leg .

"By . Emma Innes . A father-of-two is slowly turning into a ‘living statue’ after developing the extremely rare Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). Former chef Robert McKechnie, 55, first fell ill with flu-like symptoms two years ago and despite dozens of tests, X-rays and scans, doctors were baffled. But after pain and stiffness spread to his face, arms and legs, he was finally diagnosed with the neurological disorder last month. Robert McKechnie, 55, has Stiff Person Syndrome which means his muscles are becoming progressively stiffer. He currently needs crutches to get around and fears he will soon have to use a wheelchair . It is thought to affect less than one in a million people. From walking with a stick in November 2012, Mr McKechnie moved onto crutches in January this year and he expects to be in a wheelchair by the end of the year. There is no known cure for SPS, which causes progressively severe muscle stiffness. Experts believe the disease is caused by abnormal antibodies which cause an autoimmune reaction. Mr McKechnie now takes 11 different types of pill four times a day and will next month undergo a plasma exchange in a bid to ‘wash out’ the problematic antibodies. Mr McKechnie, of Paisley, in Renfrewshire, Scotland, said: ‘I’m very worried about the future because I don’t know how this disease is going to affect me. Mr McKechnie thought he had flu when he first developed the condition but within just a few months he required a walking stick. He now has to take 11 different medications four times a day . Mr McKechnie (pictured in 2008 with his grandson, Conor Good, before his illness) is no longer able to work and is afraid of falling over and breaking an arm or hitting his head . ‘I used to be very active. I walked everywhere. Now if I walk to the shops and back, which is about 200 metres, that’s me finished for the whole day. ‘I can’t work. I used to be a chef and I’ve worked in B&Q. In both jobs I was always on my feet. Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare disease of the nervous syndrome. It causes progressively severe muscle stiffness - typically in the spine and lower extremities. It often begins very subtly during a period of emotional stress. Most patients also experience painful muscle spasms that are triggered by stimuli such as a sudden noise or emotional stress. There is thought to be an auto-immune component and many patients also have other auto-immune conditions. Symptoms usually develop in the mid-40s. SPS is extremely rare and is thought to occur in fewer than one person per million. It is more common in women than in men and is linked to diabetes. There is no cure but medications can be taken to relief muscle spasms. In extreme cases, the condition can be fatal if it paralyses the respiratory muscles. Sufferers also often fall over and can suffer severe injuries as a result. In most cases, however, symptoms can usually be well managed with medication. ‘But I’m starting to fall over now. I . get up and my feet and legs feel numb and I can’t walk. I’m worried that . I’m going to fall and hit my head. ‘I stand up from my chair and I can feel all the muscles tighten in my legs. ‘Recently I’ve started dropping things, like cups of tea. My left hand goes numb. It’s very worrying.’ Mr McKechnie suffers numbness on the left hand side of his face, his left hand and both legs. Nights are especially painful as he gets ‘dead legs’ and excruciating foot and leg cramps. He first became ill in July 2012 and thought it was just a flu bug but by November he was walking with a stick. Walking became increasingly painful for him and this January he was given crutches, but finds them painful to use and is worried that he will fall and break an arm. Now he is coming to terms with the prospect of being in a wheelchair by the end of the year. He said: ‘There’s no cure and if the last year or so is anything to go by it’s only going to get worse. ‘I used to be so active. I loved running and playing football, but now I am looking at getting around in a wheelchair. ‘It’s terrible. I try to stay positive but it’s difficult because Stiff Person Syndrome is so rare and there doesn’t seem to be any chance of a cure any time soon.’ Professor Hugh Willison, Professor of Neurology at the University of Glasgow, said: ‘Stiff Person Syndrome is a very rare disease. It’s not a condition that neurologists come across very often. Mr McKechnie suffers numbness on the left hand side of his face, his left hand and both legs. Nights are especially painful as he gets 'dead legs' and excruciating foot and leg cramps . Mr McKechnie (pictured with his daughter, Evette Good, in 2009 - before his illness) said: 'There's no cure and if the last year or so is anything to go by it's only going to get worse' ‘Because of its rarity, it can be extremely difficult to diagnose and there can be a considerable delay between the display of symptoms and its diagnosis.’ He said SPS is caused by the malfunction of neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, which lead to uncontrollable nerve activity, causing muscle spasms. Professor Willison added: ‘In its most severe form, the symptoms that can occur in SPS can be so severe that the individual is completely incapacitated. ‘In the most extreme manifestation, the person can go as rigid as a block of wood and that can affect movement and things like breathing and eating.’","Robert McKechnie has the neurological condition Stiff Person Syndrome .

"By . Emma Innes . A woman was forced to wait for four hours in hospital without her partner while suffering her fourth miscarriage - and surrounded by women waiting for abortions. Chantelle Skinner had to listen to young girls waiting for a termination, who were saying they did not want their babies, while she was distraught at losing hers. The grieving woman's partner and mother were not able to comfort her while she waited after she was informed that it was a full clinic that morning and that no visitors were allowed. Chantelle Skinner, 25, went to hospital after suffering her fourth miscarriage. She says she was forced to wait in a ward with people discussing optional miscarriages. She is pictured with her partner, James Settle . Because Ms Skinner, from Withernsea, East Yorkshire, is 25 she was not allowed to have support from her partner, James Settle, 27, or her mother, teaching assistant Karen Skinner, 46, at a time when she needed it most. Ms Skinner, who, like her partner, is in the navy, has written a letter to Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, who run the Hull and East Yorkshire Women and Children’s Hospital, complaining about the insensitive treatment. She wrote: 'I was sitting with girls having terminations - they had support from relatives yet I was not choosing to terminate my baby. 'I was going through the heartbreak of losing a wanted baby and was denied support from my partner and mum when it was needed most. 'The baby was not just mine, it was my partner’s too. He felt helpless as it was, but not being able to be there holding my hand and support me made him feel worse. 'To be sitting by my bed from 7.30am until it was my turn for surgery at about 11.30am was agonising.' Ms Skinner, who is in the navy, says that while she was at the hospital she was also surrounded by mothers coming and going with their new babies when she had just lost hers . Ms Skinner (pictured with her mother) has written a letter of complaint to Hull and East Yorkshire Women and Children's Hospital but says that all of the people who treated her were excellent . Ms Skinner has had three previous miscarriages. On one occasion she was at the same hospital but was in a private ward and had her family by her side. But this time her sadness was magnified by being alone in an inappropriate environment. She said: 'I was on ward 30 where all the young girls were talking about how they didn’t want the baby. 'I also had to see people walking in and out of hospital with their new babies, when I’d lost mine. 'There were also pictures all over of new babies and happy parents and it just made me feel awful. Ms Skinner said: 'I was on ward 30 where all the young girls were talking about how they didn't want the baby. I also had to see people walking in and out of hospital with their new babies, when I'd lost mine' 'It’s like putting Rapunzel in front of women going through chemo, you just don’t do it. 'No one should have to go through that.' Ms Skinner's baby had died and she had to go to the hospital for surgery to remove the dead foetus and the pregnancy tissue. Now Ms Skinner and her partner are saving for tests to see if they can get to the bottom of why she keeps having miscarriages. NHS tests so far has shown everything is normal. After suffering three previous early miscarriages Ms Skinner had hoped this pregnancy would be successful but a scan at nine weeks on March 6 showed the baby’s heart had stopped. The hospital has said it is unable to comment on the case because of patient confidentiality . She went for the procedure the following day. A spokesperson for Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are unable to comment specifically on the care Ms Skinner received for reasons of patient confidentiality. 'However, we can confirm we have received a letter from her, we are looking into her concerns, and will respond directly to her in due course.'","Chantelle Skinner, 25, went to hospital after her fourth miscarriage .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Psychologists have created a real 'thinking cap' (pictured) that can be used to help people learn new and difficult material more quickly . From students cramming for exams to adults wishing they had the answer to a difficult question, most people would love a quick way of becoming smarter. And now scientists have created a real ‘thinking cap’ that helps people solve problems more quickly and could one day help us learn new and difficult material more easily. U.S. psychologists have managed to manipulate our ability to learn using a mild electrical current to the brain, which can make people learn from their mistakes more effectively – or equally make them more prone to mishaps and confusion. Previous research has shown that the medial-frontal cortex - which is the part of the brain responsible for spotting mistakes - emits a spike of negative voltage within milliseconds of us recognising that we have done something incorrectly. But it didn’t explain why. Psychologists Robert Reinhart and Professor Geoffrey Woodman at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, explored the function of the brainwaves. Mr Reinhart, a PhD candidate, said: ‘We wanted to reach into your brain and causally control your inner critic.’ They came up with a headband with two electrodes attached to the check and crown of a person’s head, to which they applied 20 minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to each willing participant in the experiment. In tDCS, a mild direct current travels from the anodal electrode, through the skin, muscle, bones and brain and out through the corresponding cathodal electrode to complete the circuit, according to the study, which is published in the Journal of Neuroscience. ‘It’s one of the safest ways to noninvasively stimulate the brain,’ Mr Reinhart said, before explaining that the subjects only reported a few seconds of tingling or itching at the beginning of each stimulation session. Each participant took part in three sessions: one where the current was travelling from the electrode on the crown of the head to the one on the cheek, one where it was travelling in the opposite direction and another where there was no stimulation to the brain, but the subjects felt a ‘sham’ tingling sensation. Participants were unable to tell the difference between the three conditions. No more cramming for exams? As well as helping people learn new and complex information more easily at college (pictured), the 'thinking hat' could one day be used to treat conditions like schizophrenia and ADHD, which are associated with performance-monitoring deficits . Participants took part in three sessions where they wore the 'thinking cap', which had electrodes linked to a person's crown and cheek. In one session the current was travelling from the electrode on the crown to the one on the cheek, in another it was travelling in the opposite direction and in another where there was no stimulation to the brain. After 20 minutes of stimulation, subjects were given a learning task. The researchers measured the electrical brain activity of each participant when they made a mistake, which let them determine how brain activities changed under the influence of electrical stimulation. When anodal current (travelling from the electrode on the crown of the head to the cheek) was applied the spike was almost twice as large on average. People made fewer errors and learned from their mistakes more quickly than they did without any electrical stimulation. When cathodal current (travelling in the opposite direction) was applied, the spike was significantly smaller and the subjects made more errors and took longer to learn the task, effectively becoming more stupid. After 20 minutes of stimulation, subjects were given a learning task that involved working out by trial and error which buttons on a game controller corresponded to specific colours displayed on a monitor. For added difficulty, participants had just one second to respond correctly, providing many chances to make errors and therefore opportunities for the medial-frontal cortex to fire. The researchers measured the electrical brain activity of each participant, which allowed them to watch as the brain changed at the very moment participants were making mistakes and most importantly, allowed them to determine how these brain activities changed under the influence of electrical stimulation. When anodal current (travelling from the electrode on the crown of the head to the cheek) was applied to the ‘thinking hat’ the spike was almost twice as large on average. Consequently, people made fewer errors and learned from their mistakes more quickly than they did without any electrical stimulation. When cathodal current (travelling in . the opposite direction from the electrode on the cheek to the crown) was . applied, the researchers observed the opposite result. The . spike was significantly smaller and the subjects made more errors and . took longer to learn the task, effectively becoming more stupid. ‘So . when we up-regulate that process, we can make you more cautious, less . error-prone, more adaptable to new or changing situations, which is . pretty extraordinary,’ Mr Reinhart said. Previous research has shown that the medial-frontal cortex - which is the part of the brain responsible for spotting mistakes - emits a spike of negative voltage within milliseconds of us recognising that we have done something incorrectly. A CAT scan of the human head is pictured . The effect was not noticeable to the subjects because their error rates only varied about four percent either way and their behaviour adjusted by a matter of only 20 milliseconds, but they were plain to see on the EEG, or electroencephalogram that records the brain's electrical activity. ‘This success rate is far better than that observed in studies of pharmaceuticals or other types of psychological therapy,’ said Professor Woodman. The researchers found that the effects of a 20 minute stimulation lasted about five hours and made participants marginally better or worse in other tasks. As well as improving learning, the findings of the experiment could one day be used to treat conditions like schizophrenia and ADHD, which are associated with performance-monitoring deficits.","Psychologists at Vanderbilt University used an electrical current to the brain to enable people learn from their mistakes more effectively .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, pictured, has invested in artificial intelligence firm Vicarious . Some of the most entrepreneurial minds in the world are joining forces to help a small tech startup create a digital brain. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla owner Elon Musk join the likes of PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel, actor Ashton Kutcher and Facebook’s co-founder Dustin Moskovitz by investing in San Francisco-based Vicarious. The startup wants to create software that ‘thinks and learns like a human’, and to do that, the firm is attempting to build a program that mimics the brain’s neocortex. According to reports in the Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg, Musk and Kutcher have invested a total of $40million (£24million) in the company. Thiel reportedly invested $1.2 million (£727,000) in 2010, while Moskovitz was said to have added $15million (£9million) to the fund. The neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals. It is approximately 3mm thick and has six layers, each involved with various functions. These include sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language in humans. According to the company’s website: ‘Vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain. ‘Our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans. ‘Powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the Recursive Cortical Network.’ The San Francisco-based startup wants to create software that 'thinks and learns like a human'. To do this the firm is attempting to build a program that mimics the brain's neocortex, which is responsible for thought, spatial reasoning and language in humans. Stock image pictured .

Vicarious founder Scott Phoenix told the Wall Street Journal if the firm is successful with its current project, the company will . have created 'a computer that thinks like a person except it doesn't . need to eat or sleep.' A Facebook spokesperson said Zuckerberg’s investment was ‘personal’, and was not affiliated with the company. Peter Thiel said: ‘Vicarious is bringing us all closer to a future where computers perceive, imagine, and reason just like humans.’ And Dustin Moskovitz added: ‘The technology that Vicarious is developing has the potential to improve all lives and revolutionise every industry.’ In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘reliably’ solves modern Captchas - the world’s most widely used test of a machine’s ability to act human. Captchas are used when filling in forms, for example, to make sure it’s not being completed by a bot. This prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets, for example. A Captcha scheme is considered broken if an algorithm is able to reach a precision of at least 1 per cent. By using research into so-called machine learning - in which a machine can learn from its mistakes - and neuroscience, the Vicarious artificial intelligence achieved success rates up to 90 per cent on modern Captchas from Google, Yahoo, PayPal, Captcha.com, and others. Company founder Scott Phoenix told the Wall Street Journal if the firm is successful with its current project, Vicarious will have created ‘a computer that thinks like a person except it doesn't need to eat or sleep.'","San Francisco startup Vicarious is building software designed to mimic the behaviour of the brain's neocortex .

"By . Mark Prigg . If you've ever doubted the reach of Disney's most popular character, astronomers have spotted mickey Mouse on another planet. Photographer Damian Peach was trying to capture storms on the planet when he spotted a familiar face. The three circular storms were perfectly arranged to form the outline of the much-loved character's face. Scroll down for video . Disney's far reach: A full view of Jupiter on February 25, 2014 showing several features including three storms that in combination look like Mickey Mouse. The fifth planet out from the Sun, Jupiter is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined. It is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a 'gas giant'. The fourth brightest object in the solar system, only the Sun, Moon and Venus are brighter. It is 120 time bigger than Earth. Experts say the planet is going through  a particularly stormy phase. 'We told you this was going to be a good season to observe Jupiter, and astrophotographers in the northern hemisphere have been making the most of this time of opposition where Jupiter has been riding high in the sky,' said Universe Today. According to the photographer Damian Peach, Mickey is actually 'two anticyclones (high pressure regions) that form the ears while a longer elongated cyclone (low pressure) forms the face.' Damian Peach captured several views of the Mickey Mouse storm . The abundance of storms on Jupiter are a result of the planet’s dense atmosphere of hydrogen and helium and large gravitational field, experts say. Storms on this planet are likely the strongest in the Solar System. One, the Great Red Spot, is a huge storm on Jupiter, and has raged for at least 350 years. It is so large that three Earths could fit inside it. The upper atmosphere of Jupiter is divided into cloud belts and zones. They are made primarily of ammonia crystals, sulfur, and mixtures of the two compounds. Jupiter reached its most northern point for 2014 at a declination of +23.3 degrees on March 11, but it’s still easily visible since it is the brightest starlike object in the evening sky.","Storms on Jupiter known to be among the strongest in the solar system .

"By . Mark Prigg . Facebook has created an algorithm that can pick a face out of a crowd almost as accurately as a human. Called DeepFace, it uses technology the firm bought when it acquired Israeli startup face.com last year. Its creators say it pick a face out of a crowd with 97.25 per cent accuracy. DeepFace uses a 3-D model to rotate faces, virtually, so that they face the camera. Image (a) shows the original image, and (g) shows the final, corrected version which the software can then attempt to recognise. Yaniv Taigman and colleagues at Facebook's AI lab found a way to build a 3D model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for the algorithm to start matching. They then used a neural network that had been trained on a massive database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images, containing more than 4000 separate identities, each one labelled by humans. 'We revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network,' the team wrote. The system can now identify faces at virtually the same level of accuracy as a human . The team achieved 97.25 per cent accuracy on the test data that contained more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. A test using real people recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site managed 97.5 per cent. Details will be presented at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Columbus, Ohio, in June. Experts say Facebook could use it to identify all of a user's real friends are. 'They could identify every one of your friends in all of your photos,' Christopher Kanan of the California Institute of Technology told New Scientist. 'This would let them know who your real friends are – people you actually hang out with in the real world.'","DeepFace was trained by analysing pictures uploaded to Facebook .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . New parents to a sick baby staged their wedding in hospital so they could be together for the event as a family. Amber Brunell, 23, and Joshua Fox, 24, from Bangor, Pennsylvania, tied the knot last Thursday in the intensive care unit at St. Christopher's Hospital where their son, Lucas, is being monitored. The infant was born weighing a healthy 9lbs 11oz on February 21 but shortly after birth an ultrasound revealed he had an obstruction in his intestines which was causing discomfort and required surgery. Scroll down for video . Together as a family: Amber Brunell, 23, and Joshua Fox, 24, staged their wedding in hospital so their sick baby could be part of the big event . Although the operation went well, he then developed an air leak in his left lung. A tube was placed his chest to remedy the situation but when his oxygen levels did not improve further intervention was needed.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Scientists in Canada are looking for a meteorite that may have struck in the southwestern part of Ontario after a huge fireball was seen streaking across the sky on Tuesday night. Seven video cameras run by the University of Western Ontario captured the amazing sight at 10:24p local time. One of the cameras located in Aylmer, Ontario, not far from Lake Erie, shows the giant fireball, at times getting bigger and brighter as it moved across the sky. Scroll down for video . A bright fireball seen streaking across the night sky above Aylmer, Ontario on Tuesday night . The fireball was also caught on two cameras in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Researchers at the university say the meteorite was about the size of a basketball. It was traveling 75 kilometers (46 miles) above the earth's surface at a speed of 14 kilometer per second (slightly under 9 miles). Although the meteorite has yet to be found, scientists believe fragments may have landed just north of St. Thomas, Ontario. A map shows the path the fireball took as well as where the meteorite might have landed . Meteorities have a dark, scalloped exterior, but are denser than normal rocks. Also, they can attract magnets due to their metal content. More information on the meterorite may come today as two university researchers along with the head of NASA's Meteroid Environment office provide an update to the media.

"By . Sarah Gordon . Climate change could cause a tourism boom in the Arctic, with cruise ships benefitting from melting ice caps giving them increased access to the area, according to a leaked UN report. The draft report - which has been dubbed 'alarmist' by one British author involved - claims climate change could help the grey and killer whale populations and increase whale-watching trips to the area. It will also mean longer summer seasons, with ships being able to pass through key areas which are often frozen for much of the year, according to the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). New routes: Cruise ships could benefit from the melting ice caps in the Arctic region, the controversial UN report has claimed . The Northern Sea Route, above Siberia, and Northwest Passage, above the US and Canada, will be open for a total of 125 days a year by 2050. Currently, the waterways are only clear of ice for around 50 days a year. The melted ice will mean a more easily navigable shortcut between Asia and Europe, according to the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). And cruise ships will be able to benefit by running more tours to countries including Greenland and Canada. However, tourists on those ships won't be able to see polar bears in their natural habitat - which are in grave danger of disappearing in certain areas as Earth warms - or witness the traditions of the Inuit people, who stand to lose their hunting customs due to changes in their environment. Local wildlife: While there will be more cruises, the chances to spot endangered species like polar bears will become more limited . The report, which is currently being drafted by scientists in Japan ahead of being released official, states: 'Loss of sea ice may open up waterways and opportunities for increased cruise traffic and add to an already rapid increase in cruise tourism.' It adds: 'Climate change has increased the prevalence of cruise tourism throughout Greenland, Norway, Alaska and Canada because of decreasing sea ice.' The IPCC will publish its first update in seven years on the impacts of climate change and scientists have been meeting this week to agree the wording of the final document, which will be used to inform policy decisions of governments around the world. Opportunity: There will be more cruise opportunities for tourists and chance to spot whales, says the report . However, Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, said fellow UN academics were exaggerating climate change and comparing it to the ‘apocalypse’. He has since refused to put his name to the report. Arctic cruises have increased in popularity in recent years, with more and more ships plying the northern waterways and reaching areas that can't yet be discovered by plane and car.","Waterways will be clear of ice for longer summers by 2050 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Leaving your seat at half-time during an Ohio State football game is never a good idea, because there’s every chance you’ll miss out on a world-class spectacle. It’s at half-time that The Ohio State University Marching Band strut their superbly choreographed stuff and their latest performance – a tribute to Michael Jackson’s Bad album, released 25 years ago – entirely justified their claim to be The Best Damn Band in the Land. During Saturday’s game against the University of Iowa, the band’s 225 musicians played a medley of hits, including the title track, Billie Jean, The Way You Make Me Feel and Man in the Mirror – but it was the formations that provided the wow factor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Good to be bad: The Ohio State University Marching Band spell out the name of Michael Jackson's hit album . Spectacle: It's probably best not to leave your seat for too long during an Ohio State football game . Tribute: The Marching Band played a medley of Michael Jackon's hits . Moving and shaking: Perhaps the best moment was when the Band formed an outline of Michael Jackson and moonwalked across the pitch . They seamlessly moved from one to the other - at one point forming the word ‘Bad’ and the crown that adorns the album cover. The most impressive moment, though, arrived during Billie Jean, when the band formed an image of Michael Jackson himself, complete with a white glove – and then moonwalked. Footage of the clip, posted to YouTube, has gone viral, with over two million views to date. Unsurprisingly, internet users have been heaping praise on the performance. James McCallum said: ‘I've been in a marching band in my life. This is totally awesome! I'd rate this as one of the BEST videos EVER to hit YouTube! Congratulations to the OSU Band! Very IMPRESSED! Especially the Moon Walk across the field. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!' Sally B, meanwhile, wrote: ‘A fitting tribute to the The King. Incredible performance by the OSU- the precision, creativity and wow moment was just unbelievable!' And Chase Krogh posted this comment: ‘Blew my mind. The most insane thing I have ever seen a marching band do!!!’ The band’s previous half-time performances have included tributes to hit video games, with music from the likes of Halo and Pokemon, and The Beatles.","The Band performed a medley of hits with ever-changing formations .

"By . Carol Driver . A cliff-edge hotel could collapse into the sea as coastal erosion has been wearing away the land at a rate of a metre a month. The Blue Anchor Hotel, parts of which date back to the 15th century, has been forced to close its children’s garden play area that backs on to the cliffs, which are crumbling at a dangerous rate. Recent flooding, rough seas and heavy rain have accelerated the issue, with locals fearing if nothing is done to stop the erosion, the hotel and pub, in the tourist town of Blue Anchor, West Somerset, could be lost into the sea. Scroll down for video... At risk: The Blue Anchor Hotel in Minehead could be lost to coastal erosion . Wearing away: The pub backs on to cliffs which are crumbling due to sea erosion . Simon Strom, landlord of the Blue Anchor Hotel, said: ‘Over the last two or three months we've lost three or four metres. It's quite scary. ‘If they don't shore it up we've just got to sit here until the hotel falls in.’ Plans costing £570,000 to improve sea defences submitted to the Environment Agency by Somerset County Council have been turned down. Mr Strom, who has run the hotel in Blue Anchor for 15 years, said coastal erosion has taken its toll on the land for the past seven years – with three metres lost in just two weeks in 2012. Danger: The hotel was forced to close its children's play area which backs onto the cliffs . He said: ‘We are 100 per cent sure the land will come down – it’s just a case of when. There is no way it can be salvaged now. ‘We are concerned about public safety and would advise people not to go anywhere near it.’ Mr Strom, who lives at the property with his wife and three children, added: ‘There is no funding to sort it out, so I am in limbo. You don’t know what the sea or weather is going to do.’ Warning: The hotel has reduced the size of its beer garden due to the erosion . Chris Hall, West Somerset council spokesman, said: ‘If we were to do nothing, the hotel is at risk. The timeline is difficult, but I'd say around five years. ‘Eventually, if nothing were to happen, according to the erosion work we’ve had done, there would be the loss of the hotel. The foundations would be destablised. ‘The coastline is a moving feast.’ The council is due to discuss the Environment Agency proposals at a cabinet meeting on April 2, to decide whether to resubmit the plans.","Blue Anchor Hotel closed children's play area which backs on to cliff .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . David Beckham’s plans to build a football stadium in Miami have been opposed by cruise company Royal Caribbean. The football star wants to build a stadium for his new Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise in the U.S. city and his preferred site is near PortMiami, one of the world’s busiest harbours. But the proposed 12-acre site is close to Royal Caribbean's headquarters. David Beckham at an event in Miami in February - the star plans to build a stadium for his MLS franchise . In a blog on its website, Royal Caribbean said it had ‘deep reservations’ to the plans and revealed that it had tabled an objection. The company said it was concerned about traffic but it also has its own plans to develop the site that Beckham and his investors have pinpointed. The cruise company’s headquarters overlaps with the blueprint for the proposed stadium on the waterfront. Grand designs: A Royal Caribbean cruise ship docked near Miami, where the company has its headquarters . Royal Caribbean said its existing car . park, daycare centre and employee gym would have to move to make way . for a stadium that could contain between 25,000 and 40,000 seats. But the blog said the port’s southwest corner was too shallow to accommodate cruise or cargo ships. Royal Caribbean vice president and . chief communications officer Rob Zeiger said: ‘We have deep reservations . about using this port as a location for a stadium.’ New venture: Beckham takes part in a game of footvolley on Sao Conrado beach in Rio de Janeiro last week . Meanwhile, the Miami Herald reported that the port’s director, Bill Johnson, had pitched the site in Asia, revealing possible plans for a 36-acre commercial complex with hotels, apartments and offices to business leaders. Mr Johnson told the Miami Herald: ‘What we were doing was to literally start to garner interest globally. ‘We were upfront. We said there was a recent interest expressed by David Beckham about a soccer stadium, and that would be addressed in the next six months.’ Prime real estate: PortMiami is one of the world's busiest ports . The former England captain has big plans for his MLS franchise and is looking into other potential sites for the planned stadium. The 38-year-old said he wanted to recruit some of ‘the best players’ and plans to build a world-class stadium to host his franchise. He called his latest venture ‘a dream’ and said: ‘We're planning to bring a team that will be a global team. I . want to create a team that we can start from scratch and I am going to . work hard for this city to make this team very successful. It is an . exciting time.' The final planning decision rests with Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez and 12 commissioners.","The football star plans to build a 25,000 and 40,000-seat stadium .

"By . Charles Sale . Double Grand National-winning jockey Carl Llewellyn is set to face disciplinary action by the British Horseracing Authority for making a racist comment on the eve of the Cheltenham Festival. Llewellyn, now assistant trainer to Nigel Twiston-Davies, can expect to be charged today for conduct prejudicial to the reputation of horseracing. This follows his observation that ‘there are no n****** in here’ while sitting on a preview panel at the Hollow Bottom pub near Cheltenham in front of 140 racing fans. Disciplinary action: Carl Llewellyn made a racist comment on the eve of the Cheltenham festival . Happy times: Llewellyn winning the Grand National at Aintree on Earth Summit back in 1998 . The upcoming charge comes after a thorough investigation by the BHA, who waited until Gloucester Police, who questioned Llewellyn under caution, had completed their inquiries. They are taking no action because no official complaint was made. Racing can be an insular sport but the BHA were galvanised into action by Cheltenham guest Helen Grant, the Minister for Sport. She was ‘appalled and shocked by the use of this horrific racist word’, calling Llewellyn’s  language ‘absolutely indefensible’. Llewellyn is likely to face a BHA disciplinary panel the week after next Saturday’s Grand National, with the punishment for the offence ranging from a fine to a ban from the sport. Indefensible: Minister of Sport and Equalities Helen Grant slammed the former jockey . Premier League referee Andre Marriner, fortunate to be officiating on Saturday after wrongly sending off Arsenal’s Kieran Gibbs, has also escaped censure for breaching rules banning officials from talking to the media about match incidents. Marriner revealed he had been ‘knocked for six’ after dismissing Gibbs rather than Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and had ‘analysed it to death’. But the Professional Game Match Officials Board will take no action against Marriner because he didn’t realise a journalist was present at a talk to young players about refereeing at an event backed by the PFA. Sir Alex Ferguson’s presence at most Manchester United matches must be hard enough for his beleaguered successor David Moyes . But at least Sir Alex has stopped going to the training ground, where he liked to use United’s state-of-the-art gym. And unlike other directors Sir Bobby Charlton, David Gill and Mike Edelson, Fergie keeps out of the dressing room after games. The wheels of justice move painfully slowly at Wembley, with still no FA decision on whether Tranmere boss Ronnie Moore will face a charge six weeks after being suspended by his club. This follows Sports Agenda’s revelation that Moore was under investigation for allegedly breaching betting regulations by gambling on competitions involving Tranmere. Nike put shirt on Wayne . England talisman Wayne Rooney, who has a central role in Nike’s World Cup TV commercial, is also likely to be centre stage when the US firm launch two new England shirts next week. Nike are expected to use social media for their campaign, drip-feeding information about the kit at the start of the week leading up to a grand unveiling on Wednesday. However slick the Nike promotion, there will be understandable outrage that England fans are being milked for four different shirts in just over a year. Nike promise a normal production cycle after the World Cup with the home shirt staying the same for two years. Lucky: Andre Marriner, guilty of wrongly sending off Kieran Gibbs last week, has been cleared if punishment after some of his quotes reported by media . Boost? Relief for David Moyes, as at least Sir Alex Ferguson has stopped using Manhester United's gym facilities . Main man: Wayne Rooney will be the star of Nike's advertising campaign for the World Cup . The FA Council are certain to turn down Hull City owner Assem Allam’s bid to change the name of his team to Hull Tigers at their summit on April 9. So it will make for an interesting lunch at Wembley three days later when Allam, who has said he will walk away from the club if he doesn’t get his way, is due to dine with the blazers before Hull’s  FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United.

"By . Hugo Gye . They say that the property market is all about 'location, location, location' - and this modest bungalow could prove the saying right. Not only did the small house sell for an extraordinary £1.5million, but when it was demolished the empty plot went back on the market for double the price. But in the so-called 'Millionaires' Row' of Sandbanks, Dorset, £3million is considered a perfectly reasonable price to pay for an tiny patch of scrubland - as long as it comes with planning permission attached. Sold: This bungalow was bought for £1.5million before being promptly demolished by the buyer . Gone: The one-acre plot is now standing completely empty - but it is set to sell for £3million because it has planning permission attached . Replacement: Architects' plans show how the space will be filled by a modernist five-bedroom home worth £5million . Close-up: The house is set to include five en-suite bedrooms, a home cinema and a gym . Poole Harbour, where the house is located, is the fourth most expensive place in the world for residential property and 'blank canvas' plots like this one are hugely sought-after. It would cost up to £1million pounds to build the three-storey home from plan, and when it is complete the five-bedroom property will have a market value of £5million. The land is likely to be bought by a developer - or a millionaire with the time and money to build their dream home. Alternatively, the estate agents are marketing the property as a 'turnkey' proposition where a buyer can pay £5million pounds and move straight into the house after it is built. Work in progress: The site is currently boarded off but is nonetheless on the market for £3million . Scrubland: In the bizarre world of the Sandbanks property market, empty plots can be more valuable than actual houses . Potential: The plot's value comes from its strategic position overlooking the sea in the exclusive resort . The site is in a small cul-de-sac called The Horseshoe, where until recently England cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott owned a house. It overlooks Poole Harbour, enjoys direct access to the waters and even has its own private beach. It is just around the corner from football manager Harry Redknapp's house. The house that was demolished was a three-bedroom bungalow dating back to the 1920s that neighbours said was in a 'good state of repair.' It was built in the 1920s. The Horseshoe contains nine properties, all of which directly back on to Poole Harbour, but only one of them has so far been redeveloped into a modern, luxury home to match the profile of the area's new ultra-rich residents. Interior: The open-plan living space envisaged for the home will give excellent views of Poole Harbour . Entrance: The modern design is in stark contrast to the traditional ambience seen before . Night-time: An artist's impression of how the home will look after dark . Estate . agents Tailor Made describe the land sale as a 'superb opportunity to . build your own bespoke beachside home on the world renowned Sandbanks . peninsula.' Adrian . Dunford, of Tailor Made, said Sandbanks is a unique location where . 'blank canvas' sites are more attractive and valuable than the house . already on them. 'We are in an area where residental properties are very much viewed for their plot value,' he said. 'It is about the potential of the plot rather than what is already on it. 'Knocking a house down and getting planning permission for a new one gives the property a much greater value than before, no matter how old or new the house. Desirable: It is the position of the house on the edge of Poole Harbour which explains its inflated price tag . Looking out: The view from the beach out over the harbour . Satellite: This image shows the bungalow located near the beach in Sandbanks . 'If you have the money, you can build your dream home in one of the best locations that there is. 'The market here is moving at a real pace. We have just sold a property for the equivalent of £1,250 per square foot, which is a record.' Poole Borough Council have approved plans for a brand new house with five en-suite bedrooms, open plan living space, a home cinema and a gymnasium. Outside there is room for a double garage, a boat store, four mooring spaces and a rear terrace with spectacular harbour views. Plan: A diagram showing the layout of the house, including the home cinema where the lucky buyer can relax . Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, perched on a peninsula at the mouth of Poole Harbour near Bournemouth. Every . home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, . with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the . English Channel. The . property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past . few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with . cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' reputation has continued to grow. £3million can get you nothing more than an empty lot in the ultra-exclusive resort of Sandbanks in Dorset. But . elsewhere, that sum could get you a lot further - for £3million you . could buy a Scottish mansion, a London townhouse, a Lucian Freud . painting or the world's most expensive car. Town house: This home near London's Borough Market became Britain's most expensive council house when it was sold for £3million; it was subsequently taken over by squatters . Scottish mansion: The Frognal estate in Troon, South Ayrshire, was bought by record lottery winner Colin and Christine Weir for £3million, having previously been run as a hotel . Masterpiece: Head on a Green Sofa, a 1961 portrait of Belinda Lambton by Lucian Freud which the artist considered one of his greatest works, was bought at auction last month for just under £3million . Sports car: The Lamborghini Veneno is the most expensive car ever built, with a sticker price of £2.8million; only three were ever produced, and each one found a buyer .","1920s three-bedroom home was bought for £1.5million only to be promptly demolished by a property developer .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Missouri man who gunned down a 4-year-old girl while doing target practice in his yard won't face charges and has the child's merciful mother to thank. The Christian County Prosecutor decided early this month not to file charges against an unnamed 24-year-old man in the death of Zoie Dougan of Branson after her mother Alyssa Dougan pleaded with them not to. Dougan said the man had no idea Zoie was in front of his .22 caliber rifle October 28 as he took aim at a pile of trash, pulled the trigger and put a bullet in her head. Tragic: Alyssa Dougan's daughter Zoie, pictured, was tragically gunned down in October by a man shooting at trash. Even in the aftermath, Dougan pleaded with authorities not to press charges against her daughter's unnamed shooter . Zoie died en route to a hospital in Springfield, reports News-Leader.com. She'd been playing with friends at a home in Rogersville as her young mother and another woman painted a headboard outside. Meanwhile, the man next door had loaded his gun and decided to 'sight' the firearm by shooting at a glass bottle 70 feet away on a pile of trash meant to be burned. In that moment, reports reveal, little Zoie took off running toward a swingset with another child. The next thing anyone knew, she was lying in the grass and bleeding form the head. The man would later claim he'd closed one eye while aiming and never saw the girl at all. Shattered peace: The pastoral scene where little Zoie was gunned down in the grass as she and a friend ran toward a swing set . So sad: Zoie reportedly ran into the man's sites the moment he pulled the trigger of his .22 caliber rifle, putting a bullet in her head . After the women heard the shot and saw Zoie in the grass, chaos broke out as the little girl failed to respond to her mother's calls. ‘This can’t be real,' witnesses report Alyssa screaming when the horrific reality of the situation became clear. ‘Why?’ She also spoke words at the scene that she'd presumably repeat to county prosecutor Amy Fite: . ‘Don’t let (him) get in trouble, it was an accident,' Alyssa said. Wrenching: Alyssa was present during the terrible tragedy and told police at the scene that the shooting was an accident . Reports say the man was distraught and muttered in disbelief in the aftermath. '(The man) was crying and emotionally upset as he described the chain of events, claiming it was a complete accident,' the report said. He also told officers he knew shooting at that location 'wasn’t good judgment. I understand that.' He was arrested on an outstanding warrant, but has since walked free. While the man won't be found legally at fault in the case, the report does indicate the 'the direction he was firing the weapon was extremely dangerous' and that he did it, nonetheless, out of 'carelessness.'","Zoie Dougan died en route to a Missouri hospital in October .

"By . Rebecca Evans . Selfie has been named the word of 2013, beating tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming. Editors from Oxford Dictionaries, which made it their Word of 2013, said the word has evolved from a niche social media tag into a mainstream term for a self-portrait photograph. One of the most famous selfies this year was the Pope posing with teenagers at the Vatican. The picture went viral on social media and was widely speculated as being the first ever 'Papal selfie'. Famous faces: Pope Francis posed with a group of teenagers for this so-called 'papal selfie' An eye-brow raising selfie was taken by Samantha Cameron’s sister on the morning of her wedding day, revealing David Cameron napping on a four-poster bed in the background. And selfies hit the headlines this week when a woman from Plymouth claimed that a burglar had broken into her flat and taken a selfie on her phone. The woman subsequently realised she had invited this man in for coffee. Oxford said the earliest known usage is an Australian online forum post from 2002: 'Um, drunk at a mates 21st, I tripped ofer [sic] and landed lip first (with front teeth coming a very close second) on a set of steps. I had a hole about 1cm long right through my bottom lip. And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie.' Slumber: David Cameron's sister-in-law posted this selfie, including the Prime Minister taking a power nap . Unnerving:  A woman, known only as Susan, thought this man had broken into her home and taken selfie on her phone. It later turned out she knew the man . A number of spin-off terms are also in circulation, such as helfie (a picture of someone’s hair), belfie (a picture of someone’s behind), welfie (a picture of someone working out) and drelfie (a drunken selfie). Judy Pearsall, editorial director for Oxford Dictionaries, said: 'Using the Oxford Dictionaries language research programme, we can see a phenomenal upward trend in the use of selfie in 2013, and this helped to cement its selection as Word of the Year.' She added: 'Social media sites helped to popularise the term, with the hashtag selfie appearing on the photo-sharing website Flickr as early as 2004, but usage wasn’t widespread until around 2012, when selfie was being used commonly in mainstream media sources.' The frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 17,000% since this time last year, according to research conducted by Oxford Dictionaries editors. This figure is calculated by Oxford Dictionaries using a research programme which collects around 150 million English words currently in use from around the web each month. This software can be used to track the emergence of new words and monitor changes in geography, register, and frequency of use. Selfie has not yet been added to the Oxford English Dictionary, although it is being considered for future inclusion. The shortlist for Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2013 included binge-watch (to watch multiple episodes of a television programme in rapid succession), showrooming (the practice of examining a product at a shop before buying it online at a lower price) and twerk (dancing in a sexually provocative manner by thrusting hip movements and adopting a low, squatting stance).","Editors from Oxford Dictionaries made the phrase their Word of 2013 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Hope for pancreatic cancer sufferers: Abraxane . - already licensed for advanced breast cancer - is given as an injection costing £600 a month . A new drug that improves survival in sufferers of pancreatic cancer - one of the most deadly forms of the disease - has been licensed for use in the UK. Abraxane increases survival by two months on average, but some patients are  living up to two years longer. The drug is being hailed as the biggest advance in almost two decades against a  disease that kills four in five sufferers within a year. About 8,500 Britons are diagnosed each year and survival remains the lowest of  all the major cancers. Only . five per cent of patients are still alive five years after diagnosis . and  there has been no improvement in five and 10 year survival rates in . the last 40  years. Tumours . are hard to detect because the pancreas is buried deep in the body so . symptoms emerge when the disease is at an advanced stage. Pancreatic . cancer claimed the lives of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and author . Iain Banks, and was the disease which triggered the character Hayley . Cropper in  TV’s Coronation Street to end her own life. The drug, which is already licensed for advanced breast cancer, is given as an  intravenous injection costing £600 a month. Patients . with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with Abraxane and chemotherapy . lived for 8.7 months compared with 6.6 months for those on standard . treatment. Trial data shows that Abraxane, also known as nab-paclitaxel, increases the  number of patients alive after two years. Professor . Juan Valle, consultant oncologist and honorary professor of medical . oncology at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, said ‘Pancreatic cancer . is one  of the most difficult cancers to treat and treatment options . remain extremely  limited, with those diagnosed typically only surviving . for three to six months. ‘Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine represents a significant advance in the  treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer and offers new hope in the battle  against this intractable disease.’ High profile victims of pancreatic cancer: Novelist Iain Banks, left, died of the disease in June last year, while Apple founder and chief executive Steve Jobs, right, succumbed to it in October 2011 . Professor David Cunningham, Director of Clinical Research at The Royal Marsden,  said Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cancer, yet progress in  treating the disease has been limited. ‘One-year survival for patients with pancreatic cancer is still less than 20  per cent and we have waited for many years for an alternative to current  treatments. ‘Today’s news represents a significant step-forward in the treatment of  metastatic pancreatic cancer. ‘It is important that nab-paclitaxel, which has  demonstrated an increase in overall survival, should be available for patients  with this cancer.’ It is the first new medicine licensed for 17 years for the disease and the NHS  rationing watchdog Nice will decide later this year whether it should be funded. But makers Celgene are applying to the Cancer Drugs Fund next month to enable  patents in England to get it in the meantime. Ali Stunt, chief executive of Pancreatic Cancer Action charity, said ‘Abraxane  could really benefit eligible patients in the UK and Ireland. ‘For decades there have been very few treatment options for pancreatic cancer,  therefore this news will be a welcome advance for patients who are at a stage  in their life when time is at an absolute premium.’ Alex Ford, chief executive officer of Pancreatic Cancer UK charity, said ‘The  specialist nurses on our Support Line assist patients and carers with questions  around treatment and care on a daily basis. ‘With so few treatment options available to patients, we know that they want  access to new and effective treatments such as Abraxane.’","Hailed as biggest advance in 20 years in fight against pancreatic cancer .
About 8,500 Britons are diagnosed with the disease every year .
Only 5 per cent of those patients are still alive five years later ."
"By . Emma Innes . After months of tireless fundraising a five-year-old has undergone surgery that will change her life. Lily Ketteringham has cerebral palsy which meant she was unable to walk without a frame. However, she has now had pioneering surgery to enable her to walk normally at St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri, U.S. Lily Ketteringham, five, was born 10 weeks early and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was nine months old. As a result, she was unable to walk without a frame . The surgery, called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) surgery, was only available in the U.S. until recently. It is now being performed at a few hospitals in the UK but according to NICE guidelines Lily's hips are too far out of position for surgeons to operate in this country. Speaking from America, Lily’s father, Steve, said the surgery had gone ‘well’. Lily and her family left the UK on Friday and she underwent the surgery on Tuesday. Mr Ketteringham, 41, of Newcastle, said: ‘The operation went well and there were no problems. Lily had some back spasms last night which was difficult to see. ‘The next few days will be hard for her as it is bed rest.’ Lily's family raised £42,000 for her to fly to the U.S. for pioneering surgery to allow her to walk normally. She is pictured in hospital before the operation which took place on Tuesday . It is hoped that the Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery will allow Lily to walk independently after physiotherapy . Lily, who was born 10 weeks early, hasn't been able to walk or stand unaided since being diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at nine months old. However, her friends and family helped raise £42,000 to allow her to have the SDR surgery. The operation is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. It involves opening the lower vertebrae to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Lily (pictured with her father, Steve) is said to be doing well after the operation . The surgery is available in the UK but Lily's hips were considered to be too far out of position to make the operation possible in this country . During the procedure, electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Mr Ketteringham said: ‘When we met the doctor he assessed Lily and told us she would be an independent walker and will probably take her first steps within a year. ‘Fingers crossed that with hard work it will become the greatest day of our lives.’ Mr Ketteringham and Lily expected to return to the UK on February 23 and Lily will start work with her physiotherapist at the Heel and Toe Charity in County Durham. She will require months, if not years, of physiotherapy to allow her to get the most out of the surgery.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.","Lily Ketteringham was born 10 weeks prematurely and was diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of nine months .

"By . Louise Boyle In Darrington, Washington . The body of Marcy Satterlee has been recovered from the devastating mudslide in Snohomish County, her eldest daughter said today. Nichole Webb Rivera believes that her 61-year-old mother had been found but had no official news yet from the Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office. The mother-of-five told MailOnline today: 'At this point, it is much less tragic to find a body than to find a soul who had been suffering since Saturday.' Recovered: Rivera's mother, Marcy Satterlee, (seen here with her husband Thom) has been found among the debris of the Washington landslide - much to her daughter's relief . Mrs Rivera, 39, who grew up in Darrington, is waiting for news of her father Thom, 65, her daughter Delaney, 20 and Delaney's fiance Alan Bejvl, 21, who also went missing on Saturday when the mile-long mudslide tore through the small town of Oso, an hour north of Seattle. Marcy Satterlee, a grandmother to six, had been married to husband Thom for 41 years and the couple lived in the area for three decades. The Satterlees, who moved to their home on Steelhead Drive in 2012, had planned to spend Saturday, making wedding plans with her grand-daughter Delaney and fiance Alan. Heartbroken: Nichole Webb Rivera learned the horrific news about her daughter and future son-in-law and her parents, Thom and Marcy Satterlee, in a Facebook message from a friend . Mrs Satterlee was beautiful and hysterically funny, her daughter told MailOnline. She was also a talented artist who loved to be outside, working on her garden close to the river. Authorities have found as many as 25 bodies but expect the number of fatalities to rise over the next few days. 90 people are still missing and authorities are unsure whether another 35 were in the area at the time. Rivera was teaching a class when she first found out about the Oso mudslide through a Facebook message from a friend in her home town.Mrs Rivera, 39, who grew up in Darrington, Washington, but now lives in Texas, said that it was a few hours later, after numerous calls went to unanswered, that she realized with growing dread that her daughter Delaney, the 20-year-old's fiance Alan and her parents were among the scores of people missing. Lost: Delaney Webb, 20, and her husband-to-be are listed among the missing and presumed dead in the Washington mudslide . Delaney Webb, 20, and her husband-to-be Alan Bejvl had driven up from their apartment in Everett, Washington, to visit her grandparents Thom and Marcy Satterlee last weekend. The young couple, who got engaged last October, had been planning to go over their summer wedding plans. Mrs Rivera, a mother-of-five, told MailOnline today: 'I stayed up all night listening to a police scanner online. My ex-husband and two sons drove up to Oso when they first heard but were turned back by rescuers. 'By Sunday morning, I knew that I had to be there. I'm the eldest child and Delaney is my oldest daughter, so I bought a one-way ticket.' Although Mrs Rivera said that she always holds on to hope, the reality she believes is that her family are gone. 'We lost four,' she added. Loving couple: In this undated photo provided by Nichole Webb Rivera, Rivera's daughter, Delaney Webb, right, and her fiance, Alan Bejvl, left, are shown . Striking beauty: Delaney's grieving mother described her daughter as the 'most beautiful, sweetest girl with the biggest heart' She described her daughter Delaney as the 'most beautiful, sweetest girl with the biggest heart. I am blessed to have had her for 19 years'. She said that Delaney's fiancé, Alan, who is also from the Snohomish County, 'would be next to the Wikipedia entry for a perfect man.’ 'He was respectful, had a good sense of humor, was a lovely young man. He and my daughter were crazy in love and so happy together,' Mrs Rivera said. 'I'm just grateful that they went together and on a high note in their lives.' Her father, Thom, a Vietnam veteran who spent many years recovering from PTSD, was brilliant with a 'heart the size of that mudslide.’ Mr Satterlee, who had 52 first cousins, even more second cousins and 6 grandchildren, would have helped anyone he could, especially in a disaster situation like this, his daughter said Wednesday. Dashed hopes: The 20-year-old bride was set to . walk down the aisle in the summer, and she traveled to Oso, Washington, . over the weekend to talk about the wedding plans with her grandparents . Marcy Satterlee was remembered by her daughter as beautiful and hysterically funny - 'she would make you wet your pants laughing' - as well as a talented artist who loved to be outside, working on her garden. Mrs Rivera's remarkable show of strength is in part for the sake of those around her. She said her two teenage sons Sam, 17, and Jarron Webb, 14, had said little since the disaster. 'It's hard to tell with teenagers', the mom added. Her sons and their elder sister, Delaney, also just lost their stepmom in January. Delaney also has two other half-sisters who are desperately waiting on any news. Mrs Rivera, who lives in Houston with her husband, Vince, and their son aged five and two-year-old daughter, said that the eldest girl asks constantly for Delaney. Hoping against hope: Nichole Webb Rivera said she knows her daughter is likely among the dead, even though the family are still praying for a miracle . The mother has explained to her that her big sister is missing, to which she responds that 'she doesn't want her sister to be died,’ Mrs Rivera said. She said that the elder members of the family are 'beside themselves with grief,' but that they are praying and coming together to make decisions about what next steps should be taken as they wait for news. Mrs Rivera, who is a textile artist with her own bespoke quilting business, has set up a fundraising page which has raised close to $17,000. Mrs Rivera said that 'in the spirit of my dad who hated bureaucracy' she was organizing to have the money shared directly with those affected by the mudslide tragedy. She said that fundraising was a way she could show her own gratitude to all the volunteers and rescuers in Darrington who have gone out into the field to recover their families, friends and neighbors. Natural disaster: This March 24, 2014 aerial photo released by the U.S. Geological Survey shows the extent and impacts from the March 22 mudslide near Arlington in northwest Washington state . Altered landscape: The slide destroyed a rural community, likely killing at least 24, and left scores missing . Linne Haywood, community volunteer and high school teacher, organizes donations at the Darrington Community Center in Darrington, Wash., on Wednesday, March 26, 2014 . 'We take care of our own, that's what we do up there. People have hearts of gold.'I want  to do something to show that I love them,' she said. Despite her own devastating losses, Mrs Rivera still holds on to her sense of hope. She added: 'I am hopeful that something will come from this whole tragedy. 'It shows that helping people is powerful and it's possible. I'm hopeful the community will recover and thrive and be stronger than before.' Search crews using dogs, bulldozers and their bare hands kept slogging through the mess of broken wood and mud again Wednesday, looking for more bodies or anyone who might still be alive nearly five days after a wall of fast-moving earth destroyed a small rural community. But authorities have acknowledged they might have to leave some victims buried because trying to recover every corpse would be impractical and dangerous. Previously, authorities said they believed they had found 24 bodies from the slide that swept through a rural area north of Seattle on Saturday, though not all had been removed from the area. The debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places, with a moon-like surface that includes quicksand-like muck, rain-slickened mud and ice. The terrain is difficult to navigate on foot and makes it treacherous or impossible to bring in heavy equipment.","Nicole Webb Rivera told MailOnline that the body of her mother, Marcy Satterlee has been recovered .

"By . Mark Prigg . They are an incredible view of lightning as you've never seen it before - from space. Taken by astronauts aboard the International space station as it orbited the Earth, they reveal lightning strikes lighting up the sky. Researchers are now using instruments aboard the space station to try and find out more about lightning and its effects. The photograph above, snapped by an astronaut aboard the International Space Station on December 12, 2013, shows a white flash of lightning amidst the yellow city lights of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Across the atmosphere of Earth, lightning flashes about 50 times per second, 4.3 million times a day and roughly 1.5 billion times a year. The Firestation instrument includes photometers to measure lightning flashes, radio antennas to measure the static (a proxy for the strength of the electrical discharge), and a gamma-ray electron detector. Firestation is observing about 50 lightning strokes per day and looking for brief bursts of gamma rays that are emitted by some of them. Using a new instrument on the International Space Station (ISS), scientists are trying to observe and dissect lightning bolts every day. Installed on the ISS in August 2013, the Firestation instrument includes photometers to measure lightning flashes, radio antennas to measure the static (a proxy for the strength of the electrical discharge), and a gamma-ray electron detector. Firestation is observing about 50 lightning strokes per day and looking for brief bursts of gamma rays that are emitted by some of them. Gamma radiation is usually associated with exploding stars or nuclear fusion, but scientists have found evidence that terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) may occur in the atmosphere as often as 500 times a day. Atmospheric scientists are interested in the processes that trigger lightning within thunderstorms and what kinds of lightning produce gamma rays. TGFs may also be related to the atmospheric phenomena known as red sprites, electrical discharges that extend upward from thunderstorms. 'The fact that TGFs exist at all is amazing,” said Doug Rowland, the principal investigator for Firestation and a space physicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. 'The electron and gamma-ray energies in TGFs are usually the domain of nuclear explosions, solar flares, and supernovas. What a surprise to find them shooting out of the cold upper atmosphere of our own planet.' An astronaut orbiting over Bolivia on the International Space Station captured a close-up of a lightning flash beneath a thunderhead on January 9, 2011 . In a few years, NASA scientists plan to add another lightning sensor to the ISS. The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) was originally designed for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, which was launched in 1997 and is still flying. At the time, the research team from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center built a backup LIS in case of trouble with the main instrument. That spare is still functional and is scheduled to be sent up to the space station in 2016. LIS detects cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning, and it can detect discharges both in daylight and at night. It measures the rate and amount of radiant energy in global lightning strikes. Because the space station flies farther north and south than TRMM, this second LIS instrument will extend lightning measurements beyond the tropics.","Pictures were taken from the International Space Station .

"By . Katy Winter . Working overtime? It might not do your career any favours . You might think that treating the office as your second home and working excessively hard can only bring you success and promotion. However a new study carried out at the University of Padova in Italy has shown that workaholism is detrimental not only to employees’ health, but also their performance in the office. In addition to increasing psychological and physical strain, compulsive overworking decreased job performance and increased absence from work due to illness. A ‘workaholic’ is defined as someone who both works obsessively and compulsively, with both characteristics persistently present at a high level. Working overtime and taking work home, as well as dedicating too much thought space and emotional attachment to their job means workaholics have too little time for ‘recovery’. The efforts you put in at work must be followed by an adequate period of physical and mental ‘unwinding’ or ‘recovery’ to ensure optimum health and functionality. The team at the University of Padova looked at 322 workers in a private company over 15 months. Each worker completed self-report questionnaires to establish to what degree they had workaholic traits, and their psychophysic strain was measured by a physician’s report, an appraisal of their performance by a supervisor, and the number of days taken off for sickness. As well as increasing psychological and physical strain, compulsive over working decreased job performance and increased absence from work due to illness . Workaholicism was associated with psychophysic strain, which was in turn associated with poor performance and increased sickness absences, and was also found to be independently associated with absences from work. So though a workaholic may work harder and for more hours, the strain they put themselves under will reduce their performance - subsequently seeing them take more days off as a result.","Study by University of Padova in Italy followed workers over 15 years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An English man woke from a stroke to discover that the only language he could speak was Welsh. Alun Morgan, 81, was forced to re-learn his native tongue, despite the fact that he had never been able to speak fluent Welsh. Indeed, he wasn’t entirely confident with his newfound talent and used a Welsh dictionary to make sure he was speaking it correctly. Lost in translation: Englishman Alun Morgan woke up after suffering a severe stroke speaking fluent Welsh despite having never been to the country for 70 years . Since suffering the stroke, Mr Morgan . has been diagnosed  with aphasia, which is caused by damage to the part . of the brain responsible for using and understanding language. While the condition can leave people . with difficulties speaking and reading, the damage can also enhance . other areas of the brain. Doctors believe the stroke must have suppressed his memory of English, while bringing his knowledge of Welsh to the fore. Although Mr Morgan was brought up in . England, he was evacuated to his grandmother’s house in Wales during the . war when he was 12 years old. The retired RAF Air Commodore, who lives with his wife Yvonne in Bathwick, Somerset, suffered the stroke in 2010. 'Not easy': Mr Morgan, 81, who was evacuated to Wales during the Second World War aged 10, but never learned the language, holds a sign that says 'I can speak Welsh' Tongue terrified: Mr Morgan said his Welsh speaking gave his wife the shock of her life . A bombed-out church (left) and a shipment of haricot beans (right) being unloaded at the docks during the Second World War in Cardiff, Wales. Mr Morgan moved to the country for a year when he was 12 years old . He was taken to hospital where he spent three weeks being stabilised and assessed. While he hadn’t lost the ability to speak, as happens to some stroke victims, doctors couldn’t understand a word he was saying. He said: ‘It was clear something very funny was going on. ‘I was compos mentis but was speaking totally Welsh. It gave my wife the shock of her life.’ He believes his memories of the Welsh . language stem from his childhood. He moved to a small village in . Mid-Wales for a year in 1944 but returned home to London the following . year and lived the rest of his life in England. He said: ‘I must have picked up the Welsh because my nan, who I went to live with during the war, spoke terrible English.’ Both Mr Morgan’s parents also  spoke Welsh. He added: ‘Having learned I was only . speaking in Welsh and not English, I got myself a good Welsh dictionary . to make sure I was speaking it correctly.’ Mr Morgan has been helped to overcome . the condition by the Communication Support Service, run by the Stroke . Association in Bath. He required lessons to learn to speak English . again. He said: ‘After the stroke it was hard going. Gradually the English words came back, but it wasn’t easy.’ But it seems his bilingual talents . won’t last long. He added: ‘I’ve managed to remember English but I’ve . almost forgotten Welsh again.’ Condition 'rewires the brain' Foreign Accent Syndrome: Grandmother Kay Russell (left) began speaking in a French accent after developing a migraine, while Sarah Colwill (right) started talking in a Chinese accent after suffering the same illness .","Alun Morgan evacuated to Wales as child, but never picked up native tongue .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Accused: Tasha Trotter, 40, has been charged with first degree murder in the stabbing death of her son . A mother with a history of mental illness has allegedly stabbed to death her four-year-old son with a kitchen knife. Tasha Trotter, 40, is accused of attacking little Joseph Artis in her mother's St. Petersburg, Florida apartment on Friday evening. Trotter allegedly grabbed the knife from the kitchen and followed her son into a room before stabbing him repeatedly. Witnesses said they saw Trotter carry the little boy's bloody body out of the apartment and lay him on the grass. Joseph, nicknamed 'Turtle' for the way he stretched out his neck in infancy, was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to injury. Trotter's devastated mother, 64-year-old Carolyn Trotter, said she tried to stop her daughter who 'had just lost it' after acting erratically. 'She was crazy about him too, but her mind all twisted all up there,' Carolyn Trotter, who'd had custody of Joseph since he was six-months-old, told WTSP. 'So she just took that knife, and for some reason that I don't know if we will ever find out, she just took that knife to him.' The Tampa Tribune reported that on Friday, Tasha Trotter was waiting on the porch of the 13th Avenue home when her mother, son and brother, 44-year-old LeRonn Trotter, arrived. Not long after her brother left, Trotter, a mother-of-four, allegedly assaulted her son. Heartbreaking: Joseph 'Turtle' Artis, four (pictured left and right), was allegedly stabbed to death by his mom . Tragic: Joseph Artis, four, had lived with his grandmother since he was six-months-old . Neighbors who heard screaming and saw Trotter carrying her son outside, flagged down nearby police officers. 'She just laid him on the ground. She just politely laid him on the ground. She still had the knife in her hand,' Sherry Ford told Tampa Bay Times. 'That image, I know I'll just never forget. I'm used to seeing the little boy playing on the street.' Neighbor Stephanie Brown said she saw the little boy, lifeless, on the ground. 'When I got there cried, and I had to leave because I couldn’t understand why a bunch of people were standing out here, making like this was a game, everybody was showing up like this was a party,' she told WFLA. In happy times: Family members said Tasha Trotter (pictured left and right) used to wear six wigs at a time to entertain them . Carolyn Trotter said her daughter had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, manic depression and schizophrenia, and spent years in a facility for behavioral and mental health problems. She said the center kicked her out when she became pregnant with Joseph. 'I personally believe she was bipolar, schizophrenic, manic depressive; she is probably all those things,' she told WTSP. 'It's mind boggling. I know she wasn't in her right mind for what she was doing. She needed mental help bad. She was not getting that. I would try to go to see her doctors and they would not let me know what was happening with her. 'Tasha was telling them she was fine when she was not fine and the doctors need to hear from her family, me or her brother. Otherwise, how will she ever get the right help?' Scene: The attack happened at Carolyn Trotter's apartment on 13th Avenue in St Petersburg, Florida . Scene: Witnesses said they saw Trotter carry her son's bloody body out of the apartment and lay him on the grass . Horrified: Neighbor Stephanie Brown saw the little boy's bloody body on the grass . Trotter has three other children: two adults and a three-year-old girl who has been in the custody of family member Gwendolyn Rose since she was seven-months-old. Court records show Trotter has led a troubled life. In 2009, when Joseph was about four-months-old, Trotter filed a domestic violence injunction against his father, Joseph Artis III. She was granted temporary custody of the child and the father was allowed only supervised weekly time-sharing visits at a domestic violence shelter. Trotter agreed to give her mother temporary custody of Joseph in 2010. The following year, Trotter lost custody permanently. She was allowed only supervised visits. The Department of Children and Families stopped checking up on Trotter after closing Joseph's case in December 2011, Tampa Bay Times reported. Trotter has been charged with first degree murder and was denied bail in Joseph's death.","Tasha Trotter charged with stabbing Joseph Artis in her mother's home in St. Petersburg, Florida on Friday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Closing speech: Jurors are almost ready to consider verdicts on veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis, pictured . Dave Lee Travis is the victim of a witch hunt by police who were desperate to find a scapegoat after missing Jimmy Savile's crimes, a court has heard. The veteran DJ's defence barrister told a jury today that convicting Travis of 14 sex crimes would not 'right the wrongs' of the Savile scandal. 'Police and the authorities missed Jimmy Savile,' said Stephen Vullo in his closing speech at Southwark Crown Court. 'They missed him. 'In any society when something goes wrong, a harvest fails, there is a reaction, an understandable reaction. 'Nobody wants sexual predators to get away with their crimes. 'Everybody . wants them to be brought to justice but there is no justice whatsoever . in overreaction, bringing a 68-year-old man of impeccable character to . this court and muddying his name to make us feel better about Jimmy . Savile. 'It wouldn't right that wrong.' Travis, a former presenter of the BBC's Radio 1 breakfast show, is on trial under his birth name David Griffin accused of 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault against a total of 11 women. The charges date back as far as 1976 when he was at the height of his fame and include periods when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a . broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while appearing on Top of the Pops . and when starring in panto. Accusing the authorities of a 'witch hunt', Mr Vullo said his client's reputation was 'already finished' despite no verdict yet being reached by the court. Scapegoat: Jurors heard today that Travis (left with Jimmy Savile in 1980) is the victim of a 'witch hunt' by police who were desperate for scapegoats after missing Savile's sex crimes. Both were high-profile DJs . High-profile: Travis (left) and Savile were well-known BBC music presenters. Savile died before he could be brought to trial, and after his death hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse began to emerge . He told the jury the 'person who started this' - the first woman who went to police and said Travis assaulted her in the Radio 1 studio - 'lied to you at length and in detail'. 'It's not unfair for me to say at this stage that that's where the witch hunt begins,' he added. 'It began with a total lie.' He added: 'It's so unfair to have an accusation made against you many years after the incident.' Maintaining his innocence: Travis, 68, arrives at Southwark Crown Court today . The barrister said although the prosecution say that none of the alleged victims are motivated by money or fame, 'we just don't know what people are going to do after this case has finished'. Referring to the four assaults alleged to have taken place while Travis worked at Classic Gold Radio in the early 2000s, Mr Vullo said they had been 'blown out of all proportion'. Of one woman, Mr Vullo said: 'Mr Griffin accepts he maybe touched her leg because he was close to her in an argument. 'She went ballistic and went mad and people remember that happening and that's what people remember, but not how she says. 'Nobody has given evidence of having received a complaint from her that he put his ""hand up my skirt and in my knickers"".' He said the woman was known for particularly liking her personal space while he said of Travis: 'He is as has been described - a big cuddly bear who is very tactile.' Earlier, prosecutor Miranda Moore QC presented her closing speech - in which she branded Travis a 'dirty old man'. She asked jurors to consider whether the BBC was a 'utopia' when Travis worked there. She said: 'Was the BBC a utopia where women were free from unwanted attention, where the DJs behaved - apart from Savile? 'Where there were no rumours of untoward behaviour - apart from Savile? Where every complaint was dealt with properly?' Ms Moore said the trial had heard from witnesses who said this was not the case and told the jury of eight women and four men to 'bring your scepticism' to the case. 'This utopia that was the BBC where no girls ever felt that they were being sexually harrassed or anything was untoward,' she said. 'I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but my expression to that is ""Oh please.""' Ms Moore told jurors not to focus on the 'morality' of what was acceptable in the 1970s and 80s, because Travis has denied the assaults completely, rather than pinning them on a misogynistic industry. Breakfast: Travis's beard and slot on Radio 1's prime slot led him to be nicknamed the Hairy Cornflake . Fame: Travis in 1980. The judge in his trial is expected to sum up the case tomorrow before the jury retires . She added it was a 'criminal trial and not a feminist rant by me as to a culture that existed at a particular point of time that some of us lived through'. She also told jurors that although the courts regularly deal with more 'horrific cases', it was not their job to 'judge degrees of guilt'. Referring to the most recent alleged assault, where it is claimed Travis grabbed a journalist's breasts as if to check their size, Ms Moore said it sounded like a Carry On film, but this did not mean it was not serious. Ms Moore told jurors to forget about Travis's fame and treat him as a 'normal member of the public, no more nor less'. 'His celebrity might have given him protection in the past,' she said. Judge Anthony Leonard is due to sum up the case tomorrow before the jury retires to consider its verdict. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Defence barrister made the claim in closing speech of the veteran DJ's trial .

"By . Leon Watson . Letters penned by notorious serial killer Mary Ann Cotton (pictured) have been bought by a private collector for £4,000 . Eight personal letters written by a notorious Victorian serial killer have been bought by a private collector despite an appeal to have them preserved for the nation. Mary Ann Cotton - dubbed the Black Widow - was hanged in Durham Prison in 1873 after being found guilty of poisoning her stepson with arsenic. Cotton, from West Auckland, County Durham, is also widely . believed to be responsible for the deaths of up to 20, including her . husbands and children. Her letters, written from prison and addressed to a man who had lodged at Cotton's home, make reference to solicitors and financial problems and were put up for sale on eBay. An online campaign was launched to raise the £4,000 sought for them. But the money was not raised in time and the letters were bought by a private collector, who wishes to remain anonymous. However, copies of the letters have since been donated to the Durham Records Office and Beamish Museum in Stanley, County Durham. The buyer said: 'Unfortunately the campaign's fundraising was very slow, and the seller was keen to sell them sooner rather than later. 'I am a private collector of Victorian crime memoribilia and purchased the letters. 'I have since made high resolution copies which have been sent to Durham Records Office and Beamish Museum, and have also posted scans on the campaign Facebook page.' Ms Cotton wrote the letters to her lodger, William Lowery, weeks before she was executed. Heather Holdgate, who was part of the online campaign to buy the letters, said: 'I think the sale of the letters to the collector has turned out well, even though it wasn't the campaign group who were able to secure them. 'He appears to empathise with the desires of the team and has kindly offered to provide good copies of the letters for this group. 'It's not the resolution everyone wanted, but it is the next best thing.' Cotton was suspected of poisoning 21 people in total, including her own children, husband, lovers and mother . Despite protesting her innocence, Ms Cotton was hanged in March 1873 . Ms Cotton wrote the letters to her lodger, William Lowery, weeks before she was executed . Mary Ann Cotton, who always professed her innocence, is believed to have killed three husbands, a lover, a friend, her mother and 12 children, using arsenic. They all died suffering from stomach complaints and she was found guilty of murder in March 1873. She was hanged at County Durham Gaol on March 24 that year. The buyer has donated copies of the letters to the Durham Records Office and Beamish Museum . Bleak House, Durham, the home of murderer Mary Anne Cotton and where she was living when she was arrested in 1873 . A view inside Durham maximum security Prison, where the Great Train Robbers were held and serial murderer Mary Ann Cotton was hung here . While Mary Ann Cotton's letters that have sold on eBay might give an insight into the mind of a killer, some now believe that she might not have been guilty in the first place. She was convicted of only one murder, that of her stepson, after suspicions were aroused when he died shortly after she failed to get him admitted to a workhouse. He suffered gastro intestinal problems, as had many other people the dressmaker and nurse had dealings with over a 20 year period, including three of her husbands and a number of her children and stepchildren. Even though in all cases she claimed an insurance pay out, none of these deaths were deemed suspicious, until her stepson died. An inquest revealed the presence of arsenic, and subsequent exhumations also found the same poison in some of the bodies. Despite protesting her innocence, she was hanged in March 1873, the execution being delayed until after the birth of her 11th child. However, some believe the deaths could equally have been due to poverty and poor medical facilities, and she was merely a victim of the times. Local author, Ian Smyth Herdman, studied the court transcripts, information from the National Archives and newspapers and found a list of errors in evidence and legal process at her trial. 'The available evidence was lacking to say the least,' he said. 'She had no forensic expert to rebuke the prosecutions comments, witness statements in her defence were lodged, but were not acceptable. 'In the accordance with law it would in my opinion be questionable as to her guilty verdict.'","The eight letters were written by 'Black Widow' Mary Ann Cotton .

An autopsy will be performed on the baby Silas on Monday and more charges will be filed against Widdick following the autopsy, First Assistant District Attorney Gene Talerico said Saturday. He also said that homicide charges are likely. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Eddie Widdick, 23, is pictured here with his girlfriend's son Silas whom he allegedly beat to near death on Wednesday . Widdick frantically called Ashley Nelson on Wednesday morning to say 'he didn't do it' but that Silas was not 'breathing right.' Seven minutes after he called his girlfriend, Widdick called 911 to tell police that the baby had fallen out of his crib, reported The Times Tribune. The baby was taken from Rear Delaware Avenue in Olypahnt and was flown to Geisinger Medical Center in Danville. Widdick later admitted that he dropped baby Silas down a flight of stairs and 'forcefully put him in his crib.'

The baby's mother, Ashley Nelson, has not been charged in the death of her son . A day after the arrest, Nelson's landlord, Kevin Cavanaugh, and a code enforcement officer from Olyphant went through the home he rents to Nelson and her children. Even though the landlord never saw any signs of abuse on Nelson's children he did notice that the children often appeared dirty and that the home was in an unhealthy condition. The landlord and another neighbor on Delaware Avenue called Lackawanna County Children and Youth Services because of the conditions of the house. 'As time went on over the last three or four weeks I became more concerned with the children’s welfare because I kept seeing dirty, dirty diapers, children crying upset all the time. When I went in there those kids ran right to me, and they didn’t even know me,' said Cavanaugh to WNEP. He said he held the baby just one week before the incident occurred and that he wished he could have done something to prevent it from happening.

The 80-year-old, who plays Rita Tanner in the soap, was said to have been arrested after allegedly jumping in her car to remonstrate with police following the arrest of her daughter Maxine Ashcroft for the same offence.

But Knox, who has starred in the series for more than 40 years, later allegedly drove to Knutsford Police Station to demand her release. According to reports, Knox was then arrested. She has now believed to have been bailed until next month pending inquiries. The soap star was being driven home from Knutsford by her daughter when police allegedly stopped them. Ashscroft was breathalysed and was later found to be almost three times the legal limit.

A dog owner revealed today how her pet saved her life by hitting her on the back. Rachel Hayes, of Carmarthenshire, West Wales, thought she was going to die as she choked on a strawberry sweet while sitting in her kitchen. But as she gasped for air, the 40-year-old woman's faithful springer spaniel Mollypops sprang into action and hit her so hard on the back with her paws that the sweet popped out. Miss Hayes said: ‘She is an absolute hero - If it had not been for Mollypops I would have died. ‘I was sat down and this sweet just got stuck in the back of my throat, and I was trying to get it up but I couldn't, and I didn't know what to do.’ Miss Hayes, who lives with Mollypops in the rural village of Drefach Felindre, could not call out. She said: ‘I couldn't phone anyone because I couldn't talk. I was having difficulty breathing and was doing my best to get it out. But Mollypops's sixth sense kicked in and she knew I was in trouble. ‘I kept pushing her away because I couldn't really breathe but then she came up behind me, put her paws on me, and bashed on my back with such a force that the sweet came out.’ Miss Hayes said she could have died if ‘best friend’ Mollypops had not performed the manoeuvre.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Los Angeles Kings kept rolling toward the playoffs with their sixth straight victory on Saturday, thanks in part to an almost impossibly perfect save by goaltender Jonathan Quick. The save was one of 24 Quick made during the game against the Winnipeg Jets, but the fact that he did it while flat on his stomach using his leg and quick wits made this one special. The scorpion kick came with just one minute left to play and was defininetly the most impressive save of the night and fans are already calling it the best of the year. The shutout for Jets means they are unlikely to make it to the playoffs, while it was a coninuance of a late season surge for the Kings, who will likely open the postseason against Anaheim or San Jose.

"By . Emma Lowe . and Ashley Pearson . If Harry the spaniel looks less than impressed, it may be because he doesn’t know he’s at the forefront of a revolution in dog grooming. (Actually, it’s probably because, like most dogs, he hates being washed, but bear with us...) Harry is pictured in the middle of having a blueberry facial, the latest thing in canine pampering said to be a big hit among celebrities and their pets in – where else? – Los Angeles. Spruce up your Spaniel: Harry in the middle of his pampering . The £39.95 treatment is offered in Britain at the Pet Spa in Chelsea and features the mutt’s face being smeared in a mixture of blueberries, oatmeal, honey and yoghurt. If you think that sounds more like a breakfast than a beauty treatment, you’re not alone – Harry was certainly keen to give the concoction a taste. Salon owner Stephanie Mehanna, 45, said: ‘The biggest trend in LA recently has been the blueberry facial for dogs. It isn’t available over here so we decided to make our own. ‘The facial is made up of oatmeal and blueberries which acts as exfoliation and helps to reduce tear stains on the fur around the eyes. ‘We feel the blueberry facial works best as part of a package, and helps to groom the coat.’ Tastes good: A big lick as Harry checks out the mixture, applied by stylist Nikki Keohane . Eyes shut: The blueberry facial is massaged into Harry's fur . Her spa’s ‘deluxe face and body treatment’ package starts with a milk bath, a solution made up of orange, lavender and dried milk, followed by the blueberry facial, which is applied across the nose and the soft fur under the eyes. An all-over carrot and banana body mask is then used to work through the fur and on to the skin to help with exfoliation, using the course texture of the carrot and the natural moisturisers in bananas to do this. Then the coat is glossed over with a rosemary and cider mix which acts like a finishing solution on the fur. Pamper: Harry is brushed down to complete his £39.95 treatment . Miss Mehanna’s spa is believed to be the first to offer a ‘Deluxe face and body treatment’ package which includes a Cleopatra orange and lavender milk wash followed by the blueberry facial. A nourishing carrot and banana body mask before finally being treated with a rosemary and cider coat shine. Add-ons such as a ‘Wash and Fluff’ dog groom which, depending on the size of your breed, will range from £45.99 to £75.99 a session. All the ingredients used in the cleansing are natural and have been sourced in the UK, they are then mixed in house and made into treatments. Other treatments at the salon include the first ever ‘Blow Dry Bar’ for owners and their pooches. Clients can sip on champagne while their much-loved pets have their fur blow-dried and enjoy a mineral water. Other treatments include the ‘Deluxe paw-dicure’ which allows the paws to be soaked in rose water and then they are coated in olive oil and coconut body butter for £29.95. Many dog owners, who only want the best for their canine friends, will hire in artistic director and top stylist Dione Spice who will groom and shape their coats for up to £125.95. Most treatments to prove successful or beneficial have to be repeated every four to six weeks. They also offer a crèche for the precious pets, from 8:30am until 6pm, which includes a walk and is priced at £650 per month, or £25 per day.","The £39.95 treatment is being offered to pet owners in west London .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A bigger earthquake along the lesser-known fault that gave Southern California a moderate shake could do more damage to the region than the long-dreaded 'Big One' from the more famous San Andreas Fault, experts warn. The Puente Hills thrust fault, which brought Friday night's magnitude-5.1 quake centered in La Habra and well over 100 aftershocks by Sunday, stretches from northern Orange County under downtown Los Angeles into Hollywood -- a heavily populated swath of the Los Angeles area. A magnitude-7.5 earthquake along that fault could prove more catastrophic than one along the San Andreas, which runs along the outskirts of metropolitan Southern California, seismologists said. Such a quake along the Puente Hills fault could kill 3,000 to 18,000 people and cause up to $250 billion in damage, according to estimates from The U.S. Geological Survey. In contrast, a larger magnitude 8 quake along the San Andreas would cause an estimated 1,800 deaths. The destruction wrought by a magnitude-7.5 earthquake along the Puente Hills thrust fault could be far worse than the damage from Friday's quake, seen here, meaning up to 18,000 deaths and possibly $250 billion in damage . The shaking from a 7.5 quake in the center of urban Los Angeles could be so intense it would lift heavy objects in the air, like the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake in Northern California, where the shaking was so bad 'we found an upside-down grand piano,' USGS seismologist Lucy Jones told the Los Angeles Times. That would 'hit all of downtown,' Jones said. 'And everywhere from La Habra to Hollywood.' Part of the problem with the potential damage is that the fault runs near so many vulnerable older buildings, many made of concrete, in downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. 'In terms of location, it couldn't be much worse,' said James Dolan, a professor at University of Southern California's department of Earth sciences, told National Geographic in 2003 while working on a study of faults. 'Downtown L.A. is sitting on top of this thing.' The Puente Hills fault is horizontal and stretches through downtown LA and Hollywood -- meaning a wide area could be affected by a magnitude-7.5 quake. Here, construction workers wait for a new section of pipe to be cut after Friday's magnitude-5.1 quake . Part of the potential problem is that the fault would hit many older concrete buildings, and damage could cost up to $250 billion dollars. Construction workers are seen here lowering pipe after Friday's quake . And because the fault, discovered in 1999, is horizontal, heavy reverberations are likely to be felt over a wide area, roughly 25 by 15 miles. Scientists believe a major quake happens along the fault roughly every 2,500 years -- but don't know when the last one was, the LA Times reports. In 1987, the fault caused the Whittier Narrows earthquake. Still considered moderate at magnitude 5.9, that quake killed eight people and did more than $350 million in damage. About 150 aftershocks, including one of magnitude-4.1, were felt since Friday night's quake, which forced several dozen people in the Orange County city of Fullerton out of their homes after firefighters discovered foundation problems that made the buildings unsafe to enter, authorities said. Fire crews red-tagged 20 apartment units after finding a major foundation crack, but residents have since been allowed to return. Structural woes, including broken chimneys and leaning, were uncovered in half a dozen single-family houses, which were also deemed unsafe to occupy until building inspectors clear the structures. About two dozen residents remained displaced, down from more than 80 after the initial quake. Another 14 residential structures around the city suffered lesser damage, including collapsed fireplaces. A water-main break flooded several floors of Brea City Hall, and the shaking knocked down computers and ceiling tiles, Stokes said. It was not immediately clear if City Hall would reopen Monday. An email to the mayor was not immediately returned. A CalTrans worker and a geologist look at a rock wall where a rockslide closed a California road on Saturday March 29.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A Second World War bomber nicknamed 'Friday the 13th' which was never shot down despite flying 128 missions is to be celebrated on the 70th anniversary of its first mission. The Halifax bomber got its black-humoured name after 158 Squadron lost seven of the same bombers in succession, all bearing the registration letter F. When their newest aircraft LV907 arrived with the registration NP-F some crewmen refused to fly in it, so Pilot Officer Cliff R R Smith gave it the unusual name, decorated it with a grim reaper's scythe, a skull and crossbones and an upside down horseshoe in order to break the curse. Scroll down for video . Friday the 13th was a Halifax bomber serving with 158 Squadron during the Second World War. She flew a total of 128 missions, more than any other Halifax aircraft . The unusual name was given to the plane after 158 Squadron had several aircraft with the registration F shot down in succession. When their new aircraft arrived with the same letter on it, the Flight Officer decided to try and break the curse . Flight Officer Cliff R R Smith branded the superstition 'stuff and nonsense', named the plane Friday the 13th, and painted a skull and crossbones, a Grim Reaper's scythe and an upside down horseshoe on the side . Smith even painted an open ladder above the crew hatch so they would have to walk under it as they climbed on board, and painted over the parachute escape hatch on the belly of the plane, but these details were later removed. Smith's efforts proved successful, and on its very first mission Friday the 13th saved the life of its pilot, Joe Hitchman, who was swapped from his regular aircraft on to the new bomber at the last minute. Hitchman's regular plane was shot down during that raid on March 30th 1944, along with 100 other aircraft, but Friday the 13th returned to base safely. The plane went on to fly a total of 128 missions, more than any other Halifax aircraft, making it one of the most successful bombers to fly during the war. On the bomber's first mission on March 30 1944 it saved the life of pilot Joe Hitcman who was swapped from his regular aircraft on to the new one at the last minute. His old plane was shot down, but Friday returned to base unscathed . The original Friday the 13th was scrapped after the end of the war along with all other Halifax aircraft, but the Yorkshire Air Museum have rebuilt it from spare parts. It is the only surviving Halifax anywhere in the world . There were more than 6,000 Handley Page Halifax aircraft built during the War to fly heavy bomber missions into Europe, but their role in the conflict is often overshadowed by their more well known contemporary the Avro Lancaster which completed the famous dam-busters raid . Seventy years after its first outing, the story of the famous aircraft which cheated disaster time and time again is being remembered at the Yorkshire Air Museum with the only complete Halifax in the world. The Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington, York, North Yorks., proudly displays an exact replica of Friday the 13th, which was unceremoniously scrapped after the war, at the York Aircraft Repair Depot at Clifton airfield. The museum's spokesman, Ian Richardson, said: 'The project to recreate this legendary aircraft was started in 1986, soon after the museum's formation, and work is still going on. However, standing as a tribute to all air and ground crews of Bomber Command, it draws visitors from all over the world. The Halifax aircraft is actually a reconstruction made from other aircraft parts. Before being bought by the museum the fuselage was in use as a hen coop on the Isle of Lewis . The full crew of Friday the 13th were: Pilot Officer Cliff Smith, from London. Harold King, Navigator and Keith Smith, bomb aim, both from New Zealand. Flt. Sgt. Eric King, air gunner, from Ipswich. Rod Neary Flt. Engineer from Enfield. Ron Clarkson, Mid Upper Gunner, from Australia and Stan Hardacre, Rear Gunner, from Bradford, Yorkshire . During its first mission, 100 other Bomber Command aircraft were shot down, with seven crew on each aircraft, but Friday the 13th returned to base safely . 'Over the years we have had hundreds, even thousands of visitors who travel to see the aircraft. We've had a lot of visitors from Australia and Canada who have discovered relatives who were in service and are hoping to retrace their steps.' Talking about the restoration work, Mr Richardson added: 'It has been a real labour of love. We have had lots of different people working on it over the years and some who are no longer with us, but there has always been people willing get involved with the project.' The replica is a product of years of painstaking restoration and rebuilding work by dozens of dedicated volunteers keen to see one of the iconic aircraft saved for posterity.","RAF 158 Squadron lost a succession of Halifax bombers during the Second World War all with the registration F .

"By . Richard Spillett . and Kieran Corcoran . and Wills Robinson . A passenger killed when a light aircraft crashed in a flaming wreck yesterday afternoon only went up in the plane after a chance offer while visiting an airfield, according to local reports. They say the 'family man' had not been intending to fly. But after accepting an offer, he died along with the plane's pilot when their Yak 52 aircraft came down near the village of North Weald in Essex. The passenger was named as father-of-one and flying enthusiast Simon Chamberlain. Fuselage: Wreckage of the crashed Yak 52 was being removed from the airfield near Writtle, Essex . Debris: The plane had taken off from the nearby North Weald airfield before getting into trouble, police said . He served as secretary and trustee of the North Weald Airfield Museum, both voluntary roles. Mr Chamberlain's family said in a . statement: 'Yesterday there was a light aircraft crash near Writtle in . Essex. Simon Chamberlain, who was 29, was the passenger in that plane. He would have been 30 in May. 'Lizzie, . his wife, has lost her best friend and soul mate. His son, Charlie, who . will be two years old in August, has lost his father. And his parents, . Paul and Steph, have lost a loving son. We love him more than anything . the world. 'Our hearts also go out to the other person involved in this tragedy. 'We know that you will respect the fact that we now need time to grieve and give us the space to heal.' Onlookers . have said the plane appeared to be attempting a mid-air somersault . shortly before it 'nose-dived' straight into the ground and burst into . flames at around 3pm yesterday. Fire crews doused the burning aircraft . with foam, but the two men inside were killed. The pilot is also yet to . be named, but emergency services confirmed that both men are from . Essex. The plane had taken off from the nearby North Weald airfield before getting into trouble, police said. Local news website Everything Epping Forest . has said that the pilot was an 'enthusiastic' member of the community . around the airfield, and had been visiting with his family when he . accepted the offer of a chance flight. Tristram Taylor, 27, saw the crash while driving and stopped to call 999.

'We went a bit further down the road and I could then see the tail end of the plane on the ground and a lot of smoke. 'I got out and ran towards it with a couple of Army cadets that were in the car behind. They were probably only about 15 or 16 years old. 'There were flames coming from the cockpit, they must have been about 10ft high. The wind was very strong in the field. I could feel the heat of the flames just a few feet away. 'It was horrific. The plane was popping and spitting where the fuel was catching fire. I don't think anything could have been done.' Eyewitness Sam Gildersleeve, from nearby Ongar, was having lunch with friends when he saw the plane flying low. Mr Gildersleeve said: 'We all looked at the sky and the plane attempted to do a somersault unsuccessfully, we heard a popping sound and noticed the plane did not re-emerge. 'We then noticed smoke coming from the site in the field where the plane had crashed. Shortly after the emergency services appeared.' The aircraft's tail can be seen at the crash scene. Fire crews said it was fully alight when they arrived . A team from the Department of Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch are now at the scene . Chef Mark Reynolds saw the incident . unfold while he was taking his break outside the nearby Fox and Goose . pub and rushed to help. He said: 'We were watching the plane doing an aerobatic display over the fields. It was very impressive. 'We . kept saying the plane was very low in the air and the next thing it . nose nose-dived into the ground, completely vertical, and burst in to . flames. 'It was surreal, we started running towards it to see if we could help anyone. 'It was quite a way off. When we got to the plane it was engulfed in flames. He was very badly burned.' Mr Reynolds, 47, added: 'It was like something you see in a movie. It was very disturbing, something that will stay with me.' Fire crews, who were called from three nearby fire stations to the crash scene, later covered the wreckage, which will now be examined by investigators .

'Despite the best efforts of crews the casualties were sadly pronounced dead at the scene. Ambulance resources have now been stood down.' Two men, instructor Simon Hulme, 33, and his student Spencer Bennett, 43, were killed in a similar accident in 2011 when another Yak 52 crashed into a lake near Maldon, Essex. Mr Bennett was on a three-day flying course when the plane he was being trained in came down. Russian Yak 52s like that pictured have been involved in a number of fatal accidents in recent years. File photo . In that incident, the plane was being used as an aerobatics trainer and also took off from the North Weald airfield. In July 2006, two people died when a Yak 52 crashed and burst into flames as it came in to land at Bournemouth Airport. And in January 2003, Falklands veteran Anthony Hunt, 48, died along with his brother Ian, 45, when their aircraft crashed in a field on the Easton Neston estate, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, while practising aerobatic manoeuvres. His family were awarded £270,000 damages by the High Court in 2006 after an investigation found that during maintenance a short screwdriver had become wedged into the wires that operated the rear elevators of the plane. Two people also died when a Yak 52 crashed in the Kaluga region, south of Moscow in Russia, in August 2009. The Yakovlev Yak 52 is a two-seater propeller aircraft first built in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The former Soviet Air Force training aircraft is now a popular plane for aerobatic flying around the world. It has a reported top speed of 223mph and a service life of 30 years. It is not known how old the aircraft which crashed today was.","Two men died after Yak 52 plane crashed near Chelmsford, Essex .

"By . Martin Robinson . Backing: Anjem Choudary has got behind a Muslim group with the initials IED, which is the same letters to describe bombs used in Iraq and Afghanistan . Hate preacher Anjem Choudary is backing a new Muslim group accused of using its name to ridicule British soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Islamic Emergency Defence is already being shortened to IED, which also stands for the  Improvised Explosive Devices used to kill or maim soldiers abroad. Anjem Choudary, who said Drummer Lee Rigby 'will burn in hellfire' after he was executed on a Woolwich street a month ago, has an advisory role with the group. The new organisation says it has been set up to stop 'violent hooligans willing to inflict large scale carnage on innocent Muslims'. They have also set up an emergency hotline for Muslims to call them instead of the police so incidents can be 'dealt with in a swift and Islamic manner'. Their website adds: 'Our aim is to build a national network of Muslim volunteers who are ready and able to protect and defend any Muslim from verbal and physical abuse. 'Muslims should not be afraid to protect themselves or their brothers and sisters from acts of violence or hooliganism, because it is totally rational, sensible and above all: Islamic'. Critics have called Islamic Emergency Defence a vigilante group and said its name was inflammatory, but their members say its bomb-linked initials are a 'pure coincidence'. 'This is mocking Servicemen killed by IEDs. It shows their warped state . of mind,' Former Scotland Yard terrorism expert John O'Connor told The Sun. Website: The Islamic Emergency Defence group encourages Muslims to call their hotline instead of police when they are attacked . But Choudary has used Twitter to urge people to join up and use the group as he announced the 'Good news with the launch', adding it had 'risen to the challenge'. Defending its task forces he added: 'People can look at it as a vigilante group but to protect and defend yourself is not illegal'. But politicians have today stepped in to criticise. 'What is hoped to be achieved by this except offence and tension?' Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said. Labour MP Rushanara Ali added: 'When groups encourage people to take the law into their own hands it needs to be stopped.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Married people are now in a minority in England and Wales after millions gave up on ever tying the knot. New figures show that 51 per cent of people are 'not married' for the first time, up from 47 per cent in a decade. It marks a dramatic shift from the 1930s when 9 in 20 people had married by the time they turned 40. The Office for National Statistics said the changes were the result of declining numbers of people making it up the aisle since the 1970s and changing social attitudes towards people who co-habit or live alone.Scroll down for interactive map . According to the 2011 census more than 15.7 million people in England and Wales had never been married, up from 12.5 million in 2001, and accounting for around a third of over-16s. But also taking into account those who have divorced or been widowed, there were 23 million people classed as ‘not married’ people, or 51 per cent. The figure is up from from 47 per cent in 2001, 58 per cent in 1991 and 63 per cent in 1981. The ONS said: ‘The rise in the single population could be the result of a number of factors, including the proportional decline in marriage since the 1970s and the increased social acceptability of remaining single or cohabiting (either never marrying or not re-marrying following divorce or widowhood).’ The proportion of people who tie the knot has been falling over several decades. Among people born in 1930, 90 per cent of men and 94 per cent of women had ever married by age 40. By contrast, of those born in 1970, 63 per cent of men and 71 per cent of women had ever married by the same age. The 2011 Census shows that just 20 per cent of men and 24 per cent of women aged under 40 were married. The Office for National Statistics released a interactive series of maps showing where single people live, including this one which shows the percentage of those aged 16 and over who were not living as a couple in 2011 . The ONS added: 'Men and women in their late teens and twenties have seen the greatest decline in the proportions who have ever married. Of those born in 1930, 51 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women were married by the age of 25 compared with 5 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women born in 1986. 'These figures reflect the increasing proportion of men and women choosing to delay marriage or not get married at all.' Meanwhile the number of singletons has risen by 3million in a decade, as more of us choose to live on our own, according to new research. A detailed analysis of the state of the nation reveals that in some areas more than half of people are unattached, with Islington topping the league tables where almost two in three men and 57 per cent or women are single. But anyone looking for love in East Devon is going to struggle, because just a quarter of men and fewer than a fifth of women are on the market. The Office for National Statistics has published an interactive map showing the areas where all the single men, and women, live. People who live near the seaside may be more prone to divorce, a new report suggests. The divorce hot spots of England and Wales are all coastal areas, according to the ONS. The local authority with the highest proportion of divorcees was Blackpool where 13.1 per cent of the population were divorced. In Hastings 12.8 per cent of people were divorced while 12.2 per cent of those in Torbay had been through a marriage breakdown. Weymouth and Portland, Thanet, the Isle of Wight, Gosport, Eastbourne, Great Yarmouth and Worthing also made up the top 10 places with the highest proportions of divorced people. 'The top 10 were all in coastal areas, and mainly on the South coast of England apart from Blackpool and Great Yarmouth,' the report states. 'Higher levels of divorced population may relate to the affordability of housing and living costs in some of these areas resulting in divorced people with reduced economic assets living there.' The single population is also ageing, in part as a result of more older people being divorced and widowed. In 2011, the median age of the . adult population who had never been married was 27.5, a rise from 26.9 . in 2001. Those who were not married in 2011 had a median age of 35.6, a . rise from 35.0 in 2001. Of those who had never been married, women were younger than men, with a median age of 26.9 compared with 28 years. The . ONS said: ‘This is linked to the trend for women to marry men who are . older than themselves.However, not married women were on average older . than men (39.3 and 32.9 years respectively). This is most likely due to . the higher proportion of widows in the population (10 per cent of adult . women compared with 3.3 per cent of adult men).’ Islington in North London has the highest proportion of single men (63 per cent), followed by Lambeth (61 per cent) and Hackney (60 per cent). In Tower Hamlets, Hammersmith and Fulham and Manchester 59 per cent of men were classed as single. By contrast, just 24 per cent of men in East Devon were single, with 27 per cent single in South Northampton, East Devon and North Kesteven in the East Midlands. Islington is also the capital of single women, with 57 per cent unattached, ahead of Lambeth on 56 per cent and Hackney 55 per cent. In Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth and Camden, 53 per cent of women were single. But in East Dorset just 18 per cent of women were single, followed by Richmondshire (20 per cent) and several areas where only 21 per cent were single. ‘The majority of the top 10 local authorities with the highest proportions of those who were either never married or unmarried were in London,’ the ONS said. ‘Local authorities with high proportions of single people had younger populations. Oxford, for example, appeared in the top 10 for both groups. ‘The area with the lowest proportion of both never married and not married was East Dorset where 21% of the adult population had never been married and a further 18% were divorced or widowed. ‘This reflects the older age structure in this area and higher proportions of the population who were widowed.’ While the top 10 for men and women were dominated by the same areas, in some parts of the country there were marked differences. In Richmondshire in North Yorkshire there were 21 men to every 10 women who had never been married. In the small village of Scotton in Richmondshire, there were 97 men to every 10 women – because it has a large army barracks in the area. There were more women than men who were not married in coastal areas such as Rother (East Sussex) and Christchurch (Dorset) where there were around 13 women who were not married to every 10 men who were not married. The ONS added: ‘These coastal areas have an older population and as women have higher life expectancy, this is likely to be due to the number of widows in the population.’","51% of people have never married or are divorced or widowed, up from just 37% in 1981 .

"By . Anne Hamlyn . There's a bitter battle being fought on the High Street between retail titans Marks & Spencer and John Lewis. What are they fighting over? Well, that would be you, Mrs Middle England. It seems that every move M&S makes, John Lewis quickly copies it. Take the surprising similarities between John Lewis's spring/summer own-brand catalogue for the industry, released late last month, and M&S's, which came out in November. The pictures of models in little stripy dresses, floral prints and trendy pink suits are almost indistinguishable. Femail put key looks from each collection to the test and asked top independent stylist ANNE HAMLYN, founder of fashion consultancy company DressMe, to give her verdict... John Lewis: Somerset by Alice Temperley wide-leg trousers, £99, and silk jacket, £140 . M&S: Jacket, £69, and Per Una trousers, £55 . Wrap tops work nicely with wider leg trousers, which are an on-trend look this season. The John Lewis print is lovely. The Alice Temperley trousers are probably my favourite item from the entire John Lewis collection. Yes, they're a bit more expensive than most of the other clothes, but definitely worth it.  You could easily team these with a jacket and heels for work.  And thanks to the fabulous ribbon detail down the side of each leg, you could dress them up for a sexier look at night. These trousers would be  flattering whatever your size. Sadly, M&S misses the mark. Its jacket is very heavy and strangely shiny - it looks like something you'd sell in a Christmas party range, not put in a spring collection.  I'm not a fan of the trousers either, particularly after seeing the excellent John Lewis version. These are creased even on the hanger and they're cut very straight at the hip, which is going to be a problem for pear-shaped women.  One good thing is that they're properly lined, so at least your knickers won't show through the white fabric. Personally, I'd spend the extra money and buy the Temperley trousers at John Lewis. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Cashmere jumper, £69, and Collection pink trousers, £59 . M&S: Pink cashmere jumper, £65, and Per Una pink trousers, £59 . Both retailers have gone for acid brights, with varying degrees of success.  The John Lewis sweater is dull and dated - it's limp on the hanger, so it's going to look awful after a bit of wear. The rolled hem on the neckline and cuffs looks cheap. On the other hand, the trousers are well-cut, with ample room round the bottom. They've designed them with women's curves in mind. Knitwear is one of M&S's strong suits and this jumper is lovely. The longer back makes it stylish and the finish looks expensive.  The cashmere is much heavier than the John Lewis version, despite the fact they're almost the same price. However, the trousers, are not good. The crotch is too low and there's too much fabric in the waistband. And why have the designers included fussy zip pockets at the side? WINNER: M&S for cashmere, JOHN LEWIS for trousers . John Lewis: Dress, £89 . M&S: Navy and ivory dress, £35 . The John Lewis dress would suit any age. It's beautifully tailored and is flattering whatever your shape.  The nautical look isn't overdone (no sailor collars or brass buttons), so it could work in the office or at a wedding. The fabric is a little bit retro, which again will appeal to an older woman. Nautical stripes aren't a particular trend for 2014, but they're a spring/summer staple that you will see cropping up every year and I think John Lewis have executed this look well. Oh dear - then we come to M&S. I wonder who the designers had in mind when they designed this? It's too floppy and girly to wear to work, but too prim to be sexy.  The scalloped edging on the stripes is weird and sticks up unattractively, particularly at the seams.  Yes, it's cheap, but I just can't see many people looking good in it. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Collection white dress, £79, johnlewis.com . M&S: Per Una dress with leather panels, £199, marksandspencer.com . At first glance, these dresses are similar - until you put them on.  Though a fitted, white dress isn't the easiest thing to wear unless you are super-slim, John Lewis has made their cotton version as flattering as possible. The waist seam curves upwards slightly, drawing the eye away from the tummy. And the deeper neckline elongates the silhouette.  Then there's the M&S version, which I really don't like.  Yes, they've picked fashion- forward snakeskin-esque fabric (which feels rather cheap to me), but it's clingy so will be unforgiving on lumps and bumps.  Then there's that high neckline, which makes even our model look broad-shouldered. I'm surprised this is from Per Una, which is where I often take clients who want a larger size as the range goes up to 20.  I can't for the life of me picture any of them wanting to buy this dress, or any older women looking anything less than mutton dressed as lamb in it.  And the final blow is that it's more than double the price of John Lewis's version. My advice is to steer clear. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Floral print top, £49, and trousers, £59 . M&S: Autograph floral top, £65, and trousers, £75 . The John Lewis shirt is just about OK if you want to get this on-trend yellow into your wardrobe without coming on too strong, but how did those shocking trousers get past the design team? Look at the way that white panel runs across the hips at the widest area - and it's even worse at the back where it runs right across the knicker line. It's a classic case of using a print without thinking carefully enough about what it will look like on a real person. If I were a betting woman, I'd say these will be on the sale rail before long. I'm also not convinced by the M&S boxy floral top. I don't think it will flatter anyone with hips or a tummy. But the M&S trousers are brilliant. Despite being a critic of the store's normal range, there's often much better tailoring in the Autograph collection than in Per Una. The M&S designers have really thought about this print. It's not so huge that it will dwarf a little person, but not so small that it will be repeated hundreds of times across someone taller or wider. I'd wear these trousers with a plain sweater or silk blouse. The designers have made a very good job of this fashion-forward look. WINNER: M&S .

"By . Jason Groves . Boost: Germany appears to have backed David Cameron's idea for a 'two-speed' Europe . David Cameron’s bid to cut a new deal for Britain with Brussels received a major boost yesterday when Germany publicly backed the idea of a ‘two-speed Europe’. In a significant step, the powerful German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said he accepted British demands that EU countries outside the Eurozone would need special protections in future. ‘As long as the UK will not join the Eurozone, maybe we can find a two-state solution,’ he said. In a joint article with the Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Schauble spelled out Germany’s vision of how Eurozone countries could pursue deeper political and monetary union, while ensuring ‘fairness’ for EU countries like Britain that remain outside. Downing Street welcomed his intervention, saying it showed Germany had accepted that the UK and other states outside the euro needed special protections written into the EU treaties rather than fighting their corner on a case-by-case basis. Germany is pushing for closer union within the Eurozone to prevent a repeat of the crisis that nearly destroyed the single currency. But British ministers warn they are already engaged in hand to hand combat in Brussels to protect key British interests in areas like regulation of the City. They fear that strengthening the Eurozone would create a powerful voting bloc that would leave the UK at a permanent disadvantage. Ministers now hope that Mr Schauble’s words could eventually lead to a wider change to qualified majority voting, in which changes would have to be agreed by a majority of non-euro states, as well as by those in the euro. But the plan still faces major hurdles, with France resistant to a major shake-up in the EU’s treaties, particularly if it would benefit Britain. In their article in the Financial Times yesterday, Mr Schauble and Mr Osborne said any changes to EU treaties must ‘guarantee fairness’ for member states outside the euro. They wrote: ‘The UK fully recognises . the progress made so far in responding to the crisis, and it supports . the case for further steps forward. But as the euro area continues to . integrate, it is important that countries outside the euro area are not . at a systematic disadvantage in the EU,” they wrote. ‘So . future EU reform and treaty change must include reform of the . governance framework to put euro area integration on a sound legal . basis, and guarantee fairness for those EU countries inside the single . market but outside the single currency.’ In a joint article with the Chancellor George Osborne, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble . said he accepted British demands that EU countries outside the Eurozone . would need special protections in future . Downing Street welcomed the shift from Berlin. A spokesman said: What we see is Germany, one of the leading players in the eurozone, accepting that there needs to be these proper safeguards put in place as further changes are made for the eurozone. 'That is one of the important reforms we want to see to the European Union.’ Asked whether the development meant it would be easier for Mr Cameron to achieve his plans for a renegotiation followed by a referendum by 2017, the spokesman said: ‘There are a number of reforms we would like to see to the EU, but making sure that the UK and other countries outside the eurozone remain on a level playing field is vitally important.’ But some Tory MPs - and many members of the public - remain sceptical about Mr Cameron’s chances of achieving major reform before holding a promised In/Out referendum in 2017. A major poll conducted for the former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft yesterday revealed that only one in five voters is confident the Prime Minister can secure a good deal. Tory MP Mark Reckless welcomed the close-co-operation between Mr Osborne and his German counterpart, but warned: ‘The Germans aren’t going to remake the EU to suit the UK and even the prospect of treaty change seems to be receding.’ Fellow Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell said it was ‘just like the 1990s all over again’, when Brussels paid lip service to British demands for more powers to be handed back to national parliaments.","Powerful German Finance Minister said he accepted British demands .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . An 18-year-old girl died just a week after a hospital scan failed to pick up signs of deep vein thrombosis. Laura Pincher suffered a cardiac arrest after a hospital missed the blood clots in a scan recommended by her worried GP. The teenager from Stourbridge, in the West Midlands, collapsed at her home on October 28 last year and was pronounced dead within an hour at Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley. Missed chances: Laura Pincher suffered a cardiac arrest after a scan failed to detect 'massive' blood clots . An inquest heard that the student had been to see her GP, Dr Debbie Foulds, seven days before her death after noticing that her left calf was 3cm bigger than her right. Dr Foulds sent Miss Pincher for an urgent assessment at the hospital, setting off a chain of events that culminated in the tragedy. Dr Jonathan Tatton, a fellow GP at the practice, said: 'One of the things we would be thinking of was DVT - deep vein thrombosis. 'It’s a GP’s role to highlight the risk. As soon as you’ve highlighted the risk it needs to be assessed in a properly set-up clinic. Worried: Miss Pincher had been to see her GP after noticing her left calf was 3cm bigger than her right . Dr Anthony D’Sa, a doctor at the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, who specialises in radiology, said a Doppler ultrasound scan carried out the next day had not detected blood clots. But he admitted: 'I don’t think there’s any test that’s 100 per cent successful in picking up symptoms.' He told coroner Angus Smillie, sitting at Dudley Coroner’s Court: 'At any stage it’s a matter of putting together how the patient presents and the blood tests and examination. 'We had enough information at that stage to say that there wasn’t a thrombus [blood clot] within the legs.' At a follow-up visit with Dr Tatton on October 23, Miss Pincher and the GP accepted the findings of the scan, concluding the pain in her leg must have been caused in a recent accident when she had tripped on some wood. But just five days later, on the morning of her death, Miss Pincher visited a Walk-In Centre in Dudley. She complained of worsening shortness of breath and a chesty cough - but was sent home with antibiotics and a new inhaler to combat her asthma. Pathologist Dr Swapna Ghosh said Miss Pincher had died of 'massive' blood clots in both lungs, giving deep vein thrombosis and morbid obesity as underlying factors. Mr Smillie ruled death was due to natural causes, declaring that the scan had been concluded satisfactorily. But Miss Pincher's mother Jane said afterwards: 'How can they say an 18-year-old girl has died of natural causes when there’s a blood clot in her lungs? That’s not natural.' Commenting on the inquest, Paula Clarke, chief executive of the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Laura Pincher for their tragic loss. 'We acknowledge the coroner’s verdict that, sadly, Laura died from natural causes.' In some cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) there may be no symptoms, but possible symptoms can include: . * Pain, swelling and tenderness in one of the legs (usually the calf) * A heavy ache in the affected area . * Warm skin in the area of the clot . * Redness of the skin, particularly at the back of the leg, below the knee . DVT usually (although not always) affects one leg. The pain may be made worse by bending the foot upward towards the knee. If DVT is not treated, a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot that has come away from its original site and become lodged in one of  the lungs) may occur. This creates more serious symptoms such as: . * Breathlessness, which may come on gradually or suddenly . * Chest pain, which may become worse when breathing in . * Sudden collapse .

"By . Associated Press . Tragic: A skydiver found dead after a collision with another parachutist in eastern San Diego County has been identified as the 27-year-old brother-in-law of NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson, Jordan Janway, pictured . A skydiver found dead after a collision with another parachutist in eastern San Diego County has been identified as the 27-year-old brother-in-law of NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson. Jordan Janway died Sunday while skydiving with two others at Jamul, the county medical examiner's office says in a statement Monday. Janway collided with one of the other jumpers during freefall, failed to open his parachute and fell to the ground. A statement posted on Johnson's website says Janway was the brother of Johnson's wife, Chandra. The statement asks for prayers and privacy. Skydive San Diego owner Buzz Fink told reporters the victim was a veteran of more than 1,000 jumps. The medical examiner has yet to schedule an examination of the body. Deputies were called to search for the man around 4.30pm at John Nichol's Field, NBC San Diego reports. Janway was found at 5:15pm. Company Skydive San Diego operates out of that field, the channel reports. Fink said the victim was an experienced instructor with the company who had taken a group up for skydiving instruction. Family: The experienced skydiver was the brother of Jimmie Johnson's wife Chandra, pictured left with the racer and their daughter Genevieve . Janway apparently collided with the other jumper's leg mid-air and was injured too badly to open his parachute. The other jumper was not injured and safely landed in the drop zone, NBC San Diego reports. Fink said Janway and other instructors usually used a device that would automatically open his parachute in an emergency -- but it was sent out for maintenance last week, UT-San Diego reports. 'We do well over 100,000 jumps a year, and we pride ourselves on our safety and everything we do as far as our equipment, our airplanes,' Fink told the channel. Scene: The victim was an experienced instructor with Skydive San Diego, which operates out of John Nichol's Field in Jamul, pictured . 'However, it is skydiving and things can happen and generally you do everything we can to prevent it.' 'I liken it to driving down the road. You have a safety belt, an air bag. The bottom line is, you're still at a risk if someone crosses that line and hits your car,' he said. The last death at the center occurred about five years ago when a man was tangled in his chute and hit his head on a rock when he landed, UT-San Diego reports.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The European Parliament is preparing to vote on a proposal to ban all forms of pornography. A report detailing the ban was prepared by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. Embedded under Article 17 of the report . is a clause that, if eventually made into law, would effectively ban . pornography across all types of media, including the Internet, in . Europe. Ban: The European Parliament is preparing to vote on a proposal to ban all forms of pornography . Freedom of speech campaigners have criticised the move, claiming that the clause has been quietly inserted into the legislation. They also described the inclusion of the article as an 'unacceptable political invasion of people’s bedrooms'. Dutch MEP Kartika Liotard, introduced the report which recommended a 'ban all forms of pornography in the media,' including what it refers to as 'the digital field.' But the report does not distinguish between different types of pornography, or indeed what media the bill refers to. Decisions: The report recommend a 'ban all forms of pornography in the media' However, it is expected that MEPs will amend the bill to clarify that the clause refers to pornography in the context of advertising. The bill also calls for the establishment of regulatory agencies with 'a mandate to impose effective sanctions on companies and individuals promoting the sexualisation of girls.' Next Tuesday the 754 MEPs of . the Parliament will be voting on whether to endorse the conclusions of a . report called 'Eliminating gender stereotypes in the EU.' Yesterday Floella Benjamin, who sits as a Lib Dem peer in the Lords, warned of an ‘epidemic’ of violent online porn, which is leading youngsters on a ‘seemingly unstoppable march into a moral wasteland’. Baroness Benjamin said girls were becoming increasingly sexualised while more and more boys were treating them as little more than ‘sexual objects’. In an impassioned speech to mark today’s International Women’s Day, she said boys were pressurising girls into degrading behaviour. ‘I believe we have opened a Pandora’s box and I have no answer as to how we can reverse the trend of the sexual objectification of women and how to protect our children against its influence,’ she said. The idea of banning pornography is beginning to gather pace. Last month it was reported that Iceland could become the first Western democracy to block all internet porn under radical new proposals. Fears about the damaging effects on . children have led the government to work on legal measures to try and . stop the flood of graphic sexual material reaching the island’s shores. Interior . Minister Ögmundur Jónasson has set up working parties to find the best . ways to stem the tide of online images and videos being accessed by . young people through computers, games consoles and smartphones. Methods . under consideration include blocking porn IP addresses and making it . illegal to use Icelandic credit cards to access x-rated sites. A law forbidding the printing and distribution of porn has long been in place in the Nordic nation – but it has yet to be updated to cover the internet. The move is likely to be monitored by Prime Minister David Cameron who has said he finds it 'utterly appalling' that so many children in the UK have been exposed to the 'darkest corners' of the internet . Two years ago, the Icelandic Parliament – led by female prime minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir  -  successfully banned all strip clubs on the grounds that they violated the civil rights of the women who worked there and were harmful to society. This argument - that porn violates the rights of both women who appear in it and children who are exposed to it - is the cornerstone of the new proposals under discussion. The move is likely to be monitored by Prime Minister David Cameron who has said he finds it ‘utterly appalling’ that so many children in the UK have been exposed to the ‘darkest corners’ of the internet. The Daily Mail has also been campaigning for an automatic block on online pornography that means customers must ‘opt in’ for access. Recent comments by Labour frontbenchers, like Diane Abbott, suggests an emerging political consensus on the need for radical thinking to deal with the 'pornification' of childhood. While countries like China  have also tried to stamp out internet pornogaphy within its borders, this is the first attempt by a Western democracy.","Report prepared by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality .

"By . Wills Robinson . A healthcare assistant who lost 14 stone after receiving a gastric band died five years later because of delayed complications, an inquest has heard. Elise Ann Hedgecock, 35, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, suffered a perforated ulcer as a result of the operation she had in 2008. This led to an infection known as peritonitis, an inflammation of the tissue which lines the abdomen, which subsequently caused her death. Procedure: Elise Ann Hedgecock opted for a gastric band operation at Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester when she weighed 24 stone . The inquest heard she had been overweight . for most of her adult life and in October 2008, when she weighed 24 . stone, she decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery at Salford Royal . Hospital. The surgeon who performed the procedure said ulcers were a known risk of the operation, but told the hearing at Bolton Coroner's Court it was unusual for them to occur such a long time after. On the day of her death in November last year, Miss Hedgecock’s father, Philip, travelled to her house in Walkden, Greater Manchester, and realised the door was locked from the inside. He rang the police before going in through the back door. When officers arrived he asked them to look upstairs where they found Ms Hedgecock in the bathroom. An ambulance was called but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Surgeon: Professor Basil Ammori, who performed the procedure, told the inquest it was unusual for patients to suffer ulcers so long after the operation . Miss Hedgecock, who had been working at Salford Royal Hospital, was described by her father as a 'popular lady' who had many friends and loved karaoke. The inquest heard she had been overweight for most of her adult life and in October 2008, she decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery at Salford Royal Hospital. The surgery re-routes the digestive system past most of the stomach so the person requires a lot less food to feel full. Miss Hedgecock lost 14 stone (88 kgs) after her operation. The surgery was carried out by Professor Basil Ammori who told the inquest: 'She was reviewed in May 2009 and there were no problems, her body mass index dropped so she was no longer morbidly obese and was now in the moderately overweight category.' Found: Miss Hedgecock was found in the bathroom of her home in Walkden, Greater Manchester, last year . Prof Ammori said: 'According to my research the risk of ulcers happening after gastric bypass surgery is one in 120 and this usually happens in the first 18 months.' Coroner Geoffrey Saul recorded a narrative verdict, confirming Ms Hedgecock died at home from peritonitis. He said: 'She died from a late complication from gastric bypass surgery.' Speaking after the inquest, her father, Mr Hedgecock said: 'There is no blame attached at all and after the surgery Elise had a better quality of life. 'She was dearly loved and will be sorely missed.' Tribute: Speaking after the inquest at Bolton Coroner's Court, Phillip Hedgecock said: 'There is no blame attached at all and after the surgery Elise had a better quality of life'","Elise Ann Hedgecock, 35, suffered from a perforated ulcer after the surgery .

Britain's most tattooed man - who has changed his name to The King of Inkland -  has spent £6,000 getting some removed because he has run out of space on his skin and wants to 'start again'. Matthew Whelan, from Birmingham, has covered his whole body with ink, including an eyeball, but now believes he looks out of date.

But he has now decided that after almost two decades he needs to refresh his collection. 'I think of myself like an art gallery.

'I've had enough of them and I've run out of skin to tattoo on - so I thought why not get them lasered off and just start again'. Life-changing: The tattoo-obsessive, pictured right before he changed his appearance, had first one at 16 - but says he had a passion for them from the age of nine . Procedure: The King of Inkland has spent £6,000 getting some removed - having spent £30,000 putting them on in the first place . Mr Whelan has spent £6,000 getting £500 worth of tattoos removed on his hand, arm and shin but he still has £30,000 worth of tattoos on the rest of his body. Over the past two months he has undergone six sessions to have old tattoos removed- a procedure which is painful and lengthy. He said: 'I can finally see the skin underneath and the laser process is a gruelling one. My skin is currently blistered- but that's good because it means it is healing.' The King of Inkland has now started planning his next set of tattoos which he is anxious to get in place of the ones he has removed. 'Some of my friends think I'm bonkers, and it might seem odd to some people but to me I am a living canvas,' he said. 'I can't wait for the day to put new artwork in their place. It would be tomorrow if I had my way however I have to wait until the treatment to see when it completely heals.' Varied: Snakes, scorpions, eyeballs and vampires are among the illustrations on his skin . Close up: Mr Whelan's face is unchanged but tattoos have gone from his hand, shin and arm . Relaxed: Mr Whelan has been a volunteer for his local Liberal Democrat MP and was a former wrestler . Mr Whelan says body modification is a culture, a way of life and almost a religion. But he also is a political animal, having regularlary volunteered at the office of Liberal Democrat MP John Hemmings in Yardley, in Birmingham. He is also a former wrestler. He says he has wanted tattoos since the age of nine after seeing his father's and his uncle's. Snakes, scorpions, eyeballs and vampires are among the illustrations he has chosen has one of his eyeballs tattooed black. 'When I die I want to leave my body to a museum or a member of my family,' he last year. 'There's someone in Canada who has already asked if he can have my skull to use as a paint pot.'","Matthew Whelan, 34, has covered himself in ink, including his eyeball .

"By . Leon Watson . Almost half of Britons don't realise their choice of diet could protect them against cancer, but blame the disease on a 'throw of the dice', say experts. Forty-nine per cent do not know that diet affects people's risk of getting cancer, the poll found. Other results show even more - three out of five Britons - did not know that body weight was linked to cancer, with overweight and obese people more at risk. A study has found 49 per cent of Brits do not know that diet affects people's risk of getting cancer. Pictured here is a human cancer cell . Around two thirds of people questioned were unaware of links between processed meat and lack of physical activity, and the disease. A third incorrectly believe the chances of getting cancer are mainly due to family history of the disease even though only five to ten per cent of cancers are linked to inherited genes. The YouGov survey of 2,000 Britons was carried out for World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), a charity which promotes ways of preventing the disease. Experts say modern lifestyles are fuelling the rise of the disease, including alcohol, lack of exercise and being overweight. According to official figures, most people are overweight or obese in England. This includes 61.9 per cent of adults and 28 per cent of children aged between 2 and 15. Amanda McLean, World Cancer Research Fund's General Manager, said the findings showed many myths about cancer were still widely believed, instead of people taking personal responsibility for reducing their risk. (File picture) Experts say modern lifestyles are fuelling the rise of the disease, including alcohol, lack of exercise and being overweight . She said: 'On World Cancer Day 2014 it's very alarming to see that such a large number of people don't know that there's a lot they can do to significantly reduce their risk of getting cancer. 'We would like all sectors of society - including the government, manufacturers, retailers and charities - work together to raise cancer prevention awareness. 'In the UK, about a third of the most common cancers could be prevented through being a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet and being regularly physically active. 'These results show that many people still seem to mistakenly accept their chances of getting cancer as a throw of the dice. But by making lifestyle changes today, we can help prevent cancer tomorrow.' Previous research by WCRF suggested almost 80,000 Britons each year could avoid getting one of 12 major cancers if they adopted healthier lifestyles. It said two out of five cases could be prevented if those with the worst diets, drinking and exercise habits adopted healthier habits for life. Almost half of breast cancer cases could be avoided if women drank less, ate healthier foods and exercised more, it found. As a result 20,000 women a year would probably not develop breast cancer by adopting a healthier lifestyle from an early age. World Cancer Research Fund, alongside the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), said there were four steps to help to reduce the risk of developing cancer: . * Eat a healthy diet with lots of vegetables, fruit, pulses and wholegrains. * Limit alcohol and red meat and try to cut out processed meat. * Keep your weight at a healthy level (Body Mass Index of between 18.5 and 25) because being overweight is the biggest cancer risk factor after smoking. * Be physically active for at least 30 minutes every day. Activity can be divided over the day and should increase breathing and heart rate. The recommendations were developed by a panel of world-renowned scientists, after considering a detailed report on the links between lifestyle and cancer that examined all relevant scientific evidence. Cary Adams, Chief Executive Officer at UICC, said 'Governments around the world, including the UK, must recognise the growing cancer burden in their country and act on it now. 'On World Cancer Day, we demand that health leaders commit to reducing the millions of predicted, needless and premature deaths caused by cancer by focusing efforts and funds on proven preventive and early detection measures.'","Three out of five Britons did not know weight was linked to cancer .

"By . James Rush . Oscar Pistorius was expected to take to the stand today to testify at his murder trial but court was immediately adjourned because one of the judge's two assessors was unwell in hospital. The double-amputee Paralympic champion is facing 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder for killing lover Reeva Steenkamp. Defence lawyers for the runner, who is the only eyewitness in the case, were due to begin their case today after four weeks of prosecution-led testimony.

The world-famous athlete pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and also not guilty to three other firearm-related counts. After prosecutors wrapped up their case against the Olympian this week, one of the defence lawyers said Pistorius would likely testify. Legal experts say Pistorius, 27, is expected to testify because he has admitted killing Steenkamp, 29, and must explain to the court why so it can take his version into account.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Osama bin Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith has been convicted of conspiring to kill Americans for his role as the terror group's spokesman. Known as the voice of fiery al Qaeda propaganda videotapes after the September 11 attacks, Abu Ghaith had the verdict handed down after five hours of deliberation. He was the highest-ranking al Qaeda figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the attacks. Guilty: Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and spokesman, has been convicted of conspiring to kill Americans though his sentence has not yet been determined . The Kuwaiti imam had testified during a . three-week New York trial that he answered bin Laden's request in the . hours after the attacks to speak on the widely circulated videos used to . recruit new followers willing to go on suicide missions like the 19 who . hijacked four planes on Septenber 11, 2001. 'The storm of airplanes will not stop,' Abu Ghaith was heard warning in an October 2001 video that was played for the jury. Also shown repeatedly to the jury during the trial were frames of a video made September 12, 2001, that showed Abu Ghaith seated next to bin Laden and two other top al Qaeda leaders as they tried to justify the attacks. On Monday, during closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan underscored the importance of Abu Ghaith's post 9/11 status. 'Going to that man was the very first thing Osama bin Laden did on September 11 after the terror attacks,' he said. 'The defendant committed himself to al Qaeda's conspiracy to kill Americans, and he worked to drive other people to that conspiracy.' Mouthpiece: Frames of a video made September 12, 2001 (pictured) were shared in court showing Abu Ghaith seated next to bin Laden and two other top al-Qaida leaders as they tried to justify the attacks . He added: 'During the most important period of time in al-Qaida's savage history, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was Osama bin Laden's principal messenger. ... He used his fiery oratory to incite al Qaeda's growing army of terror in this war with America.' The jury returned a verdict on three charges: conspiracy to kill Americans, conspiring to provide support to al Qaeda and providing support to al Qaeda. The charges carry a potential penalty of life in prison. Captured in Jordan last year and brought to New York, Abu Ghaith has actively participated in his trial. He listened to testimony and arguments through headphones linked to an Arabic translator. Taking the witness stand in his own defense, Abu Ghaith in a calm voice denied he was an al Qaeda recruiter and claimed his role was a religious one aimed at encouraging all Muslims to rise up against their oppressors. He insisted he agreed to meet with bin Laden in a cave on the night of September 11 out of respect for bin Laden's standing as a sheik. 'Despite knowing that he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans, you met with him to be polite, correct?' prosecutor Michael Ferrara asked on cross-examination. 'I didn't go to meet with him to bless . if he had killed hundreds of Americans or not. I went to meet with him . to know what he wanted,' Abu Ghaith said. Government . witnesses included an FBI agent who interviewed him on a 10-hour flight . to the United States and a Buffalo, New York-area man who testified . that he heard him speak in Afghanistan several months before the . September 11 attacks. Another . witness was a British man who was supposed to join Richard Reid in a . shoe-bomb attack in December 2001 but who quit the conspiracy during a . trip home after his parents warned him that he better not be a . terrorist. Defending himself: Abu Ghaith, shown during his tesimony on March 19, denied he was an al Qaeda recruiter and claimed his role was a religious one aimed at encouraging all Muslims to rise up against their oppressors . He did not know Abu Ghaith, but prosecutors introduced the evidence to show Abu Ghaith knew what he was talking about when he warned that air attacks against the United States would continue. Abu Ghaith's defense lawyer, Stanley Cohen, argued there was 'zero evidence' that the 48-year-old former teacher knew of the conspiracies the government claimed he knew about. Citing the videos of his client, Cohen warned jurors not to let prosecutors 'intimidate you and to frighten you into returning verdicts not based upon evidence, but fear'. Those videos, though, emerged as the centerpiece of the government's case. One — titled 'Convoy of Martyrs' — features Abu Ghaith preaching over horrific footage of a plane flying into one of the World Trade Center towers. Another showed the defendant looking at bin Laden admiringly as the al Qaeda leader boasted that he knew the attack would make both towers fall. Prosecutors used Abu Ghaith's testimony and closing arguments as an opportunity to reshow the image of the burning towers to jurors. In his closing, Cronan used the defendant's testimony against him. 'Accept it as totally true. If you do that, he's guilty,' Cronan said.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith has been convicted on three terror charges .

"By . Associated Press . and Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . A search of a park for an 8-year-old girl who has been missing for nearly a month is now a 'recovery operation,' although District of Columbia police haven't given up hope of finding the child alive, Chief Cathy Lanier said Thursday. A day after Relisha Tenau Rudd was last seen on March 1 in the district, suspect Kahlil Malik Tatum bought a carton of 42-gallon contractor trash bags at a store in Washington and was seen in the area of the Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, Lanier said. 'We can't ignore the possibility he may have killed her,' Lanier said at a news conference at the park. Scroll down for video . What happened to Relisha? Relisha Tenau Rudd (left), 8, has been missing since March 1 when police believe she was abducted by a janitor, 51-year-old Kahlil Malik Tatum (right) Wanted man: This undated handout image provided by the FBI shows the wanted poster for Tatum . Tatum, 51, was a janitor at the city homeless shelter where Relisha lived with her mother. The girl's repeated absences from school led authorities last week to look for her, although her family had not reported her missing. The morning after the search began, police found Tatum's wife, 51-year-old Andrea Tatum, dead in a motel room in nearby Oxon Hill, Maryland. Tatum is charged with fatally shooting her in the head. A charging document says Andrea Tatum's daughter told authorities her mother was having domestic problems with her husband and was contemplating leaving him. Digital billboards along the East Coast from Maryland to Georgia are displaying photos of Relisha and Tatum. FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin said the agency is 'casting a wide net' for Tatum. Accused killer: Tatum has been charged with killing his wife before allegedly taking off with Rudd . Crime scene: Police tape block the entrance to a motel in Oxon Hill, Maryland March 20, where officers found the body Tatum's wife . Caretaker: Police say Relisha's parents passed the child into the care of Tatum, a janitor working at the homeless shelter where the family have been stay,  February 26 . Caught on camera: The FBI released this video showing Relisha and Tatum walking in a hallway of a Holiday Inn Express hotel in DC on February 26 . Relisha's parents passed the child into the care of Tatum, whom the family got to know over an 18-month period while they were staying at a DC homeless shelter. According to police, Relisha's mother, 27-year-old Shamika Young, asked the 51-year-old janitor to look after her daughter February 26. Miss Young was living in the homeless shelter at the former D.C. General Hospital with four of her children and their stepfather. ‘He was a good man, never got a bad vibe about him or salty taste in my mouth about him,’ Antonio Wheeler, Relisha’s stepfather, said of Tatum. The little girl was last seen alive March 1. A day later, Tatum was spotted buying a box of trash bags. The janitor continued going to work at the homeless shelter through March 20, Police Chief Lanier said. Fallen through the cracks: It has been revealed that Relisha missed about 30 days of classes at Payne Elementary School prior to her disappearance . Paging 'Dr Tatum': Police say the 51-year-old janitor pretended to be Relisha's doctor as part of a plot concocted by the girl's family to get her out of school . Officers obtained a search warrant last Thursday and went to the Red Roof Inn, where they discovered Andrea Tatum's body in a room. Her husband’s white truck was in the motel's parking lot. Shamika Young initially did not report her daughter missing and told officers she had spoken to her on the phone as recently as last week. However, it has since been revealed that Young met with Tatum and asked him to return Relisha, but he refused. On Thursday, law enforcement officials announced that they have suspended the search for Relisha at Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens in Northeast DC, MyFox Atlanta reported. So far, the search has yielded no clues as to the missing girl's whereabouts, but police are expected to continue scouring the area Friday. A search of a park in DC has yielded no clues so far, but police will continue what they are calling a 'recovery mission' Friday . Tatum was added to the FBI's Most Wanted List Wednesday. A day earlier, the federal agency released a video showing Tatum and Relisha walking down the hallway of a Holiday Inn Express in DC on February 26. Seeking Relisha: The child is 4-foot-1, weighing 70-80 pounds with black hair and brown eyes . According to news reports, Tatum had posed as a doctor to get Relisha out of class by taking calls from her elementary school teacher and claiming that the 8-year-old was sick. Investigators said that Relisha's mother, grandmother and Tatum were in cahoots in an effort to mislead the administration of Payne Elementary School, where the girl had racked up 30 absences. When questioned by police, Shamika Young reportedly said that her daughter was traveling with ‘Dr Tatum’ to a medical conference in Atlanta, where the janitor is believed to have ties. The 27-year-old mother could potentially face obstruction of justice charges for failing to report her daughter missing and assuring everyone that Relisha was in a ‘safe place,’ the Washington Post reported. Relisha is about 4ft tall and weighs between 70 and 80 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. Tatum is described as a 5-foot-7 man weighing about 170lbs. He has a distinctive tattoo on his left upper arm. A total reward of $70,000 is being offered by FBI and other groups for information leading to Tatum's arrest and Relisha’s recovery.","Relisha Tenau Rudd, 8, was last seen alive March 1; next day, Kahlil Tatum, 51, was seen buying box of contractor trash bags .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Britons' waistlines are getting bigger – and people living in the Midlands are battling the bulge more than the rest of us. For new statistics suggest that Birmingham men are the most rotund around the middle, while ladies in the East Midlands are wider than their counterparts around the UK. The figures, released by the virtual fitting room company Fits.me, also have some startling health implications – and paint a worrying picture for the future. Map showing the average waist size of men and women in the UK, by region . To avoid a massively raised risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes, men's waistlines should be no bigger than 37 inches and women's no more than 32. But many men underestimate by up to two inches, say experts . Fat around the waist has been found to be worse for our health than fat on the bottom and hips, in terms of the risk of heart disease, cancer, infertility and cancer. Not only is the fat nearer our vital organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys, but abdominal fat cells are more active than those around the thighs and bottom, producing toxic substances that can . cause damage. So body shape, and where we carry excess fat, is just as important as overall weight. The British Heart Foundation says that men should have a waistline of no more than 37 inches – after this, the risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes rises significantly. Women should have a waist measurement of no more than 32 inches. But those in several regions other than the East Midlands – namely Northern Ireland, north east England, Wales and southern Scotland - were also found to have broken this benchmark. Birmingham men have the largest waistlines, while Brighton chaps are the slimmest . Even their counterparts in the South East, who had the lowest average measurement, were close to the threshold at 31.3 inches. In men, the average was 35.8 inches. Brighton chaps were the slimmest, with an average waist size of 35.08 inches. The figures come from analysis of the measurements of 50,000 UK men who have submitted their own measurements to one of Fits.me’s virtual fitting rooms. The company's 'fitting rooms' are used by several retailers such as Hawes & Curtis and Thomas Pink, to help their customers buy the right size of garment when shopping online. However previous research casts doubt . on whether, relatively speaking, men do have slimmer waists than women, . as these figures suggest. A study last year from the British Heart Foundation found that men underestimate the size of their waist by as much as two inches . The survey found that the average British man estimated that they had a waist size of 35.8 inches, more than two inches smaller than English and Scottish national averages [37.9 and 38 inches respectively]. Ninety per cent of the 1,000 men surveyed by the charity even admitted that they didn't know how to measure their waist properly. Almost half thought they could measure just above the hips - resulting in an inaccurately small measurement. Only one in eight knew the correct method, which involves measuring at the midpoint between their ribs and the top of the hips. And just one in six men admitted to having a 40 inch-plus waist - half the actual number classed officially as having a high-risk waist size. My Big Greek Waistline: Internationally, Greek men were found to have the largest waistlines, shortly followed by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Pictured: Greek music and dance duo Stavros Flatley . Internationally, Greece leads the way . for the chunkiest waistlines, followed by Turkey and Saudi Arabia. British men measure in at a . respectable 58th out of 81 countries in which data was collected, with . the global average waist measurement being 36.4 inches. Japan has the . slimmest men, at an average 33.2 inches. The . largest female waist measurements are in Nigeria (32.5in) and Serbia the thinnest . (28.2in). At 31.7inches, the UK’s ladies rank 11th (out of 85), with a . global average for women of 30.1 inches. Data was also collected for other measurements, such as chest and neck size. The average collar size for men in the UK was 16.03. This too has health implications: a collar size of 17 increases the risk of snoring and sleep apnoea – where you stop breathing while asleep. This too raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. ‘The best thing to do is lose some weight if your BMI is classed as obese (30 or more) or you have a collar size of 17 or more,’ says Mr Elliot Benjamin, a consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in London. ‘A large amount of weight increases pressure on your neck, so your airways are more likely to collapse and you will snore. Reducing that pressure by losing weight can make big difference.’","Men in Birmingham have the biggest waist measurements, followed by those in Belfast and Sheffield .

The couple had been planning the . wedding for a couple of weeks, according to TMZ, but news of the . ceremony drew criticism from fellow American footballers. Buffalo Bills linebacker Brandon . Spikes claimed on Twitter the wedding was an attempt by Rice 'to save his image'. The . 27-year-old had been arrested over allegations of domestic violence on .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Marvellous memories are often attributed to elephants, but scientists have discovered that plants can also learn and remember – even though they do not have a brain. Scientists claim fern-like plants that respond to touch have learned that water droplets are not harmful and remember the finding weeks afterwards. Their research suggests that experience teaches plants to learn details to survive and could lead to scientists viewing flora in a new way. Scientists claim fern-like plants Mimosa pundica (pictured) that respond to touch, learned that water droplets are not harmful in an experiment and remember the lesson for weeks afterwards . Mimosa pudica is also called the sensitive plant, sleepy plant and the touch-me-not. Its leaves fold inwards and droop when touched or shaken to protect it from predators and re-open minutes later. The species is native to South America and Central America. It is known for its rapid plant movement as the foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light. The leaves also close when touched, warmed, blown-upon or shaken - known as seismonastic movements. The movement occurs when specific regions of cells lose turgor pressure, which is the force that is applied onto the cell wall by water within cells. When the plant is disturbed, specific regions on the stems are stimulated to release chemicals including potassium ions which force water out of the cells and the water diffuses out of the cells, producing a loss of cell pressure and cell collapse. This differential stiffness between regions of cells, leads to the closing of the leaflets. The researchers studied Mimosa pudica, which folds inwards when touched to protect itself from predators. The University of Western Australia study, which also involved Professor Stefano Mancuso at the University of Florence in Italy, found the action is not simply a reflex. They examined the species’ short and long-term memories under both high and low light environments by repeatedly dropping water on the plants using a custom-designed apparatus to look at their response. The strange fauna stopped curling up once it learned that the water was not a threat to its survival and no damage was done, according to the study, which was published in the journal Oecologia. Mimosa plants were able to acquire the learnt behaviour in a matter of seconds and as in animals, learning was faster in low light. ‘Most remarkably, these plants were able . to remember what had been learned for several weeks, even after . environmental conditions had changed,' the researchers said. The study shows that Mimosa pudica plants can learn and remember just as well as it would be expected of animals, but of course, they do it all without a brain. The study shows that Mimosa pudica plants can learn and remember just as well as it would be expected of animals, but of course, they do it all without a brain. The findings may make some think of J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Ents' in Lord of the Rings (pictured) that are trees that can think and talk . While the scientists are unsure who . the plant learns and remembers, they think it might be down to a . calcium-based signally network in its cells, which are in some ways . similar to animals’ memory process. The . research radically changes the way humans perceive plants and the . boundaries between plants and animals, including our definition of . learning as a property special to organisms with a nervous system, the . scientists said. Dr Monica Gagliano, an Australian Research Council research fellow at the university’s Centre for Evolutionary Biology, who led the study, only recently published a paper that claims plants can ‘talk’ using sounds. The research at the university suggests that plants have abilities widely used by animals and seen in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, where  fictional Ents -  a race of beings which resemble trees that are ancient shepherds of the forest - are able to think and talk. Chatterboxes: It is claimed sagebrush plants (pictured) send chemical messages through the air . A previous study in 2009 found that members of the vegetable kingdom can communicate with each other. They are 'capable of more sophisticated behaviour than we imagined,' says American bug expert Professor Richard Karban. His work, which he admits is 'controversial', suggested that plants converse by sending chemical messages through the air, warning of hungry predators. When a neighbouring plant 'hears' the message, it boosts its defences against grasshoppers, caterpillars and other invaders, he believes. Professor Karban, of the University of California, claimed to have proved that conversations happen between sagebrush bushes - hardy, yellow-flowered shrubs native to the western U.S. Using scissors, he clipped away at leaves and stems of potted shrubs, damaging them in the same way as a grasshopper would. He then planted some damaged and undamaged plants in a field and measured levels of predation on their neighbours. The leaves of the plants with clipped neighbours suffered the least grasshopper damage, according to the journal Ecology Letters.","Scientists from the University of Western Australia found Mimosa pudica plants can learn and remember as well as some animals .

"By . Louise Boyle . and Joshua Gardner . A wealthy Minnesota couple who've been on the lam since they were accused of bilking two states out of nearly $200K in welfare benefits had an astounding $3 million stashed away in various bank accounts when they were caught, it was revealed Friday. Colin . Chisholm III, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, of Deephaven, . Minnesota, have been charged with wrongfully obtaining $165,000 between 2005 and 2012 from various government assistance . programs, some while living aboard a yacht in Florida. The couple claimed to be wealthy . Scottish aristocrats while living in the community of Deephaven, Minnesota, where authorities pledged this week to do everything in their power to bring them to justice. 'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida . The couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus and beach property in Florida . 'These were rich folks ripping off the . system,' Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced at a press . conference Friday. 'I will make sure they do hard time.' While probation is the lightest sentence allowable for the charges of welfare fraud, Freeman vowed to push for prison time, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. 'I can’t imagine a judge in this district allowing the Lord and Lady to get probation,' Freeman quipped. The maximum sentence is a $100,000 fine and 20 years behind bars. Along with the . million-dollar yacht called the Andrea Aras, the couple have a grand, . six-bedroom lakeside home, a beach property in Florida and a $30,000 . Lexus, investigators found. Colin . Chisholm III, claims he is from a long line of Scottish aristocracy and . is a wealthy broadcasting executive, according to court filings. The couple are still at large after a search was launched by law enforcement last month. Tough sentence: Hennepin County, Minnesota Attorney Mike Freeman announced at a press conference Friday. 'I will make sure they do hard time.' The Chisholms also had $3 million in bank accounts which they failed to declare, according to Hennepin County Attorney's office. The couple were receiving public assistance for their medical care and food stamps in Minnesota for years while also allegedly collecting welfare in Florida. According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps. Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be desitute. In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with. Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, of Deephaven, Minnesota, have been charged with wrongfully obtaining $165,000 in welfare and are still at large . Colin Chisholm did not declare that he ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank . According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean. More than $1 million dollars flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states. The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005. However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim. In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker. Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home. They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views. The home, built in 1909, is believed to have six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres. None of these details were declaired on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her elderly grandmother. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said on Friday: 'It is truly outrageous when persons of considerable means steal from the government and all of us taxpayers through abusing the social welfare system. 'We will prosecute this case with all the capacity we have.' Hennepin County’s Human Services and Public Health Department terminated all welfare benefits to the Chisholms at the end of March 2012. Prosecutors will ask that the judge be allowed to impose a longer sentence than the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines call for because the Chisholms committed a major economic offense. The couple moved to a lakefront property on Lake Minnetonka in 2008 - all the while raking in thousands in welfare payments .","Colin Chisholm III and his wife .

Police believe Jose Miguel Tamayo, 32, murdered his girlfriend Carolina Bernal Gomez, 30, after discovering she was carrying a child. Her remains are believed to have been fed to the birds at the only nature reserve in Europe which is home to wild vultures north of Madrid. It is thought the man fed his girlfriend's corpse to wild vultures in a nature reserve north of Madrid. (File photo) The couple's relationship was reportedly stormy before Ms Bernal Gomez, from South America, fell pregnant. It is thought the butcher attacked his girlfriend when he heard the news, and took her body apart after realising he had killed her. Police were suspicious as the man waited several weeks before reporting his her missing, and then offered contradictory statements to investigators in the capital. 'The victim had not lodged any complaint of ill-treatment at any time . and it seems as if it was a spur of the moment killing,' said the deputy . minister in Guadalajara, Juan Pablo Herranz. Vultures are known for being able to sniff out dead flesh from up to a mile away, though most birds have no sense of smell. The creatures are able to detect sulphurous chemical compounds found in decaying meat from their sky vantage point, and tend to circle around towards the ground until they have sourced the origin of the scent.","Jose Miguel Tamayo has been arrested in Madrid .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Rt Revd Malcolm McMahon says scores of children living in poverty are going into school hungry every day and falling behind in lessons because of it . Children living in poverty are going to school hungry every day and falling behind in lessons because of it, one of Britain's leading Catholic Bishops has said. According to the Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon, the Bishop of Nottingham, the problem is being 'masked by a veneer of respectability' in redeveloped city centres because impoverished families are too ashamed of the stigma of not having enough to eat. The Bishop, who was last week appointed the Archbishop of Liverpool, is also chairman of the Catholic Education Service which oversees one in 10 schools in England and Wales attended by nearly 840,000 pupils. He said teachers observed deprivation on a daily basis. He told The Independent: 'There is a poverty which we witness every day in our schools.' His views were echoed by the Children's Commissioner for England, Maggie Atkinson, who in a separate interview, warned young people were being hit hardest by the Government's austerity programme. 'The poorest families, and therefore their children, are paying the price now,' she said. 'We did in-depth analysis on the welfare bill. Families, parents with children, especially where there was already economic pressure on the households, would be ill-served by the welfare reforms, she told Total Politics magazine. The Archbishop-elect said problems persisted despite vast levels of public investment, saying poorer children cannot keep up with their wealthier counterparts because of 'embarrassment and hunger'. He said the problem was masked in cities like Liverpool which, because of regeneration, look prosperous but are in reality masking an underbelly of poverty. In Liverpool, where a third of all children come from poor families, more than £1bn-worth of regeneration projects started last year. The city's mayor, Joe Anderson said regeneration was key to helping cities become prosperous and invited the Bishop to visit and see the area's efforts to create investment and jobs first-hand. The problem is particularly acute in cities like Liverpool, where vast regeneration programmes add a 'veneer of prosperity', according to the Bishop .","Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon says redeveloped cities mask scale of problem .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A teenaged Oklahoma race car driver who’s physical burns and the unthinkable loss of the fellow racer who pulled her from fiery wreckage says she musty bravely race on in her hero’s name. Harli White, 18, battled past excruciating physical pain in the aftermath of her 2008 crash only to have her savior-turned-mentor Donnie Ray Crawford slain at the hand of his own grandfather. Now, White has vows that she’s in the race for life, both for herself and for Donnie. Brave: Harli White (left) grew an instant bond with fellow race car driver Donnie Ray Crawford (right) after he rescued her from burning wreckage when she was just 12. More traumas and heartache followed, but the now 18-year-old remains dedicated to her sport . 'I try to honor him by doing the best that I can do, and by winning as many races as I can,' Harli told ESPN in a documentary special detail the Lindsay, Oklahoma teen’s unbelievable tale of tragedy and triumph. In her very first competitive race, at the age of 12, Harli’s midget sprint car spun into a wall. Within seconds, she said, she was surrounded by fire. Minutes passed and Harli’s injuries worsened. Her father tried desperately to get her out but she was stuck and her fate seemed sealed. And it was sealed, insomuch as it was to be entwined forever with that of Donnie Ray Crawford. Crawford was 20 at the time and waiting in his own car for the next race when he heard the panicked call over his radio about a horrible fire. Unbelievable: After hearing of the fire on his radio as he wanted in his car for the next race, Donnie ran and leaped into the flames to save her with no regard for his own safety and they both made it through alive . Agonizing: Harli suffered burns across 40 percent of her body but lived to race again and become fast friends with Donnie and his family . The rising midget circuit star sprang into action. While wearing his fire retardant jump suit,  to rescue a girl he’d never met. 'He was just seeing a big ball of fire and he ran right straight in the middle of it,' Harli's dad Charlie said in an ESPN special about his daughter called Forged by Fire. 'Not knowing if it was going to explode again, not knowing if he was going to come out of it, not knowing if the person inside was alive or dead. He just knew that there was somebody in trouble.' Senseless: On January 14, 2012, another tragedy struck. Donnie's mentally ill live-in grandfather Daniel Garcia (left), for no apparent reason, shot and killed Donnie. He was also killed in the ensuing struggle with Donnie's mom and dad . Harli was saved and she had Donnie to thank, but he wanted none of it. 'He didn't want the credit for it. He just said he was a vessel,' said his mother Jodie. The two families would become close friends and Donnie and Harli raced as friendly competitors for the next three years. 'It hit me so hard,' Harli said. 'He is my hero...he saved my life, but yet he's gone?' Then another tragic race day came on January 14, 2012, only this time the tragedy struck before the race. As they all got ready for a race that day, one Harli would race in, Donnie’s mentally ill live-in grandfather Daniel Garcia shot and killed Donnie. There was a struggle as Jodie and her husband got her father down to the floor. ‘At one point, we all three had our hands on the gun, and we were just kind of in a standstill motion. We were frozen, all three of us. I looked over at Donnie Ray ... and the way he was laying, he was looking straight at us,’ the stricken mother said. Garcia was dead, as well. The Crawfords had senselessly lost their son, aged just 24, and Harli had lost her mentor. 'It hit me so hard,' Harli said. 'He is my hero...he saved my life, but yet he's gone?' The intrepid teen has channel all her grief and pain into winning races, the way the talented Donnie would have wanted. The Crawfords and the Whites have grown apart without Donnie around to get them out to races. But Jodie and her husband made it out to watch Harli clench the OCRS sprint car season championship in Wainwright, Oklahoma and become her region's first female titleholder. In a way, watching Harli win allowed the Crawfords to see Donnie win again. 'We have to look at her as our miracle,’ said Jodie. ‘We have to look at her as part of Donnie Ray.’ Harli has vowed to race on in Donnie's name. 'I try to honor him by doing the best that I can do, and by winning as many races as I can,' she said .","Oklahoma girl Harli White was seriously burned across 40 percent of her body but lived to race again thanks to the heroics of Donnie Ray Crawford .

Due to the chaos on the roads after the winter storm, eight-months-pregnant Katie Norman Horne and her three-year-old son had been sitting in their unmoving car all Tuesday evening, with no water and only a box of Tic-Tacs to eat. Finally their luck changed when 25-year-old Craig Catalfu - who had been alerted to their situation thanks to a Facebook group called SnowedOutAtlanta - arrived in his all-wheel-drive truck to rescue them. Relief: Eight-months-pregnant Katie Norman Horne (right, with husband Kevin) had been in her car on an icy Atlanta interstate for 12 hours when she was finally rescued by a good Samaritan thanks to a Facebook group . Desperate times: She and her three-year-old son had no water and only a box of Tic-Tacs to eat when 25-year-old Craig Catalfu arrived in his all-wheel-drive truck to assist them . Mr Catalfu had written a post on the group offering assistance to anyone affected by the snowy conditions in the Smyrna, Georgia, area when one of the members responded: 'Craig pregnant woman at child at 285/75 [sic]'. When he arrived at the scene, he told Today.com that he witnessed the 'utter chaos' of the car-packed street, which he said resembled a 'parking lot'. He then assisted 33-year-old Mrs Horne - who had been nervous to drive while pregnant in unfamiliar conditions - by having her follow his car in hers, slowly guiding her through the turmoil and back to her home in Marietta. The whole ordeal, from when Mr Catalfu arrived at Mrs Horne's car to when they got back to her house, took three hours of driving at a cautious ten miles an hour. Reaching out: Mr Catalfu (left) had written a post on the group offering assistance to anyone in the Smyrna, Georgia, area when one of the members responded: 'Craig pregnant woman at child at 285/75 [sic]' A very grateful Mrs Horne, who works as a human resources consultant, said that she was surprised at how determined Mr Catalfu was to seek her out . 'Quite honestly, I'm pleasantly shocked by the kindness and goodness of strangers,' she said. 'Quite honestly, I'm pleasantly shocked by the kindness and goodness of strangers' 'I had never met Craig or any of these people who kept posting messages saying they were praying for me.' What's more, Mr Catalfu's timing couldn't have been better; once Mrs Horne got home to her husband Kevin, she began having Braxton Hicks contractions, which are a sign of dehydration. The SOS Facebook group was started by . Atlanta resident Michelle Sollicito after she noticed some friends . posting online about needing help and others offering help. Grateful: 'I'm pleasantly shocked by the kindness and goodness of strangers,' she said. 'I had never met Craig or any of these people who kept saying they were praying for me' Follow me: Mr Catalfu assisted Mrs Horne - who had been nervous to drive while pregnant in unfamiliar conditions - by having her follow his car in hers, slowly guiding her back to her home in Marietta . 'None of them had been matched up,' she explained. 'I created the group and it just snowballed, forgive the pun.' The group has been a savior for locals affected by the wet winter storm that hit much of the South on Tuesday, with temperatures dropping to the teens. The rare snowfall - which resulted in about two to three inches of snow - prompted thousands of flights to be cancelled and caused dozens of accidents on the roads, which were packed with commuters all trying to leave the city at once. As many as 15,000 schoolchildren across the South either slept on the buses that tried and failed to get them home, or on cots in school gymnasiums. All students made it home by Wednesday evening, officials said.","Katie Norman Horne and her three-year-old son sat in their unmoving car for 12 hours on Tuesday due to the chaos in Atlanta caused by the winter storm .

The new figures were released just days after more than 500 people were sentenced to death in Egypt. On Monday 529 supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi were sentenced to death in a ruling by an Egyptian court. The . group, members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, were convicted of a . number of charges, including killing a police officer and attempting to . murder others and were sentenced by a court in Minya, south of the . capital, Cairo. The ruling is a sharp escalation of Egypt’s crackdown on supporters of Morsi, which has seen thousands arrested and hundreds killed so far. The charity says that more than 109 death sentences were handed down in Egypt in 2013, although it was unable to confirm if judicial executions had taken place in the country during 2013. 'Little or no information was available in some countries - in particular Egypt, Eritrea, Malaysia, North Korea and Syria, due to restrictive state practice and/or political instability,' said the report.

However, Amnesty said that despite the increase in the number executions, there has been a decline in the number of countries using the death penalty over the last 20 years. Two decades ago, 37 countries carried out executions, compared to last year’s 22. Many countries who had carried out executions in 2012 did not implement death sentences last year - including Gambia, the UAE and Pakistan.

The Glowfaster sports jacket syncs with a runner’s smartphone and then uses lights to indicate whether they are running at the right pace. It can also make its lights flash in time to music to motivate runners to keep their pace and warns other pedestrians and vehicles of the runner’s whereabouts. Scroll down for video . The Glowfaster sports jacket (pictured) synchs with a runner's smartphone and then uses flashing lights to indicate whether they are running at the right pace . Lights: The jacket flashes lights to indicate if a person is running at the right pace. Built-in lighting strips can also flash in time to music to motivate a runner. They are held in place with 'double zip attachments' that can be swapped with another colour or upgraded. The lights are designed to help runners train more 'instinctively'. Design: The jacket is designed by Joanna Kent, who created clothes for Abercrombie and Fitch. App: An iPhone app works with the jacket to track a runner's performance. Runners can set goals, look at their biofeedback and stats from optional heart rate monitors. Music can be controlled via the app and games like the Bleep Test are compatible. Material: The jacket is waterproof, windproof, breathable and washable. Cost: £99 with 10% of profits going to charity. Ex-marine Simon Weatherall came up with the idea of the jacket, which has been designed by Joanna Kent, who has created clothes for Abercrombie and Fitch. The first prototype was a home-made jacket with lights stuck on with Velcro and sticky tape, but the garment now has zip-off lighting strips that react according to a runner’s performance, The Telegraph reported. The ‘double zip attachment’ means that people will be able to upgrade their lights or add different colours. The lighting pattern on the jacket lets runners recognise and respond ‘intuitively’ to feedback, according to the start-up, which originally set out to raise money on crowd-funding website Kickstarter. The company said: ‘Using our smart-jacket . can help you train more instinctively. It allows you to sync your . body’s biomarkers such as your heart rate, or measure speed versus . target via GPS, letting you know when you are at your target.’ A Glowfaster iPhone app (pictured) currently works with the jacket and an Android app will soon be added so that users can track their performance, look at biofeedback and set goals . Mr Weatherall claims that people respond naturally to lights on the jacket and are motivated by them, allowing themselves to go all-out when exercising. ‘You will continue to react and the biofeedback loop will keep your body and your motivation going. Your motivation and confidence will grow as your workout progresses,’ he said. The jacket has zip-off lighting strips that react according to a runner's performance.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . As the world was going about its business in July 2012, a solar storm of epic proportions was speeding through Earth's orbit. Researchers in California and China said a rapid succession of coronal mass ejections - intense eruptions on the Sun - that took place between 22 and 23 July caused a pulse of magnetised plasma to hurtle towards the planet. A study has now revealed that if these eruptions had taken place just nine days earlier, this solar blast would have smashed into Earth, potentially wiping out power supplies, phone signals and satellite communication. Scroll down for video . A succession of intense eruptions on . the sun, which took place between 22 and 23 July, pictured, caused a pulse of magnetised plasma to hurtle towards Earth.

Researchers in California and China said . a rapid succession of coronal mass ejections - intense eruptions on the . sun - that took place in July 2012 caused a pulse of magnetised . plasma to hurtle through Earth's orbit. The huge . outburst on the sun, on 22 July, propelled a magnetic cloud through the . solar wind at a peak speed of more than 1,242 miles per second (2,000 . km/s). This is four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm. It tore through Earth’s orbit but, luckily, Earth and the other planets were on the other side of the sun at the time. If the eruptions had taken place nine days earlier, Earth would have been directly in line with the ignition spot on the sun. Any . planets in the line of sight would have suffered severe magnetic storms . as the magnetic field of the outburst tangled with the planets’ own . magnetic fields. This has the potential to wipe out power supplies, phone signals and satellite communication. The researchers added Earth would have been 'enveloped in magnetic fireworks matching the largest magnetic storm ever reported on Earth, the so-called Carrington event of 1859.' The 1859 storm was so strong, the Northern . Lights were said to be . have been visible as far south as Hawaii. The Northern Lights predominantly appear in polar regions and are caused by the collision of energetic . charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind. Following the 1859 storm, telegraph services were disrupted worldwide. In a paper, published in the journal Nature Communications, former University of California Berkeley postdoctoral fellow and research physicist Ying D. Liu, and UC Berkeley research physicist Janet G. Luhmann reported their analysis of the magnetic storm, which was detected by Nasa’s Stereo A spacecraft. 'Had it hit Earth, it probably would have been like the big one in 1859, but the effect today, with our modern technologies, would have been tremendous,' said Luhmann. A study last year estimated the cost of a solar storm could reach $2.6 trillion worldwide. This image was captured on 23 July 2012 by Nasa's Stereo A spacecraft. It shows a coronal mass ejection leaving the sun at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per second (2,000 km/s) - four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm. It tore through Earth's orbit but the planet was on other side of the sun at the time . Arcs of plasma are shown rising on the surface of the sun in this Nasa image taken by the Stereo spacecraft. The arcs are superheated matter made up of moving charged particles. Most coronal mass ejections are more bulbous and wide, yet this is is quite narrow and contained . In 1859 a solar storm known as the Solar Superstorm, or Carrington Event named after Richard Carrington who . recorded it, saw numerous solar flares appear. From 28 August 28 to 2 September sunspots and solar flares were observed. British astronomer Carrington . observed the largest flare, which caused a major coronal mass ejection - . a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic field - to travel directly . toward Earth. It was so strong that the Northern . Lights - a natural light display that appears predominantly in that . Arctic and Antarctic regions caused by the collision of energetic . charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind - were said to be . have been visible as far south as Hawaii. Telegraph services were also disrupted. 'An extreme space weather storm - a solar superstorm - is a low-probability, high-consequence event that poses severe threats to critical infrastructures of the modern society,' warned Liu, who now works at the National Space Science Centre of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. 'The cost of an extreme space weather event, if it hits Earth, could reach trillions of dollars with a potential recovery time of 4-10 years. 'Therefore, it is paramount to the security and economic interest of the modern society to understand solar superstorms.' Based on their analysis of the 2012 event, Liu and Luhmann concluded that a huge outburst on the sun on 22 July propelled a magnetic cloud through the solar wind at a peak speed of more than 1,240 miles per second (2,000 km/s). This is four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm. It tore through Earth’s orbit but, luckily, Earth and the other planets were on the other side of the sun at the time. Any planets in the line of sight would have suffered severe magnetic storms as the magnetic field of the outburst tangled with the planets’ own magnetic fields. This diagram shows the route Nasa's Stereo spacecrafts take around the sun. Stereo is made up of two observatories - one ahead of Earth in its orbit, Stereo A, and  the other trailing behind, Stereo B. Scientists use the crafts to see the structure and evolution of solar storms as they blast from the sun . During the sun's cycle the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as Solar Maximum and Minimum. During Solar Maximum, solar activity is at its highest due to a flip, or reversal, of the sun's magnetic field, illustration pictured. This causes the sun's electromagnetic radiation to grows by around 0.1% . During the sun's cycle, the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as Solar Maximum and Solar Minimum. During Solar Maximum the amount of solar activity is at its highest due to a flip, or reversal, of the sun's magnetic field. Since . 1976 there have been three Solar Maximums and they occur roughly every . 11 years, although this can vary from between nine and 14 years. During . a Solar Maximum, large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun's . irradiance - or electromagnetic radiation - output grows by around 0.1 . per cent. This increase in energy can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns. 'The authors believe this extreme event was due to the interaction of two CMEs separated by only 10 to 15 minutes,' said Joe Gurman, project scientist for Stereo at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre. 'People keep saying that these are rare natural hazards, but they are happening in the solar system even though we don’t always see them,' Luhmann added. 'It’s like with earthquakes - it is hard to impress upon people the importance of preparing unless you suffer a magnitude 9 earthquake.' The goal of Stereo and other satellites probing the magnetic fields of the sun and Earth is to understand how and why the sun sends out these large solar storms and to be able to predict them during the sun’s 11-year solar cycle.

It seems that the ladies of Essex's love of all things beauty is rubbing off on their male co-stars. The latest TOWIE star to indulge in a spot of pampering is James 'Diags' Bennewith, who was so insecure about his skin that he shelled out £150 on beauty facials to banish his acne in an attempt to woo Fran Parman. The 21-year-old has suffered from acne in the past and was desperate to have clear skin so he could get a girlfriend on the ITV2 reality show. He underwent a red and blue LED light . therapy treatment to get rid of his spots prior to his first date with . Fran on the show last Sunday. The . 21-year-old TV star admitted that he was self-conscious about the acne . on his face but despite repeated attempts to shift it with spot creams . and avoiding eating greasy food, nothing had worked. James . said: 'I’ve had acne from the age of 14 and it’s a real pain. I’m a guy . so you just tend to deal with it but that doesn’t mean I’m happy about . it. 'I’ve . tried all sorts of spot creams but they don't really work, I was told . about this new treatment by a friend so I thought I would try it out. Scroll down for video . Did it work? Diags says he feels much more confident about his skin now and will be indulging in regular treatments . 'The treatment was really relaxing and didn’t hurt a bit and when I looked in the mirror afterwards I could see a difference right away. The spots were reduced and the other skin areas looked much better and brighter. 'A day later and the effects were even better; the redness had gone down further and they were much smaller. 'I’m going to try to have a treatment every week if I can and after 10 weeks, the acne should be gone.' Beauty fan: Diags underwent the £150 treatment, which uses LED light therapy, prior to his big date with Fran . The former university law student has previously been unlucky in love on The Only Way Is Essex ITV2 show, and has been eclipsed by cast-mates like Tom Pearce and Ricky Rayment. So before filming started for the new series - which aired last Sunday - Diags decided to take a more scientific approach to treating his skin and tried the latest combined LED light therapy and dermabrasion facial treatment - Skinbreeze. He went to London facialist Debbie Thomas for a course of treatments - that cost £145 - to clear his acne, which was especially prevalent on his right cheek. It seemed that his treatment worked - he and Fran couldn’t keep their . hands off each other as they watched the weigh-in for Lewis Bloor and . Elliot Wright’s boxing match. Wearing a pair of boxing gloves herself, Fran wrapped her arms around Diags and showered him with kisses throughout the evening.

"By . John Edwards . The old brigade are being pointed towards the exit at Old Trafford, and Patrice Evra is happy enough to be included among the veterans who have been made surplus to requirements by Manchester United manager David Moyes. The long-serving left-back may not be quite so pleased, however, to discover that age has counted against him over where he goes next. Inter Milan had him on their list of full-back targets, along with Arsenal’s Bacary Sagna, as they formulated plans to make at least three signings this summer. Surplus to requirements: Patrice Evra is expected to leave Manchester United, but may not end up at Inter . Snub: Bacary Sagna has decided not to make the move to Inter . Sagna’s decision to snub them, revealed in the Transfer Column earlier this week, appeared to leave the way clear for Evra to complete a dream move to the San Siro. But in a change of policy, new Inter president Erick Thohir has ruled that Evra, who turns 33 in May, is too old to be part of their recruitment drive. Thohir wants the accent to be on youth, and it now seems likely that 19-year old Ibrahima Mbaye will be given a chance at left-back after spending a successful season on loan at Livorno. The new approach leaves Evra pinning his hopes on Paris St Germain and Monaco for a fresh start in the summer. Target: Inter may turn to Ibrahima Mbaye, 19, who has impressed on loan at Livorno . New look: David Moyes will have to revamp his whole defence this summer . Roberto Martinez is beginning to talk up Everton’s prospects of overhauling Arsenal for the fourth Champions’ League spot with good reason – it holds the key to securing Romelu Lukaku on a permanent deal at the end of the season. Chelsea are likely to listen to offers for Lukaku in the summer, and Tottenham are showing a strong interest in taking him to White Hart Lane. But the big Belgium striker has settled in well on and off the pitch at Goodison Park and would not take much persuading to turn his season-long loan into a permanent deal. Permanent: Everton qualifying for the Champions League could encourage Romelu Lukaku to sign a permanent deal . Falling out: Lukaku angered Jose Mourinho earlier this season by saying he would consider staying at Everton . After upsetting Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho earlier this season by saying ‘stay at Everton – why not?’, he is wary of going public with his thoughts. But he has evidently made it clear in private that his dream would be to play Champions’ League football in the blue of Everton next season. Martinez would have to spend a large chunk of his £20million budget on making it happen, but no-one could dispute it would be money well spent after his impact so far on Merseyside. Chasing: Roberto Martinez is hot on the heels of Arsenal for the final Champions League spot . Nervy: Arsenal are six points clear of Everton but have played a game more - the two teams also play each other . Manuel Pellegrini is facing the galling prospect of being pipped by Real Madrid once more in a scramble for one of La Liga’s up-and-coming prospects. After heading for The Etihad Stadium last summer, as replacement for the sacked Roberto Mancini, he was desperate to return to his old club Malaga for attacking midfielder Isco. It became a straight fight with Real, which Pellegrini lost when the highly-rated playmaker headed for The Bernabeu in a £24million deal. Pipped: Manuel Pellegrini may miss out on Marco Asensio (below) with Real Madrid fighting for his signature . Hot property: Mallorca teenager Asensio has dazzled in the Segunda Liga . Now the emerging talent in question is 18-year old Real Mallorca winger Marco Asensio, and Pellegrini once more has his work cut out. The City manager is a huge admirer of Asensio’s dazzling wing play and feels he would have little difficulty adapting to the Barclays Premier League. But worrying for him, Real are already on the case and making plans to meet the teenager’s £3.3million release clause. It goes up to £7.4million next year, but Real are confident of acting before then and seeing off competition from a host of top European clubs headed by City. Selection: Isco decided to choose Real Madrid rather than join Pellegrini in Manchester . Ross McCormack has stayed loyal to Leeds United throughout this season’s escalating crisis and continued providing the sharpest of cutting edges, despite bids for him being rejected from the likes of West Ham, Cardiff City and Middlesbrough. He kept giving his all, even when West Ham and Cardiff had £5million deadline-day offers rebuffed in the January window and throughout the ensuing fiasco of manager Brian McDermott being sacked and reinstated in the space of 24 hours, amid uncertainty over who owned the club. His days at Elland Road do appear numbered, however, with several clubs jostling for position ahead of a summer scramble to sign him. Exit: Leeds United's star man Ross McCormack is being chased by a number of clubs . Turmoil: Leeds are currently stuck in a financial crisis with players not being paid on time . Crystal Palace, QPR and Fulham are leading the way, but Leeds may just have missed the boat over raking in some much-needed cash. Mindful of the Championship club’s parlous state, with the threat of administration hanging over them, the three London suitors are likely to offer only a fraction of the Scotland striker’s original valuation.","Patrice Evra may not move to Inter as new president wants to look to youth .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Sentenced to die: If the execution proceeds as scheduled, Michelle Byrom (pictured) will be the first woman to be killed by lethal injection in Mississippi since 1944 . A woman accused of murdering her husband is set to be the first female execution in Mississippi in 70 years even though her son has confessed to the killing four times. Michelle Byrom is scheduled to be executed on Thursday for the 1999 murder of her husband after prosecutors struck deals with her son who admitted to pulling the trigger and the man she allegedly hired to arrange the murder. Her husband Edward Byrom Sr was killed by a gunshot in his Iuka, Mississippi home in 1999 and state prosecutors made the case that she arranged to have him killed while she was in the hospital. Her son Edward Byrom Jr. has since confessed to killing his father in a fit of rage after his dad called him a 'b******, no good, mistake and telling me I'm inconciderate (sic) and just care about my self,' according to CNN. He made the confessions in letters riddled with spelling mistakes that he sent to her while she was in jail. 'He slaps me, then goes back to his room. As I sat on my bed, tears of rage flowing, remembering my childhood, my anger kept building and building,' her son wrote in one letter. The Jackson Free Press tells how the Tishomingo County sheriff's office decided to arrest 'Junior' for his connection to the murder-for-hire plot but they did not give him the most extreme charge. Even though he led authorities to the murder weapon and was the only one with gunpowder residue on his hands after the June 4, 1999 shooting, they argued that his mother was the mastermind behind the plot. Scroll down for video . Let out early: Edward Byrom Jr, Michelle's son, was released from prison in 2013 even though he confessed on four different occasions to being the one to shoot his father . Junior, whose age at the time was unreported, testified against his mother in exchange for a lighter sentence. He told investigators how she was going to pay his friend Joey Gillis $15,000 once she was granted access to her husband's life insurance policy if Gillis would be the one to kill him. Mental issues: Byrom, seen in this earlier undated photo, was being treated for ingesting rat poison at the time that her husband was shot dead in 1999 . 'When they got me here, I gave them a bulls*** story after another, trying to save my own ass, but when (Tishomingo County Sheriff) David Smith started questioning me, and told me what happened, I was so scared, confused, and high, I just started spitting the first thought out, which turned in to this big conspiracy thing, for money, which was all BS, that's why I had so many different stories,' Junior wrote in one of the three confessional letters ot his mother. Her advocates described Michelle as being a victim of both domestic violence and sex abuse, starting when she was a child and her stepfather allegedly forced her into prostitution and continuing when she started her relationship with Edward Byrom Sr when she was only 16 and he was 31. The Jackson Free Press reports that he abused her throughout their relationship and videotaped her when he forced her to have sex with other men. Their son, Junior, was born three years after they first got together and they married when the boy was 5-years-old. With his birth, Byrom Sr got a new target for his abuse. '(I) was fixing to go to bed when my dad . came in, and said, ""What do you think your [sic] doing coming in at this . time?"" and before I could answer, he shoves me down, and my back hits . the book shelf, and I begin to get up, and he grabs me and slaps me . twice, and says, 'You were a f****** mistake to begin with!' and shuts . my door and leaves... He was always like that,' Junior wrote in one . letter. Time running out: Michelle, who is now 56, has had a number of appeals but critical evidence- like her son's confessions- were not allowed to be taken into account . Michelle tried to leave her husband but he threatened her and beat her more. She developed unspecified mental disorders, and in the days leading up to his murder she tried to kill herself by ingesting poison. 'It just hasn't seem to gotten through that people in horribly abusive situations are doing things that don't look reasonable, like taking rat poison so she can stay in the hospital and get some temporary relief from the situation,' Warren Yoder from the Public Policy Center of Mississippi told the paper. 'That's not a strategy that looks reasonable, (but in the hospital) nobody's actually abusing her right this minute.' Abused: Both 'Junior' (pictured left and right) and his mother were physically abused- and his mother was sexually- by their father before Junior shot him in a fit of rage . Police questioned her about the murder while she was on prescribed medication and she did not confess. Only later at the police station when the detective said that her son had confessed and she should protect him did she repeat exactly what the detective told her about her son's confession. Multiple appeals have ruled with the original conviction as a result of key evidence- like the letters from her son and his original confession- being kept out of the trial as a result of specific legal wrangling. 'The majority of Mississippians support the death penalty because they think that people get fair trials and they think that they have competent attorneys representing them,' former state Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz Jr told CNN. 'In this case, she didn't have either one.' The only person who can commute the death sentence is the Governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant.","Michelle Byrom, 56, has been convicted of planning a murder-for-hire plot against her abusive husband who was shot dead in 1999 .

The adjustable device is codenamed Project Morpheus and features a head-mounted display with 1080p HD resolution and a 90-degree field of view, while sensors built into the headset track head movements. The Japanese firm unveiled the prototype device at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco but did not reveal when the product would go on sale, or how much its likely to cost. Scroll Down for Video . Sony unveiled its prototype virtual reality device, pictured, at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The adjustable device is codenamed Project Morpheus and features a head-mounted display with 1080p resolution and a 90-degree field of view . The announcement follows rumours Sony's console rival Microsoft is similarly working on a 'suite of virtual and augmented reality' systems for its Xbox One console. Multiple sources said to be familiar with Microsoft's plans told The Wall Street Journal the firm is developing 3D virtual reality devices, and looking to file numerous patents. Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, unveiled the black and white headset at the annual gathering of game designers. He said Sony had been working on the technology for more than three years. 'This prototype is by no means final,' said Yoshida. 'We will continue to work on this to improve it, but we believe it's a good representation of how PlayStation will deliver VR.' Anton Mikhailov, a senior software engineer working on Project Morpheus, said the current version of the technology must be attached to a PS4 console with a cord that's approximately 15ft (4.5 metres) long. Sensors built into the headset, pictured, can track a wearer's head movement along with a PlayStation 4 camera. In addition to seeing the view on the headset, a users' virtual perspectives will be simultaneously broadcast on a TV screen. The headset is in development and Sony did not announce prices or a release date . Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, pictured, said the company had been working on the technology for more than three years. Although Sony has released other head-mounted displays, Project Morpheus is the first foray into virtual reality with PlayStation . In addition to seeing the view on the headset, a users' virtual perspectives will be simultaneously broadcast on a TV screen. 'The experience can be shared, and that's only going to allow it to spread,' said Mikhailov. 'I think that's going to be the key. Once people see someone else interacting in VR, they're going to want to put it on and try it next.' Mikhailov continued that users will be able to interact with the virtual world displayed on the headset with the gesture-detecting PlayStation Move controller, as well as the DualShock 4 controller. Sony said the current headset must be attached to a PS4 console, stock image pictured, with a cord that's approximately 15ft (4.5 metres) long. Users will be able to interact with the virtual world with the gesture-detecting PlayStation Move, and DualShock 4 controllers, pictured . Have you ever wanted to see the world through your partner’s eyes? That's . the concept behind BeAnotherLab's Gender Swap experiment that uses . Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets to let wearers experience how other people see the . world. Through the use of . the headset, and a series of first-person cameras, the system creates . the illusion that partner A can see what is being recorded by the visor . worn by partner B, and vice versa. One member of the couple is called the user, while the other is the performer. Through the Oculus Rift goggles, the user is shown a video stream taken from the perspective of the performer's eyes. Each . couple agrees on a set of synchronised movements and the partner's . mirror each others hand gestures, and so on, while wearing the headsets. By mimicking . movements, it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer . is seeing, is actually being seen through the eyes of the user. However, he declined to say when the headset would be released or how much it would cost. Project Morpheus is available to developers with four games including a diving cage simulator called The Deep, medieval combat game The Castle, sci-fi dogfighter EVE: Valkyrie and a VR rendition of action-adventure title Thief. Although Sony has released other head-mounted display units, Project Morpheus marks the company's first foray into virtual reality with PlayStation. It is similar to the Oculus Rift, a device currently in development by the California-based startup Oculus VR. Both devices use head tracking to reduce queasiness when users move around a virtual landscape.

"Online shopping is considered quicker and more convenient that trekking round the High Street, but getting it wrong leaves 86 per cent of people in a state of grief that can take months to pass, according to new research. While online shoppers accept that they can't feel fabrics and that colours may vary from expectations if a new piece of clothing doesn't fit it can send shoppers in to a spiral of grief that very closely resembles the stages of mourning .. and it's women who are the hardest hit. According to a survey of 1,000 shoppers, making a mess of online clothing shopping leaves people experiencing up to five stages of emotions similar to those of the famous Kübler-Ross model which, in the world of psychology, describes the ‘five stages of grief’. If online shopping goes wrong and things don't fit we experience emotions similar to the key stages of grief . Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance are considered the five key emotions when mourning a death, and while some shoppers, mostly men, will move swiftly in to anger and then acceptance, others can take months to work through each stage. Women, often blaming themselves rather than the retailer, tend to spend a long time in Denial before eventually moving on to Bargaining behaviour, such as seeking further opinions or trying various accessories to improve the look. Men are much more likely to enter at the Anger phase, openly expressing frustration with the retailer or the situation. At least trekking round High Street fitting rooms means that shoppers are pleased with the end result . Retail psychology expert Phillip Adcock, who consulted on the project, said: “Unlike buying something like an iPod, buying clothing is intensely subjective.  Do I love it?  Does it make me look fabulous? People expect the fit to be right and they definitely tend to blame themselves for clothes not fitting properly. 'Spotting the symptoms is often easy.  If you can relate to feelings of ‘disbelief’, ‘puzzlement’, ‘frustration’ or ‘anger’, then you have probably gone through the phases of Denial, Bargaining and Anger, for example.' The survey for virtual fitting room provider Fits.me asked shoppers what feelings or actions follow the purchase of an item of clothing that doesn’t fit.  Ninety per cent of all respondents admitted to keeping clothes that don’t fit them, rather than returning them to the store. 57% of people felt Anger at themselves for purchasing an item of clothing that didn’t fit, while 21% direct their Anger at the retailer for not meeting their expectations. 67% of women experienced Denial, compared to just 50% of men and half of all women (49%) said they will try on an item more than once in an effort to make it fit, while 38% hold on to it while they try to lose weight. There are also significant differences in the way different age groups manage this shopper's grief: 25 per cent of 18-34 year olds do everything they can to squeeze in to the garment, while only 9 per cent of over 55s do the same. 60 per cent of people cling on to items for more than a month. The survey also revealed that a typical shopper has five items of clothing hanging in their wardrobe that don’t fit them, costing an average of £110 – leaving wardrobes bulging and pockets empty. A spokesman for Fits.me, said: 'It’s pretty disappointing to open a delivery and find it doesn’t fit – now we learn the disappointment runs deeper and lasts longer than we knew. The good news for online shoppers is that retailers are getting more sophisticated in their efforts to avoid disappointing their customers.  They are using technology like virtual fitting rooms to avoid fit mistakes – and this sort of research could help them to react better to customer disappointment that might still occur. '“For example, if a retailer knows that you’ve been disappointed and are probably experiencing grief, it might contact you in the tone of a close friend who sympathises, while they fix the issue and turn a negative experience into something positive after all.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Carrying shopping, work kit or even an order of pizzas on a motorbike can be tricky, unless you have access to a massive Harley Davidson. But an eco-friendly electric bike that has a large cubby hole instead of a fuel tank could mean the end of cumbersome backpacks or bags precariously balanced on handlebars. German engineers built a nifty electric motor into the hub of the ‘Feddz’ bike’s wheel to free up the space for a rider’s personal possessions. Scroll down for video . The future of pizza delivery? An eco-friendly electric bike (pictured) that has a large cubby hole instead of a fuel tank could mean the end of cumbersome backpacks or bags precariously balanced on handlebars . USP: The bike has a large cubby hole where the fuel tank and engine would be on a traditional motorbike. Power: An electric motor is built into the hub of the bike's wheel. Charging: The bike can be charged using a standard household power outlet and take around seven hours for a full charge. Batteries: The bikes use the latest lithium-ion batteries. Storage: The cubby hole can accommodate 23 litres - or a tool box, collection of logs or several pizza boxes. Range: The premium model has a range of 68miles (110km) and the eco one a smaller range of 43miles (70km). Top speed: The premium bike can reach 28mph (45kph) and the eco model has a capped speed of 16mph (25kph). Weight: 99lbs (45kg) - including the battery. Price: €5,990 (£5,018) for the eco model and $6,990 (£5,855) for the premium bike. The Feddz model is designed and built by a German firm called Emo-Bike and its most eye-catching feature is the cavity where you expect an engine and fuel tank to be, which is freed up as 23litres of storage space – enough for logs, pizzas or a large toolbox, according to the company. The 'cargo space' is fitted with two belts with ‘quick release closures’ and inside the frame is a USB connection so that riders can charge their smartphones on the go. The bikes are available with two different batteries. The ‘premium’ bike with the larger battery has a 68-mile (110km) range on a seven hour charge and a top speed of 28mph (45kph). The ‘eco model’ has a range of 43miles . (70km) has a capped speed of 16mph (25kph) which means it can be driven . without a licence in some places. The cargo space is fitted with two belts with 'quick release closures' and inside the frame is a USB connection so that riders can charge their smartphones . According to Emo-Bike, the ‘plug-in and drive’ batteries use the newest lithium-ion technology and can be recharged using any household outlet while they are removed from the bike, or still attached. The bike frame and wheels weigh just 73lbs (33kg) and can be loaded onto a conventional bike carrier once the 25lb (12kg) battery is removed. German engineers built a nifty electric motor into the hub of the 'Feddz' bike's wheel (pictured) to free up the space for a rider's personal possessions or heavy items like logs . Seat height can be adjusted to allow a rider to choose between a comfortable upright position and a lower, sportier posture. The most basic model costs €5,990 (£5,018) and while it is an investment, the company points out that a user will save money on fuel in the long-run. The bikes are available with two different batteries - the larger 'premium' one with a 68-mile (110km) range on a seven hour charge and a top speed of 28mph (45kph) The bike frame and wheels weigh just 73lbs (33kg) and can be loaded onto a conventional bike carrier once the 25lb (12kg) battery is removed .","German engineers built a nifty electric .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Self-proclaimed celebrity gangster Dave Courtney turned the back garden of his London home into a brutal bare-knuckle boxing den for a fight night watched by 300 baying punters. Courtney, who claims to have been a cohort of the Kray twins, hosted the event at his Plumstead house as part of a nationwide tour aimed at cleaning up the sport's barbaric image. The violent combat was once confined to back-street drinking dens and gambled on by gangland villains. It was often a fight to the death, with no rules - and definitely no first aid. But the practice is enjoying something of a renaissance - and it's completely legal. Self-proclaimed gangster Dave Courtney recently hosted a bare-knuckle fight watched by 300 people in his back garden and says the sport has been rid of corruption . Fight club: Camelot Castle, Dave Courtney's home in Plumstead, south London . The sport, labelled barbaric in some quarters, has traditionally been held without rules in underground drinking dens frequented by gambling gangsters . Reporters infiltrated one such fight, held in Courtney's garden. And despite the host's reputation, there were no snarling pitbulls or gun-toting heavies overseeing the action, but a referee, 300 paying punters, not a villain in sight and no gambling. Dave Courtney was born in Bermondsey, London, in 1959. The 55-year-old has made a name for himself through his supposed affiliation with famous hardmen such as Reggie Kray. He was only nine when the Krays were jailed, but claims to have arranged security for Ronnie Kray's funeral in 1995. Courtney became infamous as a knuckle-duster wielding debt collector, and claims to have been shot, stabbed and had his nose almost bitten off. He claims to have been found not guilty in 19 separate trials but in January 2009 he was given an 18-month conditional discharge at Bristol Crown Court, on a charge of possessing live ammunition without a firearms certificate. In recent times he has become something of a celebrity figure, making a living from appearances in numerous television documentaries and a number of low-budget British gangster films. The packed crowd were witnessing the first transatlantic championship ‘BKB' bout for more than 120 years, with pubs taking a pay-per-view video feed of the action. According to Courtney, the sport is . unrecognisable from the past. He said in the Daily Mirror: 'In the old days, the crowd . would have been 90% villains. Tensions ran high because there was a lot . of money at stake and each firm wanted to keep their rep. 'But . today it’s all about the glory. Look for yourself – there’s no . security, there’s no trouble here. It’s a lot more civilised. It’s . the most gladiatorial form of combat that is still available for the . normal person to go and see and I’m glad it’s a bit less underground . now.' The re-birth of the sport, immortalised in the Brad Pitt film, Fight Club, is thanks to former fighter and pub landlord Andy Topcliffe, who was so disgusted by the treatment of one Polish fighter left to die in the street that he says he knew he had to act. He told the paper: 'This guy was in real trouble and the promoters just jumped in their car and legged it. I knew I needed to do something. By removing the illegal money we removed corruption and the welfare of the fighters is paramount.' Bare-knuckle boxing was never outlawed but with the emergence of the Queensbury Rules and gloved bouts in 1867 it shrank into the back streets to be taken over by villains . The combatants are different from the old days, with builders, property developers and spray-painters getting involved. The combat has been portrayed in TV documentaries, left, and in stage plays, right . Iconic scene: Bare-knuckle fighting was immortalised in the Brad Pitt film, Fight Club, and the brutal sport is enjoying a new wave of popularity in Britain . Courtney, an ex-cohort of the Kray things, says it's a good thing the sport has moved mainstream but is glad it still carries a high risk of danger . Previous bills have also featured soldiers, a solicitor, and a PE teacher. They take home just £250 for having a go and many say they do it for the thrill and the feeling of being like a 'real man'. Fans say bare-knuckle fighting is no different to any other martial art, although it comes under the same 'dangerous exhibition' statute as knife-throwing. It's completely legal. But despite the introduction of a referee, the action remains brutal. In the first bout seen at Courtney's house, one fighter hits his opponent so hard on the head his hand instantly fractures and the fight is over, while another combatant is left out cold from a massive left hook. Hardmen: Two combatants slug it out at a travellers site in Luton in 2011 . Violent: Despite the sport's best efforts to clean up its act, it can still attract the wrong crowd, as shown here when police had to break up a fight at a village fair . The craze is attracting celebrities, professionals and even women, who made up around a fifth of the crowd. Film stars Keanu Reeves and Ray Winstone are fans of Andy’s B-Bad Promotions, the Leicestershire-based firm behind the venture. Mr Topcliffe takes the tour to Wales next month and said ticket sales have been good. 'We'll go wherever people want us, he said. 'And they seem to be wanting us more than ever.'","Bouts held in makeshift ring at back of Courtney's south London home .

"By . Tara Brady . An ambulance crew took nearly half an hour to get to a woman in cardiac arrest after their satnav system tried to send them the wrong way. Jodie Fields, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex, died at her home on May 20, 2012, from sudden adult death syndrome. The university student, who was training to be a nursery nurse, had visited four different doctors in the three months before her death complaining of leg pain, a racing heart and breathing problems. Much loved: Jodie Fields pictured with her mother Karen who believes a catalogue of errors led to her daughter's death . However, she was told she was suffering from stress and anxiety. Jodie's sister Kirsty called 999 after finding her unconscious at the flat which they shared. An inquest in Chelmsford heard a lone paramedic arrived minutes later but it took 24 minutes for an ambulance crew to arrive. There were no crews available in near towns so the ambulance had to travel from Basildon which was about 10 miles away. Chris Smith, a paramedic on board, said he and his colleague used the satnav system because they were unfamiliar with the area. He said: 'The satnav tried to send us the wrong way down a one-way road. 'We would not normally respond to calls in that area from Basildon. Ideally there would be more local crews.' Kirsty Fields and her mother Karen Fields hold a picture of Jodie who died of sudden adult death syndrome . However, he said the satnav error may have set them back no more than a minute. Miss Fields was declared dead half an hour after the ambulance crew arrived. Chelmsford Coroner's court also heard how Miss Fields had seen a doctor in the run-up to her death who had been placed under the supervision by the General Medical Council over his record keeping. It took five visits to a doctor before she was referred to a cardiologist. Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said Miss Fields died from adult death syndrome and recorded a verdict of death by natural causes. But her family believe a 'catalogue of errors' contributed to the death of Miss Fields. Her sister Kirsty, 24, told The Sunday Mirror: 'It's disgusting we had to wait so long for an ambulance. 'I believe it cost Jodie her life.' Her mother Karen added: 'It's just a catalogue of errors. All we want is to make sure this never happens to anyone else. We owe that to Jodie.'","Jodie Fields, 20, from Essex, died at her home on May 20, 2012 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Wanted: Qasim Majid, 30, is a suspect in the 2004 murder of Tyrone Clarke . A man was able to walk into a UK consulate in Pakistan and pick up his new passport - despite being wanted for the murder. Qasim Majid, 30, is a suspect in the 2004 gang murder of Tyrone Clarke, who was stabbed five times and beaten with an iron bar on the streets of Beeston, Leeds. The suspect, who is wanted for questioning by West Yorkshire Police over the violent killing, had no problems applying for the document under his own name. He was spotted in Dina, Pakistan, after he featured in an episode of Crimewatch. It was sent to a consulate by officials from the British Embassy in Hong Kong, where he was able to collect it. Checks were made, but there was no record of his being a wanted man, according to the Sun on Sunday. It later emerged that there was never an international arrest warrant issued for him, and that his details were left out of Government databases. Prize: Majid applied for a passport under his own name and was able to collect it in Pakistan . However, police and the Crown Prosecution Service are now attempting to obtain permission to seek his arrest overseas. A spokesman for the Passport Office said: ‘We rely on law enforcement agencies to advise us of any information that would prevent an individual from being entitled to a passport.’ Tyrone’s mother Lorraine Fraser, was said to be devastated at the missed opportunity to catch the suspected killer. Her son was killed by a group of as many as 30 Asian youths armed with baseballs bats, poles and planks. The mixed-raced youth was chased through the streets of Beeston before being stabbed to death. Four members of the gang were given life sentences in 2005, though a hearing at Leeds Crown Court decided that the attack was ‘not racially motivated’. Anjum Amin, Islamur Rahman, Kamer Akram, and Liaquat Ali, all from Beeston, were told they could apply for parole after 9 to 12 years.","Qasim Majid, 30, is wanted over gang murder of 16-year-old Tyrone Clarke .

"By . Sam Webb . A police officer who fought to save the life of a young girl who was medically dead for 20 minutes after being crushed under a car has celebrated becoming her godfather - seven years later. PC Jon Duckham was sent to the scene of the horrific accident in October 2007 where he found little Amy Samuel trapped under the wheels of her family's one tonne car. The toddler - who was just two at the time - had suffered horrific crush injuries after the handbrake was left off and the car rolled back over her. My hero: Amy Samuel, eight, with PC Jon Duckham, 42. After helping to save her life after she was trapped under a car seven years ago, he has now become her godfather . Close bond: Amy Samuel and PC Jon Duckham, pictured at Amy's christening . PC Duckham worked with emergency services to free the girl from under the Fiat Punto at the car park in Darlaston, West Midlands, after she stopped breathing. Paramedics battled to save her and she was transferred to hospital where Pc Duckham was tasked with telling parents Caroline Samuel, 31, and Gavin Manns, 34, to expect the worst. She spent days in intensive care on a life support machine but miraculously fought back and spent a week defying the odds slowly recovering from her injuries. PC Duckham was assigned as the family liaison officer to Amy's parents as she struggled back to health. Amy Samuel with her mother Caroline Andrews and PC Jon Duckham. He became their family liaison officer after the accident . During that time he ferried the worried couple back and forth to Birmingham Children's Hospital and offered them support and advice. Since then the 42-year-old had spent the last seven years helping the family nurse her back to full health, visiting her on his days off and even joining the family on nights out. Fighter: Amy's parents were told to expect the worst, but she fought her horrific injuries to survive . And last Sunday the delighted police officer was asked to be Amy's Godfather for her christening at St Bartholomew's church, in Wednesbury in the West Midlands. Today the officer said he was honoured to be asked to undertake the role for the little girl, now aged eight, who he watched come back from the dead. PC Duckham - who has worked for West Midlands Police for 19 years - said: 'Seeing Amy on life support and hearing cherished memories from her mum and dad was the most painful thing I've experienced in nearly 20 years as a police officer. 'I had two young children myself and I couldn't imagine what they were going through. 'The following morning, as doctors prepared to switch off her machine, she showed signs of life and started breathing for herself; she steadily improved and as the family's FLO I stayed in touch every day to watch Amy's incredible recovery. 'As a liaison officer I'm there to help the family through their ordeal, but naturally after six months or so you step away and leave the family to re-build their lives. 'But this was different. You don't expect a little girl who is technically dead to make such a recovery. 'How do you cope with something like that and walk away? 'When the investigation finished I became a family friend and have stayed in touch ever since. 'She is an amazing girl and every time I see her it is just great, she is so full of life. 'The bond myself and Amy have developed over the years in unreal. 'Every time I visit, she runs up to hug me and stays hugging me until I leave. I am truly honoured to be Amy's Godfather.' 'The support and help he offered was beyond belief. He helped us at our worst and I could never thank him enough' Mother Caroline said she asked PC Duckham if he'd do the honour of being her Godfather four years ago on Amy's advice. She said: 'Jon has been a part of Amy's life since the accident; the bond they have is unbelievable and nothing can break it. 'I'm delighted to have Jon part of our family he was the obvious choice as Amy's Godfather. 'He was the person there on the scene, there with us through the recovery, none of us drive so he was there to take all of us too and from hospital. 'I know it is his job to help us but it was more than that, he really cared, you don't expect that humanity from a police officer. 'Since then he has always been there for us, coming to see Amy on his days off, she always demands a picture with him when he comes round.' Amy still suffers some hearing, speech and movement difficulties as a result of her brain being starved of oxygen after the accident .

"By . Francesca Infante . Lyndsey White was left furious after Interflora failed to deliver a £60 bouquet to her mother, Jill . You mess up Mother’s Day at your peril – and pay reputable florists a lot of money to make sure things go smoothly. Spare a thought then for hundreds of Interflora customers who ordered bouquets which were subsequently dumped on their mothers’ doorsteps, arrived infested with bugs – or simply didn’t materialise at all. The flower delivery firm was forced to issue more than 100 apologies online after customers took to social networking sites to complain about poor service. Lyndsey White, 36, was one of those left infuriated when the firm failed to deliver a £60 basket of flowers to her mother, Jill, 65. Miss White lives in America and trusted the company to deliver her order directly to her parents’ home in Healing, Lincolnshire. But it never arrived, leaving her mother in tears. She said: ‘I got an e-mail saying they had been delivered, so I rang mum to see if she liked them and it turned out they hadn’t arrived. 'I rang Interflora and they said they would be with us in the next hour but they didn’t arrive at all.’ The response of the customer services team at Interflora only angered Miss White further. Miss White, who works in marketing, said: ‘I wanted to make my mum feel special. It would have been lovely if it had actually arrived. ‘But when I rang them they just kept saying it was a very small percentage of their orders that had a problem. What sort of excuse is that? Customers took to Twitter to complain about the poor service and Interflora made apologies every few minutes . 'That may be the case but even if it is just 300 people on Mother’s Day that is far too many.’ Yesterday angry customers flocked to online forums with complaints ranging from delivery issues to the quality of the flowers. Margaret . de Havilland-Hall wrote on the company’s Facebook page bemoaning the . difference between the flowers shown on the website and the ones . delivered for her mother. She said: ‘There are no flowers at all, the bowl is tiny and had fallen over so the plants were squashed.’ Many customers were left outraged, having paid an extra fee to have their flowers delivered by midday – which never arrived at all. Tony Turnbull wrote: ‘Ordered a Mother’s Day delivery online paid for it all and then received an e-mail saying that it won’t be delivered till Monday, a bit late don’t you think?’ Other customers complained of flowers being ‘dumped on the doorstep’ when the door wasn’t answered in time, and plants arriving infested with bugs. Bizarrely, one mother found her flowers decked with black funeral ribbons. Last night there was no statement from Interflora despite repeated attempts to contact them. Some customers had paid extra for Mother's Day bouquets to arrive by midday and no flowers arrived at all .","Flower firm were making apologies every few minutes on their official Twitter .

"By . Steve Doughty . Lady Justice Arden said Britain should get a cooling off period before it has to accept new laws laid down by the European human rights court . Britain should get a cooling off period before it has to accept new laws laid down by the European human rights court, a senior judge said yesterday. An automatic delay of up to three years should be allowed to allow Parliament and the British courts to argue about instructions from the human rights judges in Strasbourg, Lady Justice Arden said. Lady Justice Arden, an Appeal judge who speaks for the judiciary on international courts, said the cooling off period would give time to correct Strasbourg's mistakes when it gives orders to Britain. She said the radical scheme would mean putting 'brakes on national implementation' of European human rights rulings. Every time the European Court of Human Rights decides to make new rules and impose them on Britain or another country, it should do so only through a 'provisional judgement', she said. This would give countries 'a generous period of time', possibly three years, to point out mistakes and misunderstandings before they have to make a Strasbourg ruling part of their national law. Lady Justice Arden's idea is a response to widespread disgust among Tory politicians at the willingness of European judges to overrule the British Parliament, and deepening concerns among judges about interference from Strasbourg. She said two of the most contentious recent instructions to Britain - the order to give convicted prisoners the right to vote and the ruling which said murderers sent to jail for whole life terms must be given the chance of release - would have been bounced straight back to Strasbourg if the 'provisional judgement' system had been in place. In an analysis published yesterday, Lady Justice Arden, who has herself sat as a judge in the Strasbourg court, said Britain was not alone in having rows with the European human rights court and 'there are now many countries which have experienced difficulties with Strasbourg.' She said: 'A principal badge of judicial accountability in national courts is that judges show restraint in their decision-making and do not venture into those areas which should be left to national parliaments. 'One of the difficulties for Strasbourg is that it is difficult for it to know whether it has gone outside that area of restraint.' Lady Justice Arden said that if a Strasbourg ruling is a new departure that would force a country like Britain to change its laws, it 'would not issue a binding decision but only a provisional decision.' This would 'save a lot of friction.' Lady Justice Arden, who has herself sat as a judge in the Strasbourg court, said Britain was not alone in having rows with the European human rights court . She said that in the case of the prisoner voting decision made by Strasbourg in 2005 - a ruling yet to be obeyed by any British government - European judges had entirely failed to take into account the way British MPs had discussed the issue. A cooling off period 'would have enabled these details to be flushed out before the judgement was finalised,' Lady Justice Arden said. A similar delay in the Strasbourg order that whole life prisoners must have a chance of release would have left the European court 'thoroughly undermined' because it would have shown 'a material error in Strasbourg's understanding of our domestic law.' She added that she 'felt sure' Strasbourg would consider the cooling off period reform. Lady Justice Arden also said the European human rights court should try to get better quality judges. 'There is always room for improvement here,' she said, adding that the countries that nominate Strasbourg judges should pick people 'qualified and suited' and that there should be 'the highest priority to electing as judges the persons who are best qualified for the role.'","Lady Justice Arden is an Appeal judge who speaks for the judiciary on international courts .

"The murder weapon used to shoot BBC presenter Jill Dando was used again in a gangland execution in Liverpool years later, a former police officer has claimed. Miss Dando, 37, was gunned down outside her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26, 1999, moments after stepping out of her car. A former officer, who did not wish to be . named, today claimed that a link has been discovered between Dando's . killing and a shooting in Liverpool's docklands several years later. However a source with close knowledge of the Dando murder investigation described the latest claims as ‘complete nonsense’. Murdered: Jill Dando, pictured left, was killed outside her home in Fulham in 1999. Barry George was jailed for her murder in 2001 but freed in 2008 following the emergence of fresh evidence . ‘There is no truth in the suggestion the murder weapon was used again in Liverpool,’ he said. ‘The most likely scenario is that the gun was thrown into the Thames shortly after Miss Dando was shot dead. ‘Sadly police divers were never able to recover it.’ Dando was killed with a single muffled bullet to the skull and neighbours found her in a pool of blood on her doorstep in a crime that shocked Britain. Part-time stuntman Barry George was jailed for the killing in 2001, but his conviction was overturned in August 2008 following the emergence of fresh evidence. The 53-year-old has since attempted to claim compensation from the Metropolitan Police and her killer remains at large. The suggestion by the police officer that the murder weapon was used again years later means George could have potentially been freed earlier. He said: 'It was said that the same gun and/or a near identical bullet was used for another point-blank killing. A free man: Barry George pictured left outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, last year after he lost his legal battle for compensation as a victim of a 'miscarriage of justice' Fresh claims: An unnamed police officer claims that the murder weapon which shot Dando was used in another shooting in Liverpool docklands, pictured, years later . 'The crimping marks on the bullet were said to be very similar. 'Recycled guns can be extremely volatile and can explode if not handled right. They are meant to be used only once at close range.' He added Merseyside Police identified a potential link between Dando's murder and a convicted drugs baron from Liverpool. He . claimed that during a series of complex operations during 2004 an . undercover officer infiltrated the gang and recorded conversations with . other members, in which her name was mentioned. The source said that the undercover officer asked the gang members: 'You know what happened to Jill Dando?' One replied: 'We got asked questions about that. Even my bird claimed: ""Crimewatch: you know about her, don't you?"" Haunting: A CCTV image of Jill Dando shopping just 40 minutes before she was gunned down outside her home . Crime scene: Jill Dando was murdered outside the . front door of her Fulham home in 1999. A man was seen by several . neighbours in the moments after the murder but he has never been traced . Murder scene: Police officers cordon off Jill Dando's road in Fulham, south London, following the shooting in April 1999 . 'All I said was I knew there was a contract out on her, I think it came from Scotland. 'These other bullets were supposed to be the same as those that killed Jill Dando.' The former officer also said the Met Police was sure the murder was undoubtedly a targeted hit by a professional hitman. He said: 'When she was shot we checked out gangland links and leading gunsmiths for any evidence of criminal activities. We all knew it was a professional hit. 'We were told to concentrate on the bullet rather than the gun. It was a 9mm reactivated pistol but the bullet was custom-made by a specialist. It had a deliberately reduced charge.'","Jill Dando, 37, was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, London, in 1999 .

Ready to go: The creature looks as though he is willing himself to pick the dumbbell up . Lift me up: The squirrel appears to pick up the weight - and even looks shocked at his own ability . However, the scene is really just a clever trick set up by photographer Max Ellis in his garden in Teddington, London. Mr Ellis, who has photographed bodybuilders for a number of projects, attached the dumbbell to a wire. He then slowly lifted the weight as the squirrel held on, creating the illusion. Mr Ellis said: 'I had a few weights lying around so thought it'd be fun to see whether the squirrels which regularly come into our garden would check it out.

View  comments . Sandra Kelwick, of Duckmanton, Derbyshire, has to pay less than £7 a week to repay benefits she falsely claimed . A benefits cheat who swindled the state out of nearly £60,000 has been told by a judge she must repay the cash at a rate of less than £7 a week. Sandra Kelwick, 50, would need to live to the age of 211 before her £13.70 fortnightly repayments cleared the £57,405 she stole over six years. The mother-of-four, of Duckmanton, Derbyshire, was arrested following a tip-off and discovered to be living with a partner - despite claiming extra money available to single mothers. Edna Leonard, prosecuting, told Derby Crown Court that Kelwick began claiming benefit in July 2000 when her partner left the home. But in December 2012, civil servants were told another man had moved in during November 2007. He gave her address to his bank in 2007 and his employers were told of his location in 2011. His car's insurance documents also carried the address. 'Surveillance was undertaken and they saw him coming and going from the address. She said she had been his girlfriend for seven years but they didn't live together,' said Miss Leonard. Later Kelwick admitted he had moved in. When the offences ended, she had been wrongly paid £38,619 income support, £14,058 housing benefit and council tax benefit of £4,728. The court heard Kelwick had discussed her benefits with her new partner and further claimed he had persuaded her to keep stealing the cash. Miss Leonard said Kelwick had never been in trouble before. The investigation into Sandra Kelwick's benefit fraud was launched after officials received a tip-off. Judge Jonathan Gosling told her: 'You stole over a long period of time almost £10,000 a year. You have lost your good name.' The judge said he noted Kelwick had been ill, pleaded guilty promptly and that the benefit claims were initially legitimate. He added: 'I hope your health improves so you can go back to work.' Kelwick was ordered her to have five days of 'employment training' to help her get a job. Sandra Kelwick admitted four counts of failing to notify a change of circumstances and two of making false statements to get benefit . Sandra Kelwick was handed a three-month curfew as punishment for the offences, put on probation and given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, when she appeared at Derby Crown Court . Judge Gosling estimated she could have legitimately received £8,000 benefits and added: 'It is likely to be significantly more.' Kelwick admitted four counts of failing to notify a change of circumstances and two of making false statements to get benefit. She was handed a three-month curfew as punishment for the offences, put on probation and given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, when she appeared at Derby Crown Court. Kelwick was ordered to repay the cash at £13.70 a fortnight. But her solicitor Joe Harvey said: 'She may be able to find employment to start to pay it back at a much more attractive rate'.","Benefits cheat Sandra Kelwick, 50, ordered to pay back £13.70 a fortnight .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A mother starved, beat and tortured her two-16-year-old children for more than eight years, police have said. Jamie Marie Hicks, 43, allegedly inflicted cruelty on the two children at her home in North Tampa, Florida while their stepfather, 53-year-old Vernon Courtney Lovell, looked on and did nothing. She hit them with various objects, choked them to the point of unconsciousness and held their heads under water, according to a police report reported in the Tampa Bay Times. She also withheld food from them for up to three days at a time, they told police, and on other occasions, she fed them spoiled food or made them regurgitate food and then eat it again. Arrested: Jamie Hicks, left, has been accused of abusing her two 16-year-old children for more than eight years, while her husband Vernon Lovell, right, allegedly knew about the abuse but did nothing to help them . The alleged abuse came to light when the children went to Mary Lee's House, a nonprofit child protection organization, where they told child advocates about what they had endured. The children, whose genders have not been released, said their mother abused them while their stepfather failed to seek medical attention, even though he was aware of the abuse. A pediatric nurse carried out a physical examination of the children on Thursday and found signs of severe malnutrition and both were hospitalized, according to police. One of the children weighed 88 pounds and the other . weighed 94 pounds, whereas a healthy weight for their age is 135 pounds. Scene: The children said they were starved for days on end at their home in Tampa, Florida, pictured . Lovell has lived with Hicks and the children for 13 years, the report said.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Payday loan adverts will not be banned from children’s TV despite warnings lenders were ‘grooming’ youngsters to become the next generation of borrowers. The government has rejected calls to stop promotions using catchy songs and puppets during programmes aimed at children. Despite research showing adverts from firms offering high interest, short-term credit were watched almost 600million times by children last year, ministers said it was still a ‘relatively small’ problem. Payday lender Wonga has been criticised for using puppets which appeal to children in its advertising . Labour leader Ed Miliband called for the adverts to be banned while money expert Martin Lewis told MPs they amounted to ‘inappropriate propaganda’ which meant even the under-10s now nag their parents to borrow money to buy toys. The Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee published a report calling for the adverts to be banned from children’s shows. It said: ‘Research undertaken by Ofcom has shown that payday loan advertising is prevalent on daytime television and children's channels. ‘We do not believe that these are appropriate channels for payday loans. We recommend that payday loan adverts are banned from programming aimed at children.’ It was shown evidence that the average child aged between four and 15 was exposed to 70 payday loan adverts last year and was being persuaded that using such credit was ‘fun’ and ‘easy’. The number of payday loan adverts hit almost 400,000 in 2012, up from just 17,000 in 2008 . But in its official response to the report the government rejected the demand, and played down the scale of the problem. ‘The increase reported by Ofcom in the number of payday lending ads seen by children is concerning,’ it said. ‘But it is also important to note that they comprise a relatively small 0.6 per cent of TV ads seen by children aged four to 15. ‘The Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP), the body that writes the Broadcast Advertising Code, is considering the extent to which payday loan advertising features on children's TV and whether there are any implications for the ASA's regulation of this sector.’ More than half of all payday loan adverts are seen during daytime TV, according to Ofcom . In November Mr . Miliband called for the ads to banned during any programmes . aimed at children. He said: 'As a father of two young boys, I know how . influenced they can be by what they see. 'And I don't want payday lenders taking advantage of the cost of living crisis and targeting children in this country. Money saving expert Martin Lewis accused payday lenders of using adverts to 'groom' the next generation of borrowers . 'It . is wrong, it is not what should be happening and that is why a Labour . government would stop them advertising during children's TV. 'It's bad for young people, it's bad for families and it's bad for communities.' At a hearing of the committee last . year Mr Lewis, founder of the MoneySavingExpert.com website, called for a . blanket ban on advertising designed to ‘normalise’ the idea of . short-term loans among children. He accused the firms of ‘grooming a new generation towards this type of borrowing’. He . told the committee: ‘If you think we have got problems now, you wait . for 10 years’ time. Grooming is the right term. We are talking about a . market that didn’t exist five years ago.’ He . condemned the adverts as ‘deliberately contrived and controlled’, . singling out Wonga’s adverts featuring puppets to appeal to children. A survey on MoneySavingExpert.com found a third of parents reported their under-10s repeating payday lenders’ slogans, while 14 per cent said that when they had refused to buy a toy, their child had nagged them to take out a payday loan. According to Ofcom, in 2009 there were just 17,000 payday loan adverts shown on UK television, recording 12million views or ‘impacts’ among adults and 3million 4-15-year-olds. By 2012 the number of adverts had rocketed to 397,000, with 7.5billion impacts among adults and 596million for children. It means that in a year every adult saw 152 payday loan adverts, and 4-15-year-olds watched the equivalent of 70 each.","Commons committee called for ban on adverts on children's shows .

"By . Daniel Martin . Only 19 per cent of voters see Ed Miliband as a prime minister in waiting, in the latest blow to hit Labour. The poll puts Mr Miliband significantly behind David Cameron when the Prime Minister was in opposition. The YouGov poll for The Times found that only 26 per cent of voters think Labour is ready for government, while less than half of the party's supporters (49 per cent) believe Mr Miliband looks  like the country's next premier. Fewer than a fifth of voters see Ed Miliband as a prime minister, according to a new poll . It comes after former minister David Lammy warned the party had become overly focused on the issue of living standards without spelling out its 'positive offer' for people to vote for them. One of the party's biggest donors, businessman John Mills, said Labour had become 'boxed in' on the economy with a strategy that differed little from the Conservatives. Mr Miliband's leadership has been questioned after his failure to respond directly to measures in last week's Budget was seen to have handed the Tories a political victory. Weekend opinion polls showed the two main parties effectively on level-pegging. Labour leader Ed Miliband during his speech at the Scottish Labour Party conference . Former minister David Lammy warned the party had become overly focused on the issue of living standards without spelling out its 'positive offer' for  people to vote for them . Mr Lammy said that, with 14 months to the general election, Labour was in danger of being drawn into a fight on the Conservatives' ground. 'Effectively we knock on doors and the central message is about living standards and energy prices,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. 'I think the electorate will need more in a raft of areas and we need to be very careful that we are not solely fighting the election on the current Government's ground which is deficit reduction and a debate around welfare and immigration. 'There is more to fix in this country than just on that sole platform.' The party's Deputy Leader Harriet Harman said Labour was making steady progress.

"By . Penny Stretton . Right Adam Rickitt is back in the spotlight as part of the pop group 5th Story, put together by TV show The Big Reunion. Before that it's fair to say he had a roller-coaster ride of fame and fortune, including stints on Coronation Street and his time as a pop pin up in the late 90s. But despite all that, perhaps it is the star's experience of bulimia that has most shaped him as a person. Scroll down for video . Adam Rickett, currently starring in The Big Reunion, recounted his harrowing experience of bulimia onThis Morning and told how he had suicidal thoughts . Those who remember Adam's pop career will be familiar with images of his rippling six-pack and half naked dance routines. However, the TV star revealed on This Morning that the catalyst for his bulimia was nothing to do with a desire to look good, but all started when he was injured during a rugby game at school. 'It all started in 1994 with a rugby match,' he explained. 'All I wanted was to be a rugby player and was under pressure through school. 'Then during one match I dislocated both shoulders and in hospital I picked up a virus that made me lose weight' Adam went on to explain that the injury meant his rugby career was over and he became depressed, finding himself trying to figure out who he was. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Adam (R) and Dr Chris Steele (L) discussed the eating disorder bulimia on This Morning with Big Reunion star recalling his time as a sufferer . 'Looking back it went much deeper,' he said. 'I didn't know myself, I didn't fit in, I was so scared so I had fixated on rugby. 'Through the virus I picked up in hospital I lost so much weight so had been eating a lot to try to put it back on. 'One . day I was sitting eating a big bowl of cereal and had been so focused . on just eating and thinking about nothing else, that when I stood up I . was accidentally, physically sick. 'I . hadn't meant to be, but it made me realise I had wasted an hour and a . half away, where I didn't have to think about anything so I did it again . straight away.' At his worst Adam admits to being sick up to 30 times a day and dropping to around 6st in weight. He . is keen to spread awareness of the illness as 11 per cent of sufferers . are men and Adam stresses that eating disorders are the same as any . other mental illness and the that the driving force is not always about . physical appearance. Adam Rickitt ,35, suffered from bulimia and wants people to treat eating disorders just like any other mental illness, adding they are not about vanity . 'I'm trying to make people realise that an eating disorder is like any other mental illness. 'It's about focusing on one thing.' Adam . says if someone is suffering an eating disorder there is more than . likely an under lying issue, which goes deeper than how they feel about . the way they look and that that is simply something to focus on as a . distraction. 'If someone doesn't love themselves, it's about asking why don't they?' He said. Of his own illness Adam revealed that he was so unwell he was bringing up blood and that those around him knew but had no idea how to help. 'I was throwing up blood, I knew everybody knew, I was acting different. 'Everybody knew but didn't know how to help and I was so embarrassed. 'I would go to bed every night praying not to wake up but I couldn't [do anything like that] because I knew my mum knew I had bulimia and she would blame herself.' Adam described the horrible side effects of making himself sick such as 'always being cold' and often passing out and explained how it was a chance comment from his mother that began his turn around. 'It was Christmas 1995 and mum had just done a big weekly shop. 'She just said 'if you throw all this up I'll never speak to you again - it was like a cricket bat across the face.' Slowly Adam began to try to change his ways. He tried various therapies that didn't work and in the end worked hard to make himself better. 'I did it methodically,' he said 'I checked my temperature each day [to see if he was getting better] . 'I weaned myself off being sick. I had to calm my body down because it was so tuned to being sick and getting rid of whatever I put in it. Adam, far left, with 5th Story band mates Kenzie, Gareth Gates, Kavana and Dane Bowers . 'Quitting an addiction to something that involves food is very hard because you still have to eat. 'Getting . over the physical side took around 18 months but the mental side is . much harder and it took me until I was about 30 to be able to look in . the mirror and know who I was' This Morning's resident GP Dr Chris Steele urged anyone suffering from an eating disorder to visit a GP where they can be referred to a specialist and added 'there is no quick fix, it takes time.'

"By . Fiona Macrae . Stress: The study found that children as young as one year old can pick up on negative emotions . As if being a mother wasn’t stressful enough. Scientists say that stress is contagious and can be passed from mother to child. They showed that 12-month-old boys and girls not only pick up that their mother is under pressure, they also start to become anxious themselves. The researchers said: ‘Before infants are verbal and able to express themselves fully, we can overlook how exquisitely attuned they are to the emotional tenor of their caregivers. ‘Your infant may not be able to tell you that you seem stressed or ask you what is wrong, but our work shows that, as soon as she is in your arms, she is picking up on the bodily responses accompanying your emotional state and immediately begins to feel in her own body your own negative emotion.’ The University of California, San Francisco, researchers asked 69 mothers to come into the lab with their babies, who were around a year old. The babies were taken to a playroom, while their mothers made a five-minute speech and then took part in a question and answer session. Some of the women received encouragement as they spoke, while others were faced with frowns and crossed arms. A third group made their speech to an empty room. The women were then reunited with their babies and the children’s heart rate measured. The women whose speeches had received negative feedback felt more stressed – and their babies picked up on this, with their heart rates speeding up within minutes of sitting on their mother’s lap. And the more pressured the woman felt, the greater the effect on the child, the journal Psychological Science reports. Mechanism: It is thought the babies may pick up on changes in tone of voice, touch or smell to work out their mother's emotions . Lead researcher Sara Waters said: ‘Our earliest lessons about how to manage stress and strong negative emotions in our day-to-day lives occur in the parent-child relationship. ‘Our research shows that infants ""catch"" and embody the physiological residue of their mothers’ stressful experiences.’ It is thought the infants may have reacted to a change in their mother’s voice, touch or facial expression. Even the smell of sweat might have an effect. Such research may help shed light on how children are affected by their parent's health. The researchers said: ‘A common question in public health circles is how stress and social environment “gets under the skin” to affect health both at an individual and at a familial level. ‘With this admittedly modest study, we show a possible mechanism for how stress is transmitted from parent to child.’","Experiment by University of California scientists tested 69 mothers .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Hundreds of lung cancer patients in England and Wales are to be denied a life-prolonging drug that will remain available in Scotland. For the last five years Tarceva has been an option for around 1,000 lung cancer sufferers a year after chemotherapy has failed. But the NHS rationing watchdog has decided to change its guidance, which experts say will send cancer care ‘backwards’. Tarceva, a life-prolonging drug used to treat lung cancer patients, is no longer to be available to patients in England and Wales as Nice has changed its guidance on the medication . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has re-reviewed its existing guidance after the chemotherapy drug against which Tarceva was compared went off-patent, leading to a lower price. It is the second time in a week that Nice has hit the headlines for proposals that would impose new curbs on cancer treatment. The prostate cancer drug enzalutamide will be limited to men who have not already tried a different medicine – potentially denying it to thousands of sufferers. Lung cancer specialists are shocked by the latest draft guidance, saying Nice will leave patients with access to only the chemotherapy, docetaxel, which many patients are too sick to tolerate. This will effectively leave these less fit patients with no active treatment option to fight their cancer and goes against NHS England’s policy which states that no patient will be without access to cancer treatment. Tarceva, also known as erlotinib, costs around £1,600 for 30-days of treatment and is taken as a pill at home. The drug has been used by about 1,000 patients a year. It is given to patients for whom chemotherapy has failed. Image shows lung tumour cells . Dr Mick Peake, Consultant Physician at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and Clinical Lead, National Cancer Intelligence Network, (NCIN), said he was unaware of any similar situation in which cancer patients were to lose the chance of using a new drug after several years of approval. He said it was a backward step that would mean hundreds of patients had to appeal to local areas for permission to use it – even though it remains available nationally in Scotland. He said: ‘Lung cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat and the decision to remove what has become a standard of care will make our job as clinicians more difficult, particularly impacting on some of our sickest patients. ‘Experienced clinicians need more freedom to be able to choose the treatment that they think is right for each patient. ‘Erlotinib is not a cure but a lot of these patients get good quality of life from using it,’ he added. He said it was a ‘perverse’ proposal as independent assessment showed the total NHS treatment costs of docetaxel to be higher than those of erlotinib. This difference arises because docetaxel needs to be given intravenously in hospital, whereas erlotinib is an oral treatment taken at home. The cost of managing treatment side effects is also greater with docetaxel, especially for life-threatening complications which normally require hospitalisation for antibiotic therapy. Trials show patients get an extra two months of life on average - it increases one-year survival rates by 43 per cent - and the drug costs about £1,700 a month per patient. Doctors say the decision effectively means cancer care in England and Wales is going 'backwards' Nice said draft guidance provisionally recommends both erlotinib and another drug called gefitinib for people with non-small-cell lung cancer in specific circumstances. However, this will rule out some patients who would previously have been eligible for erlotinib. Sir Andrew Dillon, Chief Executive at NICE said: ‘When we update recommendations, it is driven by changes in the evidence, as we have to be confident that the benefits that drugs offer patients really do justify what the NHS will have to pay for them. ‘The ongoing review of these two treatments incorporates new evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of erlotinib and gefitinib – the revised recommendations aim to ensure that patients are offered the most appropriate treatments.’","Lung cancer patients will be denied Tarceva because The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has changed its guidance on the drug .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . More than 500 supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi have been sentenced to death in a ruling by an Egyptian court. The group, members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, were handed the sentences by the court in Minya, south of the capital, Cairo, today. They have been convicted of a number of charges, including killing a police officer and attempting to murder others. Scroll down for video . Ruling: More than 500 supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi have been sentenced to death following a ruling by an Egyptian court. Above, Morsi supporters face anti-riot police officers in Cairo . The ruling is a sharp escalation of Egypt’s crackdown on supporters of Morsi, which has seen thousands arrested and hundreds killed so far. Morsi, who was ousted by the army in July last year following repeated demonstrations calling on him to leave, is now being held at a high security prison near the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. The 529 Islamists sentenced to death are part of a larger group of 545 Morsi supporters who are on trial for a number of charges. These include killing a police officer, attempting to murder two others, attacking a police station and other acts of violence. Protests: The ruling is an escalation of Egypt's crackdown on supporters of Morsi, who was removed in July . Showing his support: A young Egyptian boy participates in a demonstration by supporters of Morsi in Cairo . More than 150 suspects stood trial; the others were tried in absentia. Sixteen were acquitted. The ruling followed only two sessions in which the defendants' lawyers complained that they had no chance to present their case. The alleged attacks are believed to have taken place during violent demonstrations after security forces broke up two pro-Morsi protest camps, killing hundreds of people. Ousted: Morsi (pictured) was ousted by the military following repeated demonstrations calling on him to leave . Authorities have blamed the Brotherhood for the violence - branding it a terrorist organization and confiscating its assets. However, the group has denied any links to the attacks. ‘The court has decided to sentence to death 529 defendants and 16 were acquitted,’ lawyer Ahmed al-Sharif told Reuters today. The convicted Islamists are believed to be able to appeal the ruling.","Morsi supporters were sentenced to death by court in Minya, Egypt, today .

"By . Simon Cable . French-born Chef Albert Roux has branded his fellow countrymen 'rude' saying he wants to die a 'Britishman' One of France’s greatest chefs wants to become a British citizen after delivering a withering verdict of his home country and labelling his fellow countrymen ‘rude and pedantic’. Albert Roux, 78, has revealed that he has applied for a British passport and insisted he want to ‘die as a Britishman.’ Mr Roux first moved to the UK as an 18-year-old in 1954, before setting up the famed Le Gavroche restaurant in London in 1967. It became the first restaurant in the UK to gain three Michelin stars. He explained that he now travels to France ‘as little as possible’. He explained that his application for a British passport had already been submitted and that he was exempt from taking the UK government’s citizenship test because he was over 65 and has been awarded an OBE. He now expects his application to be approved within a few weeks. Mr Roux, father of former MasterChef host Michel Roux Jr, told the Daily Mail: ‘England is not a second home for me, it is my first home. I’m an extremely strong royalist. It is only that my birth happened to be in France. ‘My heart is British, very much so. I am waiting for my British passport, I’ve applied and it is a matter of weeks now. I want to remain in this country and I want to die in this country. ‘I came to this country when I was 18, and I always felt I was born on the wrong side of the Channel and that the children should have a British education. The kids are British in their nationality. ‘I go back to France as little as possible. I find the French as a whole very pedantic. They think they know better than anybody. In the restaurant trade most of the time they are constipated. 'The French think they have the best wine, the best food. But the British know about wine and food. ‘They don’t know how to smile and say thank you. Not all of them, but many. ‘They know this very well because the government never fail to tell them to be more friendly. You have 85 million tourists coming to France on a yearly basis. We should be far more hospitable to the people who come and spend money with us. We’re not. ‘The reason I’ve decided to apply now is that I’m not going to live forever. I’m not counting the days, but I’m not going to be here in 20 years. So I want to die as a Britishman and be buried here.’ The son of a charcutier from . Burgundy, Mr Roux originally wanted to be a priest, but moved to Britain . to work as a private chef in the 1950s. He and his brother Michel opened Le . Gavroche almost 50 years ago, and it became the first restaurant in . Britain to win a Michelin star, the first to win two, and the first to . win three in 1982. The . restaurant became a favourite Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother. Le . Gavroche is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having . served the most expensive meal per head when three diners spent more . than £13,000 on one meal in 1997. Roux and his brother Michel opened Le Gavroche almost 50 years ago, and it became the first restaurant in Britain to win a Michelin star, the first to win two, and the first to win three in 1982 . Mr Roux went on to train a series of Michelin-starred chefs including Gordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White and Marcus Wareing. He now runs a series of restaurants around Britain, including Chez Roux in Muirfield, Scotland, Roux at Parliament Square in London and Chez Roux at The Atholl in Edinburgh. In a poll of UK chefs carried out by Caterer and Hotelkeeper magazine in 2003, Albert and his brother Michel were voted the most influential chefs in the country, while in 2006, he and Michel were jointly given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the S.Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurant awards. He is now hosting an event at the Investec Derby Festival in June. Asked if he felt responsible for spawning the culture of celebrity chefs in Britain, he said: ‘I was not a celebrity chef. I was a chef who was asked to do a programme on television and a chef who was at work every night in his restaurant. And so is my son. ‘Most of the celebrity chefs today, if they weren’t on television, they would have a shock to find the money for the next meal. ‘They can’t cook. They can’t cook. I wouldn’t want them to cook me a meal. I’m not going to name names, absolutely not. Google it. Read Caterer. 'There was another one last week who went into receivership, a one-star Michelin. Closed the restaurant, said he had a leak. A water leak. The water leak was his cash. ‘As long as the public likes it, long may it continue. It is interesting to talk about food. You know things have gone too far when on television if a programme goes off prime time and it reaches one million, five hundred thousand. Then it has passed its sell-by date.’","Charismatic chef labels fellow countrymen 'rude and pedantic'

"By . Dan Bloom . This is the moment a rogue recycling boss who was twice caught dumping waste had his signature white van crushed into a block. Ian Chapman, 56 - whose slogan was 'recycle it, don't tip it' - was convicted in 2010 and again last year after Newcastle City Council spent weeks following him through covert surveillance. The council seized his van and twisted it into a ball of scrap at a yard in Byker, Newcastle, to set an example to others. Destroyed: Council chiefs have destroyed this white van after its owner was convicted of flytipping . Caught: The van's owner Ian Chapman, 56, was twice convicted of waste offences . Caught on camera: This CCTV image of Chapman illegally dumping waste was captured by Newcastle City Council . Crunched: When he was caught again last year, Chapman told officers he had been out walking his dog . Crushed: Council chiefs in Newcastle have destroyed rogue scrap boss Ian Chapman's white van . Rogue: Ian Chapman's catchphrase was 'recycle it - don't tip it'. He was caught twice by council officers . Chapman set up Fast Track Recycling in 2006 and received his most serious conviction in 2010. He was prosecuted for . dumping and burning waste including dangerous chemicals yards from family homes. Environmental . Health officers, who received a flurry of complaints, put Chapman under surveillance and found mounds of scrap including a plastic bath, wheelbarrow, gas heater, vacuum cleaner, as . well as washing machines, ovens, drain pipes, corrugated metal fence . panels and filing cabinet drawers. Officers . were also alarmed to see refrigeration units and air conditioning . devices among the piles, which had been stripped-back, allowing . dangerous chemicals to be released into the atmosphere. He denied depositing controlled waste, but was found guilty in 2010 and was ordered to carry out 150 hours' community service, ordered to pay . £200 costs and £60 victim surcharge. Probe: The council followed Chapman for three weeks until they had enough evidence in 2010 . Evidence: Dumped fridges at the compound which prosecutors said was used by Ian Chapman . The van was seized but Chapman appealed his conviction, and it could not be destroyed until Chapman lost that appeal this year. Meanwhile he racked up another conviction in September last year after he began dumping scrap materials again - without a licence. Chapman was spotted disposing a bucket of rubbish and dumping roofing illegally. During an interview with officers, he claimed he was out walking his dog. But like it had in 2010, CCTV and undercover images showed him dumping waste illegally. After the offence last year Chapman, from Ponteland, Northumberland, pleaded guilty to one count of not . being a registered carrier and received a year's conditional discharge. City councillor and chairman of Safe Newcastle Linda Hobson said: 'Ian Chapman’s conviction and the destruction of his vehicle should send a message loud and clear that Newcastle City Council, with the police, will not hesitate in seeking the maximum penalty possible. Twisted metal: The council seized the truck and had to fight a long legal process to have it crushed . Claws: The van was destroyed near where Chapman had been trading in scrap metal in Newcastle . Pleased: Council enforcement officers Gavin Bell and Andrew Dixon with the remains of Ian Chapman's van . 'Fly-tipping will not pay, and indeed will cost anyone stupid enough to do it very dearly.' 'We know from surveys that fly-tipping is something that really offends our residents, so we are determined to act decisively when this crime is committed. 'Fly-tippers cost councils millions of pounds every year and, quite frankly, in the current financial climate we need the money for other services that people depend upon.'","Ian Chapman, 56, was twice convicted of illegal waste dumping in Tyneside .

"By . David Mccormack . The HR director at a healthcare provider in Bangor, Maine claims she was instructed by the company’s CEO to only hire ‘young women with big boobs,’ according to a complaint filed with the state’s Human Rights Commission. Barbara Mann was fired by Sunbury Medical Associates in Sept 2011. She claims she suffered sexual and age discrimination and was fired for complaining about CEO David Savell’s behavior. An investigation by the Maine Human Rights Commission found this week that Mann had reasonable grounds for complaint. Barbara Mann is claiming sexual discrimination against the CEO of Sunbury Medical Associates of Bangor, Maine . Mann claims that Sunbury's CEO had hired several waitresses and had told her she should just hire 'young women with big boobs' Their report states that shortly after starting at Sunbury in 2003, Mann was told by the CEO 'that Sunbury had a ""warm and fuzzy"" HR department and that [he] wanted to change that approach,' so the department was no longer a place for employees to 'vent.' In June 2010, the reports states that he told Mann that 'from now on, she should just hire ""young women with big boobs.""' Prior to that, Mann says the CEO had made other comments about 'big boobs' and 'commended her on past female hires because he thought they were ""cute and had big boobs.'"" In the report Mann says she found Savell's behavior to be offensive, such as betting with his personal assistant how big her breasts would get when she was pregnant. In compiling the report, the Human Rights Commission also spoke to Savell, who denies ever using the term 'big boobs.' The CEO also had a habit of hiring waitresses. In May 2011, he told Mann he was hiring another waitress to be assistant HR director. When the new assistant was introduced to staff, she was ‘wearing a low-cut sweater which exposed her cleavage,’ the report states. The CEO later called Mann into his office and told her he didn’t like the look on her face during the introductions, reports The Bangor Daily News. Mann replied that the assistant should 'be required to wear appropriate business attire.' In the report is also states that she told the CEO two other female employees wore more revealing clothes when they felt themselves to be out of favor with him. Mann also claims that she had noticed the CEO looking at their breasts 'and that this situation made her uncomfortable.' Following Mann's comments to her boss about her new assistant's attire, Sunbury hired an attorney to investigate. Believing the attorney could not be impartial, Mann says she refused to answer their questions. She was then threatened with disciplinary action if she did not cooperate. The attorney's report, issued in June 2011, concluded there was no basis for her claims. In the new year Mann could file a civil lawsuit at the Maine Superior Court in Bangor, where a binding settlement could include financial damages . Three months later, Mann's employment was terminated. The report compiled by Maine Human Rights Commission . included statements from current and former Sunbury employees who described Mann as 'mean' and 'sarcastic.' Sunbury, . who claim Mann was fired because of 'lack of fit' and 'negative . interactions with employees,' choose not to file a formal objection to . the commission’s report. However in a statement from Sunbury’s lawyer Robert Brooks, he said the company disagreed with its conclusions. 'Sunbury has consistently denied Mann’s allegations,' it read. 'Sunbury presented the Commission’s investigator with ample evidence to show that Mann’s claim is without merit. 'Unfortunately, the investigator chose to discount this evidence and conclude simply that there is an ""even chance"" that there are reasonable grounds to believe Sunbury violated the Maine Human Rights Act. 'However, if necessary, Sunbury will continue to defend itself against Mann’s allegation of illegal discrimination, which is untrue.' In the new year the commission will invite both sides and their legal representatives to meet in a bid to reach a settlement. If that fails, Mann may file a civil lawsuit in Maine Superior Court, where a binding settlement can include financial damages.","Barbara Mann claims she was fired for complaining about Sunbury Medical Associates CEO David Savell .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Tory minister Baroness Warsi has warned David Cameron not to try to 'out-Ukip' Nigel Farage's party in an attempt to woo voters back to the Conservatives. She also defended Cameron's 2006 description of Ukip supporters as 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists', saying 'I don't think I could have put it any better.' She acknowledged that the Eurosceptic party has drawn support from both Tory and Labour ranks, but added that a 'chunk' of supporters came from the far-Right. Baroness Warsi, a Tory minister, has defended David Cameron's 2006 remark that Ukip supporters were 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists' Speaking to the Huffington Post, she said: 'We're all being much more restrained and much more diplomatic' about Ukip, 'but I don't think I could have put it any better than the way the Prime Minister put it when he described them many years ago. 'Nigel Farage is trying to change his party and how successful he is in that will determine whether the label the Prime Minister gave (Ukip), all those years ago, sticks.' The rise of Ukip has caused concern among Conservative MPs who fear that their party will be punished at next year's general election as right-wing supporters defect to Nigel Farage. Ukip's hard-line over Europe has struck a particular chord with the public, leading Cameron to offer voters an in/out referendum by 2017 if the Conservatives win. However, Warsi warned against such tactics. She said: 'The one thing that no party can do is out-Ukip Ukip to win those voters back.' Lady Warsi, who was replaced as Conservative Party chairman by Grant Shapps, also defended her successor over the recent 'beer and bingo' Budget advert. Schapps was widely pilloried after posting an image on Twitter claiming cuts to bingo and beer taxes would 'help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy'. Warsi, who was Conservative party chairman before Grant Schapps, also backed her successor over the controversial 'bingo' election poster, saying he shouldn't be held solely responsible . But Lady Warsi said: 'I think some of the attacks on Grant Shapps have been incredibly unfair because he's been made to carry the can of decisions which probably involved a whole load of other people before that poster came out.' Reports have suggested that Chancellor George Osborne had signed off the image, but Lady Warsi said: 'Well, I don't know that...but I'm not convinced (Mr Shapps) should carry the can for this.' Warsi, who is a senior minister of state at the Foreign Office and minister for faith at the Communities Department, also acknowledged that politics has a 'women problem' adding that the number of female cabinet members needs to increase - there are currently five. She added that you 'need a mix' of people in politics, achieved by 'surrounding yourself by people from lots of different backgrounds.' Lady Warsi also offered her assessment of progress in Afghanistan - with combat troops due to come home this year. She said the UK was leaving Afghanistan 'not having achieved that we said we would achieve over a decade and a half ago, but leaving it a much better country than we found'.","Baroness Warsi has spoken out against Nigel Farage's party .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Angry residents have slammed Flagstaff city's use of clean drinking water to make snow for a two-day skiing event during the longest winter dry spell in the area's history. For the second year in a row, officials have used 400,000 gallons of potable water to create snow for the Dew Downtown Flagstaff Urban Ski and Snowboard Festival in Arizona, happening this weekend. While the city argues potable water is cleaner for snowboarders and skiers than reclaimed water, many residents say the practice is wasteful and bad for the environment. Before .

'Wasting 400,000 . gallons of water on a two-day event in the arid southwest is not a . prudent use of our scarce resources,' environmental advocacy group, Friends of Flagstaff's Future, said. 'We . hope to work with other community groups and our city to find . opportunities that promote tourism and engage our community in fun . activities but that are also aligned with principals of sustainability.' Azdailyasun.com reported the U.S. Drought Monitor last month expanded drought conditions across northern Arizona, reclassifying the Flagstaff region as 'abnormally dry'. In spite of this, the city of Flagstaff maintains the economic benefits of using potable water outweigh the environmental concerns. The annual festival attracts hundreds of tourists each year keen to watch snowboarders and skiers compete. According to Azfamily.com, the city reported a 19 percent increase in . sales tax revenue during the past two events. Revenue from bed, board . and beverage tax was also up by 13 percent. Small business owners have backed the use of potable water, saying the tourist boom has helped improve their ailing operations. 'We . just expanded our store now, so we have a lot more room for people to . come through, and it helps with lunch and drink sales,' business owner Kevin Collins told azfamily.com. 'It brings people down here to the store and keeps us busy as well.' Vino Loco owner Weston Miller said he sees a 30 percent boost in . sales during the festival.

'There's absolutely no need for an . event like this, in my opinion, at all during that time. Alexa Vagnozzi agreed, saying the city has other options. 'I . would prefer the more contaminated reclaimed water rather than the . drinking water because we don't want to take away the drinking water . from Flagstaff citizens or anything like that,' she said. Profitable: The city reported a 19 percent increase in sales tax revenue during the past two events which they say offsets any environmental concerns of using drinking water to make snow for the event .","Second year that the dry Arizona city has used potable water to make snow for the Dew Downtown Flagstaff Urban Ski and Snowboard Festival .

The gay ex-Tory MP, who now sits as an independent, said the 22-year-old alleged rape victim asked: ‘Should I follow you in?’ when he went to bed after a drink-fuelled dinner party at his constituency home, and then stripped off. ‘At no stage did he give me an indication that he was anything other than content to be with me in bed and having sex,’ he told officers. However, the 56-year-old did admit another man told him ‘No, stop, stop’ as they ‘nestled together’ on a sofa on an  earlier occasion, saying that he had misread his signals. Yesterday the jury in his trial at Preston Crown Court was given details of his answers following his arrest for rape on May 4 last year, five weeks after the alleged attack. ‘Did I have sexual contact with him, the answer is yes,’ the Ribble Valley MP told detectives. ‘Was it non-consensual, the answer is no.’ Evans told officers that guests at the party at his constituency home in Pendleton, Lancashire, all left except for the student, who was planning to stay in his spare room. But he said they began kissing, and when Evans went to go to his bedroom the student asked, ‘Should I follow you in?’ to which the MP said ‘Yes’, and they each took their own clothes off. ‘At what stage he thought what was going to happen was not consensual, I’m a bit mystified,’ he told officers. Evans told detectives that, far from being ‘incredibly shy’, the complainant was someone who ‘wanted to have sex with me’. ‘We are not talking about a wilting flower here,’ he added. 'We are not talking about a wilting flower here': The gay ex-Tory MP, told detectives the 22-year-old alleged rape victim asked: 'Should I follow you in?' when he went to bed after a drink-fuelled party at his home . In a second police interview a few hours later, Evans was quizzed over claims from a 23-year-old bisexual political aide who earlier told the jury he awoke on the MP’s sofa in 2009 to find Evans being intimate. Evans told officers the pair had been ‘flirtatious’ earlier in a drunken evening and he had ‘misread the signals’ by twice reaching towards him, but denied touching the man intimately. Arrested later over further allegations, Evans highlighted links between a number of his accusers and said he feared he was a victim of efforts to ‘destroy his career’. Evans denies one count of rape, six sexual assaults and two indecent assaults against seven men. The case continues.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A ‘mansion tax’ on the country’s most expensive properties could be introduced as early as next year according to Cabinet minister Danny Alexander. Mr Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said that ‘a lot of work’ had already been carried out by Treasury officials on the feasibility of a scheme. This would mean that the tax could be introduced by a Government elected at next year’s May General Election. Taxable: This home on the Thames is valued at £3.5m. It would fall foul of a mansion tax if introduced by the next government . Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Alexander said: ‘There’s a consensus among the public that a modest additional levy on higher value properties is a fair and reasonable thing to do in the context of further deficit reduction. ‘It's important that the burden is shared.’ The Chief Secretary claimed that the new levy would not be ‘punitive’ and that the Liberal Democrats are still in favour of people creating wealth. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has tasked his officials with carrying out a feasibility study on the imposition of the mansion tax . The party believes that the tax should be paid by people whose homes are valued at £2million or more. Last year, the Treasury estimated that around 55,000 homes would fall into that category although the Liberal Democrats insist the figure is closer to 70,000. Most of the homes that could fall into the taxing bracket are in London and the south–east. Prime Minister David Cameron is said to be against the tax although Chancellor George Osborne is thought to be more amenable to the idea. Opponents: London Mayor Boris Johnson is opposed to the mansion tax while Chancellor George Osborne is said to be more open to the idea . Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, vowed last week to oppose any move towards the tax, describing it as ‘brutally unfair on people who happen to be living in family homes’. Mr Alexander said he planned to soon reveal how the tax would be implemented and how houses would be valued.","The 'mansion tax' levy is to be imposed on homes worth £2m or more - believed to number about 70,000 .

"By . Ian Ladyman . After last September’s derby defeat, Manchester United manager David Moyes resorted to boxing metaphors. ‘I can take the punches and I am sure there will be more,’ said Moyes in the wake of a 4-1 loss  at the Etihad Stadium that gave the first indication of how difficult his debut season at United was going to be. VIDEO Scroll down to watch EXCLUSIVE: Who do Man United fans think will win the title? You Blue it: Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Danny Welbeck (L-R) look dejected at City in September . Looking forward: David Moyes wants United to step up and prove themselves against Manchester City . Three points: Ashley Young, Juan Mata, Shinji Kagawa and Rooney celebrate the win over West Ham . What nobody expected back then was just how punch-drunk Moyes and United would look at times over the ensuing weeks and months. If he hasn’t quite been on the canvas this season then he has certainly leant heavily on the ropes. On Tuesday night at Old Trafford one senses he must drag a match-winning performance from his team if United and their supporters are to take anything from a wretched season. ‘The punches have definitely hurt,’ said Moyes on Monday when invited to return to the theme. Rivals: United could scupper Manchester City's title charge, which would no doubt delight the fans . Plenty to smile about: But will Manuel Pellegrini and Brian Kidd be celebrating on Tuesday night? ‘They’ve hurt more because I joined Manchester United with big expectations, that I’m coming to the winning football club. ‘I’ve got a winning mentality and that’s what I wanted to do. 'So I’m disappointed with myself and I’m disappointed that we’ve been unable to win more. It’s not for the want of trying, that’s for sure.’ Given that Manchester City are deep into a Barclays Premier League title race, Tuesday night’s meeting is more important to them than it is to a team whose domestic aspirations now amount to little more than a salvation of pride. Such is United’s profile, though, such has been the unending drama of their season, the focus once again seems centred on the defending champions. Victories over Olympiacos and West Ham — the second more impressive than the first — have leant United a slightly more settled air, given the trauma of the preceding home defeat by Liverpool. The trouble with the current United, however, is that they only ever look one defeat away from fresh disaster and it’s hard to escape the feeling that if City arrive with the throttle open they may just burn the house down. Victors on enemy territory in each of the last two seasons, Manuel Pellegrini’s team also have memories of September’s mauling to buoy them. Asked if he was surprised how poor . United were, City midfielder Fernandinho said: ‘Yes, of course I was. It . was the first time I’d played them after joining City. Testing times: Carrick insists even victory in the Manchester derby cannot repair the damage at United . Painful: Manchester United's 4-1 defeat by Liverpool at Old Trafford has perhaps hurt the most . ‘It’s . a club with a lot of history, with very good players, they were the . champions — so yes, I was surprised at how badly they played that day . and how easily we won. ‘The situation is different now because we are fighting for the title and they are not, they are maybe just fighting for honour now. It’s been a bad time for them but I saw their game against Olympiacos and they played very well.’ Pellegrini neatly sidestepped a question about how many United players would get into his team. Nevertheless, it was a moot point. There does seem to be a widening gap between the teams and United’s . cause is not helped by a defensive crisis that will only be partially . eased by the return of Rio Ferdinand and by a clear imbalance between . the two midfields. More than 20 goals have sprung from the . centre of City’s midfield this season, for example, while United can . boast only one each for Michael Carrick and Tom Cleverley. From downtown: Wayne Rooney lines up an audacious lob from just within West Ham's half of the pitch . Reality: Wins over Olympiacos and West Ham don't cover over the cracks of United's poor campaign . Pellegrini would only say that ‘maybe United are more stronger and we are more technical’ in that area, while Moyes did his best to counter suggestions that his team had essentially been blown away in midfield by teams like Liverpool, City and Chelsea this season. Whatever the case, United will have to find a way to stop the marauding Yaya Toure before they can even think about imposing themselves. Asked on Monday if he had questioned himself this season, Moyes was candid. Big loss: Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring in the return fixture earlier this season . ‘I don’t actually blame myself,’ he said. ‘It wouldn’t be right to say there are things you wouldn’t maybe look at in a different way. But I’ve looked back at many things and most of the things we’ve carried out we would continue to do.’ Moyes’s self-belief will either encourage or baffle United fans, depending on their point of view. Certainly Tuesday night he needs to give them something to cling to. To return to the boxing theme, United’s domestic title belt is already surrendered. To land one final punch on Tuesday, though, would at least indicate some champion spirit remains. Fitness doubt: Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand (second right) has been struggling with a back injury .

"By . Tara Brady . Police are investigating the disappearance of around £150,000 paid by a school to a tour operator for a dream Caribbean sporting holiday for pupils that never materialised. Parents of children at Wrekin College, near Telford, Shropshire, had forked out thousands of pounds for the luxury sunshine break to Barbados on April 7. But they were devastated after the cricket and netballing holiday was scrapped at the last minute. Police have been called after disappearance of £150,000 paid by Wrekin College (pictured) to a tour operator for a dream Caribbean holiday . One parent alone is said to have lost £10,000 after the money was paid up front to a tour operator but no bookings were made. A total of 46 pupils, some of the members of their families and six supervising teachers were all due to have jetted out for the 12-day luxury get-away. They had each paid £1,800 to the operator for the trip, either directly or through the school, although some of the family members making up a supporters group are understood to have paid more to upgrade travel and accommodation arrangements. The fee-paying school reported the matter to West Mercia Police last week after failing to get the money returned and its solicitors are now to sue the operator in an effort to recover it. Wrekin College has, in the meantime and as a gesture of good faith, paid all the pupils, staff and family members affected a refund of £1,800 each. Parents of children at Wrekin College paid thousands of pounds for the luxury sunshine break to Barbados . A school spokeswoman confirmed the planned trip would not now go ahead, saying: 'It is a great disappointment to Wrekin College that this school trip has had to be cancelled. 'The tour operator organising the trip had failed to make the necessary bookings. 'A full refund of the tour cost is now being sought.' She said the matter was referred to police, after consultation with parents, and to the school's solicitors. One of the school's most famous pupils is former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. The school reported the matter to the Action Fraud central reporting centre on Monday. It will now be forwarded to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau based with the City of London Police.","Parents at Wrekin College, in Shropshire, paid thousands of pounds .

"By . Guy Walters . At first glance, they appear to be the sort of pictures that grace any family album — but look a little closer. Two of the faces are very familiar — and they usually bear scowls rather than smiles. They belong to none other than two of Britain's most feared gangsters: Ronnie and Reggie Kray. Since their heyday in the Fifties and Sixties, 'the twins', as they were known, have become synonymous with a sleazy sort of spurious glamour. They have become almost iconic figures who transcended the worlds of entertainment, politics and vicious criminality in which they moved. Strong arms: Bethnal Green hardman Chunky Morgan lifts two other members of the gang . Wartime evacuees: Ronnie (second left) and Reggie (fourth left) in Suffolk . These previously unseen pictures, which feature in a new book on the brothers, were drawn from the private collections of friends of the Krays. In them, we see the twins surrounded by their childhood pals such as 'Chunky' Morgan, and friends they made later, such as 'Big Pat' Connolly, a valued member of the Krays' gang, which went by the euphemistic name of 'the Firm'. We also see them in their later years, enjoying the life made possible by the proceeds of their crimes. Study these snapshots for any length of time and the menace in the scenarios they record becomes apparent. In one, a brilliantined Reggie and Ronnie and a gang of what they would undoubtedly call 'associates' affect an uneasy bonhomie in some East End drinking den. But, one senses, the laughs won't last. The twins, clutching halfs of bitter, exude a sense of dead-eyed threat, the hint of a sneer curling around their lips. Backyard boys: Even in this family snap taken in Bethnal Green with older brother Charlie's son, Gary, the twins Ronnie (left) and Reggie still exude a brooding air of villainy . Big Pat, in the centre of the picture, sizes up a gap-toothed, grinning hanger-on, perhaps assessing whether he is 'taking liberties' and needs 'sorting'. Big Pat was a Glaswegian who met Reggie when the two men were on remand in Brixton Prison. He was soon given a job as a doorman at the Krays' Double R club in the East End. 'Pat's weight was between 17 and 18st and could he could punch his weight,' Reggie later recalled. 'He had a couple of scars on his face due to various battles he had been in, and when he and Limehouse Willy were fighting side by side they were a good team to have on one's side.' In the swim: East End lads relaxing at the local lido, but Reggie (second left) already had a fearsome reputation . Tragic spouse: Reggie with his ill-fated young wife, Frances, and a friend . Drinks with the Krays: Ronnie (far left) and Reggie (far right) in an East End pub, with bodyguard Pat Connolly (centre, rear) In another picture, conveying all the grit and grime of the old East End, the twins stand in front of a ramshackle fence in a back alley in Bethnal Green. A bored-looking  Reggie holds their brother Charlie's son, Gary. Ronnie — hands thrust deep in his pockets, tie tightly knotted but askew — glares moodily at the photographer. In another shot, Chunky Morgan demonstrates his prodigious strength by holding aloft two gang members. Like the Krays, Chunky was born in Bethnal Green and into villainy. His father had been imprisoned for taking part in a raid on a warehouse where he was employed as a security guard. Chunky and his brother Dickie were great friends of the Krays, and Chunky's girth proved useful in many a gangland scrap. A habitual criminal, he eventually  graduated from borstal to Parkhurst prison. Star turn: Pianist Winifred Atwell, local children and a sullen Ronnie . The Krays themselves were almost born to a life of crime. Their father, Charlie senior, . was hardly the ideal role model. At the outbreak of the World War II he was called up to join the Army, but deserted. Frequently away from home and up to no good, the twins probably saw more of the police, who kept visiting their house at 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green, than they did their father. It was up to their mother, Violet, to keep the family together, which was a struggle. For a while, her three sons stayed out of trouble, and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring, where the twins would win many a competition. Close: A photo Barbara Windsor signed for Ronnie . However, by their late teens, Ronnie and Reggie were also fighting on the streets, and they soon started their own gang. When they turned 18 in 1951, they decided that military service was not for them. They spent most of their National Service in the guardroom. Matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen, and were imprisoned in Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Upon their return to the East End, it was clear they would never settle into regular lives. Their first business venture was a club called the Regal, off the Mile End Road, which looked like a dive from the outside but which the Krays turned into a glamorous, fashionable nightspot. In their sharp suits, they did their best to maintain, publicly at least, a veneer of respectability, but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable, from straightforward theft to gang violence and — ultimately — murder. Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Unusually for that time, Ronnie was also publicly bisexual, which Reggie found difficult to accept. Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is likely to have had an affair. Ronnie remained unmarried, and Reggie's marriage to Frances Shea in 1965 only lasted for eight months. She died in 1967. It is thought that she committed suicide, although according to one account, Frances was murdered by Ronnie, for reasons that are unclear. In the middle of 1968, the twins disappear from the family album, for the simple reason that they and older brother Charlie were arrested for murder. Ronnie had shot a rival gang member called George Cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub, and Reggie, normally the 'gentle' one, had repeatedly stabbed gang member Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in the face and neck for not following orders. Both men were given life sentences, with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years. Charlie was sent down for ten years, for being an accessory to the murder of McVitie. The next time the brothers were photographed together was not for any family album, but for the newspapers, when they were allowed out of prison to attend their mother's funeral in 1982. Their father died a year later, and by 2000, both the twins and their brother had followed him. The Krays' family album may be full of memories but, one suspects, very few of them are happy. * The Krays From The Cradle To The Grave (Media Arts, £35).","Ronnie and Reggie Kray have become synonymous with a sleazy sort of spurious glamour .

"By . Jason Groves . One in 10 Ukip supporters say they will not switch their vote at the election in order to keep Ed Miliband out . Just one in 10 Ukip supporters would consider switching their vote to keep Ed Miliband out of Downing Street, a major new poll revealed yesterday. The study by the former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft found that most supporters of the anti-EU party do not believe to David Cameron's warning that they risk wrecking hopes of an EU referendum by aiding a Labour victory. The finding is a major blow to the Tories who fear a strong showing for Ukip in next year's General Election could cost them dozens of seats. The Tories 'Vote Ukip, get Labour' - or 'Vote Farage, get Miliband' slogan is expected to play a key role in the party's strategy next year. But the new study of 2,300 Ukip supporters found that that just over half (51 per cent) disagreed with the statement 'a vote for Ukip makes the prospect of Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister more likely'. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) agreed they might inadvertently help Labour into power but said they did not care. Just 10 per cent said they would consider changing their vote to keep Mr Miliband out. The figure was slightly higher among voters who had defected from the Tories in the first place, with 14 per cent saying they would consider switching back next year. Lord Ashcroft said the results showed that the Tory message needs 'spelling out' to voters who may spend little time thinking about the intricacies of the British electoral system. He said the Tories needed to learn the lessons of the last election when they faced a similar challenge in trying to persuade voters that a vote for the Liberal Democrats was likely to result in a hung Parliament. He said: 'Again, it seemed so obvious as hardly to need stating that the more Tories there were in the House of Commons, the greater the chance of a new administration. 'But this message was harder to get across than you might think.' Lord Ashcroft insisted that the poll findings were not a disaster for the Conservatives, adding: 'If one in seven Tory-Ukip defectors might be persuaded to reconsider on the spot by this argument, that is not a failure. 'With marginal voters in marginal seats, the margins matter.' The news will be a boost to Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left) and troubling to David Cameron (right) as the mantra 'Vote Ukip, get Labour' is expected to be part of Tory election campaigning next year . But the findings are likely to dismay Tory strategists who fear they will be wiped out in a string of marginal seats unless they succeed in winning back a much higher proportion of voters who have defected to Ukip. Tory High Command believes that Mr Miliband's recent decision to all-but rule out an In/Out referendum on Europe has strengthened their anti-Ukip message by making it clear that only the Conservatives will deliver a referendum. But the new poll underlines the scale of the challenge facing the Conservatives. The new study also looked at wider public attitudes to Europe, based on a poll of more than 20,000 people. It found that Britain was split down the middle on the Europe question, with 41 per cent wanting to stay in and 41 per cent wanting to leave. Almost one-fifth of voters (19 per cent) were classified as having a 'committed hostility' to Europe. This group of mainly older, white voters saw immigration as the most important issue facing Britain, ranking it even higher than the economy. A larger group (27 per cent) were classified as discontented sceptics'. Almost 90 per cent said they believed the costs of EU membership outweigh the benefits. Poll found Britons split on Europe, with 41 per cent wanting to stay and 41 per cent in favour of leaving . A further quarter (26 per cent) were classed as 'relaxed status quo'. They tended to be younger voters with higher qualifications. Their main concerns focused on jobs and the economy, with Europe the least important issue in their lives. Another 12 per cent were classed as 'global progressives'. They were more likely to work in the public sector and twice as likely to vote Labour. They valued the freedom to travel and trade. Almost a third said they saw no real drawbacks to EU membership. A further 15 per cent were classified as 'disengaged'. This group comprised mainly young, working class women. More than 80 per cent do not have a clear view on the costs and benefits of EU membership.","Tories have been warning that voting Ukip will hand Labour victory .

"By . Mark Nicol Defence Correspondent . At least 30 Royal Marines became violently ill on a training mission at an abandoned Soviet chemical weapons plant, where they believe they were exposed to mustard gas. The crack troops needed urgent medical attention while on manoeuvres on Sazan Island, an uninhabited island just off the Albanian coast where Soviet scientists developed deadly gases during the Cold War. One Marine said: ‘The guys were in agony, the skin on their hands  and arms went bright red then became blistered. Sazan island off the Albanian coast is uninhabited. It was used to test poisonous gases during the Cold War. During a training trip on the island, 30 marines fell violently ill. ‘At least one Marine was gasping for breath when the atmosphere triggered a respiratory problem. We are sure it was mustard gas. ‘Medics treated the Marines. Even though they’ve recovered since the incident, they remain concerned for themselves and their families. The Soviets developed some lethal chemicals on Sazan and the island has had no permanent population for 30 years – go figure, after what happened on this exercise.’ The Marines, from the UK’s elite Response Force Task Group, were struck down during an 11-hour ground assault on a mock enemy stronghold on Sazan. The commandos cleared their way through a maze of tunnels and buildings that were previously occupied by Soviet soldiers as part of the annual Exercise Albanian Lion, which involves 3,000 personnel. Marines (not those pictured) needed urgent medical attention while on manoeuvres on Sazan Island, just off the Albanian coast, where Soviet scientists developed deadly gases during the Cold War . During the Cold War, Albania relied heavily on the Soviet Union and the island was used as a major strategic base in the Mediterranean. Soviet troops built a submarine compound there, and a chemical and biological weapons plant, before withdrawing from Albania during the 1980s. To this day the environmental damage caused by experiments there remains unclear. Soviet-era gas masks are still scattered across the island, which is three miles long and just under two miles wide. Soviet-era gas masks (not those pictured) are still scattered across the island, which is three miles long and just under two miles wide . Last night the Royal Navy insisted that an investigation into the incident last summer had concluded that the most probable cause of the Marines’ symptoms was not mustard gas but a poisonous plant. The giant hogweed which grows wild on Sazan Island releases a toxic sap which can cause severe damage to the skin and blindness if any enters the eye. A Navy spokesman said: ‘The health and welfare of our personnel are always our top priorities. ‘We are aware that a number of personnel reported short-term illness relating to training on Sazan Island but can confirm that no  personnel have reported any ongoing symptoms. ‘Every effort has been taken to establish the cause of the illness which is thought most likely to be  a plant.’ The spokesman added: ‘No further Royal Marine exercise activity on Sazan Island is currently planned.’","Needed urgent medical attention while training Sazan Island, off Albania .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Tim Shipman . Politicians raced to declare their love for bingo yesterday as a political row continued to rage about the Tories patronising the working classes. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Chancellor George Osborne and Tory chairman Grant Shapps all let it be known that they liked calling ‘House!’ – and not just in the Commons. Mr Osborne halved bingo tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent in the Budget this week, and knocked 1p off a pint of beer. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne says he not only plays bingo, but sometimes calls the numbers, but Nick Clegg admitted he had not gone eyes down for a decade . The move to cut bingo tax in the Budget saw internet spoofs about the Cabinet's level of interest in the game, including this one from Joel Benjamin posted on Twitter . But his efforts to woo blue-collar . workers were undermined when Mr Shapps tweeted an advert which read: . ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people . do more of the things they enjoy.’ ‘they’ was widely  dismissed as patronising and  further evidence that the . Conservatives are out of touch with many less well-off voters. t was later parodied online in numerous spoofs. rday sought to redeem himself, insisting that  he too enjoyed the pleasure of a pint and an evening spent spotting  the numbers. On . a visit to Carlisle, he told the BBC: ‘I drink beer and I love a game . of bingo.’ The Tory chairman dismissed the row as controversy whipped up . by the Labour Party. Nick Clegg said he used to play bingo when living in Nottingham a decade ago, most likely at Beacon Bingo in Loughborough . He . spoke out after Mr Clegg told the Western Morning News that he used to . enjoy the game – but hadn’t played for a decade or more. ‘Not . for years,’ he said, ‘when I was living in Nottingham. There was a . bingo hall there – I’m not sure if it’s still there – in Loughborough.’ Mr . Clegg lived in the Nottinghamshire village of Ruddington when he was . the MEP for the East  Midlands, but stood down in 2004. He said the Tory . advert was ‘silly’ because it overshadowed important measures in the . Budget. 'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget - which spawned numerous spoofs online . A Tory party advert promoting a beer and bingo tax cut was condemned by Labour leader Ed Miliband. Speaking at a conference in Scotland, Mr Miliband said: 'What about that advert that they released? 'Have you seen a more condescending, patronising, arrogant, haughty, out-of-touch, misconceived piece of nonsense? 'And didn’t the mask slip? The “hardworking people of Britain”. The Conservatives say “they”. We say “us”. 'We are the party of the hardworking people of every part of our United Kingdom.' But he added: ‘I . think it’s very good that we’re letting people know we’re helping the . bingo industry – that was decimated under the last Labour government – . the pub industry and the brewing industry. These are important measures; . by the way these industries employ many thousands of people, but they . weren’t the only things in the budget.’ Mr . Osborne confessed on Thursday that he had played several times. Asked . on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he had ever played bingo, he said: ‘Yes I . have.’ One . said: ‘He has played and called. He was a happy participant’. David . Cameron yesterday dodged questions about whether he was a fan of bingo. He . told a press conference in Brussels: ‘The issue here is trying to make . sure there are fair taxes. I think bingo wasn’t taxed fairly and I’m . very pleased that we’ve managed to cut the tax on bingo.’ Downing . Street refused to say if Mr Cameron had ever played bingo. The Prime . Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘I still haven’t had the opportunity . to ask him. I haven’t asked him about bingo at all.’ Pressed on whether he would give details later on Mr Cameron’s bingo habits, he replied: ‘I think I may disappoint you.’ Labour . leader Ed Miliband used a speech in Scotland to condemn the Tory advert . and the cut in bingo tax. He said it ‘won’t go to the  people playing . bingo, it’s going to go to the bingo companies’. And . he added: “Did you see that advert?

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . The most outlandish theory hanging in the moist heat of Kuala Lumpur was that Bernie Ecclestone is staging one of the cleverest heists in a career of clever heists by talking down the sport he spent a lifetime transforming. The theory goes that he is criticising the lack of noise from the new V6 engines because he wants the value of Formula One to fall. He will then orchestrate the purchase of the majority share in the business at a reduced price and remain in charge for the rest of eternity. His willing accomplice, so the conspiracy runs, could conceivably be Dietrich Mateschitz, the Red Bull owner, a fellow billionaire, friend and recent critic of the quieter engines. Centre of attention: Bernie Ecclestone, in Malaysia this weekend, could be staging a heist of the sport . Stunning plot: Ecclestone, who turns 84 in October, has been critical of this year's quieter engines . Formula One's current majority owners, CVC, could then wash their hands of Ecclestone before a German court reaches a verdict later this year on whether their octogenarian billionaire chief executive bribed a German banker called Gerhard Gribkowsky the last time the sport was sold, in 2005. According to the script, Ferrari, who possess a veto on these matters, would be induced onside, Ecclestone would stay in overall control and Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner would be tutored to take over if the old boy ever actually died. Fanciful? Perhaps. After all it could be doing no more than stirring up controversy - in this case about something he fervently believes in, namely engine noise. Consiparcy: Dietrich Mateschitz (left) would be Ecclestone's willing accomplice while Christian Horner would be tutored to take over when the 83-year-old passed, according to the outlandish theory . It is an old tactic of his that has made the Formula One soap opera rival Coronation Street with its cast of heroes, lunatics, cheats and Machiavellis. But everything that happens in Formula One has a reason behind it. And Ecclestone talking down the product he sells is like Del Boy telling you the video recorder that's fallen off a lorry won't switch on. So, maybe, the buying it back story is not so mad after all. Anyway, in his usual spirit of mischievousness Ecclestone said he would like to get the noise levels up, adding: 'I wish I could get it up.' He is 84 in October. On a day when Mercedes' Nico Rosberg finished practice at the top of the timesheets to reinforce their status as favourites to win the Malaysian Grand Prix tomorrow, Ecclestone was hearing for real what the fuss was all about - the engines - for the first time. He had previously only heard them in the Ferrari factory and on his television set at home a fortnight ago during the staging of the season-opener in Melbourne. Here he declared them 'slightly better' than he had imagined - a result, to a degree, of the grandstand opposite the garages providing improved acoustics. That was about as generous as he got. On track: Nico Rosberg, who won in Australia, was fastest in practice for Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix . Did you hear that? Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton drives past the Force India pit-wall on Friday . He said: 'Mr Ong, the Singapore promoter, is here and he told me that if the public don't like the engines then they will definitely stop hosting the race. 'Ron Walker in Australia is not happy. The Americans are not happy. Here, they are well down on public tickets. People go to F1 races for the atmosphere and the noise. I am not happy with what we have but we have to deal with it. 'I asked Stefano Domenicali (the Ferrari team principal) if anything can be done about it. He said he would ask his engineers but it is probably too late now. I said we should get the engineers goldplated PlayStations and send them to a desert island to play with them instead of building engines that are great pieces of equipment we don't need.' Steady: Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel was third in the timesheets on Friday . Horner agreed that the sport is in need of an image makeover after the fallout from Melbourne - naturally enough as it was his driver, Daniel Ricciardo, who was disqualified for an alleged breach of the fuel-flow pressure. He said the rules were too complex for easy digestion by fans. He instead argued that the rule on fuel-flow pressure (of all tedious things) should be done away with and teams allowed to use their 100kg of fuel any way they liked. The sagacity of his suggestion was reinforced by the fact that Ricciardo's new sensor failed during practice, underlining Red Bull's belief the equipment being used by the FIA is not reliable. They will argue as much at an appeal hearing on April 14. Their form yesterday was encouraging: their world champion Sebastian Vettel was third fastest, a place ahead of Rosberg's team-mate Lewis Hamilton and a place behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. So will Red Bull again defy the FIA if they believe the sensor is at fault? 'Hopefully, we can agree something with the FIA that is sensible', said Horner non-commitally.","Theory cites Bernie Ecclestone wants the value of F1 to decrease .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . The Open Championship at St Andrews next year appeared the perfect place for Greg Norman to wave goodbye, stopping — like the legends before him — on the Swilcan Burn for the obligatory  farewell photo of a lifetime. But, in news that will come as a bitter disappointment to his vast army of admirers, I can reveal it won’t be happening for the two-time Claret Jug winner, owing to an ugly dispute that reflects badly on the game. The 59-year-old Aussie great, never one to pull his punches, said: ‘If you want the truth, I’ve played in my last Open and it’s all down to the way the Royal and Ancient and the European Tour have handled my whole situation. Wrangle: Greg Norman will not play at The Open Championship this year . Icon: Norman and his wife Lorna back in 1993 as the Australian claims his second Claret Jug . Spot the difference: Norman kisses the trophy in 1986 (left) and in 1993 (right) ‘It has left a pretty sour taste in my mouth, a bad feeling after what I have done in the game. I’ve nothing against the R&A and the European Tour but, quite frankly, the way they go about their business is not the way I do it.’ What on earth would cause the Shark to bite such lumps out of the two bodies? It all concerns the intense rivalry between watch companies Rolex and Omega, both big players in golf. Such is their competitiveness that Norman, who represents Omega, reckons Rolex kept him out of playing in the pro-am for the Senior British Open — an event they sponsor — in 2012 over a Turnberry course where he had walked away from the field in the Open in 1986 (Rolex deny this). A month later, Norman was at  Gleneagles and planned to be present to hear his friend, Ryder Cup captain Jose-Maria Olazabal’s wildcards announcement. Again, Rolex were heavily involved and, again, Norman believes he was denied entry. Now, he says he has had enough. Instead of meeting up with friends in Scotland and Ireland and playing in the Open at Royal Liverpool and the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl in July, he will retire with his wife Kirsten to his holiday ranch in Colorado. The big losers in all of this, of course, are the fans. One of the great sights in recent Open history came at Royal Birkdale in 2008 when thousands of people followed the halfway leader Norman on his improbable quest to win a third Claret Jug at the age of 53. A grand farewell at St Andrews, the last Open for which he will be eligible, appeared ideal. How ironic this act of perfect timing looks like being sabotaged by a watch dispute. Let’s hope some wise heads at the R&A and the European Tour can resolve it, for Norman’s inestimable contribution to recent Open lore deserves a fitting finale. In line: Norman is one of the game's greats but will not be at the Open . Nervous wait: Norman and his caddy take a break during the final round of the 1986 tournament in Turnberry . Picture perfect: Norman tees off at the ninth hole in Ayrshire, Scotland . Putt your money on Bubba & Dustin . Early tips for the Masters, now just three weeks away? You could do worse than have a sneaky pound or two on former winner Bubba Watson and major champion-in-waiting, Dustin Johnson.You’ll know all about their length on an Augusta course offering the big bombers a huge advantage. But how about their ability to cope on those lightning-paced greens? In waiting: Dustin Johnson could be in line to pick up the green jacket in three weeks' time . Job done: Bubba Watson won the tournament back in 2012 and will be gunning for another one . Well, the two men who currently stand miles clear of the rest on the PGA Tour this year when it comes to the longest streaks without a three-putt, at 237 and 217 holes respectively, just happen to be Watson and Johnson. ‘It feels good to win again after seven years. A lot of good things are going to follow.’ Australian John Senden had to end a victory drought going back to 2006  to make it to the Masters and that’s exactly what he did on Sunday, holding off the likes of Luke Donald to win the latest event on the Florida swing. How many players win professional events at the age of 17? Matteo Manassero is the only one to have done so on the European Tour and did it twice for good measure. Ryo Ishikawa achieved similar things in Japan and then there’s the extraordinary New Zealander Lydia Ko, who broke all records in winning at the age of only 15. This, therefore, is the company of prodigies English starlet Charley Hull is keeping with her maiden success on the Ladies European Tour on Sunday. Hull shot 62 in the final round of . the Lalla Meryem Cup in Morocco, to catch the experienced French player . Gwladys Nocera, and then birdied the first extra hole to beat her in the . play-off. Sealed with a kiss: Matteo Manassero won the Castellon Masters Costa Azahar in 2010 . Record breaker: New Zealander Lydia Ko with the New Zealand Women's Golf Open trophy . Star quality: Charley Hull won the Lalla Meryem Cup in Morocco this month . The Woburn starlet will celebrate her 18th on Thursday, having rounded off a memorable year that saw her turn pro and promptly finish runner-up in each of her first five starts. She then became the youngest participant to compete in the Solheim Cup last August, where she proved one of the stars of Europe’s historic first success on American soil. With an historic Olympics not far away and so much more, what wonders the photogenic Hull is going to do for women’s golf in the UK.","Greg Norman says he has played his last Open Championship .

"By . David Kent . Golden girl: Former athlete Donna Hartley-Wass died suddenly while sunbathing at her home . Former Olympic 400m bronze medalist Donna Hartley-Wass has been pronounced dead after sunbathing in her home. The 58-year-old was found lying on a sun lounger by her husband, comedian and actor Bobby Knutt. Hartley-Wass had been taking prescribed medication for an irregular heart rhythm and high blood pressure. Although a pathologist said as an elite athlete her heart had been 'worked harder than most' he could not ascertain the cause of her death. Knutt said in a statement she had been to work as a fitness instructor at a . local gym, then saw a physiotherapist for back pain before she began . relaxing with a glass of wine. He . said: 'We went into the garden to enjoy the sunshine and she was just . wearing bikini bottoms. She went on the sun lounger to do her back face . down. 'I . went inside to watch a DVD then came back out to talk to her but she . appeared to be sleepy so I thought better of it and left her. 'I went back in to watch some more DVDs then went outside again to see if she wanted some suntan lotion rubbing on her back. 'She . was still in the same position face down with her head resting on her . arms but her face had turned purple and she looked like she had died.' He phoned for an ambulance to their home at Elsecar, near Barnsley but she could not be resuscitated. He . went on: 'She was fit and did not take drugs and would only have a . couple of glasses of wine. I’m shocked. It was completely unexpected.' Mrs Hartley-Wass's distinctive shoulder-length blonde hair and speed on the track earned her the nickname 'golden girl' in the late 1970s. Pathologist . Dr Charles Wilson said Hartley-Wass had been suffering from hypertension and . an abnormal heart rhythm for which she was taking tablets to lower her . blood pressure and prevent complications. Golden girl: Hartley-Wass graced the cover of . fitness magazines during her bodybuilding heyday in the late 1980s . (left). She way pictured early this year (right) before her 58th . birthday. But her heart, lungs and liver were completely normal and there was no blockage of the coronary arteries. He . did find a 'striking' build up of iron in her liver which he said was . almost always genetic yet does not often cause sudden death. Hartley-Wass married fellow athlete Bill . Hartley in 1977, but the relationship ended in divorce. She met TV actor . Bobby Knutt in 1984 and they married three years later. Donna took her husband’s real surname Wass and moved to live in his native Sheffield. After retiring from athletics she became a champion body builder and won the ‘Miss Britain Physique’ title. On-and-off the track accomplishments: Hartley-Wass won a bronze medal in . the 4x400m relay at the 1980 Moscow Olympics for Great Britain (left) and she was awarded an MBE . in 1979 (right). Amazonian: Apart from her sporting talents, Hartley-Wass was famed for her athletic good looks . She later ran a line dancing school in the city and had been working as a hotel leisure club manager when she died. A . self-confessed sun worshipper, she returned home early from work on . Friday to soak up the rays in her garden and make the most of the fine . June weather. Mr Knutt, 67, . said they went outside together at about 3pm and he returned inside to . watch television about half-an-hour later. When he went back out some . time later to speak to his wife she was dead. ‘I . went out to see her and she had gone. I don’t know what happened, she . might have had a heart attack.’ The couple have no children but Mr Knutt . has a daughter from a previous marriage. Fit and healthy: Hartley-Wass (centre) led keep-fit classes near her home in Sheffield . 'She had none of the common features of liver failure,' he added. However he did discover a pigment in her heart which is normally only seen in elderly people. Donna Hartley-Wass was born in Southampton in 1955 and came to early prominence in the athletics world when she became a south of England sprint champion while still a teenager.The talented runner originally became well known under her maiden name Murray and her distinctive looks made her an instantly recognisable figure.She and won the AAA's 200 metres in 1972 then the 400 metres in 1975 but it was the 400 metres in which she excelled.In 1977 she became UK 400 metres champion and also became one half of a UK athletics golden couple she married fellow athlete and European 400 metres champion Bill Hartley. The marriage later ended in divorce.In 1978, Hartley won two Commonwealth gold medals in Edmonton, Canada, in the 400 metres and the 4x400m relay.In 1979 she was European cup semi finalist winner in both the 400 metres and 400m relay again and crowned a stellar year with a visit to the palace to pick up her MBE.The highlight of her career came in 1980 when she won a bronze medal at the Moscow Olympic Games in the 4x400m relay.After retiring from athletics with an achilles heel problem, she married actor and comedian Robert Wass, better known as Bobby Knutt, and became a champion body builder winning the Miss Britain Physique title in 1988. 'Because . she was an athlete her heart would have done an awful lot more work . than the average person’s heart,' said the pathologist. 'I . don’t know whether this caused heart failure. I couldn’t see anything . which suggests that to be the cause. We have a previously healthy lady . who has died suddenly.' Dr Wilson said it was possible the electrical activity of the heart was interrupted causing an irregular heart beat which led to death or there were several natural possible causes. He had carried out a full review and toxicological tests but concluded it was unascertained. 'I don’t know the underlying precise pathological cause of her death,' he said. 'Her heart was worked much harder than the average person but I don’t think it is sufficient to give a cause of death,' he said. He told assistant Sheffield coroner Louise Slater that he was satisfied Donna died from natural causes. 'It fits the category of natural disease which we can’t detect with current medical science,' he said. Det Sgt Stuart Hall said police were called in to investigate the death after blisters were found on Donna’s back but it turned out to be nothing untoward as she had been lying in the sun. In his statement Mr Knutt said: 'She did all her training clean. She had strong moral compass and was immediately successful in her body-building career.' He went on: 'It was completely unexpected because she was fine earlier in the day.' Recording a conclusion of death from natural causes, the coroner said: 'It was a completely natural event however unexpected. Science cannot prove what happened at that time. 'These are very unusual circumstances. I know what a terrific athlete and body-builder she was.' After the hearing Mr Knutt said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life. She was as fit as a butcher’s dog and only looked about 42. She used to worry about everything but that is how she was.'","Donna Hartley-Wass was found dead at home whilst sunbathing .

"Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, admitted to being scared of the South African track star in a text message sent less than three weeks before he shot her dead, a police expert told his murder trial today. Pistorius was in tears as the messages were read aloud in the Pretoria court - one of them from the model to the athlete read: 'I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me,' while a later text read, 'I can’t be attacked by outsider for dating u and be attacked by you the person I deserve protection from.' The couple argued about what she alleged was the athlete's short temper and jealousy, police Capt. Francois Moller testified, citing text messages he extracted from cell phones. Scroll down for video . Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius weeps as he sits in the dock. Reeva Steenkamp, admitted to being scared of the South African track star in a text message sent less than three weeks before he shot her dead, a police expert told his murder trial today . One of the model's messages sent using WhatsApp read: 'I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me' Moller says that about 90 per cent of the messages he downloaded were what he called normal and 'loving' exchanges. But there were exceptions that he printed out for the court in Pistorius' murder trial. The Olympic and Paralympic athlete is on trial for the murder of 29-year-old model and law graduate Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he was deeply in love with Steenkamp, whom he had been dating for a few months, and that he mistook for an intruder hiding in a toilet at his luxury Pretoria home. A message sent by Steenkamp read: 'We . are living in a double standard relationship. Every five seconds I hear . about how you dated another chick. You really have dated a lot of . people yet you get upset if I mention one funny story with a long term . boyfriend.' Oscar Pistorius takes his seat in today. A neighbour testified that she heard gunshots, screaming and then a . second set of gun shots on the night that the double-amputee runner . fatally shot his girlfriend . The . Paralympic track star walks past June Steenkamp mother of Reeva . Steenkamp, as he makes his way to the dock in the North Gauteng High . Court in Pretoria . Pistorius calls his girlfriend 'Angel' and she called him 'Baba.' In one message exchange the pair appear to be arguing over an incident at a friend's engagement party. Steenkamp wrote: 'I regard myself as a lady and I didn't feel like one tonight after the way u treated me when we left.  I am trying my best to make u happy and I feel as tho u sometimes never are no matter the effort I put in. I can’t be attacked by outsider for dating u and be attacked by you the person I deserve protection from.' Pistorius wrote in a message: 'I want to talk to you. I want to sort this out. I don’t want to have anything less than amazing for you and I’m sorry for the things I saw without thinking and for taking offense to some of your actions.’ He said that his illness and sickness was not ‘an excuse.’ ‘I was upset you that you just left me after we got food to go talk to a guy and I was standing right behind you watching you touch his arm and ignore me and when I spoke up you introduced me which you could’ve done but when I left you just kept on chatting to him when clearly I was upset.' In another message, Pistorius told Steenkamp that his friends will take the blame for a shooting incident that occurred a month before Steenkamp was killed. Pistorius greets a policeman as he makes his way to the dock. Pistorius has said he shot his girlfriend by mistake through a locked toilet door, thinking that she was an intruder in his home . Oscar Pistorius makes a call on his mobile phone before proceedings get under way . Earlier today a . neighbour of Pistorius testified that she heard gunshots, screaming and . then a second set of gun shots on the night that the runner fatally . shot Steenkamp. Anette . Stipp's testimony matched some of the evidence given by other witnesses . earlier in the trial who said they also heard a woman screaming around . the time that Pistorius killed Steenkamp before dawn on February 14, . 2013. The defence has . countered that the neighbors were actually hearing Pistorius screaming . in a high-pitched voice after he shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model. Pistorius has said he shot his . girlfriend by mistake through a locked toilet door, thinking that she . was an intruder in his home.

Stipp, . the neighbor, said under questioning from Nel that she heard gunshots . while lying awake around 3 a.m. on the night of the shooting, and then . heard the 'terrified, terrified' screams of a woman. Her . bedroom is situated across a grassy area about 70 metres (230 feet) from Pistorius' home, and the windows of the athlete's bathroom are . visible from her window. 'The . screaming at that stage just continued,' said Stipp, who recalled . looking out from a balcony at two houses with lights on in the gated . estate where her family and Pistorius lived. Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius arrives ahead of his trial . Oscar Pistorius, left, accompanied by relatives arrives at the high court in Pretoria earlier today . Defence lawyer Barry Roux has said that after Pistorius fired into the door that he battered the door with a cricket bat to try to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle . She . said she told her husband Johan, who previously testified, that the . screaming sounded as though a 'family murder' had taken place. 'There . was definitely a female screaming for quite a period,' Anette Stipp . said. 'You could definitely hear two different voices.' She said she then heard a second set of shots, and the screaming stopped. The defence has said that Pistorius fired into the door and then battered the door with a cricket bat to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle. Hilton Botha,  left, former lead detective in the Oscar Pistorius murder case, arrives ahead of Pistorius's trial . Conversation: June Steenkamp, the mother of Reeva Steenkamp, talks to an unidentified woman from the ANC Women's League . It insists that some neighbors who testified mistook the sound of the cricket bat striking the door for gunshots. Pistorius' camp also maintains that Pistorius fired with quick bursts that gave . Steenkamp no time to scream, and so Pistorius did not realize he was . shooting at Steenkamp. A . South African police ballistics expert, however, has testified that the . first of three bullets that struck Steenkamp hit her in the right hip, . giving her time to scream before she was hit in the arm and head. Defence . lawyer Kenneth Oldwadge pressed neighbor Anette Stipp on her . recollections, questioning whether she was inside her house or on a . balcony while hearing what she said were shots and screams, and whether . she was alert because she had said she was slightly ill at the time. He said she was wrong to say the light was in Pistorius' bathroom around the time of the shooting. Stipp also testified about an incident this year in which she again heard screams in the estate at night. Together: Reeva Steenkamp pictured with Pistorius. The prosecution allege he intentionally killed her after an argument . Scene: Pistorius shot Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door at his home (above) in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year . The testimony appeared to refer to what Pistorius' defense lawyers have . referred to as noise tests that they conducted to determine how sound . carries and to prove their contention that the runner screams in a high . voice when extremely anxious. The sounds included a male voice screaming in both high and low pitches, Stipp said. The . screaming this year, she said, had 'very little emotion,' in contrast . to the screaming she heard on the night of Steenkamp's death. Nel, . the prosecutor, has said he will wrap up his case against Pistorius . this week after calling four or five more witnesses to support his . contention that the Olympian intentionally killed Steenkamp after an . argument. The defence will then present its case. Judicial officials say the trial will continue until May 16, with a recess in April.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone feels the sport needs to crank up the volume to improve the show. But after hearing first hand the quieter noise of the new 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units - compared to the more visceral V8s - at a circuit for the first time this season, Ecclestone believes the sound levels are not as bad as many have criticised. Australian Grand Prix chairman Ron Walker claimed Ecclestone was 'horrified' by the drop in decibels after watching the season-opening race a fortnight ago on television. Making a noise: Bernie Ecclestone was in the paddock on Friday after missing the opening race of the season . Attending this weekend's race in Malaysia at the Sepang International Circuit, although the 83-year-old could hold a conversation in the pit lane, he was not unduly concerned. 'It's a little louder than we thought, so if we can just get it (the noise) up a little bit more then it would be all right,' said Ecclestone. 'It sounds terrible on TV, but the problem isn't that, it's about the people coming here and the whole atmosphere of Formula One. 'People said you couldn't hear anything, but it's not true. It just needs to be a bit louder than we have now.' Issues: Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified from the season-opening race in Australia following a fuel irregularity . In the fast lane: Red Bull experienced more issues with the fuel-flow sensors during practice for Sunday's race . Meanwhile, Red Bull experienced more issues with the contentious fuel-flow sensors during practice for the Malaysian Grand Prix, raising the prospect of another showdown with Formula One officials similar to the one that resulted in the team's disqualification in Australia. Daniel Ricciardo was excluded in Melbourne after finishing second, because race stewards said Red Bull exceeded the new fuel flow limit of 100 kilograms per hour. Red Bull blamed the issue on faulty readings from the FIA-approved fuel sensors and subsequently  appealed. The sensors on Ricciardo's car malfunctioned again at Sepang, team principal Christian Horner said, showing a discrepancy with the team's own fuel-flow readings. Horner said he would talk with race director Charlie Whiting if the problem persisted on Saturday, in the hope of avoiding another post-race drama. 'If we don't (get synchronised readings) we will find ourselves in an awkward situation, but one we will try to work with the FIA on, but we will find ourselves in the same dilemma as Melbourne,' Horner said. We will have that conversation with Charlie and hopefully we can agree on something that is sensible. 'We need a better way of measuring and monitoring the fuel flow, or say you get rid of it and you have 100 kilograms for the race and that's it. Personally, I think it would be easier to get rid of it.'","Bernie Ecclestone says the cars sounds 'louder than we thought'

Naomi Bloomer said the receipt was 'clearly visible to customers' on the bar at Grind Coffee Bar, at Westfield Stratford, London. But when she complained to a member of staff she was apparently told 'Yeah, we've been rammed', it has been reported. Complained: Student Naomi Bloomer (left) found the receipt (right) on the bar at Grind Coffee Bar at Westfield Stratford, London and was shocked to discover it contained the expletive . The receipt features the words 'f*****s all come at once' along with the list of items bought at the shop. Ms Bloomer, a student at University College London, told the Evening Standard: 'This receipt was just sitting there on the bar, clearly visible to customers. 'I just thought it was really inappropriate and so I complained.' The student, from Kentish Town, London, said when she initially complained to a cashier he told her: 'Yeah we've been rammed'. Ms Bloomer said she has now complained three times to Westfield but has just been 'fobbed off and ignored'. Dave Dickinson, owner of the coffee bar, told the Standard the chain strives for 'super-friendly' customer service and apologised to the customer. 'Fobbed off': When Ms Bloomer complained to a member of staff at Grind Coffee Bar (pictured) she was reportedly told: 'Yeah, we've been rammed' Westfield Stratford, which had more than £9 billion spent on its regeneration, and boasts a modern transport hub, Europe’s biggest shopping mall and the vast Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, was this week revealed as the country's worst crime hotspot. An analysis of police figures by The Mail on Sunday found the postcode covering the shopping centre is plagued by almost 200 offences every month. Scotland Yard has recorded 3,440 crimes in the area over the past 18 months, including 500 shoplifting offences, almost 300 violent crimes and hundreds of pick-pocketings and muggings. A spokesman for Westfield insisted the postcode covered a wider area than its shopping centre alone, and added: 'As a proportion of high customer numbers visiting our centres, the incident levels at Westfield are very low. 'The safety of our customers, retailers and residents is a key priority. Westfield has on-site police teams and works closely with the Met Police, local authorities and retailers to ensure its centres are  a safe and enjoyable place for  our customers.'

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. This week, Mad Dog has his say on Steven Gerrard's new playing position, Arsenal's 'Amen Corner' for the rest of the season and how former non-league stars Charlie Austin and Jamie Vardy could be ready for the Premier League. G-FORCE FINALLY CONTROLLED . For all these years, Steven Gerrard has had the freedom to make, create and execute anywhere on the pitch he desired. His most successful time has been under Rafa Benitez playing in the No 10 position behind Fernando Torres. He had that freedom to link the midfield, supply those brilliant passes and save his energy from traipsing back over the halfway line to protect his back four. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Wenger's press conference . Class: Steven Gerrard used to excel in a No 10 role, but he has shown his qualities playing as a 'quarter-back' Grit: The experienced midfielder puts in tackles, and controls the tempo for Liverpool . I've often thought his brilliant attacking play was a hindrance to the success of the team, through his lack of defensive responsibility, which has been proven with average years at Liverpool – bar one or two cups – and through poor results in the England national team. But now it's different. With Lucas injured, Steven is their catalyst, their quarter-back. He has a responsibility to play with discipline and control, to anticipate the oppositions strengths; to block, intercept, and defend the dangerous areas around Liverpool's goal. I believe this will be like having a new player for England at the World Cup in Brazil. Whether Roy Hodgson will choose Steven to play in that role in Brazil is debatable. With the climate and the opposition probably going to have the majority of possession I'll be interested to see how Steven fits into Roy's team in the summer. Path to success: But will he play in that role for England in Brazil? AUGUSTA ANXIETY EATING AWAY AT THE TOP . With all the experience and quality that Arsene Wenger has at his disposal he described the performance against Manchester United last week that would've taken them to the top of the league as 'nervous'. We've all seen it time-after-time, year-after-year, in all different sports. My favourite analogy is around Easter in football when the teams are twisting and turning. It is like the Amen Corner of the Augusta Masters. The muscles get tighter, they hit the ball 20 yards further, the simple putts end up eight feet past and a standard eight iron going between 162-164 yards ends up at 180 and deep in the water. Trouble: Amen Corner is where the best are often find wanting at the Masters Golf Tournament at Augusta . Nervous? Arsenal may have hit that wall in their title challenge . The mind and the emotions can play havoc and the nervous energy drains the body. We've all been there. We've seen it for years as England supporters in their penalty shoot-outs, which highlights more than anything how anxiety can effect performance at key moments. The worst thing any supporter can do now is to boo their players, constantly criticise them and get on their back. ALL THE PLAYERS NEED IS A HUG . Last year when I was in charge at Gillingham we lost at home to Wycombe Wanderers live on Sky television at the beginning of February and got booed off. At the time we were still four points clear at the top of the League Two table. My players were shattered, they were drained and they played with no energy. I'm sure the paying public would've expected a Mad rant and rave from me in the dressing room. But, instead, I hugged every player, reinforced positive thoughts and, taking the bad days in our stride, we marched onwards. Different motivation: Sometimes, all the players need is a hug, rather than a meltdown . Title challenge: Maybe Jose Mourinho will try a similar tactic? The last thing they wanted, or needed, was me growling in their faces. Low-and-behold, only three months later, we were crowned champions for the first time in over 50 years. Who will win the Premier League? It'll be the team that controls their emotions and copes with the tension through to the finishing line. NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL . How crazy is it that two of the top teams in the Championship have got centre forwards banging in the goals that, up until just a few years ago, were playing in the Conference? Well I go to watch lower-league football on a regular basis, and it doesn't shock me. Jamie Vardy, at Leicester, was playing for Fleetwood Town part-time and working a full-time as well less than two years ago. Started at the bottom: Charlie Austin (left) and Jamie Vardy have proven that you should never give up . And Charlie Austin was a bricklayer playing for Poole Town in 2009 when he was scooped up aged 20 by Swindon. Neither player went through the academy system; both were let go, deemed not good enough and both have shown that with hard work and dedication you can fight back and make a living after that heart-breaking rejection. For me players are released far too early before they have reached their maximum development and, more often than not, the heartbreaking conversation that ends their dreams finishes their career. However, Vardy and Austin are currently in the process of fast-tracking themselves and their clubs into the Premier League to mix it with the very best in the world. COOK HAS GOT THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS . On Tuesday night, I went to watch my local team Wycombe Wanderers take on Fleetwood Town. A minute before kick-off, the Chesterfield manager Paul Cook came bouncing up the stairs in the directors’ box on a scouting mission. The Cook, as I call him, had driven down straight after training and got caught in the motorway madness. I noticed, as he scrambled for a pen, he was still in his club tracksuit and training kit from the afternoon session. The fragrance was powerful – but it was the smell of success. Talented: Paul Cook has the flavour for success at Chesterfield . I asked him why he was there and he told me: 'There's nothing like watching it yourself, so it's got to be done.' At that level as a manager you have to mix so many ingredients and blend them all together to succeed. He is certainly getting the flavour right at the moment. The next morning he was in at 9am when the players had a day off, to work on the weekend's game against Torquay and then watch his reserve team that afternoon. It's no surprise that the Cook is sitting top of League Two, three points ahead of his nearest rival with this man set to be a champion. Last week, at BT Sport for my Tuesday night spot on the Sports Hub, I went into the make-up studio. Before you go on air they powder your face to stop the shine on the cameras. To clarify: This is standard practice, it's normal. However, . as I was about to get off my chair and leave for rehearsals the . beautiful young lady there decided, without asking me, to apply some lip . balm. I sat there – . frozen in shock – as she applied what felt like lipstick, and thought: . 'Oh my God. I hope no-one is filming this!' I . thanked her and immediately upon leaving that room wiped it all off on . to my shirt, hoping and praying nobody saw me with those shiny, pouting . lips. Not for me: Funnily enough, I didn't fancy having lip balm put on! I was also lucky enough to be treated to dinner in Canary Wharf with my two sons George and Charlie on Thursday night. George is off for four months to work in Johannesburg for his company KPMG. Now, my George is an extremely bright spark when it comes to figures – and even more so when it comes to settling the bill. While . I thought I was being treated in a posh restaurant at the top of a sky . scraper with all the City whizz-kids, I experienced once again George's . skill, as a chartered accountant, with figures. Even though his dad is out of work, as the bill came he looked across the table and said: 'Thanks dad, it's great to see you.' I nodded, paid and was a very, very proud dad.","It will be interesting to see if Steven Gerrard can play deep role for England .

"By . Emma Innes . Most of us get stung by an insect occasionally and grumble about it for a couple of minutes before forgetting about it. Not so for one researcher from Arizona. Justin Schmidt, from the Southwestern . Biological Institute, has been stung so many times that he decided to . create a pain scale to rate the insects’ stings. Justin Schmidt has been stung so many times he decided to create a pain scale to rate insects' stings. He says that the most painful is a bullet ant (pictured) which he says 'makes you want to lay down and die' Mr Schmidt’s scale ranges from zero to four, with a one being a minor reaction, and four being the worst pain you can imagine. Mr Schmidt explained to Weather.com what a one on the scale would be. Fire Ant - one (pain lasts two to four minutes) Honeybee - two (pain lasts up to ten minutes) Bumblebee - two (pain for up to five minutes) German Yellowjacket - two (pain lasts four to ten minutes) Velvet Ant - three (pain for up to 30 minutes) Harvester Ant - three (pain for one to eight hours) Paper Wasp - three (pain for five to 15 minutes) Warrior Wasp - four (pain for up to two hours) Tarantula Hawk - four (pain for three minutes) Bullet Ant - four (pain for 12 to 24 hours) He said it would cause a sharp pain but would not be enough to make you drop your drink. However, he goes on to explain how he . would describe a four – this would be a creature such as a tarantula . hawk, which he says feels like being hit by 20,000 volts. Not only would it make you drop your drink, it would make you throw it across the room, he says. He told Weather.com that a bullet ant has the most painful sting he has encountered. He said: 'They just make you want to lay down and die. You are just screaming in pain and agony.' In contrast, he said that the sting of a fire ant is much less painful. He said: 'They have this kind of sharp, piercing sting. 'Your immediate reaction is ""brush those things off"". That's all its going to do to you.' Mr Schmidt ranks the bug's stings from zero to four with four being the worst pain imaginable. He rated the sting of the tarantula hawk (pictured) a four . Mr Schmidt believes he has been stung by 150 different bugs. He rates the sting of the fire ant (pictured) a one and says the pain lasts between two and four minutes . According to Mr Schmidt’s scale, a fire ant has one of the least painful stings – a one on his scale – honeybees and bumblebees’ stings score a two, and the stings of warrior wasps, bullet ants, and tarantula hawks score four. He claims to have been stung by about 150 different insects while travelling the world but says it doesn't worry him, as none of the insects’ bites have a lasting impact. Mr Schmidt says that the pain from a honeybee (pictured) sting ranks at two on his scale and lasts for up to ten minutes .","Justin Schmidt created a pain scale from zero to four to rank insect stings .

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. This week, Chico is given both barrels, why Jose Mourinho may not want to complain about West Ham and which teams Martin's tipping for the drop. Chico, Chico, Chico. Cheeky, cheating, Chico. Andy Carroll didn’t catch you in the face. But you squealed like a tasered pig, then rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled. It was ridiculous. Straight over: Andy Carroll saw red for this aerial 'challenge' on Swansea defender Chico . Can't believe it: Target man Carroll was dismissed by Howard Webb, putting the Hammers down to ten . Agony? Chico's rolling around and clutching his face may have contributed to Webb's decision . One minute you’re threatening your own team-mate with a brick and the next you’ve been shot by a sniper. You should be ashamed of yourself. Chico’s reaction to Carroll’s arm going across the side of his head was pure theatre. He should have been booked and I would hope his manager Michael Laudrup and team-mates will have words with him. That is not what football is about. Jose Mourinho’s outrageous rant about West Ham playing 19th Century football in their goalless draw against Chelsea was used to deflect from his own team’s inability to break down West Ham’s resolute, determined and dogged defending. West ham doubled up in all areas and sat deep, not allowing any space behind their back four. It meant the intricate play of Willian, Oscar and Eden Hazard was ineffective. Complaining: Jose Mourinho deflected attention away from his own team's failings to break West Ham down . Resolute: Chelsea stars like Eden Hazard couldn't find a way past Hammers stars like Guy Demel (left) Mourinho’s very clever, with a big smile on his face, at shifting all the blame on to Big Sam. But underneath I think he was probably raging, knowing that without a top quality centre-forward they will not be able to win the Premier League. And also that Juan Mata, with his superior passing ability in the final third, would no doubt have been more than useful on the night. The Special Juan? Former Chelsea star Mata may have made a difference in the final third . His ability to slip a pass through the eye of a needle in the West Ham game would have been perfect for such deep defending. I’m looking forward to Monday night when Jose takes his Chelsea team to Manchester City and we’ll see if they will play an open attacking, expansive game to take on Mr Pellegrini’s side. It’s more likely Mourinho will be parking the super-yacht, as it is in Chelsea’s case, to keep out magic City’s relentless attack. Not even the farcical situation at Leeds where my old chauffer Brian McDermott got sacked one minute then reinstated the next. What a ridiculous situation. Earlier in the week he was told that Gianluca Festa was coming in and wanted to sit on the bench for the game against Ipswich. In the face of chaos: Brian McDermott was sacked one minute and reinstated the next at Leeds . Obviously Brian said no. Everyone knew what was happening and the prospective owner, Massimo Cellino, was quite obviously trying to force him out. I know Brian very well and you couldn’t meet a nicer, humbler, more down-to-earth man if you tried. While he was chief scout at Reading he kindly offered to be my chauffer for three months when I broke my leg playing in the Middlesex Cup final on a Sunday afternoon. I was assistant manager to Alan Pardew at the club then. Brian picked me up every day and dropped me off after work and we had some great laughs. Writing on the wall: Leeds fans showed their support for McDermott against Huddersfield . He used to have to help me with my crutches getting in and out of the car. Some of the highlights included late night journeys home after scouting and watching other teams play. We would sit and listen to the late night peoples’ problems programme on the radio, about all sorts of tricky challenges we face in our lives. When they sacked Brian on Friday, I wonder if he made one of those phone calls to his local radio station to ask for advice and guidance, as the inside of his head must’ve been all over the place. With 14 games to go it is still possible for teams to put a run together to get out of relegation trouble. It was obvious that Gus Poyet would improve the spirit of the playing staff at Sunderland after taking over from Paolo Di Canio. Now bad boy Phil Bardsley and the magician on the wing Adam Johnson look like rejuvenated, regenerated and quality Premier League players. Gus has also recruited well and he has proven what can be done. Crystal Palace have also got momentum and now West Ham’s players have returned to fitness they will go from strength to strength. Dead man walking? Fulham manager Rene Meulensteen trudges off the pitch after losing 3-0 to Southampton . Norwich lack a goal-scorer and with the players they’ve got I think they’ve done particularly well. But it’s going to be tough for Fulham, West Brom and Cardiff City. Strikers are the key in a relegation scrap. It’s no surprise Rene Meulentseen got rid of Adel Taarabt and Dimitar Berbatov as their team ethic and willingness to do a shift are not the right ingredients for a recipe to avoid relegation. Hush now: Cardiff will find it hard despite Craig Bellamy's winner against Norwich . Whether new record signing Kostas Mitroglou can score the goals to keep them up remains to be seen and the same applies to Kenwyne Jones at Cardiff City. For me, relegation will go down to the last day and right to the wire, but it’s Fulham, West Brom and Cardiff City to go. I’m out and about now watching loads . of games and I empathise with the wicked, at times cruel, life of the . professional football manager. The . frustration of the ball hitting the post and rolling along the line . back into the goalkeeper’s arm; the blatant penalty decision not given; a . simple pass to slot your centre forward in for a last-minute equaliser . just over hit. A supporter . sat five yards from me at a game I went to last week was shouting his . mouth off; I’m not sure if he was doing an impression of Sir Alf Ramsey, . Sir Bobby Robson or Sir Alex Ferguson telling the manager exactly what . he should be doing. As the . minutes ticked by on that luminous orange clock you know as a manager it . is a ticking time bomb and brings you closer to the guillotine with . every second that flashes by. It’s draining, exhausting and you know there’s not a lot you can do. It’s . a horrible feeling and I’ve been there many, many times. But the desire . to get back in and win another championship fuels the blood that flows . through my veins. As I wrote this column I was on my way . to the Apple Store in Reading for a two-hour one-to-one tutorial to . help improve my Apple Mac skills. On . the way I sat in the car park looking over the pitch where I played my . first game of football for Southcote United FC, when I was aged seven, . in an under 11 game. I can remember it like it was yesterday. To . think that skinny, nice, quiet, young boy – with ambitions and dreams – . could step from where I was standing to play at Anfield, Highbury, Old .

"Gianfranco Zola is the bookmakers favourite . Stuart Pearce describes vacancy as 'outstanding' opportunity . Neil Warnock turned down chance to replace Billy Davies . By . Laurie Whitwell . Neil Warnock has backed Gianfranco Zola to take over the Nottingham Forest manager’s job - and also endorsed Stuart Pearce. The former QPR, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United boss ruled himself out of the position after claiming there was ‘certain criteria’ he could not adhere to. Zola is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed sacked Billy Davies and Sportsmail understands contact has been made with the Italian, who stepped down at Watford in December. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Alan Brazil on the latest at Nottingham Forest . In the frame: Former Watford and West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola is the bookmakers favourite to take charge at Nottingham Forest . But where Warnock’s deal was believed to be on a short-term basis with the aim of getting Forest promoted to the Barclays Premier League this season, any deal for Zola would more likely be longer term. Pearce, who spent 12 years at the club mostly as captain, is second-favourite to take the job with bookies and would be a winner with the fans. Warnock described him as an ‘ideal’ candidate on talkSPORT and Pearce himself called the job an ‘outstanding’ opportunity. Warnock turned down the job after failing to agree terms with owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi. It is understood the Kuwaiti indicated he wanted influence on starting line-ups with particular focus on Algerian duo Rafik Djebbour and Djamel Abdoun. No go: Neil Warnock's talks with Nottingham Forest over their managerial vacancy have broken down . Warnock told talkSPORT: ‘I am sure someone like Zola, who will come in and just coach the team, will end up there. ‘In . my mind I knew my starting line-up, so if I can't 100 per cent go into . it knowing that I'm not going to be able to manage as I manage then I . can't commit myself. ‘In the end it just didn't add up to me. I thought I'd be doing it for the wrong reasons. It wasn't the financial part of it. ‘That's . why I think Zola will be the favourite because if you remember he was . given players [at Watford] and it worked for a while. Interested: Stuart Pearce managed Forest for a brief four-month stint in 1996-97 season, winning the manager of the month award in January. But the Tricky Trees failed to stay up that year in the Premier League . Endorsement: Neil Warnock believes there is a place at the City Ground for club legend Pearce . ‘Stuart with his contacts - perhaps he would work with Zola. He is an icon at the club. Stuart, I think, would be ideal.’ Warnock . added: ‘There was nobody you could talk to at the club English-wise . that knew about football; that you could have a conversation about . getting things done. ‘They've . got to alter that issue. You've got to know the rules and regulations. It just seemed very difficult to get things done at the club.’ Pearce, also speaking to talkSPORT, . said: ‘There are some really good jobs out there at times. 'Nottingham . Forest outside the Premier League is an outstanding job for whatever . manager wants it.’ Chopping block: Nottingham Forest manager Billy Davies was sacked after a 5-0 beating by Derby . Orders: Davies attempts to rally his players during the convincing defeat on Saturday at the iPro Stadium . Asked . about the potential involvement from Al-Hasawi the former England Under . 21s manager said: ‘It depends what type of manager you are. Foreign . owners are very prevalent around the English game now. ‘As . a manager you have to define what you think is acceptable. I would have . thought there are certain things any manager wouldn’t accept and that’s . the picking of the team and players coming through the door being . signed by somebody else that you don’t want. They are probably the two . golden rules. ‘But some . managers are different. It depends how desperate for a job you are. Some . would want total control. It’s varying degrees. ‘I’m . not sure which way they will go. That’s down to the owner. They have . got their feelers out at the club and they will identify somebody that . will do the job well. 'Gary Brazil has got the opportunity to showcase . himself.’ Blasted: Johnny Russell drives home the fourth for Derby at iPro Stadium . European Cup winner Garry Birtles, meanwhile, welcomed the sacking of Davies and called on Al-Hasawi to appoint a manager who would restore the reputation of the club. ‘Billy Davies was dragging the club that Brian Clough and Peter Taylor turned into what it is into the gutter,’ said Birtles. ‘It’s a club that has got a good history and it needs propping up again.’ He would like to see Nigel Clough follow in his father’s footsteps. ‘I know from first-hand how Nigel does it. I used to go to the training ground at Derby and it was a happy place to be. He gets the place bright and vibrant and enjoying things.’ Meanwhile, former captain John McGovern has taken on an ambassadorial role with the club.","Gianfranco Zola is the bookmakers favourite .

"By . Mike Dawes . Cincinnati Reds pitcher Aroldis Chapman has shared an image of his stapled head on Instagram after undergoing surgery for a horrific injury suffered during a training game last Wednesday. The 26-year-old was hit in the face by a line drive after pitching a 99mph ball against the Kansas City Chiefs in Surprise, Arizona. The impact broke bones above his left eye and nose, causing him to be taken to the nearby Banner Good Samaritan Medical Centre for further tests.

Road to recovery: Chapman could be pitching again within a month if his recovery goes as planned . He has since undergone successful surgery, having had a titanium plate embedded in his skull to help heal the fracture. Chapman, who is nicknamed The Cuban Missile, posted the image of his head on the social networking site along with a message in Spanish translated as: 'My fans, everything is fine, thanks to God we are already out of any kind of trouble.

"By . Mike Dawes . Cincinnati Reds pitcher Aroldis Chapman suffered a sickening injury on Wednesday night when he was hit by a line drive in Surprise, Arizona during a Spring training game. The closer broke bones above his left eye and nose when the ball which he pitched at 99mph came hurtling back towards his face - the latest frightening injury to a pitcher struck in the head by a batted ball. Chapman was undergoing further testing at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, where he was set to spend the night for observation, according to a statement from the Reds. Scroll Down for Video . Pitch: Reds closer Ardolis Chapman fires off a 99mph pitch towards  Salvador Perez of the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night in Arizona . Manager Bryan Price said Chapman was conscious and talking as he was taken off the field during Cincinnati's spring training game against the Kansas City Royals. The exhibition was called after an 8-minute delay with Kansas City leading 6-3. 'Not good,' Price said. 'He left the field on a stretcher, took a line drive just above his left eye is what it looks like â€” a contusion, a laceration, and certainly needs to be taken to the hospital and checked. 'We've got Tomas Vera, an assistant trainer, is going to be with him. And then we'll get our updates from there.'

'It's just a real sickening feeling for everybody.' Collapse: Chapman falls to the ground as concerned team mates and umpires dash over to help him as he writhes in agony on the floor . Players from both teams knelt, some bowing their heads and crossing themselves in prayer. Chapman was taken to Banner Del E. Webb Medical Center in Sun City. He was then transferred to Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center. Perez appeared to be in tears as he left the field, and first baseman Eric Hosmer hugged him. Perez quickly left the clubhouse without speaking to reporters. Hosmer hit a line drive off the head of Tampa Bay's Alex Cobb last June. Cobb sustained a concussion. Playing right field, Reds teammate Jay Bruce heard the ball hit Chapman. 'It was one of the more frightening and non-fun moments I've been a part of on the baseball field,' he said. After Chapman was driven off to the waiting ambulance, Price and Yost met with the umpires. 'It was really a mutual agreement,' crew chief Chris Guccione said. 'Players were rattled. The staff was rattled. The umpires were rattled. We figured it was best, along with both teams in agreement, that the game should end.'

Yost said neither he nor his players wanted to keep playing. Price felt the same way. 'You can't find it in your heart to go out there and play,' he said. Oakland pitcher Brandon McCarthy, who had emergency surgery after he was struck in the head by a line drive in September 2012, urged caution in a post on Twitter. 'all reporting at this point means zilch, until he gets a scan,' he said in a tweet. Chapman, who throws a 100 mph fastball, had walked four Royals in the inning before being injured. The two-time All-Star had 38 saves for the Reds last season. When reporters walked into the Royals clubhouse, third baseman Mike Moustakas asked a team official to request that they leave. Cincinnati Reds relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman throws in the third inning of a spring training baseball game against the Cleveland Indians in Goodyear, Arizona in this 2012 file photo . 'No one wants to talk,' Moustakas said. In January, Major League Baseball approved a protective cap for pitchers following several terrifying scenes similar to this one in the last few years, including Toronto's J.A. Happ, who sustained a skull fracture. The heavier and bigger hats were available for testing during spring training on a voluntary basis, but the cap apparently would not have helped Chapman in this case. 'I know this isn't uncommon as we would like it to be, but it was frightening,' Price said. 'Certainly frightening.'","Cincinnati Reds pitcher Aroldis Chapman suffered fractures to bones in his nose and left eye while taking a line drive to the face on Wednesday night .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . If you just can't be without your phone or tablet, even when you're in bed, a pair of Canadian inventors have created a pillow that doubles up as a charger. The Power Pillow comes with two portable batteries, and each battery is fitted with two USB ports capable of charging a phone and tablet at the same time. Its makers claim each battery will charge an iPhone six times before it runs out of power, but will need to be charged for 10 hours to reach full capacity again. The Power Pillow, pictured left in a bedroom and right on a sofa, comes with two portable batteries. One is placed inside the pillow, while the other can be charged separately via a wall plug. Each battery has two ports, meaning two devices can be charged at the same time . Electric lights, including those which illuminate laptop computers, smartphones and tablets, often play a key role in causing people to sleep badly, according to a leading health expert. Artificial lights disrupt the body's natural rhythm, affect chemicals in the brain and drive people to use stimulants like caffeine to stay awake longer. The claims were made by professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, Charles Czeisler. However, a follow-up study by psychiatrists in Arizona found that simply lowering the brightness of a screen and holding the gadget about 12 inches away from the face can stop the light from interfering with a good night’s sleep. The Power Pillow is aimed at people who 'watch films or TV, check emails, or read on their tablets and Kindles in bed.' It is the brainchild of Canadian inventor Geoff Martin who came up with the idea when he was speaking to his brother on the phone in bed and his battery ran out. He started working on the project with his partner Lisa Sutt and they created various designs and prototypes. The pair has now launched a campaign on Kickstarter and is hoping to raise $30,000 (£18,200) to fund the device. The pillow is being sold for $79 (£48) for a pillow and one battery. People who donate $124 (£76) will be sent a cushion, two batteries, and two micro USB cables. Lisa, 37, from Nova Scotia in Canada, said: ‘Geoff and I were relaxing in bed when his brother Frank called: 'While he was on the phone with his brother he blurted out ""why not have a pillow that you can directly connect your phone to for charging.""' The Power Pillow, pictured, is aimed at people who watch films or TV, check emails, or read on their tablets and Kindles at home. It is the brainchild of Canadian inventor Geoff Martin who came up with the idea when he was speaking to his brother on the phone in bed and his battery ran out . ‘I was sitting next to him on the bed working on my laptop and thought it was a good idea, and we immediately started working on the Power Pillow. People who donate $124 (£76) to the Power Pillow Kickstarter campaign receive a cushion, pictured, two batteries, and two micro USB cables . ‘We have gone through dozens of design drawings, dozens of batteries and over a dozen prototypes.’ The charging system comes with two 12000mAh battery packs, one is kept in the pillow along with a charging USB cable. The other pack is charged separately via a wall plug. When one battery dies, it can be replaced with the fully-charged pack so the pillow is never without charge.

"By . Fay Strang . She has always been a fan of turning heads and making an entrance, so it was no surprise that when Lady Gaga arrived for her appearance on Good Morning on Monday she did so in typically extravagant style. Showing off a sleek bob with blonde highlights and risqué white dress, the singer stepped out of her vintage Cadillac as she unveiled her video for Applause for the first time. And proving she is very much human, the 27-year-old revealed that she too gets stretch marks on her cleavage, which she proudly had on display in her flimsy white bra top. Body confident: Lady Gaga revealed stretch marks on her breasts as she stepped out in white bra top . Putting her very public spat with Perez Hilton behind her, she was seen leaving her hotel in New York smiling widely - no doubt excited to finally show her fans what she has been working on. Revealing her recently slimmed down figure, she slipped on a white dress with a plunging neckline, beneath which her white bra could be seen. The dress featured an interesting white cape detail while the skirt, which barely covered her derriere, featured a longer section down one side. Leggy: The star wore a very short white dress which showed off her legs as she sat in the car . Arriving in style: Lady Gaga chose a vintage Cadillac to take her to her appearance on Good Morning America on Monday . Eye-catching: The singer turned heads in her short white dress and new hairstyle . Completing her look, she wore a typically huge pair of grey platform boots while she also slipped on a pair of white fingerless gloves. The star, who was wearing far less make-up than usual, wasted no time in getting into her eye-catching black convertible. It was a vastly different look to the day before, when she stepped out with almost jet-black hair styled in a rockabilly fashion. New look: Gaga showed off new lighter hair which looked sleek in a side parting . Once she arrived at the studio to film the show, she spent time greeting the hordes of screaming fans - dubbed her ‘Little Monsters’ - who had waited to see her. The 27-year-old chose the popular TV show to debut her new video for Applause, which is her first new visual in two years. The hotly-anticipated video will no doubt delight her legions of loyal fans as it shows her in various states of undress against different eye-catching backgrounds. What a difference a day makes: On Sunday the star was seen with jet black hair in curls compared to the lighter look of Monday . Fans: The singer looked really pleased that she got the chance to meet some fans who had waited to see her . Flimsy: The 27-year-old's bra top didn't really appear to be giving her much support . After two years, it’s no surprise that she was keen to impress with the latest video, which begins with her lying on a mattress in her underwear. Other scenes show her climbing out of a giant top hat and dressed all in black with a black hat on, while dancing with a large white sheet. She also at some points has her face covered in the rainbow-coloured, kabuki-like face paint, which features on the front of her album ARTPOP. Here she comes: There was no missing Gaga as she drove up in her vintage car . Tricky: The star tried to protect her modesty as she got into the vehicle . Elated: It has been two years since Gaga has released a new visual so fans are unsurprisingly excited . Another shot shows her head superimposed onto a black swan, while another sees her with long blonde hair down her back with just shells covering her modesty as she dances. Keeping up the theme of wearing little clothing, she also slips on a top featuring two hands covering her chest as she embarks on a dance routine. As the video comes to an end, she shows off a more glamorous side with long hair and ethereal-inspired make-up and dress as purple glitter falls all around her. Back appeal: Gaga's out fit showed off her wide array of back tattoos . Revealing: The cut of her black dress meant the superstar showed a lot of skin . Quick change: Gaga changed into a black dress which was more demure as she continued promotion that day . Promotion: Lady Gaga appeared on the the Z100 Morning Show, alongside someone who was inspired by her music video . Puppy love: Gaga cuddled her dog Fozzy at the Elvis Duran and the Z100 Morning Show . Following her appearance on Good . Morning America, the star changed into a black dress, which was . relatively demure compared to the skimpy white outfit she wore earlier. But . the look didn't last long, and as she left the Z100 radio station in a different . one to which she arrived in - a purple and black leather dress. Again opting to flash some skin, her dress featured a plunging neckline and a very short hemline. On show: As she left the radio show she showed a lot of her chest in the plunging top . If three changes wasn't enough, the . singer was spotted arriving back at her apartment block later that . afternoon in yet another change of clothes. Clearly having exposed enough flesh . for one day, the singer covered up completely, with a black cashmere . turtleneck jumper and white pants, which she paired with the previous . outfit's black and gold belt and towering black boots. It's no wonder her frustrated longtime stylist, Nicola Formichetti, parted ways with the out-there star just last week. Gaga apparently changes her outfits 'at least 12 times a day'. Stylish: Gaga's purple and black leather creation was certainly eye catching . And again: As she left the radio station she wore yet another outfit- this time with a purple skirt . All covered up: Gaga headed back to her apartment later that day with not an inch of fresh on display . On . Sunday, Gaga took to Twitter to discuss her new video, writing: ‘OK lets . start over! I'm so excited to see u at the premiere of my video @gma in 8 . hrs! I am grateful to share this new experience with you! ‘I've . thought of u fans every moment since the last BTWBall & dreamt . everyday how I could make it up to u. Only w your happiness comes mine.’ She . added: ‘I know this sounds weird but, I can't believe I'm gonna be on . TV today for an interview! It's been so long, I can't wait to see your . smiles!’ Style chameleon: The singer ditched the dresses for a black cashmere turtleneck jumper and white pants, which she teamed with the previous outfit's black and gold belt and towering black boots . Different look: Gaga appears in a mermaid style ensemble in her new video . Simple: A number of the scenes are remarkably simple showing her in her underwear on a mattress .","Arrived at Good Morning America in a vintage Cadillac, wearing a white dress with her bra on display .

"By . Pete Jenson . Gareth Bale was predictably made to carry the can for Real Madrid’s defeat last night with the image of him doing up his laces as Sevilla scored the winner plastered over every single sports page. Diario AS detailed the minute-by-minute of his decision to change his boots midway through the second half as Sevilla attacked down his right flank and scored the goal that could end up losing Real Madrid the title. On 70 minutes 34 seconds Bale took advantage of a Sevilla substitution to change footwear but he was still on the sidelines on 71 minutes 53 seconds when Carlos Bacca scored. The ill-timed pit-stop did not finish until 72 minutes 30 seconds when Bales came back on with the game out of Real Madrid’s control. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Marcelo: We ask the Real Madrid fans to forgive us . What? Gareth Bale is left confused during Real Madrid's title-damaging defeat to Sevilla on Wednesday night . Down: Cristiano Ronaldo (left) holds his heads in his hands as another chance goes begging against Sevilla . Painful: Xabi Alonso (left) and Luka Modric struggle to come to terms with the game slipping away . The rollicking Bale received from Cristiano Ronaldo was also covered in detail as the Madrid press carried out the inquest on the first time in five years that they had lost two consecutive matches in the league. Xabi Alsono tried to play down the incident saying: 'All the players were upset with themselves for the defeat.' But Ronaldo’s anger is clearly directed at Bale as he blasts a late free-kick off target with Ronaldo feeling he should have taken the kick. 'He comes from the cradle of rugby - perhaps that is why he puts so many over the bar,” sniped Diario AS’ resident critic Tomas Roncero. Are you serious? Real Madrid's Marcelo (right) and Daniel Carvajal query a decision from the referee . Heads down: Ronaldo can't hide his disappointment as he trudges off as the Sevilla players appeal for a decision . on the floor: Ronaldo takes a tumble after another attempt to get Real back in the game comes to nothing . Joy: Ronaldo celebrates scoring a deflected free kick earlier in the match - but Real still ended up losing . It is customary for Bale and Ronaldo to share free-kick taking duties and on the night both had been woefully off target. Ronaldo had scored from a first half set-piece but only because the ball hit Sevilla’s Carlos Bacca on the arm to divert it past Beto in the Sevilla goal. Diaro AS rounded off its savage criticism of Bale saying: 'He did not respond to the importance of the game. He made the wrong decisions even upsetting Ronaldo.' Marca went slightly easier on Bale saying he had not been the only player out of position when Sevilla scored. But elsewhere he was slated and given a five out of 10 rating alongside the comment: 'It seems he plays better when he has injury problems.' Madrid’s embarrassment was made complete by the fact that their misfiring 250m euros forward line, had been outdone by Carlos Bacca, a former bus conductor who cost 8m in the summer.","Real Madrid lost 2-1 at Sevilla, leaving them three points behind Atletico Madrid and two points behind Barcelona in the La Liga title race .

"Lolita is a fashion subculture from Japan, influenced by clothing from the Victorian and Rococo eras . The style has no association with the book Lolita . By . Olivia Fleming . The Japanese fashion subculture Lolita has made its way to Mexico, and the trend appears to be a hit. The trend . Lolita is often associated with Vladimir Nabokov's novel by the same . name, referred to as cute, 'nymphet'-inspired styles in high fashion magazines. However the Lolita style is influenced by clothing from the grand, but demure, Victorian and Rococo eras, its roots lying in modesty rather than promiscuity. Pretty in pastels: Members of the Lolitas Paradise club share a moment together in a park in Monterrey . Its basic style consists of a buttoned up blouse, petticoat, bloomers, bell-shaped skirt, knee-high socks, and heavy make-up with an influence from Japan's Anime media. Members of the Lolitas Paradise club in Monterrey are turning what was once a sporadic and limited style outside of Japan into a prominent fixture in South America. A member of Lolitas Paradise club . said: 'The goal of Lolita is not to create a sexy image but rather to . maintain a cute or elegant appeal. 'The . intention of Lolita fashion is for women to wear what makes them feel . beautiful and dress for their own happiness, not for the approval of the . opposite sex,' she added. Sweet frills: Alin Nava, 25, poses in front of a mirror in her bedroom . Bows and pearls: A member of the Lolitas Paradise club adjusts her headband . Members of the Lolitas Paradise club walk together in Monterrey - its basic style consists of a blouse, petticoat, bloomers, bell-shaped skirt and knee-high socks . Street style: Miss Nava walks to the supermarket in Monterrey . Ellie Frye, a 24-year-old Lolita . reinforced this idea: 'It’s not, as some commentators have suggested, . some sort of appeal to men’s expectation that women should be childlike, . or an attempt to pander to pedophiles. 'Pedophiles . like little girls. They don’t like grown women who happen to like . dresses with cakes on them. I’ve never been hit on by a pedophile while . in Lolita. We don’t get into it because it is some sort of misplaced . pedo complex or anything, and the objective isn’t simply to emulate . little girls, despite the name Lolita,' she explained to Jezebel. The style, which emerged from the . Japanese street fashion scene in the Nineties, has many incarnations and . subsects, among them Elegant Gothic Lolitas, Erotic Lolitas, Gory . Lolitas, Sweet Lolitas and White Lolitas. Curious strangers: Passers-by look at a member of the Lolitas Paradise club in Monterrey . Standing out: Miss Nava stands in a checkout line at a supermarket in Monterrey . Friends alike: Members of the Lolitas Paradise club fold a cloth after a picnic in a park in Monterrey . Sub-culture: Members of the Lolitas Paradise club share a moment together in a park in Monterrey, where they believe the style is not only a fashion statement but also a way to express their loyalty, friendship, tolerance and unity . While some Lolitas veer toward the . goth influence with inky black garb, others emphasise a kitschy . 'cuteness' through pastel colors and pretty bows. Major Japanese brands, like the . Metamorphose temps de fille, Moi-même-Moitié, Angelic Pretty, and Baby . The Stars Shine Bright started shipping Lolita products and goods to the . international marketplace three years ago. However, with the demand increasing, many non-Japanese designers are producing their own Lolita style and range of clothing, enabling pockets of the sub-culture to flourish outside of Japan.","Lolita is a fashion subculture from Japan, influenced by clothing from the Victorian and Rococo eras .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The BBC has been attacked over its decision to send 95 staff to cover the Sochi Winter Olympics, nearly double the number of Team GB athletes. The corporation will send 95 staff including radio, online and news reporters . to the event, 21 more than it sent to the 2010 Vancouver Games. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The BBC needs to stop wasting the licence fee on over-staffing events. The BBC has been criticised for sending 95 staff to cover the Winter Olympics, nearly double the number of GB athletes going to compete and 21 more than last time . 'The Beeb consistently sends too many staff to the big events. With this many staff at the games, each athlete will probably have their own personal correspondent.' The BBC has defended itself, saying that its coverage of the 16-day Games will be 20 per cent longer than before, with 200 hours of programming to be broadcast. Team GB athletes will aim to win three medals at sports including the skeleton - aka the 'tea tray' - where Lizzy Yarnold, 25, and 32-year-old Shelley Rudman are among the favorites to win. Eve Muirhead, 23, is also hotly tipped in the women's curling after leading Scotland to victory in the world cup in March. GB also has hopes of winning in the freestyle skiing, speed skating, bobsleigh and snowboarding. Britain's best ever tally at the event is four medals, won at the inaugural ceremony in 1924. Meanwhile Team GB are sending 50 athletes to compete, including Craig Pickering, Ben Simons, John Baines and Lamin Deen (pictured left to right) The Sochi Games will start on Friday in Russia, where officials hope to avoid  some of the controversy and security fears that have built up before the event. The country has been condemned by gay rights activists for passing a law banning 'homosexual propaganda' which critics say has led to a spate of homophobic attacks. Celebrities such as Stephen Fry have asked nations to boycott the events, and while athletes will be attending, many foreign leaders such as David Cameron and Barack Obama will not be going. Volunteers are now completing the final stage of preparations ahead of the Games which start on Friday . Some athletes, including the German speed skating team, are already practicing in the venues in Russia . Security fears have also plagued the run-up, with Chechen rebels threatening suicide bombing attacks throughout the Games, with British athletes warned not to wear their uniforms while arriving in case they are targeted. Leaflets were also issued last week showing the face of a suspected female 'black widow' terrorist, the wife of a dead rebel, who was thought to be in Sochi and planning an attack.","The BBC is sending 95 staff to cover Sochi Winter Olympics .

"By . John Edwards . There has been an intriguing fall-out from Inter Milan’s latest attempt to prise Bacary Sagna away from Arsenal, with suggestions in Italy that the experienced right-back may remain in the Barclays Premier League but not at The Emirates. After tieing up the signing of Manchester United centre-back Nemanja Vidic on a two-year contract with an option for a further 12 months, Inter have turned their attention to recruiting a full-back, central midfielder and striker in an effort to spark an overdue revival in their fortunes. Sagna is their first choice to fill the full-back position, and Sportsmail understands a delegation from the San Siro visited London in the last few days for negotiations about a summer move. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of the transfer targets in action . Gunning for it: Bacary Sagna, battling Eden Hazard, may move to one of Arsenal's Premier League rivals . Linking up: Inter have already snapped up Manchester United stalwart Nemanja Vidic for their new back-line . They left disappointed, and the talk . in Milan is that Sagna will either sign a new deal with Arsenal or join . another Premier League club, with Chelsea and Tottenham being mentioned. Galatasaray have not . given up hope, but a source close to Inter said: ‘The impression that . came out of the talks was that Sagna and his wife are settled in London . and want to stay there. He . is hoping Arsenal come up with an acceptable offer, but there is . interest from other Premier League clubs. We are hearing Chelsea and . Tottenham.’ After securing Vidic’s signature, Inter have distanced . themselves from claims they may move for Arsenal defender Thomas . Vermaelen. Hands up: The right-back could yet stay at the Emirates and sign a new deal . Politics could . play a part in Arsenal’s pursuit of Julian Draxler after his club . Schalke found themselves caught up in the escalating crisis over . Russia’s military movements in Crimea. While . the rest of Europe condemns Russia’s involvement in eastern Ukraine and . calls for tough sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s regime, Schalke’s . top brass continue to enjoy a close relationship with the Russian . president. Controversy: Julian Draxler's (left), challenged by Nacho Fernandez, move to Arsenal could be boosted . The . Bundesliga club have been sponsored by Gazprom since January, 2007 and . wear the Russian government-backed gas company’s name across the front . of their shirts, much to the dismay of not only Greenpeace activists but . leading German politicians. Increasingly, . influential political figures in Germany are calling on Schalke to cut . their ties with Gazprom, so far to no avail. Schalke . chairman Clemens Toennies admitted he has a direct line to Putin, and . is on friendly terms with the Russian leader, but was adamant he will do . all he can to resist pressure to end the partnership: ‘Are we still . friends? I am not a politician, but he shows his interest in our club by . always asking about our results whenever we speak. It is a good . relationship.’ However, . with little indication political tension is about to ease over Russia’s . activities in Ukraine, pressure is likely to mount on Schalke to seek . alternative means of funding. It . can only have a destabilising effect on the Bundesliga club and . increase Arsenal’s prospects of convincing Draxler he would benefit from . a fresh start, when they resume their efforts to sign him in the . summer. Postal service: The situation in Russia may have given Arsene Wenger greater hopes of signing Draxler . Fernando Torres . is not Chelsea’s only bargaining tool in their attempts to pep up their . attack next season with the summer acquisition of Atletico Madrid . striker Diego Costa. A . return to his former club and spiritual home could be on the cards for . Torres, but Atletico are much more likely to be swayed into sanctioning . Costa’s departure for Stamford Bridge if Thibaut Courtois was included . in the deal. And it . does appear ever more likely that Courtois would be happy to go along . with it. Now in his third season on loan at Atletico, he is so enamoured . with the lifestyle over there that he has been going out with a Madrid . girl for the past 12 months and has even bought a house in the Spanish . capital. You blue-ty: Atletico Diego Costa is No 1 on Chelsea's strikers wanted list for the summer . Between the sticks: Atletico want to sign keeper Thibaut Courtois on a permanent deal . Chelsea have . responded by offering him contract talks, but the outcome of those could . hinge on his prospects of being installed as first choice ahead of Petr . Cech. Sportsmail . understands the Belgian keeper may ask for a guarantee that he will . start as number one next season before committing himself to a new . improved deal. If that . proves a stumbling block, he knows he can count on just such an . understanding at Atletico, where his place has never been in doubt. ‘My . future is unclear, and I do need to sit down with Jose Mourinho and . discuss it,’ he admitted. In action: Fernando Torres could be in line for a return to his former club in return for Costa . With . Nemanja Vidic bound for Inter Milan and Rio Ferdinand possibly heading . for retirement, Thomas Vermaelen could provide a short-term solution to . Manchester United manager David Moyes’ defensive requirements after . stalling over the offer of contract talks at Arsenal. Moyes . is scouring the market for top-quality candidates who can serve .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in cold and icy regions. Melting snow has recently revealed a remarkably intact woolly jumper likely worn by a fashion-conscious reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago. The find, which sheds more light on the life of people living in the Iron Age, was found two years ago in Norway, but has recently been examined by scientists. Scientists using radiocarbon dating believe the woolly tunic (pictured) was made between 230 and 390 AD. Scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in icy regions and this tunic, worn by a reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago, was found in melting snow . Marianne Vedeler, from the University of Oslo and Lise Bender Jørgensen, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, told Discovery News: 'Due to global warming, rapid melting of . snow patches and glaciers is taking place in the mountains of Norway as . in other parts of the world, and hundreds of archaeological finds emerge . from the ice each year.' Other scientists have also said more hidden artefacts are being exposed in cold regions as temperatures rise, and while this is proving exciting, there is a risk that rare items could rot or disintegrate when exposed to air if they are not discovered very quickly. The tunic, which was found in melting snow, has a trendy boat neck and is crafted from wool woven in diamond twill, which was apparently fashionable at the time. Scientists using radiocarbon dating believe the woolly tunic was made between 230 and 390 AD and was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the Norwegian Lendbreen glacier, at around 6,560 feet above sea level, where it was found. Professor Jørgensen described the find as very rare and added that the number of fashion items discovered from the early first millennium AD in Europe can be counted on one hand. Scientists believe the tunic was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the Norwegian Lendbreen glacier (pictured), at around 6,560 feet above sea level, where it was found. They said global warming and melting ice is taking place in the mountains and hundreds of archaeological artefacts are being discovered . Researchers' examinations of the tunic using a scanning electron microscope revealed that two different types of wool were used to make the garment - wool from an adult sheep and softer lamb's wool. The scientists said: 'There is no doubt that the wool was . carefully chosen for both fabrics, and that both quality and natural . pigmentation were taken into consideration.' It appears that the tunic was pretty stylish in its day as the fabric was carefully mottled using the light and darker threads to deliberate effect. It would have fitted a slender man measuring about 5 feet 9 inches tall and the tunic would have been quite short and pulled over the head like a regular jumper, as it has no buttons. The find is relatively similar to another tunic found more than 150 years ago in a bog at Thorsbjerg, . Schleswig-Holsten in northern Germany, which is presumed to have . belonged to an officer as it was found with early weaponry. Professor Jørgensen said: 'The similarity between the two tunics is . very interesting as it suggests that a specific style was intended, and . that this ""fashion"" was known over a wide area.' The archaeologists have found approximately 50 fragments of items in the same area as the tunic (pictured) that they will date and analyse and predict they will find many more if the global temperatures rise as predicted. It is hoped the finds will give historians a better grasp on fashion and textiles of the first millennium AD. Both the tunics were woven in a diamond twill pattern and had been mended in areas, suggesting they were relatively hard-wearing as well as precious. Professor Jørgensen is unsure if the Norwegian garment was passed down or shared between people, but said the hunter probably looked after the tunic. She believes it could have started . out as a sleeveless design that was later adapted, as the first repair . used a patch from the body section, while a second patch came from a . different fabric used to make the sleeves. Despite . the apparent care of the owner, the archaeologists do not know how the . jumper was lost on the mountains but speculate the hunter might have . been caught in a snow flurry or particularly dense fog and was unable to . find his garment.

The tunic, which was found in melting snow, has a trendy boat neck and is crafted from wool, woven in diamond twill (pictured), which was apparently popular at the time. However, the world's glaciers are disintegrating and ice melting so quickly that archaeologists could lose relics exposed to the air if they are nor discovered incredibly quickly. Human remains and natural materials are most at risk. Wool, features are leather can disintegrate in mere days when freed from the ice, while wood can take a few years to rot, The Guardian reported. Patrick Hunt of Stanford University, California noted a frighteningly fast rate of thaw in the Alps, where he is looking for artefacts associated with Hannibal's invasion of modern Italy with elephants in 218 BC. He said: 'This is the first summer since 1994 when we began our field excavations above 8,000ft that we have not been inundated by even one day of rain, sleet and snow flurries. I expect we will see more ice patch archaeology discoveries.' British scientists have previously claimed that climate change is damaging archaeological treasures that have been preserved for thousands of years. Experts . at the University of Edinburgh's Business School  said remains in . some of the coldest places on earth are becoming exposed as warmer . temperatures cause ice and hardened ground to thaw. Dr . Dave Reay, of the university, said: 'Warming climates are . expected to lead to more melting ice, and we need to take action to . safeguard ancient treasures.'Long-term efforts are needed to locate archaeological remains that are at risk, and research how best to care for them.'","Scientists said 'hundreds of archaeological finds' are discovered under ice each year and predict more will be found as the Earth gets warmer .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Manchester United's hopes of signing Edinson Cavani hinge on the club retaining their Champions League status. The Uruguayan features highly on manager David Moyes' summer transfer hitlist as he looks to rebuild his struggling team. But Cavani is unsure whether a summer move to Old Trafford represents a forward step in his career.Playing Champions League football was a key factor for Cavani when he moved from Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain last summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal target Hakan Calhanoglu score an incredible free-kick . Target: Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani is Manchester United's main transfer target this summer . Unsure: But the Uruguayan hotshot won't move to Old Trafford without the offer of Champions League football . Prestige: The former Napoli striker is considering leaving PSG but wants to remain in Europe's top competition . And keeping his status among Europe's elite players remains imperative for the 27-year-old. Manchester United's chances of staying in the competition next season are slim; they are 2-0 down in their last-16 tie against Olympiakos and 12 points adrift of a top-four place in the Barclays Premier League. The sheer cost of the deal would also prove a major stumbling block toward a potential move to United. Struggle: Man United - currently in seventh place - look set to miss out on Champions League qualification . Disappointment: Man United suffered a humiliating 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool over the weekend . PSG will look to recoup the majority of the £55million they spent on Cavani last summer. Likewise, the player will demand a minimum of £6.7m-per-season, after tax, in wages should he decide to leave France this summer. Cavani's complicated ownership issues will also add more pounds to the total fee, with a number of agents and advisers eager to get a slice of the lucrative pie. Arsenal are monitoring Hamburg attacking midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu. The 20-year-old, who has been likened to current Gunners star Mesut Ozil, has earned rave reviews in Germany following a number of impressive displays and scored an outrageous free-kick against Borussia Dortmund last month. He has already been capped by the Turkey national team and is set to play a key role in their Euro 2016 qualification campaign. And Gunners spies are making regular checks on Calhanoglu's progress with a view to a future move. Hamburg would demand around £15m for the youngster this summer, with Liverpool also keeping tabs on their player. Target: Hamburg midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu is being monitored by Arsenal ahead of a summer move . Prospect: The 20 year-old has already notched eight Bundesliga goals for Hamburg this season . Heads up: The German-born Turkish midfielder has already represented the Turkey national team . Under instruction from Arsene Wenger, Arsenal have ramped up their scouting network in Germany in recent months. And the Gunners are set to raid Germany yet again this summer with moves for Calhanoglu and Schalke wonderkid Julian Draxler in the pipeline. Tottenham need convincing that Burnley hotshot Danny Ings has what it takes to become a top Premier League striker. Ings has been a revelation in the Championship this season, scoring 25 goals for Sean Dyche's men so far. His displays have attracted major interest from the top-flight; with Spurs among the clubs monitoring Ings on a weekly basis. Step up? Tottenham have been considering a summer move for Burnley hotshot striker Danny Ings . Main man: Ings was just this weekend named as the Sky Bet Player of the Year for the Championship . Prolific: Ings has already notched 25 goals this season as Burnley go in search of Premier League promotion . Spurs chiefs have been impressed with Ings but there remains doubt among the club's hierarchy about how he would adapt to life towards the top of the England's top league. With Burnley set to secure automatic promotion, Ings is likely to play in the top-flight next season regardless. Liverpool, Stoke and West Brom are among the sides to have watched Ings at various junctures this season. Leicester have identified Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni as a potential candidate to replace Kasper Schmeichel. Foxes boss Nigel Pearson fears Schmeichel will leave the club this summer, despite their pending promotion into the top-flight, when his contract expires. The club are trying to nail down the 27-year-old's long-term future, but Pearson has begun the process of finding a replacement in case a deal cannot be reached. Wanted: Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni is a target for Premier League-bound Leicester City . Spread himself: Speroni (right) in action here as he advances out to try and prevent Jay Rodriguez scoring . Outbound: Current Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is expected to leave the King Power this summer . And Speroni has emerged as a prime contender should Schmeichel depart. The Argentine himself is out of contract in the summer, though talks are ongoing over fresh terms.Palace are keen to keep Speroni, 34, and are ready to offer him coaching opportunities at the club as a carrot to sign a new deal. But his future as first-choice keeper is far from secure after the arrival of Wayne Hennessey in January. AC Milan are understood to be keen on taking Schmeichel on a free transfer. Charlton manager Jose Riga is set to revive the club's interest in Derek Boateng. The Fulham midfielder has been on Charlton's radar for a number of weeks, but sacked manager Chris Powell decided against signing Boateng. But with Powell departed, a loan move for the Ghanaian is back on the cards at The Valley. Changes: New Charlton boss Jose Riga is keen to take Fulham midfielder Derek Boateng to The Valley .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Manchester United's patience with manager David Moyes is being driven by an increasing belief that he was handed a questionable behind-the-scenes legacy by his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson. One club source said post-Ferguson, ‘it was like looking behind the curtain of the Wizard of Oz and seeing there was nothing there to work with’. United fans have grown increasingly disillusioned with Moyes in recent days as a disappointing season got a lot worse with 3-0 home defeats by Liverpool and Manchester City. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Moyes reacting after each of United's PL losses . Blame Fergie! Manchester United sources claim Sir Alex Ferguson left the cupboard bare for the new boss . Smiling... but for how long? David Moyes has come under severe pressure after a string of bad results . Tense times: Supporters have started to turn on their manager after a dismal first year in charge . The United board and in particular the owners the Glazer family will only stand so many dreadful  performances on the field and next week’s daunting Champions League tie against Bayern Munich may prove decisive in terms of Moyes’s future. However, Sportsmail understands that one reason why chief executive Ed Woodward and fellow board members are giving Moyes so much time and patience is that they feel he inherited a set-up from Ferguson that was not fit for purpose at Barclays Premier League level. Nobody at the club wants publicly to sully Ferguson’s legacy, given that his 27-year reign lifted United from oblivion to the summit of European football. He also left Moyes a squad that had just won the league by 11 points. But it has since emerged that he ran United’s football operation in such a closed-off way that the board believe the task of restructuring required to bring it up to speed with the rest of Europe’s top clubs is much harder than expected. Boiling point: A fan attempts to confront Moyes during the awful 3-0 defeat against Manchester City . Grounds for concern: A plane will fly over Old Trafford on Saturday to show discontent towards Moyes . Differences of opinion: The derided 'Chosen One' banner will stay up at Old Trafford for now . Contrast: Moyes (left) holds his head in his hands as the Manchester City bench go wild in the derby . Patience pays: Ed Wooward is willing to afford the beleaguered Moyes more time to turn things around . Moyes has begun the process — . especially in terms of scouting and recruitment — but Woodward believes . the job of doing this has influenced the dismal events on the field. This is why the club wants — if at all possible — to give Moyes the . summer to put his own plans into action and recruit his own players. United know this strategy is not without risk and further bad results may force their hand. They plan to spend up to £200million on new players and nobody can blame recent bad performances on anyone but the man in charge. Nevertheless, the United source said: ‘Sir Alex had such a hold on the club that he was left to get on with it. His methods worked for him. ‘It was always known that David would have things to address behind the scenes but there has been much, much more and it has taken longer than was anticipated.’ Not happy: Ferguson has frequently seen his old side get beaten, particularly at home, this season . When will it end? Moyes has presided over United's worst ever Premier League campaign this season . Looking ahead: Moyes had a three-hour meeting with Woodward last week as they plan for next year . Not around much longer: Moyes expects Rio Ferdinand (left) to retire and Nemanja Vidic is off to Inter Milan . Moyes had a three-hour meeting with Woodward last week, the day after United beat Olympiacos 3-0 in the Champions League to set up next week’s clash with old foes Bayern. A sign of growing divisions among supporters is that one group have raised £840 to fly a plane over Old Trafford during the match with Aston Villa tomorrow with the banner: ‘Wrong One — Moyes Out’. This is a direct challenge to the Stretford End Flags group, who have refused to take down their ‘Chosen One’ banner inside the ground. If Moyes survives the turbulent days ahead, he has a list of players he wishes to move out of the club. These include midfielders Anderson, Nani and Wilfried Zaha and defender Alexander Buttner. Moyes will also listen to good offers for Darren Fletcher, Tom Cleverley, Shinji Kagawa and Javier Hernandez. Meanwhile, Nemanja Vidic is leaving for Inter Milan and Moyes expects to lose Patrice Evra to Serie A and Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs to retirement. Off elsewhere? Ryan Giggs completed a takeover of Salford City on Thursday as he heads for retirement .","Manchester United's patience with David Moyes derives from misgivings over Sir Alex Ferguson's legacy .

"By . Graeme Yorke . The controversial banner which Manchester United supporters plan to fly over Old Trafford on Saturday has been pictured for the first time. A group of United fans have chartered a private plane with the message: 'Wrong One: Moyes Out' printed in red lettering and aimed at embarrassing manager David Moyes. They plan to fly the banner over the ground during the Barclays Premier League game with Aston Villa because of the poor results, lack of fight and the fact Moyes is not up to United’s standards. United won the title last season in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final year in charge, but this season they are 17 points behind league leaders Chelsea and look highly unlikely to finish in the top four. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch David Moyes react to this season's United defeats .

The group of fans have raised £840 to . charter the plane and now they have confirmed they have received enough . donations to pay for the flight. The . wording of the banner is a reference to the ‘Chosen One’ banner hanging . from the balcony of the top tier of the Stretford End. The group of fans issued a statement via the Red Issue forum outlining their reasons for their banner. They . claim their decision is 'borne out of acute frustration - frustration . at the poor results, lack of fight on the pitch and the unavoidable . signs the David Moyes isn’t up to the highest standards required to . manage Manchester United Football Club.

Taunt: Millwall fans mock West Ham with this message about Avram Grant after the Hammers' relegation . To whom it may concern, . The decision to fly a plane over Old Trafford bearing the slogan 'Wrong One: Moyes Out' is one borne out of acute frustration - frustration at the poor results, lack of fight on the pitch and the unavoidable signs that David Moyes isn't up to the highest standards required to manage Manchester United Football Club. A significant proportion of Manchester United fans have had enough and unequivocally want David Moyes sacked. Further frustration has been created from the inaccurate perception that all Manchester United fans are behind David Moyes. A banner erected by Stretford End flags, that dubs David Moyes the 'Chosen One' (ludicrously prematurely into his career at United), suggests that all Manchester United fans are supportive of Moyes which isn't accurate. The plane and banner which will fly over the stadium this Saturday attempts to directly counter this very unpopular banner with the words 'Wrong One' and the 'Moyes Out' wording is our statement of what a significant group of Manchester United fans want to happen next at our club. This isn't a reaction because we aren't getting our own way in terms of winning games. There is neither sufficient time or space to list the unwanted records set by the club this season under Moyes stewardship. We cannot have a manager who thinks it is acceptable to call our major rivals ""favourites"" when they play us at Old Trafford. It is a betrayal of the club's ethos, a betrayal of the players and a betrayal of the fan's support. We want a manager who understands and embraces our attacking traditions and has a vision of confidence for the future, not a manager who seems to be completely disassociated and visibly uncomfortable with the fact that he is the manager of Manchester United.

"By . Wills Robinson . A DJ has become an internet sensation after he refused to take part in the 'NekNominate' drinking craze, choosing to finish his coffee instead of downing a cocktail of alcohol. Ashley Abernethie, 25, from Plymouth was invited to join Facebook boozing game where users film themselves downing drinks before nominating others to do the same. But instead of following in the footsteps of thousands of other social media users who have guzzled spirits and beer, he took a stand, finished his hot drink and said: 'It's getting a bit out of hand'. The game has been linked to two deaths in Ireland, but videos of people consuming alcohol, as well as urine, dog food and even live goldfish, are still sweeping the web. Scroll down for video . Refusal: Ashley Abernethie, 25, was invited to join Facebook boozing game where users film themselves downing a drink before nominating others to do the same. But instead of consuming alcohol he swilled coffee . In a minute-long video rebuke, the club DJ and producer said: 'Cheers for the nomination. To be honest, I've seen it all now on the internet. Viral hit: The video has been liked by more than 50,000 people and shared over 11,000 times . 'People necking dog food, goldfish, eggs - disgusting amounts of alcohol in a pint glass. I'm not one for not getting involved, but it's now getting a bit out of hand . 'For me to do anything that's going to create lots of likes, I would have to do something that's probably going to hurt me.' Instead, Ashley finishes his coffee before adding: 'I will neck my coffee and go to work. Cheers.' Ashley's video has amassed nearly 50,000 likes, 12,000 shares and hundreds of supportive comments since it was posted on Sunday. The club DJ said he was 'overwhelmed' with support shown by people backing his video.The married radio presenter, of Plymouth, said: 'The video was just a spur of the moment thing. 'When . I posted it on Facebook I was expecting people to give me a bit of a . ribbing or call me a wuss - but the response was the exact opposite. 'I've been overwhelmed with supportive messages, particularly from mums across the world worried about their kids. 'One wrote to say said I'd given her . 15-year-old son the strength to say no. We know from what happened in . Ireland that this game can be deadly. 'I'm just happy to spread the message that this stuff is dangerous.' Ashley sees plenty of drinking while working as a DJ but he reckons NekNominate takes it to dangerous levels. He added: 'Don't get me wrong, I like a drink. I've downed beer, shots that sort of thing. But NekNominate is utter madness. 'A friend told me that someone he knew ended up in hospital having his stomach pumped after downing a litre of vodka. 'I've also seen videos of people necking urine, condiments, even some bloke drinking three live goldfish. Support: Mr Abernathie said he was overwhelmed by the response to his video . 'People feel they have to do this sort of stuff because their friends are into it but they are risking their health. 'It's not cool, so don't do it. Have a pint and a game of pool with your mates instead.' One user, James Prowse says: 'Love this the party man himself goes famous for being anti-neknom!! Lmao.' Paul Day added: 'Fantastic mate. Love the approach. About time someone was sensible! Legend!' Ashley's . intervention comes after police and alcohol awareness charities warned . about the 'catastrophic dangers' of NekNominate after it was linked to . two deaths in Ireland. Advice: Pictured with his wife Amy Louise, he said on Facebook: 'It's not cool, so don't do it. Have a pint and a game of pool with your mates instead.' Peer pressure: He said people are risking their health by getting involved in the game . The Neknominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world. The . concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck . your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink . Responsible'. The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One . popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down . the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain . bowl to lap it up. Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'Young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in, but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise. 'Quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess, there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the 'cyber shame' some young people may experience. 'Drinkaware research shows nearly half of 18 to 24-year-olds admitted 'un-tagging' drunk photos of themselves on Facebook that they didn't want others to see.' Devon and Cornwall Police urged more Facebook users to follow Ashley's example and refuse to play NekNominate. A spokesman said: 'Getting involved in such irresponsible activity not only poses obvious health risks but increases the possibility of anti-social behaviour and other criminal behaviour which, ultimately, can have a devastating effect on a young person's life which they may later regret.' Two young men died in Ireland over the weekend, both suspected victims of the 'NekNominate' drinking craze. Ross . Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early . hours of Saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was . drinking spirits at the time of his death. Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination.

"By . Craig Hope . and Chris Wheeler . Marouane Fellaini has denied spitting at Pablo Zabaleta in the Manchester derby but the FA are investigating the incident. The Manchester United midfielder was fortunate to only receive a yellow card for thrusting his forearm into Zabaleta’s face but new footage appears to show Fellaini spitting at the City defender on the ground. The FA have asked to see clearer images. United boss David Moyes said: ‘Marouane is adamant that he didn’t do that. We’ll work with the FA if that’s what we have to do to clear it.’ Footage: Video has emerged that appears to show Marouane Fellaini spit towards Pablo Zabaleta . Aftermath: The incident happened moments after Fellaini elbowed the Argentine defender . Insult to injury: Zabaleta was on the ground hurt . Walking away: Fellaini then walks away after being booked by Michael Oliver . Getting away with it: Fellaini was only booked for elbowing the City defender . Accident? Fellaini has since claimed that Zabaleta ran into his elbow . Banned: Hull City's George Boyd was retrospectively banned after spitting at City goalkeeper Joe Hart . The United midfielder was booked by . referee Michael Oliver for a first-half elbow in the face of his City . opponent. However, with Zabaleta stricken on the turf, Fellaini appears . to spit at the Argentine immediately after being shown the yellow card. The £28million summer signing was unrepentant about the elbow on the defender. 'I don't know, but I certainly didn't do it on purpose,' said Fellaini when asked about the incident that saw him pick up a just yellow card. 'I put my arm up to try and protect possession of the ball, and Zabaleta bounced (his jaw) against it. He was unlucky to make contact. 'The movement by me was not in an aggressive manner. It was a defensive move to protect the ball.' Making a case: Michael Oliver opted to show Fellaini the yellow card rather than the red . Too easy: City barely moved out of second gear as they smashed United 3-0 at Old Trafford . Game, set and match: Edin Dzeko bags his second goal of the night in a dismal showing for United . The FA could now look into the incident . in much the same way as they did when retrospective punishment was . served on Hull City's George Boyd earlier this month. Television cameras caught the forward spitting towards goalkeeper Joe Hart during Manchester City's 2-0 win at the KC Stadium. Boyd was subsequently banned for three matches despite appealing against the charge and protesting his innocence.","The FA are looking into footage that appears to show Marouane Fellaini spitting towards Pablo Zabaleta during the Manchester Derby .

"By . Graeme Yorke . A group of Manchester United supporters have raised £840 to fund an aeroplane to fly over Old Trafford with an anti-David Moyes message. The supporters have put the money together to hire the plane with the order: ‘Wrong One – Moyes Out’ to go overhead during Saturday's Barclays Premier League home match against Aston Villa. It is a direct challenge to the Stretford End Flags group, who say they will not take down the 'Chosen One' banner inside Old Trafford. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch David Moyes react to this season's United defeats . Get the message: David Moyes is being targeted by fans because of United's woeful season . Grounds for concern: The plane will fly over Old Trafford during Saturday's match against Aston Villa . Keeping watch: The David Moyes banner will stay up at Old Trafford for now . Contrast: Moyes (left) holds his head in his hands as the Manchester City bench go wild in the derby . Stretford End Flags spokesman Andrew Kilduff on why they're keeping the Moyes 'Chosen One' banner - for now . The Republik of Mancunia website, who first reported the plans, . said: 'The message is a response to the Stretford End Flags banner which . reads ""The Chosen One"". Following United’s 3-0 defeat against City . yesterday, stewards were sent to protect the banner at full time, after . there were concerns that fans would want to remove it.' 'As . yet, there have been no public protests within the ground, home or . away, but it is expected that will change at the weekend when United . face Villa.' Andrew . Kilduff of Stretford End Flags told Sportsmail that the group had . thought about taking the banner down but ultimately decided to keep it . up. He explained: 'It’s . rare that we commission banners for a player or manager who has just . arrived. Certainly it’s almost unheard of that we would do one for . someone who hadn’t won or achieved anything with us. But we thought the . David Moyes situation was different. 'When . he arrived, we had been urged by Sir Alex Ferguson to support him and . this was just one of the ways we felt we could do that. Now we are under . some pressure to take it down. Discontent: One supporter looks angry as he passes Moyes and his staff . 'The words ""The Chosen One"" came from . a rank-and-file United fan and we took it and ran with it. It was . appropriate that it was first hung for the visit of Jose Mourinho and . Chelsea at the first home game of the season. We knew the ""Special One"" had wanted the United job and this was our way of telling him we had . chosen someone else.' 'The . feedback was largely good. A few people moaned that Moyes shouldn’t get a . banner until he had won something but on the whole the banner proved . very popular, both as a concept and in terms of the wording. 'All . in all it probably cost about £500 to make and hang and all that cash . came from supporters. Some may donate a pound, someone else may donate . £50. It’s the way it always is. 'Over . the course of the season there have been some moans and groans about . results but the talk about removing the banner only really gathered pace . on the Sunday and Monday ahead of the Olympiacos home game. People . started to get in touch on Twitter and other social media asking us to . take it down. Taunt: Millwall fans mock West Ham with this message about Avram Grant after the Hammers' relegation . 'As we speak, there are still calls . for us to remove it. There are polls saying that more than 90 per cent . of fans want it down. But 90 per cent of how many? Is that truly . representative of the average United fan? I’m not sure it is. 'What . we don’t want to do is anything knee-jerk. So the banner will stay for . now. It will stay for the Villa game on Saturday and it will stay for . Bayern Munich. As I said before, the focus should be on the team ahead . of the Bayern game in particular. 'There has been nothing particularly visible or verbal against Moyes during games at Old Trafford. No ‘Moyes Out’ flags or anything. So we don’t think it’s our place to initiate some kind of campaign for his sacking by taking his banner down.' Planes are usually used by fans to taunt opponents, such as when Millwall supporters flew a message over the DW Stadium mocking relegated West Ham and thanking their manager Avram Grant. They are even sometimes used by players - in the 1980s Blackburn striker Simon Garner hired one to mock relegated rivals Burnley.","A group of United supporters have put the money together to hire plane .
