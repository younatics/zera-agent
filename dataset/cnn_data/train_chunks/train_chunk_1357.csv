"Abraham George, 37, was sentenced to 24 months in prison after spending £60,000 on stolen cards . A pair of fraudsters went on a £60,000 spending spree using stolen credit cards to buy designer clothes, shoes and even a wedding. Abraham George and Olatunde Emmanuel Lawal from Manchester were sentenced today after police found they had used the stolen money to fund a lavish lifestyle far beyond their means. Manchester Crown Court heard that when George's home was raided, officers found an unusually high number of designer items with expensive electrical items in every room. He was also caught with more than £560 worth of alcohol fraudulently bought from Waitrose using stolen cards and his house was strewn with receipts from the fraudulent transactions. As part of the investigation, officers found George and his wife enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle far beyond their legitimate means of income recorded with the Inland Revenue. The couple's wedding at the Davenport Green Hotel in Hale Barns, of which the venue alone cost £14,000, was also suspected of being paid for using stolen money. It was heard in court that George and Lawal met and agreed the fraudulent stolen card scheme at church, and Lawal was paid £50 for each of the transactions by George. The pair used a stolen Hilton Honours credit card issued by Barclaycard to a genuine cardholder to make more than 40 transactions between  May 11, 2012 and May 31, 2012. The hotel card was used to load pre-paid cards at Paypoint terminals - these can be loaded with a specific amount of money and used as debit cards that are not linked directly to any account. In total they used the card to spend £32,950 - mainly at Co-op supermarkets in the West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester areas. George and Lawal also used a stolen Natwest card to rack up transactions of more than £25,000. An unusually high number of designer items were found at George's home when it was raided, including these designer sunglasses, some of which are still in their original cellophane bags . A rack of designer shoes, left, and a pair of red Kurt Geiger heels, right, were among the items bought . George had £560 worth of booze fraudulently bought from Waitrose at his house bought with stolen cards . The genuine cardholder reported that in September 2012 someone accessed her online banking, changed her passwords and made several unauthorised withdrawals and transactions on her account. The pair pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and money laundering at an earlier hearing. George, 37, of Heaton Park Road, was today sentenced to 24 months imprisonment and Lawal was given a 12 month prison sentence, suspended for two years and 200 hours unpaid work. Police Constable Andrew Butcher said: 'These men must have thought they had struck gold. 'They managed to get hold of genuine credit card holder's details and went on a spending spree. George, in particular, used the money to kit his house out with designer clothes and expensive electrical items, none of which he could have come close to affording on his wages. A pair of women's Jimmy Choo designer heels were among the fraudulently bought items, still in their box . Some of the designer handbags found in the raid. George pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and money laundering . Along with Lawal, the pair used a stolen Hilton Honours credit card issued by Barclaycard to a genuine cardholder to make more than 40 transactions and spend £32,950.

Pictured, some of the designer belts  found in the raid on George's house . The genuine cardholder of the card they were using to buy designer items, including belts (pictured) reported that in September 2012 someone accessed her online banking and made transactions on her account . 'George and Lawal caused considerable distress, upset and unrest to the victims who had their details stolen before defrauding major companies out of tens of thousands of pounds. 'Anyone who has been a victim of this sort of crime will know how unsettling it is to have fraudsters mimic your identity and use your hard-earned cash to fund their criminality. 'That is why I am delighted we have exposed these conmen. They were persistent fraudsters who would still be spending other people's other money today if we had not caught them and I hope this sends a powerful message to other people who think they can get away with this sort of scheme that we will be coming for you.'

"Earning a spot in the first line of riders at SoulCycle is so competitive these days, it's being compared to nabbing a seat in the front row at Fashion Week. Die-hard fans of the cult fitness movement - essentially a mixture of the hard-core aerobic spinning set to ear-splitting loud chart tunes - jostle for a spot at the front, where all eyes are on them and the pressure to perform is at its highest. One SoulCycle instructor tells Daily Mail Online: 'The front row is definitely sought after, and is absolutely a status symbol.' You can't sit with us: One SoulCycle instructor tells Daily Mail Online, 'the front row is definitely sought after, and is absolutely a status symbol.' Pictured, shirts from the company's new line of branded sportswear . 'If you're new, and you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't sit in the front,' the instructor remarks. While there have been reports of some instructors going as far as to insist that only 'pre-approved' riders can sit in the front row, our source says that in reality, 'there is no such thing.' She further adds that she would never ask a less-experienced rider to 'move back' herself, but there are instructors who do. One SoulCycle die-hard claims that inexperienced riders regularly get 'shamed' by fellow participants or moved to the back by instructors. It's largely to boost morale for the rest of the class. Indeed, one of SoulCycle's many brand commandments, which are painted on the walls of every studio, is called 'The Pack.' It states: 'There is a direct correlation between your energy and your neighbor’s ride. If you want to do your own thing, please don’t ride in the front row.' Be seen: Die-hard fans of the cult fitness movement - essentially a mixture of the hard-core aerobic spinning set to ear-splitting loud chart tunes - jostle for a spot at the front, where all eyes are on them . One keen SoulCycle rider, 29-year-old Jeff Rosenbloom, based in New York, remarks that although anyone can technically book themselves a bike at the front of the class, 'no-one in their right mind would unless they were good enough.' He notes: 'The pressure would be too much.' Another SoulCycle fanatic tells The New York Times that she refuses to take classes altogether unless she can sit at the head, claiming that riders in front of her 'get in the way' of her workout. One devotee describes the day she was chosen to ride in the front, recalling: 'I was so honored and excited that he recognized me as a strong rider. 'I kept looking at myself in the mirror during class, thinking, ""I feel strong and beautiful"".' SoulCycle, which boasts an astonishing retention rate of 85per cent, launched in 2006 and only has 26 locations in the U.S. so far, but it's growing fast, with plans to expand to London this year. Jennifer Lawrence, Olivia Wilde, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Alessandra Ambrosio have all hopped onto SoulCycle's stationary bikes, with sessions priced at a hefty $34 for 45 minutes. Strong following: Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Olivia Wilde (right) are both fans of SoulCycle .

"Boko Haram has killed up to 2,000 people  in the northeast Nigerian town of Baga in the past two days, their second killing spree since seizing control there over the weekend. Locals said the insurgents began shooting indiscriminately and burning buildings on Tuesday evening in several raids targeting the civilian population that carried on into Wednesday. Dead bodies were left in the streets following the bloody assault by militant Islamists, eye witnesses said. Scroll down for video . Boko Haram has killed up to 2,000 people in the northeast Nigerian town of Baga in the past two days - pictured is the leader of the Islamist extremist group Abubakar Shekau (centre) delivering a speech . Soldiers protecting the town, which has a population of 10,000 fled on Saturday after militants attacked the town's military base. Nigeria's government today said troops had begun a fightback against Boko Haram. The militants first attacked Baga, in the north of remote Borno state, on Saturday and on Wednesday set fire to the town and razed at least 16 towns and villages nearby. Mike Omeri, who speaks on national security, said security forces had been 'actively pursuing the militants' since the first attack and after the second. 'Security forces have responded rapidly and have deployed significant military assets and conducted airstrikes against militant targets,' Omeri told reporters in Abuja. Boko Haram has been waging a five-year insurgency to carve out an Islamic state in northeastern Nigeria. Local officials in and around Baga told AFP on Wednesday that at least 20,000 people were forced to flee their homes and that 560 had been stranded on an island on Lake Chad since Saturday. Omeri said the country's emergency management agency was helping 2,000 people displaced from Baga, while other agencies, including the Red Cross, were ready to assist when security allows. A boy walks through damage caused by Boko Haram insurgents during the attack at Ngala in  Borno State . Boko Haram has for the last six months captured dozens of towns and villages in northeast Nigeria as part of its aim to establish a hardline Islamic state. The Baga attack effectively gave it control of all three frontiers of Borno state with neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, increasing fears of cross-border attacks. Security analysts this week said that the militants were now in a better position to strike south towards the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, where the group was founded in 2002. It has also cast doubt on the ability to hold general elections in the affected areas, scheduled for next month. Musa Alhaji Bukar, a senior government official, told the BBC that fleeing residents told him that Baga was now 'virtually non-existent', adding those who fled reported that they had been unable to bury the dead, and corpses littered the town's streets. Nigeria's government maintains it is on top of the situation, despite repeated claims of a lack of military presence in the region and complaints from soldiers about inadequate weapons and kit. Omeri condemned the latest attacks as 'brutal and barbaric' and said they represented 'none of the people of Nigeria and no religion'.","Boko Haram have seized Nigerian town of Baga and 16 neighbouring towns .

"Bill Clinton's name being recently linked to registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has greatly upset his wife, according to a report published Thursday. An unnamed source told Page Six 'Talk in Washington is that Hillary is furious with Bill about all this new information on Jeffrey Epstein.' Court documents from 2011 describe Clinton's connection to Epstein, the news outlet reported. Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor. An excerpt of the documents, obtained by The Smoking Gun, said from 2002 to 2005 that 'Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then suddenly stopped - raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of events related to Epstein's sexual abuse of children. Unfortunate connection? Bill Clinton's name being recently linked to Jeffrey Epstein has reportedly greatly upset his wife, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . It continued 'Epstein's personal phone directory from his computer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including those of his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton's personal numbers. 'This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of relevant information and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead to admissable evidence.' However, Clinton was not deposed by the lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims, The Smoking Gun reported. The Clintons went to St. Ignatius Loyola Church earlier this week for the funeral of Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York. Onlookers claimed to see Bill Clinton 'waiting by the front door for a long time' while speaking to Page Six. Frosty entrance? Though Hillary Clinton has been accused of 'storming' into a church on Tuesday, she was seen smiling and with her arm wrapped around her husband's while leaving . Links: Jeffrey Epstein had contact information for Bill Clinton, including his email addresses and phone numbers, court documents say . A source told the website 'People assumed he was waiting for [Mario Cuomo's widow] Matilda Cuomo. But then Hillary came storming in right past him.' The source additionally claimed Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, appeared upset with her husband. Page Six noted that Clinton and Epstein are no longer friends. Photos show that the Clintons had their arms wrapped around one another while leaving the Upper East Side church later in the day - with both of them flashing smiles. A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton told Page Six it was 'Utter nonsense,' with the website reporting that a spokesperson for her husband 'made a customarily snide comment.' Representatives for both Clintons did not immediately return messages seeking comment from Daily Mail Online.","Bill Clinton's name being tied to Jeffrey Epstein has greatly upset his wife, a new report claims .

"Lobster, once a delicacy restricted to high-end restaurants, is getting its claws into High Street takeaways and snack bars. The UK's appetite for it is at an all-time high due to its growing availability and low price. So-called lobster shacks, modelled on those in Maine, America, are springing up, serving the seafood in a roll for as little as £9. Simon King of Burger & Lobster, an expanding restaurant group, said despite problems keeping the shellfish alive in shop tanks, they will become more commonplace on menus across the country. Lobster, once a delicacy restricted to high-end restaurants, is getting its claws into High Street takeaways. Pictured is waitress Rhiannon at the . Burger & Lobster, an expanding food chain . Analysts are expecting lobster to be available at a lower price than ever this year as its popularity continues to grow. On its opening day, the 240-seat Burger & Lobster restaurant in Cardiff served about 200 customers at lunchtime alone. Three new branches are planned in London for 2015, and the Burger & Lobster will open in Manchester this spring and Bath and Liverpool later in the year. 'If you go back 20 years, people didn't have king prawns, now you can get them almost anywhere,' said Mr King. Lobster and chips served at the opening of the Burger & Lobster at the top of Harvey Nichols in London . Analysts are expecting lobster to be available at a lower price than ever this year as its popularity continues to grow, pictured is The Lobster Kitchen restaurant in London . 'It's not going to be exactly the same with lobsters as keeping them alive is difficult, but we are still going to see lobster become more commonplace on menus.' His restaurants charge £20 for a one-and-a-half-pound lobster, but rival chains are charging less for smaller lobsters. Mr King said: 'The price point of lobster is dropping.' Takeaways selling lobster rolls are making the delicacy even more affordable. Fraq's Lobster Shack in London, modelled on those in Maine, America, charges £15 for a lobster roll, but nearby Smack's Deli is the cheapest at £9 for a large roll, similar in price to a gourmet burger. Lobster has also gained new fans with discount supermarkets such as Lidl and Iceland selling whole frozen crustaceans for just £5.","UK's appetite for lobster at all-time high due to  availability and low price .

"David Cameron today insisted his love for Mancunian mega band The Smiths would 'never go out' – despite the group 'banning' him from listening to their music. The Prime Minister was given a limited edition T-shirt with a photo of the indie band during a trip to Manchester today. Frontman Morrissey has attacked Mr Cameron for declaring his love for the group – while bandmate Johnny Marr even expressed his disgust that the Tory leader 'liked' his songs. The Prime Minister was presented with a limited-edition T-shirt featuring his favourite band after he had a tour of local newspaper offices in Manchester . After being handed the T-shirt today, the PM appeared to take a swipe at the two music stars, quipping: 'You have made my day. Thank you very much.' He then quoted a famous Smiths lyric: 'There is a light that never goes out.' Mr Cameron is lucky to have got his hands on the T-shirt, with Smiths fans from around the world clamouring to get hold of the Salford Lads Club shirts, which have gone on sale to support local young people. The shirt features a famous photo of The Smiths outside the club in Ordsall, similar to the one pictured on the band's 1986 album 'The Queen is Dead'. Photographer Stephen Wright has licensed the picture for the club's T-shirts until November 2015. The Salford Lads Club, based on the corner of Coronation Street and Ignatius Way in Salford, is a top destination for Smiths fans. In 2010 Morrissey called on the prime minister to stop proclaiming his admiration for the Smiths . It even has its own Smiths room, which was visited by Mr Cameron in 2008. He paid homage to the band by visiting the Lads Club in 2008 and in 2010 he chose 'This Charming Man' as one of his Desert Island Discs. It prompted Johnny Marr to 'ban' him from listening to The Smiths and Morrissey voiced his disapproval too. Mr Marr said: 'I think he likes the song. That's probably sadder than if he didn't know it, really. He's entitled to like whatever he likes, as long as he doesn't say it. It's a good song.' Former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr told David Cameron to 'stop saying' he is a fan of the band . He added: 'I do forbid him to like it. He shouldn't like us because we're not his kind of people. ' Morrissey has also called on the prime minister to stop proclaiming his admiration, saying in 2010: 'David Cameron hunts and shoots and kills stags - apparently for pleasure. It was not for such people that either Meat Is Murder or The Queen Is Dead were recorded; in fact, they were made as a reaction against such violence.' But in 2013 Mr Cameron joked about not being allowed to listen to the Smiths. He said: 'I'm a huge music fan, but obviously it's been something of a music crisis year for me because Morrissey and Johnny Marr have said I'm not allowed to listen to The Smiths any more, so I've had to find some other stuff I am allowed to listen to.' The Manchester band, whose other hits include Bigmouth Strikes Again and Panic, split in the 1980s. The Smiths are not the only musicians to voice their opposition to Mr Cameron. Nick Mulvey, a folk singer who was recently named as Mr Cameron's favourite new musician, last week said he felt a 'bit sick' at finding out the Prime Minister is a fan. The 32-year-old songwriter, who is British but moved to Cuba at the age of 19 to study music, was clearly not impressed after Mr Cameron told an interviewer he enjoyed cooking while listening to his album Cururucu. Asked via Twitter how he felt about the honour of being listened to by the Prime Minister, Mulvey replied: 'A bit sick.' Mr Cameron has a musical ear and, along with wife, Samantha, likes to keep up with current music trends. Other favourites include First Aid Kit, a Swedish folk duo who he saw in person after sneaking into a gig at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. He has named Pink Floyd as his favourite band of all time. Last year, the prime minister gave a 'mixtape' of British music to fellow world leaders attending a G8 summit in Northern Ireland.","PM was given a special T-shirt with a photo of indie band in Manchester .

"Almost £90,000 worth of goods has been stolen from Parliament buildings since 2010, official figures reveal. Expensive electronic gadgets including iPads, laptops and cameras have been regularly targeted by Parliamentary thieves. But House of Commons documents reveal that MPs and their staff have reported a host of other bizarre thefts – including of a teddy bear, some champagne and even a dental mould. Expensive electronic gadgets including iPads, laptops and cameras have been regularly targeted by Parliamentary thieves . Other items which have been reported stolen include an 'orchid', 'beer casks', a 'pedal bikes', 'six boxes of mints' and some 'floral arrangements'. Some £900 in cash, £450 worth of knives and a £1,700 Rolex watch have also been stolen. The thefts comes despite armed police and sniffer dogs patrolling the Palace of Westminster 365 days a year. Just under £11,500 worth of goods were stolen from Parliament this year, official  figures show. This is more than double the £4,200 worth of items which went missing last year. In 2012, goods valued at £17,500 went missing - down from a whopping £43,600 worth of laptops, iPads and other gadgets which were stolen in 2011. In the first year of the Coalition, goods worth £10,500 were stolen. Tory MP Keith Simpson said: 'It's worrying people working here may be stealing.' Expensive electronic gadgets including iPads, laptops and cameras have been regularly targeted by Parliamentary thieves . Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner was one of the most high-profile victims of the Parliamentary crime spree when his bike was stolen. The 82-year-old MP discovered the theft of his 18-gear hybrid bike when he turned up to collect mail before a meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee. He said: 'It was parked 20 yards from a police box - but they can't keep an eye on my bike all day long.' Mr Skinner says he used the bike for exercise, completing three or four laps of Hyde Park on fine days in the Spring and Summer.

I have always walked and so on and kept pretty fit.' The Palace of Westminster is not the only public building seen as an easy target for thieves. The Ministry of Defence has come under heavy fire for the amount of military kit it has mislaid. Figures released by the MoD show alleged thefts have totalled more than £7 million over the last seven years. The figures were made public by the MoD in response to a written parliamentary question from Nick de Bois, a Conservative MP. Tthe stolen items include £5,800 worth of anti-impotence Viagra pills, also used for conditions including blood pressure, and equipment from nuclear submarines from RAF Marham in Norfolk. In the past year 100 bayonets, thousands of rounds of live and blank ammunition, a Bedford truck and an industrial washing machine have all been stolen from MoD sites across the country. Lead flashing and roofing, copper piping, electrical cables and radiators have also been stolen by metal thieves, as well a £25,000 silver statue from the Household Cavalry barracks in Knightsbridge and £7,000 worth of silver cutlery from Redford Cavalry and Infantry Barracks near Edinburgh. Dr Andrew Murrison, defence minister, said: 'The Ministry of Defence takes detecting and deterring fraud and theft seriously and set up a new counter fraud and loss department last year to improve the way fraud and theft is managed across defence. 'The aim being to minimise the losses from the defence budget from fraud, misappropriation and theft and thereby maximise the amount spent on our armed forces.'","Electronic gadgets including  laptops and cameras  regularly targeted .

"As a Burberry model, Vogue cover girl and socialite Jourdan Dunn is seemingly living the supermodel dream. But her enviable lifestyle and stellar success is bittersweet because Jourdan, 24, is also a mother who's regularly forced to leave her son behind when she jets around the world for work. The Victoria's Secret model has a five-year-old named Riley and has revealed she was envious of her mother spending so much time with him when she first began working internationally. Scroll down for video . Jourdan Dunn, pictured arriving for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in December 2014, is only 24 but she already has a lucrative career that most women could only dream about . Speaking in the February issue of British Vogue magazine, which she covers, Jourdan said: 'They are so close I was kind of jealous of their relationship in the beginning. But it works for me. 'You can find the balance of being a working mother, but I couldn't do it without my mum. She is the one who allowed me to go and do my thing.' The catwalk star also claims other models couldn't relate to her at first because they didn't understand her commitments as a mother. Jourdan added: 'I love that one day I am doing this and then I go home to my reality: getting Riley ready for school, doing his reading with him, taking him to the park. 'For some in this industry their life is their work. The other girls didn't understand in the beginning why I didn't want to go out all the time.' Jourdan, who was scouted in her local Primark at the tender age of 15, fell pregnant aged 18 and after giving birth to her son Riley, his father was arrested for possession of cocaine. Jourdan fell pregnant aged 18 and her son Riley is now five and often cared for by Jourdan's mother . The catwalk star also claims other models couldn't relate to her at first because they didn't understand her commitments as a mother. She and Cara Delevingne are, however, fiercely close . Jourdan was in a predicament, left alone to balance her increasingly successful working life with her flailing personal life. And things didn't get any easier for the mother from Ealing after Riley was diagnosed with sickle-cell anaemia, an inherited, noncontagious blood disorder. The disorder leaves sufferers with a shorter life expectancy and periods of sickle-cell crisis that last a few days and require serious medication and hospitalisation. Although Jourdan doesn't have the disease herself, she and the father of her son are among the 250,000 people in England estimated to carry the genetic mutation that causes it. Jourdan Dunn posted her first Vogue cover to her Instagram account and revealed her joy at becoming the first solo black model to grace the cover of British Vogue for more than 12 years . Jourdan poses alongside her  Victoria's Secret model pals (l-r) Elsa Hosk, Jourdan, Karlie Kloss, Candice Swanepoel, Doutzen Kroes and Lily Aldridge) in matching leather jackets ahead of the show in December . Speaking to the Sunday Times Style magazine at the time, the model said: 'I found out I carried it when I was pregnant, which was a huge shock. 'The first time Riley had a crisis, I was working in New York and due to travel to Puerto Rico. Mum was amazing and reassured me he was in the best hands and that I should keep working.' Riley has to take penicillin and folic acid daily and Jourdan worries that more awareness should be raised about the disease. She said: 'It's something people don't really know about, due to the fact it's genetic, so it doesn't have the high profile of HIV or malaria, . 'Riley looks just like a normal boy, but I can't get away from the fact he has a serious disease.' Jourdan intends to use her status as a famous model to help garner more support for the Sickle Cell Society, which she strongly supports. Taking it in her stride, Jourdan has powered through life and juggled her thriving modelling career with the demands of being a single parent. Jourdan's career highlights include walking for the super-cool Topshop Unique show, left, and VS, right . The modelling world has been extremely accommodating of Jourdan's decision to be a mother first and a model second, with Jean-Paul Gaultier even making her a special pregnancy catwalk outfit for a show. Last week, Jourdan was revealed as the first solo black model to grace the cover of British Vogue for more than 12 years. The 24-year-old Londoner shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on Instagram to her 954,000 followers after speculation on Twitter today. She wrote: 'I'm so Happy to finally say I'M ON THE COVER OF BRITISH VOGUE!!!' She added: 'Thank you Patrick Demarchelier and Kate Phelan for making this happen and also thank you all for the Love and Support it means everything to me #2015YearOfTheDunn.' Although this is her first solo Vogue cover, Jourdan did previously front the magazine in 2008 along with Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Eden Clark. This also marks a change for the fashion bible as it is the first time they have featured a solo black model on the cover since Naomi Campbell appeared in 2002. Jourdan has enjoyed a highly successful career so far and has been the face of Burberry beauty along with Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell . This is the latest in a string of good news for the model. At the beginning of last month she took a highly successful turn on the Victoria's Secret runway as the show hit London for the first time. Then in mid-December it was revealed that Jourdan and Naomi Campbell were the faces of Burberry's Spring / Summer 2015 campaign. She said of the shoot: 'This campaign is even more special for me because I was shot with Naomi Campbell for the first time - someone who I admire and respect within the fashion industry.' She is also a firm favourite on the fashion party circuit counting Cara Delevigne, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May Jagger amongst her close friends. Last year, Forbes announced that she was the 10th highest paid model, making an estimated £2.65m ($4m) last year and beating world-renowned beauty Cara, who earned £2.3m ($3.5m). Jourdan posed in September 2013 with some of her model pals including Suki Waterhouse, Cara Delevingne, Georgia May Jagger and Clara Paget .","Jourdan reveals she was envious of her mother but it works for her now .

"Defiant Charlie Hebdo staff gathered in the offices of a rival newspaper today to plan their next edition - just two days after gunmen slaughtered 10 of their colleagues. Journalists and cartoonists met with staff from French newspaper Liberation - who, along with several other media outlets, have promised to help them produce next week's magazine. Employees at the satirical magazine who survived the massacre have pledged to create next week's edition in memory of their colleagues and 'write it with our tears'. Scroll down for video . Editorial staff from French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo gathered with journalists from rival newspaper Liberation following the deadly attack  by armed gunmen on Wednesday . Employees at the satirical magazine who survived the massacre have pledged to create next week's edition in memory of their colleagues and 'write it with our tears' Among those pictured was French cartoonist Renald Luzier, 42, known as 'Luz', who only escaped the slaughter because he overslept by half an hour and was late for work, according to his wife. Reporter Lauren Leger, accompanied by cartoonist Catherine Meurisse, was also seen solemnly making his way into the meeting while French police officers lined the entrance. Journalist Mr Leger, who was in the room where most of the victims were slaughtered, described how some of his colleagues laughed when they first heard shots. 'We thought it was a joke, that it was fire crackers' said Mr Leger.

'Then we heard footsteps. The door opened. A guy shouted 'Allahu Akbar' (God is Great).' Mr Leger said he saw 'barbarism enter the newspaper' as the terrorists called out the name 'Charb', referring to editor Stephane Charbonnier, one of those killed. 'They called out the name of Charb, yes. But after that they fired into the group,' said Mr Leger, who threw himself under a table to get away from the gunman and 'escaped his eyes.' The shooter then turned to his accomplice, with Mr Leger saying: 'He said he thought he had killed everybody, but did not kill women.'

The French government is pledging around £800,000 to Charlie Hebdo to ensure its survival - the largest of a surge of donations to the satirical magazine following Wednesday's atrocity. It is due to be published on Wednesday, a week after the Al Qaeda terrorists attacked their offices, killing a guest editor, three cartoonists, two columnists, a sub-editor and Mr Charbonnier. Charlie Hebdo staff will be using the offices of French newspaper Liberation - while fellow newspaper Le Monde has reportedly vowed to donate computers to the displaced journalists. Amid speculation that the cover image could be more provocative than ever, former editor Philippe Val declared: 'We will never stop laughing. We must let people laugh. We must let them ridicule the bastards.' Mr Val, who edited the magazine before Mr Charbonnier and was his mentor, said yesterday: 'We have laughed so much, we must continue to laugh.

"Well educated and pulling in a decent income? If so, you're more likely to steal from hotel rooms,  claims a new study. Eight per cent of hotel-goers have stolen something from their accommodation in the past two years, according to a poll by Keyfacts Online Research. And more than half of those who lift items that are supposed to be left for the next guests have a higher educational qualification. Hygeine products make up 69 per cent of the items stolen from hotel rooms, says Travel24.com's survey . The survey of German travellers claims 1.3 million towels have disappeared in the past two years . University graduates are the group most likely to steal from a hotel room, making up more than half . Only nine per cent of thefts were committed by those whose education stopped at high school, according to the study commissioned  by website Travel24.com . The survey of 5,898 people aged over 14 in Germany who have stayed in a hotel in the last two years calculates that about £28.85million (37 million euros) in property have been nicked. According to the results, the majority of hotel thieves have what the survey deems a moderate income of between £1,365 and £1,950-a-month before tax, with 18 per cent of hotel thieves earning this amount. Those who earned between £1,950 and £2,535 rank second with a share of 17 percent, although the survey also indicated that those who earn more than this are the least likely to swipe items from their accommodation. Hotel phones aren't even safe, making up two per cent of the items swiped from hotels . Hairdryers are also not safe, making up two per cent, even though many hotels fix them to the wall . Mid-range hotels are the most under threat from thieves, with 47 per cent of hotel theft coming from four-star hotels. About 35 per cent came from three-star hotels while only 10 per cent of robbery comes from five and six-star accommodation. Only nine per cent of theft happens in one or two-star hotels. As for what disappears from rooms, 69 per cent of items taken include hygeine products including shampoo, shower gel and conditioner along with nail files and shower caps. The survey claims 3.1 million shampoo or soap bottles are taken by more than 250,000 hotels worldwide every year. Hotel guests are also keen on taking stationary as a souvenir, with writing implements, notepads and in some cases their leather casing taken from desks by 34 per cent of those who steal. Source: Travel24.com . Travel24.com's survey claims this means at least 1.6 million pens, pads and other stationary items have been swiped in the past 24 months. Plush hotel towels are the next most popular hotel products with 28 per cent of those who believe hotel property should be theirs finding space in their bags for one, meaning hotels are scratching around for 1.3 million towels that have disappeared in the past two years. Bathing shoes or slippers the fourth most stolen with a total of 700,000 stolen items, based on the 16 per cent theft ratio. Bottle openers (six per cent), drinking glasses (six per cent), toothbrush mugs (four per cent), ashtrays (four per cent), cutlery (three per cent) or whole pieces of furniture (two per cent) are also not safe. Source: Travel24.com . Even electrical devices aren't safe, with two per cent of the items taken from hotels made up of hair dryers or even the telephone from the room. Pillows and blankets and duvet covers are each admittedly taken by two per cent of those with light fingers who were surveyed. One per cent of thefts are room decorations or a radio, while remote controls and TV sets, presumably together, are also stolen.","Eight per cent of people have stolen from hotels, claim Travel24.com .

"A man was thrown into jail in Spain for nine months after leaving a sarcastic comment under his ex-girlfriend's Facebook profile picture. In October 2012 the man, who has not been named, was banned from contacting his former partner by any means after a specialized Domestic Violence court in Palma, Majorca passed a protection order. But just five days later the hopeless individual posted a mocking comment under her profile picture which read: 'Showing them what you've got I see, babe.' Breached restraining order: A man jailed for nine months at court in Palma, Majorca (above) after leaving a sarcastic comment on his ex-girlfriend's Facebook page . After reading the comment, 'a la vete a enseñarlo guapa’ in Spanish, the woman alerted the authorities and the ex-boyfriend was once again brought before a court in Palma. He was charged with breaching the restraining order and  sentenced to nine months behind bars. He appealed his conviction, citing that the court could not prove who sent the Facebook message or that he had actually breached the order. But the court in Palma said the man was 'completely conscious' of the fact his Facebook message 'was an infringement of the restraining order'. Five days after being issued with a restraining order banning contact with his ex-partner the hopeless individual wrote a comment under her profile picture which read: 'Showing them what you've got I see, babe' It is not the first time that Facebook comments have landed someone behind bars.

"Nicholas Stewart, from Blackpool, was branded a danger to public health after he was caught selling bottles of fake spirits filled with urine . A conman was branded a danger to public health after he was caught selling bottles filled with urine as whisky to tourists. Nicholas Stewart was arrested after he was seen trying to sell the one and a half litre bottles of fake whisky and vodka to holidaymakers for £10, a court heard. Scientific analysis revealed some drinks merely contained flat cola but in others they found evidence of human waste. Blackpool Council prosecutor Victoria Cartmell said the drinks had probably been laced with faeces and urine to give the colour of whisky. The 35-year-old, from Blackpool, was spared jail for the sickening offence and was handed a 70 day jail term suspended for 12 months after he admitted fraud. Prosecutors are now working with police to impose a CRASBO to ban him from selling anything on the streets of Blackpool. It was the second time is seven days that courts heard how Stewart had duped holidaymakers into parting with the £10 for what they thought were sealed one and a half litre bottles of spirits. The bottles were seized by security staff when Stewart was seen approaching customers in the massive Coral Island slot machine complex. Blackpool Council prosecutor Victoria Cartmell revealed the most sinister threat to public health posed by Stewart. 'Two of the bottles seized from him were sent for analysis,' she said. 'They were purported to contain whisky and vodka.' 'But they were water laced with urine and faeces probably to give the so called whisky colour.' Fake bottles of Jack Daniel's whisky and Smirnoff vodka were seized and tested- revealing evidence of urine and faeces . The 35-year-old was handed a 70 day jail term suspended for 12 months at Blackpool Magistrates Court after he admitted fraud . 'They were totally unsuitable for public consumption- they were hazardous and contained dangerous e-coli bacteria.' 'This man  has been involved in 32 incidents and is a persistent and troublesome offender.' CRASBOs are Anti-Social Behaviours Orders that are made on the back of criminal conviction. The individual subject of the CRASBO will have a set of prohibitions unique to the case to prevent anti-social behaviour re-occurring and protect the Community from such acts. They can be used to ban someone from entering a defined area and certain buildings or shopping centres. CRASBOs can also ban an individual associating with certain people and can impose a curfew. The maximum penalty for breaching the order is five years imprisonment. 'We are working with the police and will apply to the courts for a CRASBO against Mr Stewart forbidding him from selling anything in Blackpool.' Martin Hillson, defending, said he would be objecting to the CRASBO because it would even ban his client from selling The Big Issue magazine. He said: 'It is a blanket ban in a set geographical area.' At an earlier hearing Mr Hillson said that Stewart carried out the alcohol scam because he needed money for food. Sentencing Stewart to the 70 days magistrates told him: 'You are a danger to public health.' The court heard how Stewart used Smirnoff vodka and Jack Daniels bottles which he managed to re seal to dupe the public into thinking they were buying the real thing.","Nicholas Stewart, 35, was caught selling fake bottles of Jack Daniel's whisky and Smirnoff vodka for £10 each .

"David Caquais, 43, jumped to his death from his fourth floor Manhattan office . An accountant at a New York ad firm leaped to his death because he was hallucinating that the mannequins at his Manhattan office were chasing him, it was claimed today. David Caquais, 43, opened at window at Catch NY on the fourth floor of a building in Manhattan's Garment District and jumped out about 9pm on January 2. The New York Post reports that Mr Caquais screamed 'They're after me! They're after me!' as he ran around his office and attempted to kick out windows. The mannequins were in the office as part of a retail project that the company was doing. A worker at the hotel across the street told the newspaper he saw Mr Caquais in his office frantically trying to kick and punch out the windows of his office. 'He’s yelling all kinds of things. He goes to a fourth window, and that’s when he gets enough room to get his body through and he jumps,' the worker said. Mr Caquais' co-worker told police that the father-of-three from Staten Island had smoked PHP prior to his suicide and one of his bosses said he had a history of drug use, according to the Post. Though, a longtime neighbor  said he had never heard of Mr Caquais taking drugs. Mr Caquais' bosses said he they had seen him acting strangely at least once between in his two years at the company. His co-workers told the Post he was a 'sweet, lovable guy' and described him as 'an office favorite.'

"Cow's urine may soon be used to clean the floors of India's government offices in a country where the animals are considered sacred and their bodily waste therapeutic and even thirst-quenching. A charity working to care for the cows that freely roam India's streets has developed a cleaning product from their urine. The product, which has been distilled and scented, is the latest in a long line of items made from bovine bodily waste. Other products range from soap to urine-based medicines and even a soft drink. Scroll down for video . Breakthrough: A charity working to care for and protect the cows that freely roam India's streets (New Delhi above) has developed a cleaning product with their urine . 'Initially when we tried the product, it had too strong a smell. Nobody would have used it. So we have distilled the urine now and added natural ingredients like pine oil to cover the smell,' said Anuradha Modi from the Holy Cow Foundation. Ms Modi said she was working on a deal to get the company that supplies housekeeping items to government offices to use the product - which is called 'Gaunyle', with gau the Hindi word for cow. 'We have tested the product in labs and we can say that it is much better than the phenyl that you get in the market which is so full of chemicals,' she told AFP. 'We want to create a market for cow urine and I can say supply won't be a problem.' Method: The urine is distilled and spiked with natural perfumes to remove the pungent odour . Speaking to the Economic Times, she added: 'The product has been certified 'excellent' by labs in its pest-removing abilities.' While the sacred status of cows precludes India's huge Hindu majority from eating beef, their waste falls into the same acceptable category as dairy products. The cow, also known as 'Kamdhenu' - 'that which fulfils human needs' - is described in Hindu scriptures as the 'mother' of civilisation. Their revered status took on extra significance after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party won a landslide election victory in May last year. The party's election manifesto pledged to work to protect cows. On Friday the head of the company that supplies housekeeping products to government offices praised the urine cleaner. 'It is a great product for the health of safai karamcharis (cleaners) as well as for the cows,' Jagdish Bhatia said. Speaking to the Economic Times, he added: 'In 2004, the government employed experts from leading research institutes to find out more about the disinfectant qualities of cow waste but the study was terminated even before the team could reach conclusive results . 'However, from the preliminary studies, we understood that cow urine can be a good alternative to phenyl if mixed with the right components of other herbal extracts and scientifically treated.' Meanwhile, a growing cult of Hindu worshippers in India claim that drinking fresh cow urine will help cure them of all diseases - including cancer. The believers regard the cow as a holy animal and say her urine has divine healing properties. In the north Indian city of Agra, a growing cult of Hindu worshippers in India claim that drinking fresh cow urine will help cure them of all diseases - including cancer . Many say the recent increase in the number of people drinking cow urine can be attributed to campaigns run by spiritual leaders. Followers claim that cow's urine can successfully be used to combat cancer, diabetes, tumours, tuberculosis, stomach problems and much more. They also claim that drinking cow pee is the only effective solution for treating baldness.","A charity is developing cleaning products made from cow's urine .

"British taxpayers may have to pay more money to Brussels to cover the rising cost of pensions for EU civil servants and MEPs. This year the pension bill for EU officials jumped by more than seven per cent to £1.3 billion. Growing costs mean the EU now has a £36 billion pension time bomb, with Britain expected to pay a £4 billion share. Scroll down for video . The European Parliament in Brussels - British taxpayers may have to pay more money to cover the rising cost of pensions for EU civil servants and MEPs after the pension bill jumped by seven per cent to £1.3 billion . The pension bill for EU officials jumped more than seven per cent to £1.3billion this year. The EU’s total pension liabilities now stand at are £35.8 billion (€45.7bn), according to the latest figures for 2013. EU auditors have warned the cost of paying the pensions will be a major factor in pushing up British contributions to the Brussels budget. A British government spokesman said: ‘At a time when governments have taken significant actions to reduce the costs of their public sector, including commitments fundamental reviews of staff pension schemes, the EU institutions must reflect the very difficult decisions which are being made right across Europe.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) said: ‘The EU is a racket which looks after its own, the officials and MEPs. The quicker we leave it the cheaper it will be' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The EU is a racket which looks after its own, the officials and MEPs. The quicker we leave it the cheaper it will be.’ The average annual pension received by retired EU officials was over £40,000 in 2012. The highest ranking officials can pocket £85,000. According to figures from 2013, the average retirement age for EU officials was 61. Much of the soaring EU pensions bill is due to the increasing cost of paying for retired MEPs. A scheme created by the European Parliament in 2009, which is currently worth £13,760 for each five year time served as MEP, is 100 per cent taxpayer-funded, with MEPs making no contributions. EU auditors have said that a ceiling capping payments at a maximum of £809 billion billion between 2014 and 2020 may not be enough to pay EU bills, including the pensions. They have warned that this could lead to extra contributions from taxpayers across Europe. If the EU spends right up to the payment ceiling, which now seems likely, British contributions to the EU would rise to £13billion a year over the next six years – a significant rise on the previous £11.3billion record high paid last year. Britain already faces an extra £474million bill over the next two years after MEPs earlier this month voted through additional spending that will cost the Treasury £379million this year and £95m next year. These demands are over and above the £1.7billion surcharge Britain faces because of its better economic performance compared to the rest of Europe.","British taxpayers may pay more to EU to cover rising cost of pensions .

"Chelsea have never been bigger or more glamorous. They have Jose Mourinho, a fast-expanding global fanbase and a multi-national squad of elite footballers. Then again, the club at the foot of the Kings Road in London has always enjoyed a sprinkle of stardust. Take the day 43 years ago when during a game against Leicester City, screen siren Raquel Welch stood on the touchline trying to attract the attention of Chelsea’s star striker Peter Osgood. Raquel Welch shouts from the Stamford Bridge terraces, accompanied by Jimmy Hill . Welch cheers on the Chelsea team from the touchline during the match against Leicester City . Welch wears a Chelsea kit donning Osgood's number nine while on set for the film 'Hannie Caulder' Welch yelled at former Chelsea striker Peter Osgood from the touchline during the game . Welch poses for her iconic role in the film 'One Million Years BC' in which the actress played a cavegirl . It was a surreal sight even by the standards of the Seventies. Welch, chaperoned by none other than Jimmy Hill, emerged from under a brolly dressed in an immaculate flared trouser suit and a pair of high-heeled platform shoes to start shouting at Osgood. Former Chelsea player John Hollins takes up the story: ‘I don’t remember the game at all. I couldn’t tell you who we were playing or what the score was. I don’t think anyone was interested after that. ‘I do remember she was very tall and beautiful and wearing tight trousers and all the lads were all looking, thinking: “How the hell did she get into those?” ‘She walked out with Jimmy Hill and she was waving and shouting to Ossie and he’s going: “Do me a favour, leave it out, I’m playing here”.’ Welch waves to fans as Hill protects her from the rain as he hold an umbrella over her head . Welch poses for a picture in full Chelsea kit as she stands on a football while on set . The Hollywood actress strikes the ball towards the camera on the film set in Arizona . In his autobiography, Osgood wrote: ‘She probably figured as I was standing there on the pitch doing nothing it was OK to interrupt. If I had been George Best I would have slipped her my number but then again if I was George Best she would have slipped me hers. ‘I don’t think she really understood football because when she left, the game had kicked off and she walked down the touchline next to the dog track to a cacophony of wolf-whistles and cries of “Get ‘em off!” Then the crowd joined in. ‘She saw me, waved and shouted to get my attention, “Wooeeee, Ossie, bye-bye Ossie”.’ Hollins is sure she didn’t visit the dressing room and she didn’t attend the ‘tea-room’ where many of the A-list celebrities would go for post-match refreshment and where, according to legend, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was once spotted among the likes of Michael Caine and Michael Crawford. Welch controls the ball as she is snapped with a holster and gun around her waist . Myth claims Welch was smitten with Osgood, but in reality it was a stunt set up by promoter Greg Tesser . Popular myth claims the American actress was smitten by Osgood, but the reality is it was a stunt dreamed up by promoter Greg Tesser and celebrity photographer and Chelsea fan Terry O’Neill. Tesser, who died last month after an illness, promoted the Yardbirds and Georgie Fame before he became involved in football as an agent for Osgood and QPR’s Rodney Marsh. On the Kings Road scene, he became friends with O’Neill, who produced some of the most famous pop images from the era, including the pictures of Raquel Welch in Chelsea kit, taken in Arizona, also in 1972. ‘We were shooting in the middle of the desert but I managed to convince Raquel to put on a Chelsea strip for a kickabout on the wild west set,’ says O’Neill. In his book Chelsea FC in the Swinging 60s: Football’s First Rock ‘n’ Roll Club, published in 2013, Tesser told how O’Neill had helped him boost Osgood’s showbiz profile by forging the connection with Welch during a shoot for an interview with The Times. After the Leicester match a young fan insists on getting Welch's autograph, but she refuses and Hill steps in . Osgood spent 10 seasons at Chelsea and scored more than 100 league goals for the club . ‘Terry told me Raquel was giving a major interview to a guy from The Times and thanks to his prodding she was going to say a few very complimentary things about Os,’ wrote Tesser. ‘Wow! This was better than I expected - sensational stuff. ‘The interview raised more than a few eyebrows. Her compliments were unique in the sense that never before had such an international movie star - and an American one at that - raved about an English football star.’ As the story gathered momentum, at O’Neill’s suggestion, Tesser approached Chelsea manager Dave Sexton about getting Welch along to a game. Welch enjoys a kickabout on set during filming for the Western in 1971, a year before going to Stamford Bridge . Welch wears the traditional skimpy shorts with Osgood's number nine on show . He described Sexton’s response as ‘positively Antarctic’ and yet, with the help of TV pundit Hill ‘who smoothed the way with the club’, he made it happen. Even compared with today when Samuel L Jackson and David Walliams turn up, this will go down as Chelsea’s real Hollywood period. There were impromptu visits from film stars Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood, usually accompanied by lifelong Chelsea fan and future club president Dickie Attenborough, and time spent hanging out in cafes after training with Tom Jones and Elton John, or ‘Little Reg from Ruislip’, as he was known to the players at the time. Hollins said: ‘A few of us would often go up to Mills Music in Soho in the afternoons, and Ron Harris would come in and go: “Get us a coffee Reg”. 'Then about three years later, Terry Venables is at one of his big dos when this guy comes over to say hello and Terry can’t recognise him because he’s turned into Elton John. His hair was blue or green or something.’ Osgood proves he was hit with the ladies as he is pictured with glamour model Jo Carey at Stamford Bridge . John Hollins (right) said players would hang out with music stars including Elton John and Tom Jones . When the Sixties were in full swing, players would begin preparation for games by meeting in Alexander’s on the Kings Road, which was run by fashion designer Mary Quant and her husband Alexander Plunkett Greene, beneath the basement of their first shop, Bazaar. The restaurant would attract star diners like Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier, Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy, and several of the Chelsea squad, especially on a Friday lunchtime. ‘We must have been one of the first teams to eat pasta ahead of the games,’ said Hollins. ‘We’d meet at Alexander’s and have pasta and thin, tender steaks soaked in olive oil.’ These days Chelsea have the finest food on offer to their players - but not many film stars shouting from the touchline.","Raquel Welch attended Chelsea's match against Leicester City in 1972 .

"This enormous smartphone could become the most secure commercially available device in the world, according to its designers. The BOSS Phone has been developed specifically for security and privacy, integrating Android Lollipop's operating system with software that ensures online anonymity. The $355 (£234) phone, which has a seven-inch display, routes all of its traffic through The Onion Router, the online network that allows anonymity. Scroll down for video . Designers of the Boss Phone (above) claim its operating system makes it one of the most secure in the world . It means that users can upload photographs and videos, use applications and send emails without fear of third parties being able to listen in. David Briggs, the San Diego-based entrepreneur behind the project to develop the phone, first came up with the idea after he tried but failed to upload a YouTube video while attending his brother's wedding in Turkey. Tor - short for The onion Router - is a  matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday . internet with complete anonymity. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online. Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer. The Tor network on the Deep Web hides the IP address and the activity of the user. Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a specific search. An Internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a majority is deep and therefore missed. Access to YouTube was blocked for two months after recordings that appeared to be of leaked conversations of Turkish officials discussing Syria appeared there. Mr Briggs said that he wanted to give people the freedom to use their smartphones without restrictions. The Onion Router, or Tor as it is also known, uses layers of encryption that can help to defend against traffic analysis. Mr Briggs, who had developed a prototype of his device and is now seeking support on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. He said: 'BOSS Phone is being manufactured with user privacy as a focus. 'The devices will be tested by Tor/Guardian project to determine that the included software is configured correctly. 'This special network and browser is used by everyday people, the military, journalists, law enforcement, activists, and anyone who wants absolutely secure communications and Internet browsing. 'As our mobile devices become more powerful and essential to our daily lives, they’re increasingly used for more valuable tasks, like banking and shopping, and are, therefore, growing exponentially more vulnerable to a wide variety of online predators. The Boss Phone, pictured above, has a seven-inch screen and allows the use of two SIM cards simultaniously . 'In order to protect yourself and your family from known and unknown threats, you need to be aware of the range of security risks and how to prevent them. 'This is exactly why we are using Android 5.0 Lollipop for its encryption capabilities and the Tor network for secure online communication. Both of these open source systems provide the most robust and easy-to-use security available globally.' However the use of TOR may be controversial as it is also exploited by criminals and paedophiles to help mask illegal online activities. The Onion Network software will allow users of the Boss Phone, above, to browse online without fear that their activities are being tracked, but it could mean that it will be ideal for those looking to hide illegal activities . Few people have more call for a secure mobile phone than the leaders of countriEs. Barack Obama uses a specially modified BlackBerry that was adapted by the US National Security Agency to enhance its encryption. The US President recently said that he was not allowed to have an iPhone for 'security reasons', suggesting Apple's device is not considered secure. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, apparently has two phones that she uses regularly - a Nokia 6260 Slide that she uses for party matters and a BlackBerry Z10 for state affairs. The BlackBerry was modified by Dusseldorf-based security company Secusmart, who have fitted it with an encryption chip. French President Francois Hollande uses an iPhone 5 for personal use, but has been given an ultra-secure Teorem phone with encryption as head of state. Vladimir Putin, however, is famous for claiming not to own a mobile phone - possibly as a result of his time spent as a KGB spy. It houses what is known as the dark net, or deep web, a hidden subsection of the internet that does not show up on searches and is used to share hacked information and trade in drugs and illegal goods. Recently David Cameron announced a joint special unit from the government spy organisation GCHQ and the National Crime Agency would use the latest technology to hunt down paedophiles who have been using the dark net to share abusive pictures. Use of The Onion Router may not also guarantee users from having their information hacked as there have been a number of experts who have demonstrated weaknesses in the software. However, the Boss Phone also comes with additional features, including the ability to use two seperate SIM cards, allowing users to switch between different numbers with different carriers. Mr Biggs claims the phone will have a battery life of more than 20 hours and its large screen - at seven inches it will be one of the largest phones on the market - should be attractive to those who find small smartphone screens impractical. He hopes to begin selling commercial models of the Boss Phone by October this year. He said: 'Lets face it the tiny screens on smartphones are impractical. 'They are useless for almost everything except texting and calling. And even then, if you have big fingers you are in trouble. With the Boss you are not limited by size.' The Boss Phone's seven inch screen may make it rather impractical to hold while making phone calls (above)","Designer David Briggs, from  California, decided to build a prototype after internet restrictions in Turkey prevented him from uploading videos .

"Found: A body found washed up on a beach in 1995 has been identified as 17-year-old Cengiz Nuray . A body that washed up on a California beach nearly two decades ago has finally been identified as a missing Grateful Dead fan who vanished while following the band. The decomposed remains were identified as belonging to Cengiz Nuray, 17, after the Pacific Grove police and the coroner's office sent its DNA  to a state laboratory. It matched Nuray's profile on the FBI's DNA index system. The teenager had last been seen at Greyhound Rock Beach in Santa Cruz on April 24, 1995. He told friends he was going for a walk and left his belongings behind but never returned. The group had been following the Grateful Dead at the time, the Monterey Herald reported. His mother, who lived in Santa Barbara at the time, filed a missing persons report. Nuray was considered a runaway and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children produced an image for what he might look like now, aged 37. But a few months after the missing person report was filed, a badly decomposed body was found down the coast near Asilomar Beach in Monterey Bay. The remains, which were found around 35 miles from where Nuray was last seen, were known as a 'John Doe' because they were so badly decomposed. Scene: The body washed up on Greyhound Rock Beach in Santa Cruz, California (pictured) a few months after his mother filed a missing person's report. Its DNA was matched to the FBI system last month . Although tests in the 90s had failed to produce a match, his DNA was sent to be tested again last year and, thanks to advances in technology, it made a match on the FBI's database. It is not clear how he ended up in the water. His family has been notified. 'After almost 20 years, the family will finally have closure and 'John Doe' will be laid to rest,' Pacific Grove police said in a statement.

"Saturn and its moons may be nearly a billion miles away, but scientists now say they can pinpoint their location to within just two miles (4 km). The discovery was made using ten antennae spread over an area from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands. The calculation improves astronomers' knowledge of Saturn's orbit and could allow Nasa to better navigate its probes through space. Scroll down for video . Saturn and its moons may be nearly a billion miles away, but scientists now say they can pinpoint their location to within just two miles (4 km) after using data from the Very Long Baseline Array and the Cassini probe . Known as the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), the antenna assembly used signals sent by the Cassini probe to exactly monitor the position of the gas giant. They combined this data with information about Cassini's orbit from Nasa's Deep Space Network. The combined observations allowed the scientists to make the most accurate determinations yet of the position of the centre of mass, or barycentre, of Saturn and its numerous moons. Nasa claims the measurement is some 50 times more precise than those provided by ground-based optical telescopes. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) antenna assembly used signals sent by the Cassini probe to exactly monitor the position of the gas giant. Pictured are the location of the ten sites . Nasa claims the measurement of Saturn and its moons using its new method is now some 50 times more precise than those provided by ground-based optical telescopes. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) is a system of ten radio-telescope antennas,each with a dish 82ft (25 metres) in diameter and weighing 240 tonnes. From Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii to St Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the VLBA spans more than 5,000 miles (8,000 km), providing astronomers with the sharpest vision of any telescope on Earth or in space. Dedicated in 1993, the VLBA has an ability to see fine detail equivalent to being able to stand in New York and read a newspaper in Los Angeles. Source: National Radio Astronomy Observatory . 'This work is a great step toward tying together our understanding of the orbits of the outer planets of our solar system and those of the inner planets,' said Dayton Jones of JPL, who led the study. The improved accuracy will help enhance precise navigation of interplanetary spacecraft and help refine measurements of the masses of solar system objects. It will also improve predictions of when Saturn or its rings will pass in front of background stars -- events that provide a variety of research opportunities for astronomers. Previously, the navigators performed their own estimates of the positions of Saturn and its satellites using data gleaned by tracking Cassini's radio signal during its communications with Earth. The new calculations, enhanced by VLBA data, are about 20 times more accurate. Professor Jones and colleagues plan to continue the joint observations with Cassini and the VLBA through the end of Cassini's mission in late 2017. The team will also use similar techniques to observe the motion of Nasa's Juno spacecraft when it reaches Jupiter in mid-2016. The findings were reported at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle.

"These stunning images show RAF Typhoons circling over the Grand Canyon en-route to Nevada to participate in Red Flag, the largest and most complex air war-fighting exercise in the world. With echoes of the elite flying squad in 'Top Gun', the classic film starring Tom Cruise, the RAF will take part in a series of combat missions with other coalition forces to prepare them for war. Red Flag was established in 1975 to provide realistic combat training through integrated war fighting. It was set up in the wake of the Vietnam War where one US aircraft was being lost for every two enemy aircraft. Typhoon FGR4's from 1 (Fighter) Squadron based at RAF Lossiemouth, fly over the Grand Canyon en-route to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada . The RAF will take part in the Red Flag Exercise in a series of combat missions with other coalition forces to prepare them for war . Following the end of the war, it was decided that readying pilots for real-life combat would improve their chances of survival. In what is viewed as the most technologically advanced combat training exercise in the world, two teams made up of the 'Blue Forces' (friendly) against the 'Red Forces' (hostile) simulate real-life air-to-air and air-to-ground warfare at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and Alaska's Eielson Air Force Base. The integration - which is made up of 31 different air forces - helps each force learn about other countries' capabilities and how to work effectively with them in war conditions. Colonel Tod Fingal, Commander of Red Flag, said: 'We bring all types of forces here both from within US forces, so army, navy and marine corps, but also our coalition partners, because when you bring all of us together and train in that contested environment it gives us the opportunity, if called upon, to achieve war-fighting excellence.' For the RAF Typhoons FGR4's, even the 6,000 mile journey to reach Nevada is a complex process. Known as a 'trail', it is possible only with meticulous planning. Each plane will be refuelled in the air 13 times from a Voyager aircraft as they follow a route over the Azores, Bermuda and the east coast of the USA. An RAF spokesman said: 'We start planning the trail four weeks in advance and while we've been conducting trails for many years each one is different. 'When we get tasked we plan the route and determine where each air-air refuelling will take place. This then gives us the information we require to obtain diplomatic clearances and to book airspace. 'When trailing fast jets over long distances we need to remain within 90 minutes of a diversion airfield lest we have any problem with one of the aircraft. 'We also have to factor in the sea temperature to ensure that in the unlikely event of a pilot having to eject that they are able to survive in the water for as long as possible.'

"The eight children who were killed in the alleged Cairns stabbing massacre have been remembered  in a public funeral service attended by more than 5000 members of the local community. Eight white caskets were laid out in a row in the Cairns Convention Centre, each topped with red roses - the smallest a little over a metre long. Nearly 1000 family members of the fours boys and four girls, aged two to 14, attended the Christian service in remembrance of the children who were found dead in their Manoora home. Scroll down for video . The funeral for the eight children killed in the alleged Cairns stabbing massacre will be held on Saturday . The last to arrive were Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and local Cairns MP Gavin King. Mr Abbott laid a wreath of red flowers at the front of the stage and stood for a minute of silence, followed by Mr Newman and his wife. Many of the mourners wore red, out of respect to the family members at the service. Mourners sang 'Amazing Grace' as students from the four schools the children attended laid flowers and candles at the front of the stage. In the front row, nine women wailed, supporting each other and unable to stand as young children in the audience cried and held their parents' hands. The service leader introduced the children's 'favourite song', and announced it had been sung 'over and over again' in the months leading up to their death. The service was followed by a large procession of around 50 vehicles, including the eight hearses . The procession ended at Martyn Street cemetery, with a guard of honour formed by South Sea Island descendants during the graveside ceremony . The procession made its way through the city under police escort . A slideshow was played showing photos of the children, and eulogies spoke of children that had loved song and dance, playing outside together, and time with their family. One of the four pastors leading the service labelled the incident a crime, and said that there had been 'cries and no one had heard'. 'I'm sure there was a standing ovation when they were greeted in heaven. We put eight babies to rest today,' the pastor said. 'They go before us and they shouldn't be going before us,' he said. Outside the auditorium, a simple cultural tribute was made, with eight apples strung with rope and frangipani flowers, while inside floral tributes were laid. The Islander term 'Keriba Omasker' has been attached to the memorial, a phrase which means 'our children' in the Erub dialect of the children. The service was followed by a large procession of around 50 vehicles, including the eight hearses, which made its way through the city under police escort. Friends and family members filed into the Cairns Convention Centre for the funeral of the eight children . The service was a 'Keriba Omasker' memorial, a term which means 'our children' Thousands of people from the far north Queensland community have filed into the Cairns Convention Centre . 36 pallbearers represented the affected families, carrying the children during their final journey- a route which passed by the end of  Murray Street, so that any families who were unable to attend were able to pay their respects. The procession ended at  Martyn Street cemetery, with a guard of honour formed by South Sea Island descendants during the graveside ceremony. The eight children were buried in an arch formation, instead of side by side, to represent a sunrise. White sand was placed at the top of each of the graves, which were each topped with a white cross and a plaque with the children's name, age and a symbol of a sunrise. The inspiration came from a photo that was taken by Gavin Willie, the father of the four youngest children, the day after they were killed. A guitar played and a song in their native language was sung as the children were lowered into the ground. The eldest, Angelina Thaiday and her cousin Malili Warria on the outside, and the youngest six on the inside - 2 year old Patronella, known as 'baby girl', her tiny grave little more than a metre long. The father of the youngest children, Gavin Willie, knelt at the graves of each of his children with his hands lightly touching the sand, crying as loved ones putting their hands on his shoulders. The two surviving children of accused killer Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday stood at the foot of their siblings graves holding each other's hands. Lewis and Norena Warria wore black and red and cried silently as people took turns placing flowers, windmills, wreaths and teddy bears in the sand. The deceased children's grandmother wailed at a chair nearby, loved ones mopping at her head and fanning her in the heat. The service was expected to run for two hours before a procession travels through the city centre . The procession will end at Martyn Street cemetery, and a guard of honour will be formed by South Sea Island descendants during the graveside ceremony . An aunt of the deceased children said that the children's grandfather, who had been acting as a spokesperson for the family, was 'numb'. 'He's so overwhelmed, he hasn't said a word. He doesn't know what to do, none of us do,' she said. Most of the mourners were dressed in red, although many wore floral shirts, school shirts or rugby jerseys to pay tribute to the 'bright, playful' children. Paramedics were on hand as 20 people were treated for heat exhaustion in the stifling Cairns heat. A young girl, a friend of three of the children, collapsed at the burial, with water poured over her head as she lay on the pavement. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Saturday that his appearance at the funeral was out of solidarity with the people of Cairns and those affected by the violence. 'It's just a horrible business,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday. 'We know that sometimes people break. We also know there are difficult circumstances people deal with,' he said. 'This is a social issue as well as a law enforcement issue, but I'll be there in solidarity with them.' A collection of flowers, cards, and soft toys remain in memorial to the children in a park next to their Murray Street home . On the day of the funeral, tributes laid at a temporary memorial shrine matched the flowers at the funeral . The children were found dead in their home on Murray Street on December 19, sparking widespread scenes of grief and shock from the close-knit community . Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, mother of seven of the deceased children, has been formally charged with eight counts of murder over the act. She is due to face court later in the month. The pentecostal service involved elements of Torres Strait Islander culture and has been described by family members as one that will depict the personalities of the children. Cairns Mayor Bob Manning said that the community had handled the cultural protocols well, as the families at the centre of the tragedy grappled with laying their loved ones to rest. Relatives of the children said that the funeral would another step in the grieving process, and appealed for sensitivity during the period of mourning. 'The community has certainly felt very strongly for these people,' Mr Manning said. 'I think there's been a wonderful outpouring of support by the wider community to the families that have been affected and indeed the Torres Strait Island community.' 'I believe that will then be another outpouring of grief,' Mr Manning said. 'It's always very hard to go to funerals and ... so what really will count then is how we support the people in the period after the funeral (on Saturday).' The wider Cairns community has also pulled together, deputy mayor Terry James says. 'We’re talking about children, and you think if it was your own children, and it just brings a tear to your eye,' Mr James said. Family members gathered to mourn outside the Murray Street house where the children were found dead . Residents say that they are more likely to report disturbances rather than ignore them in light of the tragedy . Tributes were laid outside the Murray Street house where the children were killed in the days after their deaths . 'Really we’ve got to repair the community after such a sad event.' A collection of flowers, cards, and soft toys remain in memorial to the children in a park next to their Murray Street home, as residents say that they are more likely to report disturbances rather than ignore them in light of the tragedy. The Cairns house in which the children were killed will be demolished and replaced with a permanent memorial. Member of Parliament Gavin King said the fate of the public housing home at 34 Murray Street, Manoora was decided upon by family representatives, locals, pastors and elders from the Torres Strait Island community. 'It's the right thing to do going forward to help with the grieving process,' Mr King said. The house where the children were found dead remains barricaded .

"The cartoonist behind the legendary French comic strip Asterix has come out of retirement to pay tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack. Albert Uderzo released two new drawings in solidarity with the cartoonists killed on Wednesday, which he shared on the official Asterix Twitter account. One shows Asterix declare: 'Moi aussi je suis un Charlie' - which translates to 'I too am a Charlie'. Scroll down for video . Albert Uderzo's tribute shows Asterix declare: 'Moi aussi je suis un Charlie' - 'I too am a Charlie' The other sketch shows main characters Asterix and Obelix bowing their heads in grief with their hats in their hands. Asterix holds a rose in one hand, and their pet Dogmatix looks back over his shoulder with sadness. The 87-year-old cartoonist told Le Figaro: 'Charlie [Hebdo] and Asterix have nothing to do with each other obviously. 'I simply want to express my affection for those designers who have paid with their lives.' 'Young designers are on hand now and I wish them courage. They keep in mind this terrible thing came to their colleagues that no one could expect.' The cartoonist brought back the characters he co-created and drew an image of Asterix and Obelix bowing their heads in grief . Albert Uderzo told Le Figaro: 'I simply want to express my affection for those designers who have paid with their lives' French media reported that 'At the age of 87, Uderzo takes his pen for #CharlieHebdo' on Twitter . He also expressed his anger at the attack, adding: 'How can you do such appalling actions? How can people who say humans can they kill people they do not know.' Since the attack, cartoonists across the world have flooded the internet with powerful drawings in defiance of the armed gunmen who attempted to silence the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Using the hashtag #jesuischarlie, meaning I am Charlie in French, artists shared their own powerful and often satirical sketches to advocate for free press, denounce violence and mourn their innocent colleagues from the French publication. Tonight, 'Paris est Charlie' (Paris is Charlie) was projected onto the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, in tribute to the victims. Elsewhere, people paid their respects by holding banners reading 'Je suis Charlie' and observed a minute's silence in remembrance. In Cannes, a giant banner saying 'Je suis Charlie' was displayed over the Palais des Festivals facade and people were pictured holding signs with the same message outside.

"The parents of a 19-year-old South Carolina college student who died in September under mysterious circumstances took to social media this week to warn other families about the danger of fraternities. The body of Clemson University freshman Tucker Hipps was found submerged in the Seneca River September 22, hours after his brothers at the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity reported him missing. It is believed the pledge class president fell off a 20ft bridge into the water during a pre-dawn run and died after hitting his head on rocks. Cautionary tale: Gary and Cindy Hipps, the parents of 19-year-old Clemson University freshman Tucker Hipps who died in a fall from a bridge in September, posted this message on Facebook warning families about fraternities . Seeking the truth: His parents, Gary and Cindy Hipps, have been searching for answers about their son's untimely passing . Tucker (pictured) was last seen on a pre-dawn run with his fraternity brothers the morning of September 22. Brothers say he started to fall behind, but that they didn't notice him missing until he failed to show up for breakfast . His parents, Gary and Cindy Hipps, have been searching for answers about their son's untimely passing, which they suspect may have been related to hazing. On Wednesday, Fox Carolina reported the parents took to Facebook, sharing a powerful image depicting Cindy and Gary standing next to a large white cross bearing their late son's name. The picture was accompanied by the following message: 'A warning to parents of college students who want to pledge a fraternity. Everyone please feel free to share.' As of Friday morning, the heart-rending photo has been shared 760 times. Speaking to GreenvilleOnline.com just before Christmas, Cindy Hipps said they are still ‘actively pursuing the truth’ in their son's case. The parents explained that they have not heard anything from their son's fraternity or the university in about a month. A day before Tucker's parents posted the message on Facebook, Oconee County Sheriff Mike Crenshaw told The State that tips were continuing to come in about the events surrounding the freshman’s death, and that investigators were still working the case in hopes of bringing closure to Tucker’s family. While the sheriff' was short on details, he did say traditions of Sigma Phi Epsilon’s runs across the Lake Hartwell bridge were part of the ongoing probe. The Sheriff's Office also was analyzing data obtained from cell phones, laptops and social media. Cindy (left) and Gary Hipps (right) lost their only-son Tucker this past September. The 19-year-old Clemson University student's body was found submerged in Seneca Lake hours after participating in a fraternity activity . In November, Mr and Mrs Hipps gave an emotional interview accusing their late son's fraternity brothers of withholding information about that fateful night in September. 'That's a horrible thing to hold inside, it's going to affect you for life,' Mrs Hipps told Fox Carolina. 'It's going to affect all of your relationships. It's going to affect your school, it will affect how you deal with things. It might not feel so bad right now, but as time goes on it gets worse and worse. Truth, the power of truth sets you free.' The incident is still under investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and Oconee County Sheriff's Office. They are not speaking about the case until their final report is published, with will include toxicology results. Tucker's death is even more tragic considering his parents warned him against joining a fraternity, preferring he spend his time in college focusing on his studies. But they relented since he was a social young man and students in Greek Life organization do, on average, maintain higher grade-point averages. Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities. It's unclear if that's suspension is still in place . Tucker apparently fell from this bridge into the waters of the Senca River. Police are still investigating the incident, and will not be commenting on the case until they release their full report, including toxicology reports . The Hipps also hope their son's death will help bring change to the fraternity pledging process. Tucker pictured above with an unidentified young woman on the left . 'I told him I'm not going to say you can't do it but I am not going to pay for it,' Mr Hipps told WSPA. Just four days before he died, Tucker's parents had dinner with him, and they saw that the pledging process noticeably taking a toll. 'I can tell you that last time I saw him he was both tired and worn out he looked like he hadn't had much sleep,' his dad said. 'It was hard and I asked him I said are you feeling okay are you doing alright?' Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities for two weeks. Last month, the university put together a task force to address drunkenness and hazing at fraternities and sororities. 'There seems to be something systemically wrong with the pledging process, and how kids are put through the things they are put through,' Mr Hipps said, adding that he is not 'making any friends'  in the Greek community as he searches for answers in his son's death.","Tucker Hipps, 19, was found dead in a South Carolina lake in September after going missing on a pre-dawn run with his Sigma Phi Epsilon brothers .

"A plane flying from  New York to London Heathrow hit near supersonic speeds yesterday after getting caught up in a powerhouse jet stream. British Airways Flight 114, a Boeing 777-200 jet, took off from JFK at 10.50pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), and landed at 9.06am local time at London Heathrow. The total flight time was five hours and 16 minutes, well short of the estimated minimum six-hour journey. Scroll down for video . A British Airways flight from New York to London Heathrow took only five hours and 16 minutes due to flying through a powerhouse jet stream (File Photo) The difference in temperature between the Equator and the North Pole means pressure and winds are greater thus reducing flight times between the US and the UK (jet stream in purple) By comparing the flight path here to the graph above, you can see the plane was bang in the jet stream . What's more, the flight was reported to have flown at speeds of 745mph relative to ground speed. The speed of sound at sea level is 761mph. Several flights are reported to have made the journey from New York to London yesterday in around five hours 20 minutes due to the 200mph North Atlantic jet stream. How the stats measure up for the supersonic flying BA jet from New York to London Heathrow . The conditions around the North Atlantic have meant the US have been feeling the effects of a polar vortex . Passengers leaving JFK heading to London yesterday were treated to a reduction in flight duration . It is not unexpected for the jet stream to intensify during the winter months, with flight times in January and February between the US and the UK shortening in duration. The temperature contrast between the equator and the North Pole is at its greatest during these months, and as well as leading to polar-vortex related climate experienced by the US currently, air pressure and wind increases. Sadly, however, the strength of the jet stream is heavily weighted in one direction; that is to say flights heading to the US from Europe will see an increase in duration. The heavier green points on the Earth signify the powerful jet stream across the Atlantic . The Atlantic jet stream route was taken advantage of by the Concorde, when in 1996 it hit a top speed of 1,350mph and took just two hours and 53 minutes from New York to London . Often this is because pilots are forced to fly closer to Greenland to escape powerful headwinds, as oppose to the direct route over the Atlantic. Despite the Boeing 777-200 jet reaching a top speed of 745mph, it doesn't come close to matching the top speed of the Concorde on the same flight path. Back in 1996, a New York to London flight took just two hours, 53 minutes, and hit top speeds of 1,350mph.","Boeing 777-200 hit top speed of 745mph on New York to Heathrow route .

"Around 40 pupils were sent home on the first day back to school after the Christmas break for not wearing the correct uniform - including one boy who was wearing the wrong colour socks. Dozens of children were refused entry to Strood Academy, Kent, on Monday for not complying with the school's strict uniform policy. Furious parents said teachers turned children away at the gate for wearing the wrong kind of trousers, blazer and even socks. Around 40 pupils were sent home on the first day back at Strood Academy, Kent, for wearing the wrong uniform . Harri Scott, a 12-year-old girl with autism, was turned away because her black, tailored trousers were 'wrong', her mother said. 'Being singled out and turned away made her really upset,' mother Jackie Winter told KentOnline. 'Harri has worn those same trousers for two terms now, and suddenly the school said they were inappropriate, but they haven't said why. 'They even left it up to the children to ring home and to make their own way back. As far as I'm concerned when my child is at school she is under their duty of care and it is their responsibility to make sure she is safe, not let her off school grounds to walk home on her own, without even knowing for sure if I'd been contacted. What if something had happened to her?' Other parents, including Ashley Hitch, 33, who works at Medway Maritime Hospital, reported having to leave work to pick up their children and sort out the problem. Girls: Academy blazer with badge . Black or skin-toned plain tights or black socks . Black shoes (no sandals, boots, trainers or open heels) Optional academy black V-neck jumper with logo . Black, pleated skirt no higher than just above the knee or tailored trousers or pinstriped blouse . Boys: Academy blazer with badge . White shirt . Black shoes & laces (no trainers, trainer shoes or boots) Optional black V-neck jumper with logo . Academy tie . Black trousers . Furious parents said their children were told to go home for wearing the wrong kind of trousers, blazer and even socks . Miss Hitch, whose daughter Chelsie, 13, was pulled up for wearing 'too skinny' trousers, said: 'The teachers were standing outside the gates with clipboards turning pupils away. It was like a power trip. 'They obviously don't have enough to do. They are teaching pupils about appearance rather than actually educating them.' Headmistress Kim Gunn said she would make no excuses for her school's 'high standards' Meanwhile parent Laura Hopwood said her friend's son was sent home for wearing navy socks instead of black ones. The academy's uniform policy states that girls must wear the academy blazer with the school's badge, as well as a skirt which should sit no higher than just above the knee. Girls can also choose to wear black, tailored trousers or a pinstriped blouse with black or skin-toned tights or black socks. Meanwhile boys must wear the blazer, a white shirt and the academy's tie. They must wear black trousers and both boys and girls should wear black shoes. Strood Academy headmistress Kim Gunn said: 'Strood Academy make no excuses for having high standards for their students, including uniform. 'Unfortunately, a very small number of students have persistently challenged the uniform expectations despite numerous reminders and conversations with families . 'Four letters, a newsletter item and a website notification were sent to parents asking them to ensure that students were in correct uniform or they would be sent home to rectify the uniform issue. 'Pupils who informed staff that they were unable to safely make their way home were kept in school.' Pupils and parents around the country have found themselves the victims of stricter uniform rules being imposed in Britain's classrooms this school year. Around 100 students were sent home just minutes after arriving for the first day of term in September when staff at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, told them their footwear was not 'black, leather shoes' and was 'inappropriate'. Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good. 'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing? 'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.' Tyler Hawkins (left) was made to colour-in his shoes with marker, while (right picture, left to right) Jaydee Hart, 13, Chloe Gregory, 14, and Amelia Wileman, 13, were told their uniforms were 'too tight' Kicked out: Mason Beaumont, 14, pictured with his mother Lindsay Stansfield, was sent home from Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire when staff branded his black leather shoes 'trainers' A few days later, 15-year-old Tyler Hawkins was told to 'colour in' the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes with a black marker pen at Newquay's Tretherras School. His mother, Gemma, said: 'Uniforms cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get any help. 'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and making him buy an orange pair.' In October, parents of pupils at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire claimed their teenage daughters have been left in tears after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight. They said their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform. Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight. She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands. She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her. In November, Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire sent home 215 pupils over two days after strictly enforcing a new dress code. Several students reported being turned away at the gates for minor infringements such as wearing a winter coat and not displaying their school ID on a lanyard. A majority of student were sent home for wearing the wrong footwear, Hanson Academy business manager Sarah Roberts said. Mason Beaumont, 14, was turned away for wearing black leather Magnum made footwear because staff branded them trainers.","Strood Academy, Kent, sent home 40 pupils for wrong uniform on Monday .

"Likely Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee takes a swipe at Jay Z and Beyonce in his new book, calling out the hip-hop duo for their on-stage sexual gyrations and explicit lyrics, and slams the Obamas for their close relationship with the A-list couple. 'How can it be that the Obamas let Sasha and Malia listen to that trash?' the onetime Arkansas governor-turned-Fox News host asks. 'Apparently they do.' 'Beyonce is incredibly talented – gifted, in fact,' the former Baptist minister  writes. 'She has an exceptional set of pipes and can actually sing. She is a terrific dancer – without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom.' But that's where the love-fest ends in the book 'God, Guns, Grits and Gravy.' 'Jay Z is a very shrewd businessman,' Huckabee adds, 'but I wonder: Does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is ginning up interest in a second presidential campaign with a new book that throws elbows at pop-culture icons while positioning himself as a preacher from 'flyover country' Huckabee slammed the diva for her performance of 'Drunk in Love' at the 2014 Grammy Awards (pictured), saying that she had 'agreed to humiliate herself' with a show that one author referred to as 'foreplay' The book hits shelves on January 20 and is seen as a vehicle for Huckabee to take a second bite at the presidential campaign apple in 2016. He last ran in 2008, winning the Iowa caucuses and five Super Tuesday primaries before conceding the Republican nomination to Arizona Sen. John McCain. Huckabee's weekend Fox News show has positioned him as a conservative culture warrior who may find it difficult to attract an audience in an increasingly secular America. And nowhere in his book is the culture war between the coasts and 'flyover country' more present than in his backhand dismissals of Jay Z and Beyonce. The music video for 'Drunk in Love,' the song Huckabee criticizes in his book, includes explicit lyrics and images of a sultry Beyonce strutting on a beach . 'FROM HUSBAND TO PIMP': Jay Z makes an appearance in the 'Drunk in Love' video, rapping 'Slip the panties right to the side / Ain't got the time to take drawers off' as his wife dances seductively . The pair headlined the 2014 Grammy Awards, opening the broadcast with a performance of their hit 'Drunk in Love.' Huckabee calls it a 'song' – air quotes included. 'Beyonce must have been confused,' he writes, 'when she agreed to humiliate herself by performing in a way that prompted this comment from author Charlotte Hays (whose book When Did 'White Trash Become the New Normal?' says it all): ""Honestly, I didn't want to watch Jay Z and Beyonce's foreplay"".' Huckabee's latest culture-war book hits shelves on January 20 . 'The song contains words and imagery so graphic that they would never make it through the editing process of this book. (Not that I would want them to!) But the onstage gyrations, bare flesh, and (most of) the lyrics did make it onto CBS, again during the smoldering remnants of what used to be the ""family hour"".' Beyonce's rap lyrics in 'Drunk in Love' include 'I get filthy when that liquor get into me.' Her husband enters the song halfway through, intoning about 'foreplay in the foyer / f***ed up my Warhol.' 'Slip the panties right to the side,' Jay Z continues in the wildly popular track. 'Ain't got the time to take drawers off.' The song's video has been played a stunning 245 million times on YouTube, treating viewers to repeated shots of Beyonce gyrating in a swimsuit and swapping lines with Jay Z about their sex life. Beyonce, Huckabee reflects, 'was a huge, breakout star before going X-rated. She proved she doesn't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar.' 'She must know that millions of young girls look up to her as a role model to emulate. And she even has a daughter herself now. So why has she done this?' First lady Michelle Obama is a close Beyonce friend, taking Sasha, her younger daughter, to a concert in July. The singer serenaded the first couple as they danced at their first inaugural ball, and performed America's national anthem at President Barack Obama's second inauguration. She later admitted she had lip-synched the patriotic song. 'THAT TRASH': Beyonce performed onstage at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum in Inglewood, California . FOrmer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was a force to be reckoned with in 2008, winning the Iowa Caucuses and five Super Tuesday primaries before conceding the GOP presidential nomination to Sen. John McCain . But Beyonce has been to the White House numerous times with Jay Z and remains close to the Obamas. She was the star attraction at the first lady's 50th birthday party a year ago, and the A-listers hosted a fundraiser for the president in 2012. In a December 2013 People Magazine interview, the president said that both of his daughters have 'gotten to know Beyonce, and she has always been very sweet to them.' He told Glamour magazine in a softball 2012 interview that he and the first lady 'don't constrain' the music elder daughter Malia listens to. 'We expect her to show some good judgment.' 'We actually share tastes in hip-hop and rap music,' the president added, 'but we don’t listen to it together, because some of the language in there would embarrass me – at least while I’m listening to it with her.' 'Folks like Jay Z, Nas, we both like them, but when it comes on and I’m sitting with her and Sasha, then I fast-forward because it would make me blush.' Huckabee pounces. 'Oh. I see. The important thing is for him not to be embarrassed,' he snarks in the book. 'It's no small wonder why the culture has become so crude when fathers and mothers allow and even encourage their children to devour vulgar, misogynistic, and violent material when it's performed by ""cool"" people like Jay Z and Beyonce.' 'With the first lady so concerned about making sure her daughters' bellies don't ingest unhealthy food, how can she let their brains ingest obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics? If lived out, those lyrics would be far more devastating to someone's health than a cupcake.' RAP FAN? An image apparently showing Malia Obama, 16, wearing a t-shirt for hip hop collective Pro Era was shared on Instagram by the group, which claimed a 'mutual friend' gave them the image . SULTRY: Huckabee writes that Beyonce 'doesn't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar' Beyonce is close to the first family, performing at inaugurations and headlining Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party in January 2014 . Malia attracted attention this month when the hip-hop collective Pro Era posted a photo on Instagram in which she appeared to be wearing a $40 t-shirt emblazoned with their logo. The first daughter's picture was shared online just days after one of Pro Era's founding members was arrested for breaking a security guard's nose at a concert in Australia. The White House is investigating how the photo of the elder Obama daughter found its way to the group. Huckabee signed off from his eponymous Fox news show on January 3, announcing that it would be the last episode. He is expected to make a final decision about whether or not to join the presidential race in the coming months. His first stop will be in the state where he first cruised to victory eight years ago: Huckabee is scheduled to speak at the Iowa Freedom Summit on January 23. 'God, Guns, Grits and Gravy' also includes a chapter about the indignities of airport searches at the hands of the Transportation Security Administration – titled 'Bend Over and Take it Like a Prisoner!' 'Where else would I be ordered to stand still, put up my hands, and have my personal belongings taken and searched without a warrant or probable cause?' he asks, referring to his frequent commercial airline flights. 'After years of this indignity, much of the flying public thinks little of it, and they usually don't complain. They just dutifully stand there, bend over, and take it like a prisoner.'","Baptist-minister-turned Fox News host ended his weekly show on Jan. 3 and is expected to run for president .

"Pictures of the prosthetic arm fitted with a spork used by hook-handed British hate preacher Abu Hamza have been shown for the first time. Hamza, who was found guilty of terrorism and kidnapping by an American court in May, will be sentenced later today and could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Since he was extradited to the US in 2012, he has been detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York where he was provided with the prosthetic spork. The image of the spork-hand has been included by Hamza's lawyers as part of an argument he should serve his time in a prison medical facility. Scroll down for video . This picture of the prosthetic spork used by Abu Hamza in the detention center is part of an argument by his lawyers that he should serve his time in a prison medical facility - he will be sentenced later today . Hamza was convicted in May last year of aiding a deadly kidnapping of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and plotting to establish a jihadi training camp on an Oregon ranch in 1999 . They say his severe disabilities mean it would be wrong to send him to the high-security supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. His lawyer, Michael Bachrach, said: 'The accommodations that were ultimately provided to (Hamza) demonstrate the limitations in the ability of the MCC — or any standard, non-medical, (Bureau of Prisons) facility — to properly provide for (Hamza's) disabilities.' The Egyptian-born cleric famously demanded in 2013 a bidet be installed in his cell — a request that was not granted. Instead, the toilet in his cell was outfitted with a 'paddle' to help him more easily flush, according to documents. Hamza was also charged with supporting the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in part by making his London mosque in Finsbury Park a breeding ground for radical jihadists . Hamza, 56, whose full name is Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, will be sentenced by Judge Katherine Forrest at 10amEST (3pm UK time) today. It marks the final step in what was a 10-year legal saga to have Hamza extradited from the UK to face justice in the US. He was arrested by British police in 2004 at Washington's request and sentenced to seven years in jail in 2006 for inciting murder and racial hatred, before finally being extradited to the US in 2012. He was convicted last year of aiding a deadly kidnapping of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and plotting to establish a jihadi training camp on an Oregon ranch in 1999. Hamza was found guilty of providing the kidnappers with a satellite phone, acting as an intermediary and dispensing advice by telephone from home. Four of the tourists - three Britons and an Australian - were killed. He was also charged with supporting the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in part by making his London mosque in Finsbury Park a breeding ground for radical jihadists. His sermons were reportedly attended by 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe bomber Richard Reid. It has also emerged that one of the brothers suspected of carrying out the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris was mentored by a terrorist linked to London’s notorious Finsbury Park mosque. Cherif Kouachi, 32, met Djamel Beghal, 50, who was once accused of being Osama bin Laden’s main European recruiter, while in prison in Paris. Beghal attended hate cleric Abu Qatada’s prayer meetings in London, and is also said to have been a ‘constant presence’ at the Finsbury Park mosque in the late 1990s, when it was Abu Hamza’s base. Hamza had denied the charges throughout and claimed his militant links were part of an attempt to find peace with extremists. Since he was extradited to the US, he has been detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) Abu Hamza al-Masri was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1958 as Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, the son of a naval officer and a primary school headmistress. After initially studying civil engineering he entered the UK in 1979 on a student visa. He was granted UK citizenship when he met and married his first wife, a British Muslim convert, in 1980. Hamza has previously said she was the one who got him interested in Islam and he converted after taking time off from his job as a nightclub bouncer in London’s Soho. As he found his new religion and his job incompatible, he instead resumed his civil engineering studies at Brunel University and Brighton Polytechnic, gaining a degree. He then divorced his first wife, the mother of his oldest son, Muhammed Kamel, who at the age of 17 was convicted of being part of a bomb plot in Yemen and imprisoned for three years in 1999. He met and married his second wife in 1984 in a Muslim ceremony in London and had a further seven childen. Heavily influenced by the Iranian revolution, he took an interest in Islam and politics, in particularly the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. After meeting the founder of Afghan Mujahideen in 1987, he moved to Egypt and then to Afghanistan, and it was in the following years that he lost his hands and one eye. Over the years, Hamza has given several different reasons for the loss of his hands and eye. These include a road project in Pakistan, an explosion during a de-mining project in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, fighting the jihad as a Pakistani Mujahideen, and working with Pakistani military in Lahore when an explosives experiment went wrong. After spending time in Afghanistan and Bosnia in the early 90s, he returned to Britain and adopted a new name - Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri. It was in London that Hamza began his rise to public notoriety as the Finsbury Park mosque imam, where he arrived in 1997. One year later, in 1998, he helped organise hostage-taking of 16 mostly British tourists in Yemen. Three Britons and an Australian killed in rescue mission. In 2000, he set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, sending volunteers and money to Afghanistan to support al Qaeda and the Taliban. He firmly placed himself on the national radar in 2001 after speaking out in support of Osama bin Laden following the September 11 attacks. His inflammatory speeches led to the Charity Commission suspending him from his position at Finsbury Park Mosque the following year. In 2003, legal moves begin to get Hamza deported to Yemen, a move which he appealed. In 2004 Hamza was arrested on a US extradition warrant over charges of conspiring to take hostages in Yemen, funding terrorism, and organising a terrorist training camp in Oregon. Charged with 15 offences under the Terrorism Act, temporarily staying US extradition. In 2006, Hamza was jailed for seven years at the Old Bailey after being found guilty of 11 of 15 charges, but the courts still battle to have him extradited. He was finally extradited in October 2012, and appeared in a U.S. court, indicted under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, where he pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges. In May 2014, Hamza was convicted of all 11 charges on terrorism offences at Manhattan’s Federal Court. He will be sentenced later today.","Abu Hamza given a prosthetic arm fitted with a spork to shovel food .

"Strike laws will be dramatically tightened in key public services to prevent disruption if the Conservatives win the General Election, ministers will say today. A ban on agency workers being brought in to cover for striking workers will be overturned and a new threshold introduced before industrial action is legal in health, schools, transport and fire services. The plans, to be in the Tories’ election manifesto, will require unions to get a turnout of at least 50 per cent. Strike laws will be dramatically tightened in key public services to prevent disruption. Pictured are midwives and nursing staff picketing outside Watford General Hospital last year . In the core services, a ‘yes’ vote from at least 40 per cent of all those entitled to vote in a ballot, in addition to the 50 per cent turnout, will also be required. The moves are designed to stop militant action on the basis of strike ballots involving tiny numbers of members, but angry union leaders said the proposals would ‘effectively end the right to strike in the public sector’. Britain’s biggest health unions have been branded ‘complete hypocrites’ after vowing to press ahead with plans for damaging strikes this month, despite attacking the Government this week for delays at A&E units. Labour, which accepts large donations from the unions, is under growing pressure to call on them to call off the industrial action. Of the 119 major ballots for industrial action between August 2010 and December 2014, nearly three quarters would have been invalid under the proposed rules. Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured, is set to announce the reforms today as a Tory election manifesto promise . Today Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will say: ‘It is only fair that the rights of unions are balanced with the rights of hard-working taxpayers who rely on key public services. 'It is wrong that politicised union leaders can hold the country to ransom with demands that only a small percentage of their members voted for.’ The reforms will require a new anti-strike Bill, which the Conservatives say they would introduce early in a new Parliament if they win in May. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘The Conservatives know that this threshold will effectively end the right to strike in the public sector. 'No democracy elsewhere in the world has this kind of restriction on industrial action. It is a democratic outrage.’","Ministers will announce plans to prevent disruption in Tory manifesto .

"One of the men making a grueling ascent of a half-mile of exposed granite in California's Yosemite National Park is now 1,000 feet from finishing the groundbreaking climb. Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are attempting to become the first men to free-climb - using only hands and feet - the Dawn Wall of the park's towering El Capitan rock formation. On Thursday, Caldwell climbed to a ledge 2,000 feet up, says Tom Evans, a photographer and climber who has been chronicling the journey. His partner, however, is hundreds of feet below. Scroll down for video . Epic ascent: Kevin Jorgenson struggles up one of the lower pitches of their first free ascent of the Dawn Wall on Yosemite's El Capitan . Kevin Jorgeson relaxes in his portaledge tent, which is attached to the rock face and hangs above the Yosemite Valley floor far below . Don't look down: The climbers are making their way upwards using a series of cracks and narrow ledges in the rock . Record breaking: A cameraman can be seen on the portable ledge high above Yosemite Valley in this shot of Jorgenson climbing . Almost there! Tommy Caldwell is 1,000 feet from the top of the Dawn Wall in Yosemite National Park . Meal time: The climbers recover on another night in their portable tent . Tommy Caldwell assesses the way one morning after a night recovering . Room with a view: A view from the opening of one of the portaledges . the way forward: A view up the face of El Capitan which Caldwell and Jorgenson are climbing . Stuck: Kevin Jorgensen is still nursing the split skin on his fingers as he struggles at a lower-down point . Jorgeson, 30, is struggling to recover from splitting open the skin on the fingertips of his index and middle fingers of his right hand. This has severely hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner, and led to the pair taking three ‘rest days’ in the hope the skin will heal. This weekend, after a short break, Jorgeson plans to try surpassing the particularly difficult section lower down once more. Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson are relying completely on their physical strength and dexterity to make their way up the Dawn Wall, a vertical face on one side of El Capitan. Caldwell could become the first to accomplish the feat. Progress: Caldwell makes his way up the rock face last Sunday. If all goes well, he could do it this weekend . Don't look down: Jorgeson calculates his next move up the mountain despite suffering cuts to his fingers . The men have been climbing toward the 3,000-foot summit for two weeks. Speaking from the foot of the Dawn Wall at the start, Tom Evans, a fellow climber and photographer in contact with the pair, told the Daily Mail their spirits are still high. ‘They remain determined to complete the climb,’ he says. ‘They are definitely going for the top. They say they are not coming down until they’ve got there. The human body is not designed to take the kind of abuse they are enduring up there. ‘The granite flakes when you grip it, creating tiny razor-sharp edges which cut the skin deep. Kevin has taped up his fingers to protect them, but underneath, the skin is dry like toast.’ While many people have climbed the Dawn Wall — renowned for its smooth surface — using ropes and metal pins, no one has ever free-climbed it in a single attempt. Although the pair are clipped to ropes, they must not use them to help in the ascent. Instead, the ropes are to stop them falling if they misjudge a move or lose a grip with their fingers or feet. The men, who started the expedition on December 27, begin their climbing day shortly after 3pm, just two hours before sunset. December and January were picked for the climb in the hope it would be cold — sunlight and warmth cause fingers to sweat and so lose grip. Climbing shoes are also nowhere near as effective at clinging to the rock if the rubber gets warm because it becomes softer. But Yosemite National Park has been unusually warm this winter, so they are forced to do most of their climbing during the chill of night, using head torches. Kevin Jorgenson pulls on a relatively big hold during the climb . Precarious: The climbers have been living in a vertical world for weeks . Logistics: Aside from the actual climbing, the climbers have a great deal of work to do managing their ropes on the long climb . Filmed all the way: A cameraman hangs from the rock face awaiting the arrival of Caldwell and Jorgenson . Daring: Free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent. Above, Caldwell makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on El Capitan using a headlamp on Sunday night . Up they go: Kevin Jorgeson, 30 (left), and Tommy Caldwell, 36 (right), reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb Yosemite's El Capitan earlier this week. They've now been forced to separate . At the dead of night, temperatures can plummet to well below freezing, as ice-cold winds sweep across the face of the rock. At midnight, after nine hours of climbing, they clamber into their ‘portaledges’ — 4ft by 6ft tents that hang from ropes fixed to the cliff face. Each has a stove to cook dried pasta, chilli and vegetables, brought by a six-strong support network of porters who haul food along with 12 gallons of water in huge sacks up the ropes to their precarious camp. On occasion, the pair have even celebrated the completion of a particularly demanding section with a swig or two of whisky — ‘to take off the edge’, Caldwell says. Before bed, they treat their cuts, grazes and bruises. Writing from his tent via social media, Caldwell says: ‘It’s the most chapping environment in the world up here. Windy. Cold. Super dry. [It feels like] we’re grabbing razor blades. I wake up twice a night and reapply lotion to my hands.’ Bizarrely, they are not alone — a photographic team and film crew, charting their ascent, camps alongside them. ‘We have three double “portaledges” set up. It’s like a five-star hotel up here!’ Caldwell says. In truth, few hotel guests face the prospect of falling rocks and ice hitting them as they sleep. They wake at 10am and have breakfast. By then the sun is out and they use solar-powered devices to charge their smart phones, and report back via social media to base camp, as well as family, friends and supporters. Tom Evans believes Jorgeson and Caldwell — who have trained for six years — could complete the challenge by early next week. The greatest threat would be a turn for the worse in the weather, or an acute injury to the hands. But even that might not stop this remarkable pair from conquering what is surely one of nature’s greatest challenges.","Tommy Caldwell climbing El Capitan in bid to become first to free-climb notorious Dawn Wall has reached 2,000 feet .

"Security chiefs have been handed a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists, George Osborne has revealed. The Chancellor said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals going to fight in Iraq and Syria. Mr Osborne also pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. Scroll down for video . The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need . The revelation comes in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo atrocity in Paris on Wednesday, when two gunmen killed 11 journalists for insulting Islam. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Armed British police patrol St Pancras station in London, where the Eurostar train runs to Paris . Mr Osborne said the security services would get all the resources they needed to keep people safe . Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Director General of MI5 Andrew Parker warned that Islamist radicals were plotting terror attacks on the UK . Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.' There is also growing concern about the threat posed by ISIS fights returning to the UK. Radicalisation expert Shiraz Maher this morning told the BBC's Today programme that strict blasphemy laws in Muslim countries abroad were inflaming tensions in the West. He said stricter controls on what could be said about Islam and the prophet Muhammad 'affect some European Muslim's tolerance of satire'. Earlier, the Today programme heard from a number of British Muslims in High Wycombe who expressed anger at the journalists Charlie Hebdo for lampooning Islam. One Pakistani gentleman, Sajjad Haidyer, told the programme that the murdered journalists were 'not innocent'. He said: 'If the people make his cartoons or something else, they are hurting my heart. You can insult the peoples, you can insult me, you can insult anybody else – but not god, not the prophet Muhammad – we are not allowing that. 'If they are doing that, that will happen again and again.' The Chancellor's remarks came as members of the French gendarmerie surrounded the two main suspects of the Paris massacre to Dammartin-en-Goele, north east of Paris . Downing Street said checks at ports and Eurostar terminals would be stepped up in the wake of the Paris attacks . He added: 'Some of these people were not innocent. The editor who makes the cartoons. He has no right to make cartoons or the prophet. He has no right to say Islam is bad.' Another elderly Muslim man said: 'Democracy doesn't mean you can go and insult anybody. Insulting somebody, you shouldn't allow that. What are they achieving with the cartoon – what is the point?' But another man in the town said people did not have the right to take people lives. 'What Islam means is peace, love,' he said.","George Osborne reveals cash has been handed over 'in the last few weeks'

"A veteran Wisconsin middle school principal has been suspended after calling students 'idiots' and telling another student that he would 'kill' him for not following instructions, according to complaints filed against him. Aaron Amundson, the administrator at Bluff View Intermediate School, was placed on one week of unpaid leave after admitting he lost his temper at students twice on December 23 and yelled at them. In one incident, he told a student getting in line for buses: 'God help me if you have to ask me what line you’re in, I am going to kill ya,' according to the LaCrosse Tribune. Aaron Amundson, principal at Bluff View Intermediate School, was suspended for a week and has apologized publicly for his comments . Mr Amundson, who has been with the school district for 17 years, told school administrators in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, that he didn't remember using the word kill, but admitted he lost his temper on that occasion. Prairie du Chien School District administrator Drew Johnson also detailed an incident earlier in the day in which he called a group of students 'idiot's for not paying attention during a school assembly. He admitted to using the word 'idiot' and issued a written apology to the school. 'To those who are upset, I am disappointed with the words I used to address the students on 12/23/14. I made a mistake, and for that I sincerely apologize,' he said. Superintendent Johnson called the language that Mr Amundson used 'highly unacceptable.' Mr Amundson has been in trouble before. He was given a letter of reprimand in 2013 for an 'inappropriate email' he sent to a staffer and also using inappropriate language when he began angry at a school employee, according the Tribune. He was also investigated and disciplined twice by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction for 'seclusion and restraint' issues.","Aaron Amundson was suspended for a week without pay .

"Israel has re-arrested 51 Palestinians freed in a 2011 prisoner swap deal, the army said on today as it presses on with a furious search for three missing Israeli teens believed to have been abducted in the West Bank. Israel believes Hamas was behind the abduction of the teens, who disappeared last week on the way home from a religious seminary, and has intensified a clampdown on the militant group. The 51 rearrested prisoners were part of a group of 1,027 Palestinians released in 2011 from Israeli prisons in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit captured by Gaza militants in a cross-border raid in 2006.

Accusations: Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin . Netanyahu has blamed the Islamic militant group Hamas for kidnapping . Eyal Yifrah, 19 (left), Gilad Shaar, 16, (right) and Naftali Frenkel . Gilad Shalit was an Israeli soldier captured in Gaza by Hamas in 2006 and held for five years before being traded for the release of 1,027 Palestinians. Shalit, then a 19-year-old sergeant, was abducted  by militants who tunnelled into Israel from the Gaza Strip and surprised his tank crew, killing two of his comrades. He was whisked back into Gaza and has since been held incommunicado – many believe in underground cells. A skilfully orchestrated campaign led by his family and a growing army of supporters, some of whom camped in tents for 15 months outside the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem, piled the pressure on Netanyahu’s government to act. He was eventually released looking thin and pale. He told an Egyptian TV interviewer that he hoped his release would further the peace efforts and help end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. His release was generally widely supported by the Israeli population, although there were concerns that trade would spark further kidnappings. Since . the swap in 2011, Palestinian militants have called for more kidnappings . of Israelis in efforts to release Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli . jails. 'We have two efforts ongoing in . parallel. First is to bring back the boys, and the second is to take a . toll on Hamas for its actions,' spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter . Lerner said. 'What Israel is doing has nothing to . do with security, but is a policy of revenge,' said Qadoura Fares, . chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which advocates on behalf of . Palestinians in Israeli custody. An . Egyptian official said that Cairo, which is in contact with Hamas and . other Palestinian factions, was helping Israel gather information that . might lead to the missing teenagers. But . the official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, denied . Israeli and Palestinian media reports that Egyptian mediation was . already under way to return the boys. 'There . is a flow of information (between Egypt and Israel), but we are still . short of information, so there is no negotiation,' the official said. Israel . has not provided proof of Hamas' involvement in the teens' disappearance, but Gilad Erdan, an Israeli minister, told Israel Radio . on Wednesday that Israel knows which Hamas cell was responsible. He did not elaborate. Hamas has praised the kidnapping, but not claimed responsibility. Since . the teens disappeared, Israeli soldiers have searched 800 locations in . the West Bank and carried out operations against 10 Hamas civilian . institutions there, including raiding a Hamas radio station overnight, . Lerner said. 'These actions are already striking a substantial blow to Hamas infrastructure, institutions, and operatives,' Lerner added.

The page, in Hebrew, which features images of Palestinian men behind crosshairs, was started a day after the trio disappeared while hitchhiking in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory. It appeals to Israelis to eliminate 'terrorists' until the teenagers are found, the International Business Times reports. Writing in the top-selling Yediot Aharonot, Alex Fishman said the kidnapping had created a 'one-time operational opportunity' which Israel would use 'to castrate' Hamas and suppress its 'strongholds in Palestinian Authority territory to the greatest extent possible.' By crushing Hamas's infrastructure, it would weaken the movement ahead of Palestinian elections which under the unity deal are supposed to take place before the end of the year, Fishman said. 'Removing the political leadership from the West Bank is supposed to weaken Hamas in advance of the Palestinian presidential elections,' he said. Writing in Haaretz, Amos Harel agreed. 'The purpose of the Israeli actions ... is to drive a wedge between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, and stop the reconciliation process that began some two months ago,' he wrote. But as the manhunt entered its fifth day, commentators voiced concern about growing reports of violence around the West Bank, sparking fears that an already tense situation could rapidly escalate.","51 rearrested prisoners were part of 1,027 Palestinians released in 2011 .

"Fin Rayner (pictured with her daughter Rhiannon), who left Kai the Shar-Pei tied up at a train station, has insisted she did nothing wrong . The woman who left Kai the Shar-Pei tied up outside a train station insists she did nothing wrong by abandoning the dog. As the first picture of Fin Rayner, from Aberdeenshire, emerged, the 39-year-old mother claims she left the dog  behind after the sale of him fell through. Ms Rayner claims she had arrived at Ayr train station planning to buy the dog for £400 after replying to an advert on listings website Gumtree. But when she got to the station with her nine-year-old daughter Rhiannon Strachan, she found Kai - whose real name is Pluto - did not look like the dog in the advert. The mother-of-three told the Daily Record: 'I went to buy a dog but the dog was not the same as the picture advertised.' 'The guy rushed out with a food chest and lead on the dog. But I could see there was something up because he was very skinny. 'I said I wanted to take the dog for a walk, so he asked me for £150 as a deposit in case I didn't come back. Then I saw him tearing off in his car. I phoned and said ""You better come back for your dog"". He never turned up.' She added: 'I got into the station and the dog wasn't settling. He was pulling on the lead and peeing everywhere. 'I thought that it wasn't my dog - I didn't want him.' The mother claims she then panicked as she had to get the last train to Aberdeen. She phoned her son who told her the photograph in the advert was actually from a picture taken in the U.S. in 2005 - and not of the Scottish dog. Ms Rayner said: 'I panicked. I suffer from a panic disorder so I panicked even more and thought I could have a stolen dog now. 'I spoke to a man at the station and told him that it wasn't my dog. I told the guy I needed to get the next train. So the guy knew and he said to tie him so I did.' Miss Rayner said she has now decided not to buy another pet for her family after going through the ordeal at the weekend. She said: 'He lied about the dog. I can't believe he did this.

One of its inspectors, Stewart Taylor, said: ‘We have received information as to how Kai came to be found tied up at Ayr railway station. ‘This appears to have been a sale over the internet which has gone wrong and an example of the potential dangers of buying a pet online without knowing an animal’s background. ‘His sad story has touched the hearts of animal lovers all over the world and we have been overwhelmed with kind messages and offers of new homes.’ Jed found a home in Whitby, Yorkshire, after his plight was highlighted in the Mail . After spending almost seven years in kennels, Jed had probably given up on ever finding a loving home. The lurcher, pictured, was taken in as a four-month-old puppy in 2007. But he spent his next 50 dog years at the rescue centre in Darlington being overlooked by 17,000 potential suitors. Then, just before Christmas – after his plight was highlighted in the Mail – a couple came forward. New owner Ian Woodcock, of Whitby, Yorkshire, said he now spends his days going for walks on the moors, sleeping by the fire and playing with his new toys. After pictures of Kai were tweeted by the animal charity, hundreds of dog-lovers from Britain, the U.S., Canada, Spain and even the Philippines offered to re-home him. Assistant manager of the SPCA Katrina Cavanagh said: 'We've had offers from America, the Philippines, Canada and England and we're trying to work our way through them. 'We've had good responses in the past but this is off the scale. We've never had offers from the other side of the world before. 'What we're saying to people is fill out a questionnaire, and Anna the manager and I will have a wee look through, whittle them down and make a decision. It'll be hard but we'll get there. 'We just can't believe how big this became, but then, it's not every day you get a dog abandoned with his own suitcase.' Kai has been compared to Paddington bear after his ordeal, which has prompted an investigation by the animal welfare charity. Until it is complete, he will not be handed over to a new family, so it could be some time before he is adopted. Hundreds of people offered to home Kai after pictures of him were tweeted by the Scottish SPCA .","Fin Rayner, 39, left Kai the Shar-Pei dog tied up at Ayr train station .

"A police woman who once used a fake Facebook account to bombard an Aboriginal rights activist with racist taunts is standing to be a One Nation candidate for the upcoming Queensland election. Leanne Rissman made headlines in July last year when a police investigation found that she had hurled abuse at Geraldton's Joyce Capewell on her Facebook page, Boomerang Justice, using the alias 'Anne T Sharia'. This comes as Queensland Premier Campbell Newman on Tuesday announced the state election will be held on January 31. Ms Rissman joins the party which is being led by controversial political figure Pauline Hanson, who's known for her first parliamentary speech in which she warned of a country 'swamped by Asians'. Leanne Rissman was disciplined by the Queensland Police Service after it was found she made racist remarks via an alias Facebook account . Ian Nelson, the Queensland director  for One Nation, confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Ms Rissman is standing as the party's candidate but is yet to provide further comment. Party leader Pauline Hanson returned to One Nation last year after being forced to quit in 2003 as she was found guilty of electoral fraud and sentenced to three years in jail, although the conviction was overturned and she was freed after 11 weeks. Hanson is notorious for her first parliamentary speech in which she warned of a country 'swamped by Asians'. On New Year's Day last year, Senior Constable Rissman referred to indigenous people as 'scum bags' and 'oxygen thieves' after Ms Capewell posted on her Facebook page about Tony Abbott's indigenous advisory council and what role they would play in looking into deaths in custody. 'Get off your a*** get a job and start giving something back to your own and the greater community,' Senior Constable Rissman allegedly posted under the Anne T Sharia alias. Ms Capewell started Boomerang Justice last year after 20 years of working in the Western Australia prison system and interacting with Aboriginal inmates. The page aims to raise awareness about ongoing Aboriginal deaths in custody. 'And while you're at it how about you give you children and dogs a decent existence as well instead of starving and abusing them.' Ms Capewell said the barrage of racist comments continued after she contacted Anne T Sharia to ask her to stop posting the offensive remarks. 'Everything you have is because of the white man, if you hate it so much go back to the Aboriginal empire that existed before we came and saw you all sitting in the dirt rubbing sticks together while Rome was built, China built the magnificent great wall, and the English Spanish and Dutch traded and built empires,' Senior Constable Rissman allegedly wrote. When sounded out phonetically 'Anne T Sharia' sounds like 'anti-sharia'. Sharia is the moral code and religious law of Islam. A police investigation was launched into Snr Const Rissman (left) after Geraldton's Joyce Capewell (right) lodged a complaint against her . Ms Capewell told Daily Mail Australia back in July that she was so offended by the comments she lodged a complaint with police that sparked an internal investigation into Snr Const Rissman. An official document seen by Daily Mail Australia confirmed the Queensland Police established that the abuse allegations 'were capable of being supported'. 'I felt very horrified and lost faith in the police...[it] kept me wondering if this was the type of people we have working with Aboriginal people in custody,' Ms Capewell said. 'I don’t want this woman dealing with Aboriginal prisoners or any Aboriginal people for that matter.' A Queensland Police Service spokeswoman confirmed an officer had been disciplined in relation to a complaint made by Ms Capewell in January. 'The remarks were considered to be racially offensive and although made by the subject officer off-duty were not consistent with the standards and values of the QPS,' she said. 'In response, the complaint was investigated by a senior officer and found to warrant significant remedial action. 'The officer was subsequently required to undertake a number of training programs relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People race relations and social issues as well as professional practice in the QPS and information security obligations.' Under the alias, Snr Const Rissman abused Ms Capewell through her Facebook page, Boomerang Justice . Daily Mail Australia can also reveal Ms Capewell has been attacked on Facebook by supporters of Senior Constable Rissman since Monday. 'Why don't YOU get your facts straight and stop terrorising a decent hardworking Australian citizen,' one wrote. Another supporter also threatened Ms Capewell with legal action, writing: 'Please don't waste your time on this UNEDUCATED MORON. I hope she has a GOOD Lawyer because she's going to need one.' Senior Constable Rissman is also under investigation for not complying with police standards in relation to the investigation into the bashing death of an indigenous woman named Adelaide Riversleigh, according to The Australian. The 37-year-old died on May 10 after she was allegedly attacked by her partner. A Queensland Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia she could not comment on the matter because it was currently being investigated internally by the service. The spokesman for One Nation also declined to comment on the investigation. A number of Senior Constable Rissman's supporters did not return messages seeking comment on the matter. 'All matters relating to this officer are being investigated by a senior member of the QPS from Northern Region with overview by the Ethical Standards Command,' the police spokeswoman added.","The One Nation party's Queensland director Ian Nelson confirmed Leanne Rissman is a One Nation candidate .

"An ambitious project to put an African spacecraft on the Moon is sputtering on the launchpad as it struggles to secure funding. The Africa2Moon Mission has drawn just £8,600 ($13,000) of the initial target of £99,000 ($150,000) with a countdown of only three weeks left before the appeal closes. In contrast, a private British moon project, Lunar Mission One, rode the internet crowdfunding phenomenon to reach its target of nearly a $1million (£661,000) ahead of deadline last month. Scroll down for video . The Africa2Moon Mission has drawn just £8,600 ($13,000) of the initial target of £99,000 ($150,000) with a countdown of only three weeks left before the appeal closes . The apparent lack of interest may come as little surprise to those for whom Africa conjures up images of political unrest, disease and poverty as opposed to science and space exploration. But countering that view of the continent is one of the underlying aims of the project by the Foundation for Space Development, which says it will go ahead even if the initial target is not reached. 'We get a lot of Afro-pessimism,' chief executive Jonathan Weltman told AFP. 'Anything positive, aspirational or leading edge is treated with scepticism. 'But I have faith that Africa can do this, without a doubt.' The Africa2Moon Mission has drawn just £8,600 ($13,000) of the initial target of £99,000 ($150,000) with a countdown of only three weeks left before the appeal closes . The non-profit group was co-founded in 2009 by the head of the space lab at the University of Cape Town, Peter Martinez, who is also chairman of the South African Council for Space Affairs, the national regulatory body. An inspiring British project to land a spacecraft on the moon in 10 years completed its funding target in December. The Lunar Mission One project reached its £600,000 ($938,170) goal on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, with 36 hours to go. For £60 ($94), backers have the opportunity to buy space on memory discs that will be sent to the moon, and, for an undisclosed price, they are able to send a sample of their DNA . These discs will act like time capsules for photos, videos and other files, and will be buried in a bore hole drilled into the lunar surface. While the discs have raisede money for the mission, its main aim is to analyse the lunar South Pole and assess its potential for a possible human base to be developed in the future. The mission is to see an African-engineered rocket take an African-built module to the moon. The team behind it want to inspire wider interest in the study of science and technology among young Africans while stemming the 'brain-drain' of highly qualified graduates to the developed world. However, the world's poorest continent recently scored a major international scientific coup with the decision in 2012 to build the bulk of the world's biggest telescope in South Africa. The multi-nation Square Kilometre Array Radio telescope (SKA) will investigate the Big Bang, peek at black holes and uncover new frontiers - possibly even life beyond Earth - by peering further into the universe than ever before. SKA site bid manager Adrian Tiplady said the telescope project proved 'there's definitely the skills and talent out there and a huge amount of interest as well'. The Africa2Moon project 'certainly is feasible,' he told AFP. 'There is the expertise to design, develop and launch such a vehicle.' South Africa is the most developed economy on the continent and under the former apartheid regime had nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile programme, but the foundation is pushing for an all-inclusive African effort. Apart from Afro-pessimism, a lack of publicity on the project may have contributed to the funding shortfall . The appeal for £99,000 ($150,000) is to cover the first phase, which aims to finalise a feasibility report by the end of November and present it to an international conference. Only then will it be possible to estimate the full cost of the mission, Mr Weltman said. He admits to disappointment, and some puzzlement, over the failure so far of the hoped-for crowdfunding boost for Africa's rocket to the moon. 'The industry and media response has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive,' Mr Weltman said. 'The donor response has been slower than we hoped but has picked up dramatically at the start of this year and we are optimistic about our target being reached, if not by the end of the current crowdfunding campaign, then through other funding sources in the first quarter of the year.' Apart from Afro-pessimism, a lack of publicity on the project may have contributed to the funding shortfall. Some critics have also suggested that the sort of money spent on space exploration could be put to better use on other projects in Africa, such as conquering Ebola and other diseases. But the planners argue that investment in education is the best way to take the continent forward. Mr Weltman says the African project is aiming for the moon rather than any other space venture partly because any African child will be able to step outside, look up and share the pride in a successful mission.

"It may seem like something from the Planet of the Apes franchise, but it appears orangutans are capable of learning how to make sounds in a similar way to human speech. Researchers studying a female orangutan called Tilda at Cologne Zoo, in Germany, discovered she has learned to whistle tunes and makes sounds comparable to human consonants. Born in the wild in Borneo during the 1960s before she was captured at the age of two, she has spent nearly 50 years in captivity. Scroll down for video and to hear Tilda make her unusual calls . Tilda, a female orang-utan at Cologne Zoo pictured above, has developed an unusual way of communicating with zookeepers by whistling tunes and producing a series of clicks and grunts that mimic human speech . In that time it appears she has learned that she can attract the attention of zookeepers by producing whistles and a series of rhythmical clicks. A team of biologists who have now studied her unusual calls have found that she produces the clicks by imitating the mouth movements used in speech. By gently tickling the feet, palms, necks and armpits of baby humans and apes, scientists have been able to map the evolution of laughter. Researchers at Portsmouth University analysed the  sounds the animals made - giggles, hoots, grunts and pants. They concluded that laughter can be traced back some 16 million years, and that it evolved along the same pathway as our evolution. Primatologist Dr Davila Ross, who led the work, said: 'Our results on laughter indicate its pre-human basis. 'This is important for emotional research in humans and animals as well as for the management of primates in captivity and in the wild.' Her previous work has also shown that orang-utans also have a sense of empathy and mimicry which is an essential part of laughter. She studied the way facial expressions were picked up and copied by 25 orang-utans aged between two and 12 playing at four primate centres around the world. Playmates often mimics the expressions around half a second later than it appeared on the face of a partner, suggesting the mimicry was an involuntary display. The movement of her lips and tongue are similar to those used by humans to produce the consonants 't', 'k' and 'p'. She also produces 'faux -speech' grunts that are similar to human vowel sounds. The researchers found that to do this, Tilda rapidly opens and closes her mouth in rhythms comparable to those used to create human speech. The rhythms she used were seven times faster than those seen in typical orangutan calls. Although the sounds she produces are difficult to compare to human speech, the scientists claim the movements she makes require the kind of fine control over her lips and tongue that was thought to be restricted to humans among primates. They believe the findings may help to explain how human speech first evolved. Professor Serge Wich, a primatologist at Liverpool John Moores Univesrity who was involved in the study, said: 'This research highlights that studying orang-utan calls is very relevant to our understanding of the evolution of the production of human speech. 'Orangutans seem to have more capabilities to learn and produce calls than we assumed several years ago. 'This indicated how important studies are that examine calls in this relatively silent ape species.' Zookeepers at Cologne Zoo believe Tilda was initially trained to perform tricks for human entertainment, which may help explain some of her unusual behaviours. From 1975 she was housed at a Zoo in Switzerland before being transferred to Zoo Krefeld in Germany in 2007 and then a year later being moved to the Cologne Zoo where she remains. Tilda is thought to have first learned to produce the calls by copying a human trainer at some point in the past. In the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (above) primates learn to speak after being exposed to a virus, but the latest study suggests apes can already learn how to mimic the mouth movements that humans use in speech . However, according to Dr Adriano Lameira, from the University of Amsterdam, who led the new research, she now produces these calls without prompting. He said that she produces them with a specific goal in mind - clapping her hands or pointing at food in the caretakers hands as she vocalises. In their study, which is published in the journal Public Library of Science One, the scientists analysed video and audio recordings of Tilda communicating. They looked at the way she opens and closes her mouth and found she used rhythms similar to those used in human speech. Dr Lameira, who also works for conservation charity the Pongo Foundation, said: 'These calls were produced by quickly opening-and-closing the lips, much alike humans do when talking. 'One of these calls presented similarities with human consonants, and the other with human vowels, the two basic building blocks of human speech.' Clicks sounds occur as consonants in many languages around the world but the Khoisan languages in southern Africa contain the widest use of clicks. The Juǀʼhoan language, for example, has 48 click consonants, among nearly as many non-click consonants. Tilda, above, is thought to be around 50 years old and learned to produce the calls by copying a human trainer . The scientists analysed the sounds and mouth movements of Tilda as she produced her clicks (left hand graph) and vowel like grunts (right hand graph). The dark blue line shows the power of the sound, the light blue line shows the acoustic amplitude and the red line indicates how the distance between her lips changed . Some anthropologists believe these click languages may have been among the first forms of human speech to emerge. Dr Lameira said: 'Speech underlines every social and community structure in human society, yet the origin of all the world’s spoken languages remains a puzzle ever since the publication of Darwin’s theory of natural selection. 'The major barrier for our understanding of the evolution of spoken language is the observation that great apes – our closest relatives – exhibit a very rigid use of their calls, and seem to lack the capacity to modify or learn new calls into their repertoire. 'This stands in stark contrast with human spoken languages, which are learned anew every generation, raising therefore critical questions about evolutionary continuity between our vocal repertoire and that of great apes. 'The new findings changes all of this as we can now see fundamental similarities.'","Female orang-utan called Tilda uses unusual calls to communicate with keepers at Cologne Zoo in Germany, often to indicate that she wants food .

Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook , 'A few years ago, an extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Mohammed that offended him' And while he did not end up being charged with any crime or sentenced to death, the Pakistani government did block Facebook in their country. 'We stood up for this because different voices -- even if they're sometimes offensive -- can make the world a better and more interesting place,' explained Zuckerberg. 'Facebook has always been a place where people across the world share their views and ideas. We follow the laws in each country, but we never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share across the world.' The idea for the day came after Comedy Central decided to censor a not-so-flattering rendering of the prophet on their show South Park. This act was deemed illegal under Pakistani law, where it is a crime to defile the 'sacred name of Mohammed.' This under Islamic Sharia law. Zuckerberg ends his statement by honoring those who lost their lives in Paris, writing; 'My thoughts are with the victims, their families, the people of France and the people all over the world who choose to share their views and ideas, even when that takes courage. ‪#‎JeSuisCharlie‬.' Many Muslims however are taking issue with Zuckerberg's statement, with one, Aftab Ahmed, writing; 'What about all those people in Palestine , Iraq , Afghanistan , Syria died Never seen you condemned about those barbaric acts talk about standing for right Mr Zuckerberg.' He then added; Yet you ban countless pages for posting ""offensive"" things so how can you say that you refuse to let one group silence everyone when Facebook bans pages for posting humor?'

"If you’ve suffered from a blocked nose and sinus pain, the chances are that you’ll have reached for a decongestant. But you may not know how the remedy relieves the annoying symptoms. Now, a chemistry teacher from Bournemouth has created an infographic to explain just how the medicine, which typically comes in spray or tablet form, stops the nose from running. Chemistry Andy Brunning created an infographic (pictured) to explain how decongestants work. They targetalpha-adrenergic receptors in the nose and sinuses to constrict blood vessels, which helps to reduce inflammation and the formation of mucus . Andy Brunning explained in a post on his blog, Compound Interest that decongestants work by targeting alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nose and sinuses to constrict blood vessels, which helps to reduce inflammation and the formation of mucus. While a number of drugs can be used to create the effect, some of the most common are pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline - which can also be used to treat nosebleeds - phenylephrine and xylometazoline. Pseudoephedrine, a natural compound found in plants, is one of the most effective decongestants and is produced on a large scale by using a mixture of yeast, dextrose – grape sugar - and benzaldehyde, which is a colourless liquid with many industrial uses. As well as acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors, pseudoephedrine also targets other receptors, which relax muscles in the airways to ease congestion. Research has shown that man flu isn't a myth, because a lack of female sex hormones actually leaves males with weaker immune systems. Scientists from Harvard University said in October that a lack of oestrogen makes men more likely to succumb to pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Their study, published in medical journal Life Sciences tested the effect of bacterial pneumonia on mice by introducing the infection to their lungs. Professor Lester Kobzik, of the university's School of Public Health, found females were naturally more resistant to the condition. Their increased resistance was linked to the enzyme nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) - activated by the release of the female sex hormone oestrogen. By administering a simple dose of oestrogen to both males and females, they were able to cure both of serious lung infections - clearing the bacteria from their lungs far more rapidly than normal mice. The team hopes that, in the future, this knowledge could be used to enhance resistance to common and serious lung infections and prevent flu developing into more serious pneumonia. Professor Kobzik said: 'Ultimately, this work could be especially useful in reducing risk of secondary bacterial pneumonias during seasonal or pandemic influenza. 'We were quite pleased that the work led us to NOS3-targeting drugs that are already available and that can indeed improve resistance to pneumonia in our mouse model.' As well as acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors, pseudoephedrine also targets other receptors, which relax smooth muscle in the airways to ease congestion (illustrated in this stock image) But using the decongestant for too long can backfire . While pseudoephedrine is an ingredient in may over-the-counter medicines, there are other active ingredients. Phenylephrine is one such alternative, but a handful of studies have claimed it is no more effective in easing nasal congestion than a placebo. Xylometazoline, on the other hand, is on the World Health Organisation’s list of essential medicines, but isn’t advised for people with high blood pressure. Oxymetazoline can also be used in the treatment of nosebleeds and eye redness. While nasal decongestants may be effective in relieving the symptoms of a cold in the short term, they can only be used for a limited amount of time. ‘For the most part, use of nasal sprays for more than a few days can induce rhinitis medicamentosa, more commonly referred to as rebound congestion,’ Mr Brunning writes. Scientists are unsure exactly why this happens, but it means that people who overuse their nasal sprays can trigger a vicious circle of mucus. ‘More of the decongestant is taken to alleviate the congestion, and the rebound congestion continues,’ he explained. It seems that the problem of rebound congestion can be avoided by taking tablets instead.","Chemistry Andy Brunning created his inforgraphic to detail the different chemical types of decongestants .

"Marine Le Pen talks to media after meeting with French president Francois Hollande yesterday. She was called for a return of the death penalty in the wake of the Paris terror attacks . The French National Front leader has called for a return of the death penalty in the wake of the Paris terror attacks as her far-right party is expected to receive a boost in the polls. Marine Le Pen said she believed that France should have corporal punishment in their 'legal arsenal' and pledged that if she were to be elected president in 2017, she would offer a national referendum on the issue. It comes after she said that 'Islamic fundamentalism' had declared war on France and she demanded strong, effective action to tackle it. Miss Le Pen's resurgent Front National is expected to be receive higher poll ratings following the attack on the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday after they published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad. Speaking to French broadcaster France 2, she said: 'I have always said that I would offer French citizens the possibility to express themselves on the issue through a referendum.' However, while she was careful to draw a distinction between Muslim citizens who share French values and 'those who kill in the name of Islam', her father, National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, and her deputy, Florian Philippot, were less cautious. Mr Philippot told RTL radio: 'Anyone who says Islamist radicalism has nothing to do with immigration is living on another planet.' Meanwhile, it has been reported that France's ruling Socialists have tried to ban the National Front from a peace march for Charlie Hebdo shooting victims. French president Francois Hollande's Socialists called this week for a show of national unity on Sunday in support of Charlie Hebdo and media freedom. But the mood of unity lasted just hours, as the march's organiser said there would be 'no room' for the anti-EU, anti-immigration National Front. Miss Le Pen's party won the highest score of any in European parliamentary elections last May and several polls suggest she could reach the runoff round of a 2017 presidential election. Police and rescue workers gather outside the the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, where 12 people were shot dead by Said and Cherif Kouachi . On the run: French police surrounded an area north-east of Paris where the armed men, who killed 12 people in Paris on Wednesday, are believed to be hiding . 'The idea of national unity has been totally undermined, and we will face up to the consequences,' Le Pen told Le Monde newspaper, calling the move to exclude her from a group of politicians to lead the march a 'pitiful political manoeuvre'. Socialist Party leader Jean-Christophe Cambadelis later qualified the ban saying 'anyone who wanted to and felt concerned' could participate. Mr Hollande met with Le Pen as well as other party leaders at his offices, as hundreds of police faced off with suspected shooters in an industrial facility northeast of Paris. Francois Hollande, pictured, met with Miss Le Pen as well as other party leaders at his offices, as hundreds of police faced off with suspected shooters in an industrial facility northeast of Paris . But analysts say that Le Pen is set to reap gains from her exclusion and willingness to use strong words to describe the attack, ahead of two local elections this year in which the Socialists are seen suffering further defeats. 'We're at a tipping point,' said Francois Miquet-Marty, an analyst for polling agency Viavoice. 'French people who felt sympathetic to the National Front but might have been on the fence are now being forced to choose, which may well accelerate a movement toward Le Pen.'","Marine Le Pen says France should have death penalty in 'legal arsenal'

"A 7-foot-1 former NBA star has been arrested for attempted armed robbery after neighbors spotted him and a friend with masks over their faces trying to break into a rural Washington State home in broad daylight. This is just the latest trouble for 29-year-old Robert Swift, who blew his NBA $20million earnings and was evicted from his Seattle home in 2013. At the time of his arrest, he was a fugitive from justice, wanted for failing to show up for court to answer charges of possession of a sawed-off shotgun from last November. Swift and 28-year-old Carlos Abraham Anderson were busted on Tuesday near Gold Bar, Washington, as they were trying to break into a home there, police told to KIRO-TV. Fallen star: Robert Swift, 28, hasn't played in the NBA since 2009 and blew his $20million earnings within four years of leaving the league . Neighbors spotted the conspicuous pair and called police. Sources told the TV station that Swift was 'heavily armed' and at least one of the men had a baseball bat. Swift told sheriff's deputies he was high on drugs at the time. Charges for the incident have not been filed, though both men are being held on previous warrants they had out for their arrest. Last November, Swift was arrested after police raided the home where he was living with the man who he said was his heroin dealer. Police seized this cache of weapons when they raided the home where Swift was living last year. Among the legal guns was an illegal sawed-off shotgun . Swift's suburban Seattle home was foreclosed on in 2013 after the star blew his massive basketball fortune . They seized a massive cache of weapons - including a sawed-off shotgun, which is illegal without special permits. Cops also found heroin, meth and several prostitutes at the home. Swift, an admitted heroin addict, has seen his life fall apart after he was picked by the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the NBA draft at age 18. He played four seasons of NBA basketball, but was saddled with injuries, but hasn't been on an NBA court since 2009. In 2013, his Swift was evicted from his suburban Seattle home and revealed that he was broke - despite earning $20million during his NBA career.","Robert Swift, 28, blew his $20million NBA earnings and was evicted from his home in 2013 .

"The Yemen branch of al-Qaeda appear to have claimed they directed the attack on the office of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. It comes after the gunman who held up a kosher grocery store in the east of Paris, killing four people, said he was 'fighting for the Islamic State' and wanted to kill Jews. A member of al-Qaeda in Yemen released a statement in English tonight saying that they had carefully chosen their target of the Charlie Hebdo office but stopped short of claiming responsibility. Scroll down for video . Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers who had assassinated 12 people at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday. The Yemen branch of al-Qaeda appear to have claimed responsibility for the attack . Police and rescue workers gather outside the the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, where 12 people were shot dead by Said and Cherif Kouachi . On the run: French police surrounded an area north-east of Paris where the armed men, who killed 12 people in Paris on Wednesday, are believed to be hiding . In a statement in English, the member said: 'The leadership of AQAP (al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula) directed the operations and they have chosen their target carefully. He added that the attack, which left 12 dead, was in line with warnings from the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to the West about 'the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslim sanctities.' Bin Laden was shot dead by US Navy seals in a raid on his compound in Pakistan on 2 May 2011. The member added the group has delayed its declaration of responsibility for 'security reasons' and spoke on condition of anonymity because of the group's regulations. Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers who had assassinated 12 people at Charlie Hebdo, died in a blaze of gunfire at a printworks near Paris earlier today where they had been holed up with one hostage, who survived. The Yemen branch of al-Qaeda's senior cleric Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari issued a recording on the group's Twitter feed commenting on the 'blessed raid on Paris.' If confirmed, the attack would be the first time al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen has successfully carried out an operation in the West after at least two earlier attempts. Soon after, the branch's senior cleric Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari issued a recording on the group's Twitter feed commenting on the 'blessed raid on Paris.' He denounced the 'filthy' French and called them 'the heads of infidelity who insult the prophets.' He praised the 'hero mujahedeen' who he said 'taught them a lesson and the limits of freedom of speech.' Addressing the French, he said, 'It better for you to stop striking Muslims so you can live in peace. But if you only wish for war, then rejoice, you will not enjoy peace as long as you wage war on God and his prophets and fight Muslims. 'It is better for you to stop your aggression against the Muslims, so perhaps you will live safely. If you refuse but to wage war, then wait for the glad tiding.' It was not immediately clear why al-Nadhari did not outright said al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the attack. A member of al-Qaeda in Yemen said the attack on Charlie Hebdo was in line with warnings from the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, pictured . Before his death, one of the Kouachi brothers, who were responsible for Wednesday's attack, told a television station he had received financing from an al Qaeda preacher in Yemen. 'I was sent, me, Cherif Kouachi, by Al Qaeda of Yemen. 'I went over there and it was Anwar al Awlaki who financed me,' he told BFM-TV by telephone, according to a recording aired by the channel after the siege was over. Al Awlaki, an influential international recruiter for al Qaeda, was killed in September 2011 in a drone strike. A senior Yemeni intelligence source earlier said that Kouachi's brother Said had also met al Awlaki during a stay in Yemen in 2011. Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal, which chronicles militant activities, said Yemen's branch of al-Qaeda has managed to seize territory inside Yemen, provide training and support for extremist groups operating in Syria, Iraq and other regions, and promote 'lone wolf' attacks in the West. 'They are active in the heart of the Middle East. They threaten the Yemeni government and they are directing their activities externally as well,' he said. 'And they are serving to train and support in other theatres.' These include a foiled plan to down a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 using a new type of explosive hidden in the bomber's underwear, and another attempt a year later to send mail bombs hidden in toner cartridges on planes bound to the U.S. from the Gulf. Amedy Coulibaly, right, the gunman responsible for taking 15 people hostage at a kosher deli in the east of Paris earlier today claimed he was 'fighting for the Islamic State'. His armed and dangerous wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, left, is on the run and is described as 'armed and dangerous' The group recently called for its supporters to carry out attacks in France, which is part of a US-led coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State group jihadists in Iraq and Syria. AQAP's English-language propaganda magazine 'Inspire' has urged jihadists to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks abroad. In 2013 it named Charlie Hebdo cartoonist and editor-in-chief Stephane Charbonnier among its list of targets. Mr Charbonnier was one of 12 people killed in Paris on Wednesday by two gunmen who stormed the magazine's offices. It comes after the gunman responsible for taking 15 people hostage at a kosher deli in the east of Paris earlier today claimed he was 'fighting for the Islamic State'. It emerged tonight that four people had been killed while another five are critically wounded. As many as 30 had survived by hiding in a cold store where they kept silent for hours. It was revealed that Amedy Coulibay, 32, had telephoned a French TV station hours before he was killed by police. He told BFMTV he was 'fighting for Islamic State', the militarised Islamic group who currently control huge swathes of Iraq and Syria, and wanted to kill Jews. He added: 'I have sixteen hostages and I have killed four, and I targeted them because they were Jewish.' Going in: Special forces storm the Jewish grocery to the east of Paris where terrorist Amedey Coulibaly had taken people hostage . Terrified: Hostages - who had been held for hours with Coulibaly threatening to kill them - flee from the shop, crying with relief. Coulibaly was shot dead and his wife is still on the run and is described as being 'armed and dangerous . The reporter he spoke to said that he claimed to have been acting under instructions from the terrorist group and that his actions were synchronised by the Kouachi brothers. He is asked: 'Are you in contact with the two (Kouachi) brothers,' to which he answered: 'Yes we made contact before the operations.' He then denied having been in contact with them recently and said he did not plan to take any further action. In the end, the studio journalist described the gunman's claim that the kosher supermarket had been targeted and that he carried out the siege 'to defend Muslims... notably in Palestine.' It is not yet clear when exactly the interviews were carried out but they are believed to have taken place hours before they were killed. A nationwide hunt is now underway to find his 'armed and dangerous' wife Hayat Boumeddiene, who is on the run tonight following his death after the store siege. The Paris-born terrorist once belonged to the same Al-Qaeda group as the Kouachi brothers, who were also killed today after murdering 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo magazine slaughter on Wednesday. The next day, Boumeddiene and his wife were both involved in the gun attack on Clarissa Jean-Philippe, a 27-year-old rookie traffic policewoman. She had attended a routine traffic accident in Montrouge, south of Paris, at 8am when the couple struck. A second victim - a street cleaner who was shot in the face after he confronted the couple - is still in a serious condition.","Member of al-Qaeda in Yemen says they directed Charlie Hebdo attack .

Four passengers who had been missing were found and the other 106 people on the boat, survived and were in good health, Chacon added. According to the public security ministry, 57 passengers were rescued and taken to the beach town of Herradura while 40 others went to the port town of Caldera. Survivors said they were handed lifejackets by staff shortly before the boat sank. One told the BBC: 'We were floating in the ocean. Many people were crying, screaming, asking for help,' an unidentified woman told local television. Todd Olson, a tourist from Kansas, told the station: 'The captain started to turn the wheel to the left. There were pretty heavy seas and we started to take water on, apparently on the right side. 'Within a minute it was flipped. Very fast, shocking.'

"Tragedy: Insomniac Sue Greenwood, 43, was found hanged in a wooded area close to her home two days before Christmas . A teacher plagued by decades of insomnia killed herself two days before Christmas after becoming addicted to sleeping tablets she bought online, an inquest has heard. Sue Greenwood, 43, was found hanged in a wooded area close to her home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of December 23. Her heartbroken husband Dave Greenwood said his wife had suffered from insomnia  deprivation throughout her adult life and would often go for days without sleep. An inquest into to her death was opened and adjourned ahead of a full hearing, but there are believed to be no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death. Mr Greenwood said the couple had enjoyed a dream wedding on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar in 2011 and had battled through her problems together. He said he wants to raise awareness about the damage insomnia and the purchase of sleeping tablets without prescription can do. He said: 'Sue would sometimes go several days without being able to sleep. 'It would reach a point where she was desperately tired, but still she could not sleep. 'If she could sleep, it was often during the day, which would cause enormous disruption to her life. 'It was something she had suffered from since being at school and university. 'Sue tried everything - hypnotherapy, acupuncture and CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). 'Unfortunately, she resorted to accessing sleeping tablets, which should only be prescribed by GPs, online, and became dependent on them. 'It's totally wrong that people can get these things on the internet, but how do you stop it? 'Ultimately, she was taking too many of them and they were making the problem worse. But she must have been desperate. 'She was a beautiful, intelligent and driven woman and what has happened is devastating.' Tribute: Sue's husband Dave, pictured together on their wedding day in 2011, said his 'beautiful and brilliant' wife was driven to despair by her lack of sleep . Mr Greenwood, 47, said he now knows sleep deprivation affects many people in all walks of life, but there is too little publicity about possible cures. Dependency: The 43-year-old tried everything to manage her insomnia but then resorted to sleeping pills she bought online . 'I have only found out since Sue has died that GPs often run sleep clinics, specifically for people suffering from insomnia,' he said. 'They might have helped. It seems insomnia is something even the medical profession seems reluctant to talk about. 'If anything positive can come out of this, it is that more people must know about insomnia as an issue and how to access coping strategies to combat it. 'I would urge anyone suffering from such a problem to be assertive with the medical services of getting help. 'I would also like something to be done about the ease at which people who are desperate can get hold of prescription drugs - containing who knows what - with the click of a button on the internet. 'In an age when you can't even buy more than two packets of paracetamol from a supermarket without being challenged, it is wrong.' Mrs Greenwood, 43, was found dead in the wooded area at Haslam Park in the Deane area of Bolton, Greater Manchester. She moved to the town more than 20 years ago after qualifying as a teacher at Edge Hill University near Liverpool. She worked at Brandwood Street and Church Road primary schools in Bolton, Claypool in Horwich. Anderton Primary School, and rose to the position of an assisted skills teacher at Manor Road Primary School in Chorley. She had also worked as a primary education consultant in Trafford. She had no children. A humanist service will take place at the East Lancashire Crematorium in Cemetery Road, Radcliffe, on Friday, January 16 at 1pm.","Sue Greenwood, 43, killed herself in woods two days before Christmas .

"Osar Pistorius' older brother is facing a charge of reckless or negligent driving for a road accident last year in which he was seriously injured. Carl Pistorius, 29, became recognisable around the world from his appearances in the Pretoria courtroom where his brother was jailed for killing model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year. He even attended the trial in a wheelchair with his legs in splints - injuries sustained in the car crash which he is now being prosecuted for. Facing charges: Carl Pistorius is facing a charge of reckless or negligent driving for a road accident last year in which he was seriously injured . Pistorius was charged by a Limpopo province court, in the north of the country, because he did not submit a statement after the accident despite repeated requests from police. He had been returning home from a business trip when he crashed -  sustaining injuries -- although no-one else was hurt. Police spokesman Colonel Ronel Otto, who confirmed the charge, said: 'Mr Pistorius did not want to submit his statement, he was charged mainly because of that.' She added that he will be formally charged on Friday and will appear in a the Modimolle court, north of Johannesburg, at the end of February. Seriously injured: The brother of Oscar Pistorius attended the jailed athlete's trial in a wheelchair last year after he was injured in the crash . Pistorius was acquitted in 2013 on charges of culpable homicide or manslaughter over the death of a woman in a traffic incident in 2008. South African prosecutors recently won their bid to appeal against the culpable homicide verdict handed down to his brother along with a five-year jail term last year. They are seeking a murder conviction for the killing which shook the world on Valentine's Day 2013. Oscar Pistorius, formerly known as the 'Bladerunner' for his prosthetic legs, is said to have flown into a rage after learning that prosecutors had won their appeal - which opens the door for a stiffer 15-year prison sentence. Brothers: Carl Pistorius was regularly seen in attendance in the Pretoria courtroom during his brother's trial . Oscar was jailed for five years for culpable homicide but prosecutors recently won a bid to appeal against the sentence. They are pushing for a murder conviction - which carries a 15 year sentence . A fellow prisoner at the Kgosi Mampuru II jail in Pretoria said the double-amputee athlete 'lost it' after hearing the ruling on the radio. The source said: 'He got up and stomped. He went straight to the gym. He started lifting weights like it was going out of fashion. He is p***** off.' Legal experts said it was unlikely that Pistorius would now be released on house arrest after serving just ten months of his sentence as he had previously hoped.

"An Albuquerque police officer unknowingly shot an undercover detective during a narcotic operation Friday near a busy intersection on the city's southeast side, police said. Both of the officers were working undercover and wearing plain clothes, KOAT reports. The shooting officer did not know the man he was confronting was one of the Albuquerque Police Department's own. The unnamed undercover detective is a 10-year veteran of the force and the other officer has been with the department for several years. Shot: An Albuquerque police officer unknowingly shot an undercover detective during a narcotic operation Friday near a busy intersection on the city's southeast side . Didn't Know: Both of the officers were wearing plain clothes but the shooting officer did not know the man he was confronting was a fellow cop . The shooting happened just before noon as unmarked police vehicles surrounded a car in the parking lot of a McDonald's. Witnesses told KRQE that three unmarked police vehicles surrounded a black car, and when officers tried to take a man into custody, shots rang out. The witnesses said they heard a series of gunshots and it was not long before dozens of officers had the area surrounded. Police Chief Gordon Eden said the undercover detective who was shot was rushed to University of New Mexico Hospital in critical condition and entered surgery soon after. He was not wearing a bullet proof vest at the time of the shooting. Hospital: The undercover detective who was shot was rushed to University of New Mexico Hospital in critical condition and entered surgery soon after . McDonald's: The shooting happened just before noon as unmarked police vehicles surrounded a car in the parking lot of a McDonald's . Eden had no other details about the circumstances that led to the shooting and he did not release the names of the officers. 'There are many questions that need to be answered and right now I don't have those answers,' he told reporters gathered near the scene. Eden said the two suspects involved in the drug bust were taken into custody. No one else has been reported injured as a result of the shooting. Dozens of law enforcement agents had the restaurant parking lot cordoned off with yellow tape as police cruisers surrounded the area. Wallace Anderson, 68, of Albuquerque, was inside the restaurant having coffee with a group of people when he heard at least four gunshots. 'They told us we couldn't leave because it was a crime scene now,' he said.

The officer injured in that case, Lou Golson, is in stable condition at a hospital and the suspect is being held on attempted murder and other charges. Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry called Friday's shooting a tragic incident and said it was another example of the dangers that come along with police work. He and Eden asked residents to pray for the officers.","An Albuquerque police officer unknowingly shot an undercover detective during a narcotic operation Friday .

"The funeral for a Pennsylvania college student whose body was pulled from a river near his home was held on Friday afternoon. The disappearance of 21-year-old Shane Montgomery in Philadelphia on Thanksgiving Day caused a widespread search and led to a $65,000 reward for information about his whereabouts. On Saturday, volunteer divers discovered the West Chester University senior's body in the Schuylkill River near Kildare's Irish Pub in Philadelphia, where he had spent the night drinking until 1.45am on November 27. Found: The body of Shane Montgomery, pictured, was recovered from the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia on Saturday, close to where he was last seen on November 27 . Shane Montgomery's remains are carried from his funeral Mass at St. John the Baptist Church in Manayunk . Mourners embrace after Shane Montgomery's funeral service at St. John the Baptist Church in Manayunk . A line of mourners stretched out the door of St. John the Baptist Church in Philadelphia, where family and friends bid a final farewell. The mass was followed by a procession to Calvary Cemetery in West Conshohocken, where Montgomery was laid to rest. The medical examiner's office has conducted an autopsy to determine a cause an manner of death, but has not yet released the results. However, Montgomery's uncle Kevin Verbrugghe told the Allentown Morning Call that investigators believe his nephew's death was accidental. Verbrugghe did not elaborate on how they think Montgomery died. Bittersweet: His heartbroken parents, Karen and Kevin Montgomery,spoke with the media after their son's body was discoveredSaturday . Search: Teams had been searching the nearby canal for the last month but turned up no signs. Montgomery's body was found Saturday in the water behind the Manayunk Street Brewery . 'Today we have done what we have promised,' Karen Montgomery told NBC Philadelphia on Sunday. 'We have found and we brought Shane home.' Two weeks earlier divers found a set of keys belonging to Montgomery in the same section of water after they were tested on his parents' house. Montgomery was last seen leaving a bar in Manayunk in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day, having returned home from college for the holidays, and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot. Recovered: Different clues lead search crews to Montgomery's body, especially the discovery of a set of keys nearby (left) in the Schuylkill River two weeks ago. Manayunk is a neighborhood of Philadelphia (top right) A bereft Karen Montgomery is comforted as she gets ready to speak with the media . Search: His disappearance has sparked a huge search involving the FBI, K-9 units and helicopters . The search predominantly focused on the nearby Manayunk Canal, with police not suspecting foul play. His heartbroken parents were sure something unfortunate had happened to their son. 'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home,' Karen Montgomery previously said. Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in Manayunk - a neighborhood of Philadelphia  -at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table. Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, had a distinct Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder . He had spent the night of November 26 there with friends. It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it. One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave. Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning. The footage has been withheld by authorities. The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him. His father, Kevin, previously told NBC: 'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder.'","The body of Shane Montgomery was recovered from the Schuylkill River in Manayunk, Philadelphia, last Saturday .

"A Walmart employee refused to print a couple's wedding photo just days before their ceremony because they believed it would promote 'gang culture' as they were posing with a rifle. Stephanie Wehner and her fiancé Mitch Strobl took 13 images including one of them posing with a 12-gauge Ruger Red Label over-and-under shotgun into a store in Dallas, Texas. When the couple, who are due to get married this weekend, returned to pick the prints up, they were handed 12 prints with a slip which read: 'MINUS ONE 5 X 7. NO WEAPONS.' Wedding photos: Stephanie Wehner and her fiancé Mitch Strobl took 13 images including this one of them posing with a 12-gauge Ruger Red Label over-and-under shotgun into a store in Dallas, Texas . Devastated: The pair were shocked when they returned to pick up their prints and found the clerk had refused to print one of the poses . The clerk then explained to them that she could not process the picture with the weapon as it was against 'store policy' and promoted 'gang culture' Miss Wehner told WFAA-TV: 'She was very nice, but very matter-of-fact, like she was not going to budge or give me my photo. 'It depicts our love for each other, and I wanted to be able to display those at the reception. 'To automatically to be lumped into that category of a gang... that hits a little close to home for us, because that isn't our intent at all.' The puzzled pair then spoke to the store's manager who told them the employee had been misinformed, printed their photo and gave them a gift card. Anger: Miss Wehner condemned the fact that the couple had been branded into the category of a gang . Lifestyle: Mr Strobl (pictured with his fiance) who writes manuals for hunting safety and outdoor recreation said that the photo was safe as the 'action was open . Brian Nick, Director of National Media Relations, told the Houston Chronicle the refusal was quikcly reversed: 'The store manager has reached out and apologized to the couple and also paid for their photographs, including matting them and has given them a gift card for the store, so clearly this was an unintentional situation by the store.'

"As a federal lawmaker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is legally exempt from jury duty. But the Republican legislator answered his summons on Friday anyway, setting Houston's courthouse abuzz. The Senate is session today, but Cruz flew home last night in order to be on hand at the courthouse this morning. 'I'd actually never been called to jury duty before,' Cruz told ABC 13. 'I got the summons and I was happy to come down and do my civic duty.' As a federal lawmaker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is legally exempt from jury duty. But the Republican legislator answered his summons on Friday anyway at the Harris County courthouse . As the politician arrived, he took off his shoes and handed in his bag so they could be scanned by security . He sat taking notes in the front of the courtroom as the process began . The city of Houston specifically states on its website that residents are exempt from jury duty if 'you are an officer or employee of the Senate, the House of Representatives, or any department, commission, board, office, or other agency, in the legislative branch of State government' The city of Houston specifically states on its website that residents are exempt from jury duty if 'you are an officer or employee of the Senate, the House of Representatives, or any department, commission, board, office, or other agency, in the legislative branch of State government.' Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, could have easily filed paperwork asking to be excused from today's proceedings on those grounds. Instead, the trained lawyer joined roughly 100 of his constituents at the Houston courthouse today, posing for photos with those that asked. 'My parents are huge supporters,' a young woman told him, according to the Houston Chronicle, as she had her picture taken with the local leader. 'I wish I could say I took a picture with a future president,' one man told the presumed 2016 presidential candidate. As jury selection began, Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett advised Cruz on Twitter to go ballistic a la a scene in the classic movie A Few Good Men and scream, 'Did you order the Code Red?' A judge for Houston's Criminal District Court, Ryan Patrick, later said on Twitter that Cruz was among 65 potential jurors 'randomly' selected for voire dire in a felony criminal case. He took the opportunity to smile for a photograph with Dr. Nazanin Hebel, another person part of the process . Patrick did not state the outcome of the interview process, but it's unlikely that Cruz was selected as part of the 12-member jury given the circumstances . Cruz acknowledged to the Chronicle that actually being named to a jury would present problems to fulfilling his duties as a U.S. Senator, yet he indicated to reporters that he knew he'd never make it far enough in the jury selection process for that to become a serious consideration. 'It would be a bit of a complication if I ended up in a six-week trial. That would be in some tension with getting back to Washington and doing my job representing Texans,' Cruz said. 'But I think at the end of the day that'll work itself out.' And while entire episode was mainly for show, Cruz used the opportunity to advocate for greater civic engagement. 'I would certainly encourage everyone else when you get a jury summons to come down to participate,' told ABC's Houston bureau. 'It's like voting. It's part of the responsibilities of the citizen.' Still, the trained lawyer and likely 2016 presidential candidate joined roughly 100 of his constituents at the Houston, Texas, courthouse today, posing for photos with those that asked .","As a federal lawmaker,  Cruz is legally exempt from jury duty, but he answered his summons today anyway .

"Shocked classmates of the alleged Charlie Hebdo getaway driver have leapt to his defence - claiming he was in school with them at the time of the deadly attack. Mourad Hamyd was arrested on Wednesday night after handing himself in at a local police station, after rumours he was involved in the Charlie Hebdo massacre began to circulate on social media. But friends of the 18-year-old suspected terrorist say there is no way he could have been involved, as he was sitting in class at the Lycee Monge when the attack took place. The school is in Charleville-Mezières, around 130 miles from the scene of the murders in Paris. Twitter user Vicomte Crew (@babydroma) claims her classmate was in school on Wednesday, using the hashtag #MouradHamydInnocent . Classmates immediately took to Twitter saying a terrible mistake had been made, using the hashtag #MouradHamydInnocent. A user under the hand @babydroma insisted that Mourad was in her philosophy class, and added: ‘Please, he was in [school] all morning, he’s in my class.’ Another Twitter user - @AnyceDz, who is thought to have launched the hashtag - appeared on television to defend his classmate. He is reported to have said he got the bus in with Hamyd at 8am, and spent the 10am break with him, then took the bus with him just before midday. A Facebook group has also been set up in support of Hamyd – called ‘Hamyd Mourad est innocent’ – has more than 500 members who believe the teen is in no way connected to the massacre. But the school has not confirmed whether or not Hamyd was in class that day. Headteacher  Miguel Rubio declined to comment and told MailOnline: ‘I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you any more because there is an inquiry and so we must wait until the inquiry is closed to speak.’ A map showing the location of the Charlie Hebdo offices - and the town of Charleville-Mazires, on the border of Belgium, 144 miles away . Hamyd, who is still in custody, is believed to be the brother-in-law of one of the suspected terrorists currently on the run from police. According to public records, Hamyd’s sister Izzana - understood to be a nursery school teacher - is married to suspect Cherif Kouachi. Cherif, 32, and his brother Said, 34, are both the subject of a massive manhunt, after allegedly storming the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and killing 12 people. He and his family live on the 13th floor of an apartment block on the outskirts of Charleville-Mezieres, in a neighbourhood known for drug trafficking and vandalism. When MailOnline contacted the family to ask for comment on Hamyd, an angry woman shouted in response: ‘No, no we are not doing interviews.’ @AnyceDz tweeted Hamyd was 'the last person on earth who would support terrorism' However, neighbours in the Ronde Couture estate insisted they were a quiet family who were always friendly. One said: ‘They are a nice family, never a problem. Mourad is a nice boy, he was always polite and very friendly.’ Neighbours who spoke to local newspaper L'Ardennais, described Mourad as a young man 'without history'. They added he was a quiet teenager who was a 'moderate, who had never been about extremists'. Other pupils at the Lycée Monge said he 'would not hurt a fly' and added that the allegations he was involved in the massacre had ruined his name forever. This Twitter user says he is 'a good guy' whose name is being smeared for no reason . And Hamyd's friends say he was ‘a good guy’ and that there was ‘no way’ he was a radicalised Islamist. He is said to have been a popular and well-liked pupil at the school. A male teenager told MailOnline: ‘Mourad was a good guy, a nice kid. ‘We can’t believe what has happened. I think it is crazy to say he was involved with this horrible incident. There is no way he was part of this.’ Another friend, who only gave his name as Edea, added: 'Mourad is innocent, definitely. He is a good guy, a nice guy. We all like him.' Sabine, a teenager who knew Hamyd, openly laughed at the suggestion he was in any way involved with the horrific incident. She said: 'This is stupid. Anyone who knows Mourad knows that he has nothing to do with this. No way, no way. 'He is just a normal boy who likes normal stuff, he is not a terrorist.' People at the local mosque are also not convinced he could be a terrorist. At the Amcca mosque in Charleville-Mezieres, an elderly man who knows the Hamyd family also insisted Mourad was innocent. The man - who refused to give his name - said: 'They are a good family and Mourad is a good boy. Very tranquil and no problem. 'He prayed here before but not recently. I have not seen him recently. He has good character. 'There is no trouble with him at all, he has never had trouble with the police. 'I believe that he is innocent of these claims. This is not something that he is involved with.'","Hamyd handed himself into police after his name was circulated on Twitter .

"She's famous for her impeccable sense of style and Spain's Queen Letizia didn't disappoint as she joined forces with King Felipe for an audience at the Zarzuela Palace. The royal couple were hosting a discussion on the regularisation of Spanish train timetables as well as meeting charity bosses at the palace. But while the subject matter might have been dull, Letizia's ensemble certainly wasn't with her businesslike black trousers given a pop of cheerful colour with the help of a pretty cerise top. Looking good: Letizia was glamorous in a businesslike jacket and a pretty cerise top . Chic: She added a pop of colour to her otherwise sensible ensemble and chose her favourite purple . The colour is one of the 42-year-old's favourites and she is often seen sporting it - or variations on it - at official events. One that she didn't wear purple for was Monday's Epiphany Day celebrations, which see parades take place up and down the country. Known in Spain as El Día de los Reyes (Day of the Kings), it is celebrated with presents and colourful parades, the oldest of which takes place in Valencia. The biggest and most important, however, is Madrid's - thanks in no small part to the presence of a real king at the procession. Felipe was making his first appearance at an Epiphany Day parade since becoming king in June 2014 and follows a turbulent Christmas period for the Spanish royals. On the 20th December, it was announced that Felipe's older sister Infanta Cristina, 49, would go on trial for tax crimes. Important: The audience at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid included a discussion on train timetables . Pleased: The assembled dignitaries looked delighted to be included in a photo with the royal couple . New rules: King Felipe hopes to regain the respect of the Spanish people following a series of scandals . Royal salute: Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia watch the traditional Epiphany Day parade . Glamorous: Letizia began the new year in style and wore a floor-length teal dress for the occasion . Along with her husband, former handball player, Iñaki Urdangarín, the 49-year-old princess is one of 17 people charged with misusing funds donated to Mr Urdangardin's charity, the Noos Foundation. As a result, Cristina has been asked to keep a low profile, has not been allowed to undertake royal duties since 2011 and was conspicuous by her absence at Felipe's coronation. If convicted, which would be a first for Spain's royal family, she could face up to four years in prison as well as a multi-million pound fine. While Felipe and Letizia remain popular, the incident has led to the introduction of new rules designed to prevent a repeat of both the current scandal and the last two to affect his family - King Juan-Carlos' love of a freebie and the infamous 2009 photo in which he was pictured standing over an elephant he had shot. The rules, which also apply to Letizia and his two daughters, came into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'. Along with banning freebies, royals will be prevented from working in the private sector and all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.'

"Neutron stars are among the densest objects in the universe - just a spoonful of matter from one of them would weigh more than the moon. But inside these remarkable stellar objects, which are no bigger than a city on Earth, a remarkable process might be taking place. Scientists have revealed their matter might become so squashed that it turns into ‘strange matter’ - and observing so-called strange stars could unlock some of the secrets of the universe. Scientists at the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil say an undiscovered type of matter could be found in neutron stars (illustration shown). Here matter is so dense that it could be 'squashed' into strange matter. This would create an entire 'strange star' - unlike anything we have seen . The latest theory was proposed by Dr Pedro Moraes and Dr Oswaldo Miranda, both of the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil. They say that some types of neutron stars might be made of a new type of matter called strange matter. What the properties of this matter would be, though, are unknown - but it would likely be a ‘liquid’ of several types of sub-atomic particles. ‘Stars, galaxies, planets and even ourselves are made of the so-called baryonic matter,’ Dr Moraes explained to MailOnline. Quarks are elementary particles, the smallest particles we know to exist. When they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons that are grouped in two families - baryons and mesons. Quarks are said to have six ‘flavours’: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom (also known as 'beauty'). Combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘larger’ particles. Groups of three quarks are known as baryons. An example of a baryon is a proton, which is made of two 'up' quarks and a 'down' quark. ‘A baryon, which is a proton or a neutron, is made up of more fundamental particles, known as quarks. ‘There are six types (or flavours) of quarks. They are: up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom. ‘Depending on how these quarks are combined, different baryons will be formed. ‘For instance, two up quarks and one down quark form a proton while two down quarks and one up quark form a neutron.’ Inside a neutron star, however, Dr Moraes says the neutrons and protons of regular baryonic matter - the stuff that everything around us is made of - can be squeezed so intensely that it turns into a new type of matter - strange matter. It would look just like ordinary matter, but would be different to something like dark matter, as it could form physical objects. 'What differs ordinary matter from strange matter is basically the density,' said Dr Moraes. Inside a neutron star, Dr Moraes says the neutrons and protons of regular baryonic matter (protons and neutrons illustrated) - the stuff that everything around us is made of - can be squeezed so intensely that it turns into a new type of matter - strange matter . Atoms are usually made of protons, neutrons and electrons. These are made of even smaller elementary particles. Elementary particles, also known as fundamental particles, are the smallest particles we know to exist in the universe. They are subdivided into two groups, the first being fermions, which are said to be the particles that make up matter. The second are bosons, the force particles that hold the others together. Within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks. When quarks combine in threes, they form compound particles known as baryons. Protons are probably the best-known baryons. Sometimes, quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles (such as anti-quarks), which have the same mass but opposite charges. When this happens, they form mesons. Mesons often turn up in the decay of heavy man-made particles, such as those in particle accelerators, nuclear reactors and cosmic rays. Mesons, baryons, and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons. The only known way to find strange matter at the moment would be to confirm its existence within neutron stars. On Earth, it is currently impossible to directly observe strange matter, even in places like the Large Hadron Collider at Cern in Switzerland. Pictured is the Large Hadron Collider Beauty experiment (LHCb) ‘As its name says, a neutron star is a star made up of neutrons - which are made up of two down and one up quarks,’ Dr Moraes continued. ‘It is a star of very high density and rapid rotation rate. Most of them have masses close to 1.3-1.4 solar masses.’ Most matter we see comes in two ‘flavours’, made up of just two types of fundamental particles - up and down quarks. When the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life, protons and electrons are literally scrunched together, leaving behind one of nature's most wondrous creations: a neutron star. Neutron stars cram roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city-sized sphere perhaps 12 miles (20 kilometers) across. Matter is packed so tightly that a sugar-cube-sized amount of material would weigh more than 1 billion tons, about the same as Mount Everest. But in these extreme conditions a rare type of three-flavour matter, made of up, down and strange quarks, could be being created. This is what strange matter would be. And Dr Moraes says, if the neutron star is massive enough and rotating at a fast enough speed, the entire star could be made of this matter. The star would be much smaller and lighter than a neutron star. For example, a neutron star with a mass 0.2 times that of the sun would have a radius greater than nine miles (15km), but a strange star of the same mass would be less than a third the size. One of the implications of the theory, if true, would be that there might be more types of matter in the universe than we know of. Dr Moraes says, as we cannot observe individual fundamental particles like quarks on Earth, the only way to prove strange matter’s existence would be to spot it in a neutron star. Interestingly, though, proving that strange stars exist could also provide a detection for one of the ‘holy grails’ of astronomy - gravitational waves. Dr Moraes says the interaction of a neutron star and a strange star (illustration shown) could create ripples in space-times, resulting in gravitational waves. These are one of the 'holy grails' of astronomy that have been impossible to detect in other experiments so far . Gravitational waves are said to be ripples in space-time caused by the interaction of massive objects in the universe. However, their existence has been hard to prove, despite numerous attempts to find them. Dr Moraes says that, if strange stars exist, they could be interacting with regular neutron stars in binary systems and producing these noticeable effects. Observing such a system could result in a ‘gravitational wave detection,’ said Dr Moraes, ‘which is one of the most challenging experimental breakthroughs of the century.’ For now, just the existence of strange matter and stars themselves would be hugely interesting. It would suggest there are objects in the universe that are far beyond our current understanding.","Scientists at the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil say an undiscovered type of matter could be found in neutron stars .

"Outspoken politician Jacqui Lambie has spoken out against self-styled WA sheik Junaid Thorne for his comments regarding the Paris terrorist attacks, calling for him to be jailed for treason. Ms Lambie has branded Thorne, who is in his 20's, as a 'mongrel' for suggesting that insults to the Prophet Mohammed are 'not allowed' and 'very likely to stimulate some kind of response'. In a statement, Ms Lambie blamed previous  governments for failing to protect Australian citizens against these type of extremists living amongst us. Outspoken politician Jacqui Lambie has spoken out against self-styled WA sheik Junaid Thorne for his comments regarding the Paris terrorist attacks, calling for him to be jailed for treason . 'There are now Australian citizens (like the mongrel in WA) who brazenly, express public sympathy and support for the actions of the Islamic extremists,' Ms Lambie said. Junaid Thorne, who spent 14-years growing up in Saudi Arabia, took to social media after the Paris killings, claiming that the victims has failed to learn from the Charlie Hebdo office firebombings in 2011. 'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' he said. Mohammed Junaid Thorne, pictured, is a self-styled sheikh in his mid-20s. He is pictured here in front of a banner for the little known radical group, Millatu-Ibrahim . According to Lambie, there are more than 20 Australian citizens fighting for Islamic state and there are at least 100 Islamic state Australian citizen supporters who are living among us. 'I suspect many more, given the growing public support that Islamic groups now give for the imposition of the extremist Sharia Law in Australia,' she said. Ms Lambie called for Thorne and other extremists living in Australia to be tried for treason before they 'seek to impose their culture on us - or kill us'. Thorne, pictured taking a selfie, grew up in Saudi Arabia with his brother, Shayden, and his father, who found a job in the country . 'These savages hate our democratic way of life, which attempts to accommodate difference of political opinion, thought, freedom of speech and religion, while trying to respect basic human rights,' she said. 'So the time has come for ordinary Australians to wake up. The time has come for the Abbott Government to act swiftly and deal decisively with these traitorous individuals.' Thorne moved to Saudi Arabia with his brother Shayden and his father, an Indigenous man of the Noongar clan, when he was nine-years-old. Lecturer: Thorne claims he could recite the Koran by the age of six. He was deported from Saudi Arabia in 2012 and moved back to Perth, where his mother lives . His father found a job in the country after divorcing Thorne's mother, a Malaysian Muslim who lives in Perth. Growing up in the devout family, Thorne claims he could recite the Koran by the age of six. However, life in Saudi Arabia was not without difficulty. His brother was imprisoned for allegedly possessing terrorism-related material on a lap top, according to reports, and remained imprisoned for two-and-a-half years when he was granted clemency. Junaid was deported to Australia after protesting his detention in 2012. Brothers: Thorne was deported for protesting the detention of his brother, Shayden (right), who was eventually granted clemency on terrorism charges in Saudi Arabia . Younger Muslim figure: Thorne told the ABC younger Muslims were often more comfortable bringing their problems to him than more senior figures . After returning to Australia, Thorne began to tour the country, delivering lectures about Islam in front of the flag of a little known radical group known as Millatu Ibrahim, which is banned in Germany. He also delivered talks about how to 'exorcise jinn' - or genies - which he said are affecting people across the country. Over the past six months, the self-styled sheikh has become a controversial figure. He branded Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' after police swooped on properties across in Sydney in September. He has been outspoken in defence of some of his associates and supporters, including terror suspects Abdul Numan Haider, 18, and Sulayman Khalid, 20.","Jacqui Lambie believes self-styled WA sheik Junaid Thorne should be charged with treason .

"A Pakistani entrepreneur has opened a beauty salon to help rehabilitate the female survivors of acid attacks who are 'usually left to rot in their houses like vegetables'. Mussarat Misbah founded the Depilex Smile Again Foundation in Lahore, Pakistan, to help victims become self-reliant members of the community following their horrific ordeal. The foundation's aim is to provide the women with medical and psychological care and help them gain confidence and employment. Scroll down for video . Second chance: Acid attack victims can train to the beauticians thanks to the Depilex Smile Again Foundation . Support: Founder Mussarat Misbah, left, has helped around 600 women rebuild their lives so far . Proactive: Misbah, pictured centre in pink, said she knew she had to do something to help the women who are 'usually left to rot in their houses like vegetables' Work opportunities can be few and far between for survivors who are often 'treated like modern day lepers'. Over the last decade, Misbah has helped around 600 women, with most electing to be trained as beauticians as they feel safe in the female-only world. Others have been given the support they need to start their own businesses. Misbah said she knew she had to do something to help the young women who are disfigured in attacks often linked to family disputes, sexism or misogyny. Employment options: The salon in Lahore, Pakistan, is giving burns victims job opportunities in a society where they are often 'treated like lepers' Team work: Misbah with acid attack victims Anisha Zoya, left, and Bushra Shafi at the reception of her salon . Moved to action: Misbah was inspired to set up the foundation after she met a burns victim in 2003 . Not hiding away: Bushra Shafi said thanks to Misbah she now has the confidence 'to face the world' She knew they needed more than just surgery to get their lives back on track. She said: 'On average they need to go through 25 surgeries to make them look better and then I also realised that giving them surgeries is not helping their misery, is not helping their pain because they are left to rot in their houses like vegetables. 'They are treated like modern day lepers.' The philanthropist said she was moved to start the foundation following an encounter with an acid attack victim in 2003. She said: 'As I was about to leave my office, a young girl walked in and she was wearing a veil and she asked me to help her and I thought maybe maybe she's one of those girls who's asking for financial help and support. Life changed forever: Aneesha Zoya before left, and after being the victim of an acid attack . Ordeal: Misbah knew that women like Zoya, pictured, needed more than just surgery to help them recover . 'I asked her to come the next day as I was going home and then she removed her veil and that was the day which changed my life. 'The girl in front of me was a woman without a face. She had lost her eyes, she had lost her nose, her neck was contracted to her chest.' Aneesha Zoya and Bushra Shafi are both acid attack survivors who work in the salon. Aneesha said: 'After this tragedy of getting burnt, I had a feeling that I am not the same person anymore. I stopped venturing out of my house. I stopped meeting people as well. I stopped attending any gatherings and functions. Bushra Shafi said she stopped venturing out of the house after her face was disfigured by a horrific acid attack, pictured before left and after right . 'After coming here, Mussarat Misbah helped me a lot. First she made me undergo surgeries for my face and then I did a course to become a beautician.' Bushra added: 'After coming here, my life changed completely. She taught me confidence. She taught me how to face the world. 'She made me believe that I have the ability to cope with anything and anyone. It boosted my self-confidence so that I could lead my life in a better way.' Acid attacks continue to be a problem in Pakistan, with women burned for everything from having a female child to offering too small a dowry. Fresh start: The salon is helping the women regain confidence and happiness . Misbah said: 'Making laws will never curb a crime, it will never stop a crime, it's only the implementation which is important and how do we do that? The government has to take stern actions against these perpetrators.* . 'Sometimes it seems the incidents are on a decrease then all of a sudden you will see in one month there are five girls been attacked with acid. So I think there is much more than what is being reported. 'To me, these girls are our heroes. You must salute them.'","Pakistani entrepreneur has opened a beauty salon in Lahore .

"House Republicans announced plans Friday to take broad aim at President Barack Obama's immigration policies and eliminate protections for immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids. The legislation to be voted on next week satisfies demands from the most conservative lawmakers and goes further than the approach initially discussed by some House Republicans. That approach would have targeted only the executive actions Obama announced in November that provided deportation protections for millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Conservatives in the GOP caucus pressed leadership to go further and also shut down a 2012 program that has granted work permits to more than 600,000 immigrants brought here illegally as kids. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has unified his GOP caucus behind a proposal to gut President Barack Obama's immigration plan; it remains to be seen what the Senate will do . The president is determined to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants but Republicans have pledged to stop him and now have majorities in both houses of Congress . Ending the program would eventually expose those young people to deportation. Other changes would undo Obama directives to immigration agents aimed at limiting deportations of people with no significant criminal record. 'The American people were expecting the leadership to step up to the plate and not just make some symbolic gesture in trying to address what the president did back in November, but try to go a step further,' said Alabama Republican Rep. Robert Aderholt. 'That's what our language does and that's what at the end of the day I think will garner a lot of support among our colleagues.' But the outcome won't have the support of a handful of moderates in the caucus, including lawmakers representing heavily Latino districts. 'We've got to deal with immigration, immigration as a whole. Reforming our system across the nation,' said California GOP Rep. Jeff Denham. 'Just picking on the children that came here through no fault of the own I think is the wrong way to start. ' The vote will come on a $39.7 billion spending bill to keep the Homeland Security Department running past February. Lawmakers said the goal is to keep the agency running on full funding – an especially critical goal in the wake of the Paris terror attacks – while at the same time blocking Obama's administrative moves on immigration. Obama's directives in November gave temporary relief from deportation to about 4 million immigrants in the country illegally, mostly those who'd been in the country more than five years and have kids who are citizens or legal permanent residents. The earlier program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, applied to certain immigrants brought here illegally as kids, known as 'Dreamers' by their supporters. The immigration fight is coming to a head as Congress wraps up its first week of work for the year after convening under full Republican control. Republicans deliberately kept the Homeland Security Department on a short leash when they passed a full-year spending bill for all other government agencies late last year, so that they could deal with Obama's immigration moves with more Republicans on Capitol Hill. Yet the dynamic does not have appeared to have shifted much. Even though Republicans now command a larger House majority, the biggest in decades, giving Speaker John Boehner more room to maneuver, leadership still catered to the most conservative lawmakers in crafting the immigration bill, as happened several times in the last Congress. Indeed, some of the same conservatives who voted against Boehner for speaker in a failed overthrow attempt this week were cheering loudest Friday at the shape the legislation was taking. COLD: Capitol Hill is getting chillier, both in its weather and in the mood indoors, as vastly outnumbered Democrats struggle to figure out how to stop a GOP legislative onslaught . 'I liked what I heard,' Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert said after a closed-door meeting to discuss the legislation. 'I really appreciate the process of allowing all of us to have some input,' said Gohmert, a frequent critic of House Republican leaders. 'One of the things that has really been lacking for the last eight years is having more input like we've finally gotten in this bill, so this is a good thing.' And even with the Senate under GOP control,  minority Democrats still exercise considerable sway, and there's no guarantee senators will agree to the House legislation. Even if they did, Obama could very well threaten to veto it. That leaves the ultimate outcome of the legislative dispute unclear. At the same time, Democrats say Republicans are courting electoral disaster in the 2016 presidential election by passing legislation that could alienate many Latino voters. 'It's nothing short of breathtaking that their first move coming out of the gate in 2015 is to attack immigrants and their families,' said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigrant advocacy group.","Conservatives got  budget language that attacks the White House's latest executive actions along with Obama's 2012 'deferred' deportation order .

"While some women may be embarking on diets and exercise plans this January in the hope of obtaining their dream bikini body, one mother-of-four has taken more extreme measures. Tracey Belger, 43, from Flitwick, Beds, has spent £8,000 on a tummy tuck and liposuction because she hated her bulging belly. After having her four children, now aged 22, 20, 16 and 11, Tracey struggled to find clothes to fit her 'ridiculous' figure as she had a size 18 stomach but slim size 8 legs. Scroll down for video . Full of confidence: Tracey Belger, 43, in a rare photo taken before her surgery, left, and proud to show off her bikini body, right, following the four-hour procedure . Banish the belly: The mother-of-four hated her protruding size 18 stomach so decided to go under the knife . Her flabby stomach made her feel self-conscious and unhappy. She said: 'My belly just dwarfed my legs and the rest of my frame - I looked ridiculous and I completely lost my confidence. 'I was constantly comparing myself to everyone around me - at family events and parties all I could think was how great while I was just the frumpy mum in the corner.' She added: 'I thought I would never have my photo taken or be able to go to family events again I was so lacking in confidence. 'I would never be photographed - I just absolutely refused because I was so embarrassed by my big bloated stomach. 'As soon as the camera appeared I would run out of shot or turn the other way so I didn't have to feature in people's albums or on Facebook.' Drastic measures: Tracey spent £8000 to have a tummy tuck and liposuction where two litres of fat would be sucked from her stomach . Flat stomach: Now Tracey has a size 8 figure but she needed hypnotherapy in order to go through with the plastic surgery . Tracey decided to pay more than £8000 to have a tummy tuck and liposuction at Linia Cosmetic Surgery where two litres of fat would be sucked from her stomach. However, she was terrified about going under the knife so she turned to her hypnotherapist husband, Paul, for help. Paul, 48, gave his wife a number of hypnotherapy sessions to make her feel more relaxed about her operation. Speaking of her determination to have the surgery despite her fears, Tracey said: 'I knew that if I had my surgery in August I would be back in slim fit size 8 trousers by November and feeling ready to slip on a glamorous dress in time for party season. 'It meant that I could start 2015 with a bang and finally be in the limelight, instead of always hiding in the background. Confidence boost: Before the surgery, left, Tracey said she hated seeing pictures of herself but she was keen to show off her new figure before the dressings had even been removed, right, afterwards . 'I'd really wanted to do something about my tummy for years but I was terrified of surgery and even though I'd booked the operation date, two days before I was having sleepless nights terrified that I would wake up mid-way through. 'That's when my husband suggested I try hypnotherapy through his clinic Develop 2 Prosper. He's never hypnotised me before but within a couple of hours it was sorted.' As a result of her husband's help, Tracey was able to have her procedures with just a local anaesthetic and not even sedation. Look at me! Now Tracey says she loves having her picture taken . Snap happy: The mother pictured with one of her four children said now she's 'desperate to get into the frame of every photo taken just to show off how great I look and feel' She said: 'I waltzed into the surgery without a care in the world. The liposuction wasn't painful at all - just ticklish!' As a result of the four hour abdominoplasty and liposuction, Tracey says she has never felt better and has gone from wanting to hide away to keen to flaunt her new figure. She said: 'We went to a family Christmas gathering and people said straightaway they could see the difference, physically and in my personality. 'I was desperate to get into the frame of every photo taken just to show off how great I look and feel.

"A father-of-two has been jailed after RSPCA officials discovered the maggot-infested bodies of his two dogs in a locked bedroom where they had been starved to death. Jamie Broadbent forced the animals into one of the rooms in his home in Burnley, Lancashire, after deciding he could not afford to feed them on the fortnightly £84-a-week benefits he received. The 29-year-old ignored their scratches on the door and cries for attention, leaving their bodies to rot for more than a week. Dogs Cassie and Roxy were locked in a room at their owner's home and left to die. When RSPCA officials discovered them, their bodies had become maggot-infested . He was jailed for 12 weeks and banned from owning a pet for 10 years. Burnley Magistrates Court heard how Broadbent left a bag of dry dog food with German Shepherd Roxy and Cassie, a terrier, before removing the door handle used to access the room. The unemployed father-of-two did not leave any water for the animals which died of dehydration. Scratches on the door and dirty marks on the window pane of the living room were indicators of the dogs' desperate attempts to survive, an RSPCA prosecutor told the court. 'The German Shepherd was severely decomposed with a large number of maggots. He had been dead for at least 10 days. 'The Terrier had been dead for around seven days,' said Christopher Wyatt. 'He said he could not afford to feed them, and that they perhaps died through a lack of water because he didn't give them enough.' Jamie Broadbent (left) was jailed for 12 weeks after admitting causing unnecessary harm to the animals.

The 29-year-old left both animals to die after deciding he could not afford to feed them . 'It seems bizarre that after watching one dog die you would sit back and watch another die and if it was just a case of lack of water, he could have easily remedied that.' Broadbent, who admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs, had displayed 'long' neglected the animals, said magistrates. 'There was a long neglect resulting in the death of one dog followed by the death of a second dog and we feel you should have acted on the death of the first dog. 'There were signs of distress and scratches on the door. There were children sometimes in the house and you went to the trouble of taking the door handle off and you left knowing that the dogs were dead.

"Nebraska's highest court threw out on Friday a suit challenging the proposed pathway of the Keystone XL pipeline, putting the decision to approve or deny a permit to build the conduit squarely on the shoulders of President Barack Obama and his administration. The State Department and the White House had used the outstanding court case as cover to indefinitely block new construction on the transnational oil transportation system owned by company TransCanada. With the legal matter resolved, President Obama must decide once and for all whether to allow TransCanada to proceed as planned on building the XL portion of the pipeline. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama is pictured here today leaving the White House. A Nebraska court threw out this morning a lawsuit challenging the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline, putting the decision squarely on the Obama administration's shoulders . President Obama met on Wednesday with Secretary of State John Kerry, left, Vice President Joe Biden, center left, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, right, in the Oval Office. It is now up to Kerry's State Department to decide whether pipeline construction can proceed or to the White House to sign congressional legislation giving the project the green light . If given the go ahead by the U.S. government, the XL portion of the pipeline would travel from Hardisty, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska, by way of Montana and South Dakota. From there it extends down to the United States' southern border, splitting off in Texas to come to a head in Houston and Port Arthur, Louisiana. Obama has already said he would veto bipartisan legislation poised to pass in Congress giving the XL portion of the project the green light. However that veto threat was partly predicated on the uncertain route of the pipeline and the White House wouldn't commit this week to issuing a blanket rejection of Keystone. 'Once that is resolved, that should speed the completion of the evaluation of that project,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday. A spokesman for the president confirmed on Friday, though, that the president's position remains unchanged. 'Regardless of the Nebraska ruling today, the House bill still conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures…and if presented to the president, he will veto the bill,' Obama spokesman Eric Schultz said today, per The Hill. The president appeared skeptical at a press conference last month of Keystone backers' claims that a new segment of pipeline would lead to a significant drop in gas prices and large scale job creation. 'It’s very good for Canadian oil companies and it’s good for the Canadian oil industry. But it’s not going to be a huge benefit to U.S consumers. It’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers,' Obama told reporters. 'I’ve just tried to give this perspective because I think there’s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the U.S. economy, and it’s hard to see on paper where they’re getting their information from,' he said. Obama is also uneasy about the amount of carbon pollution the pipeline would indirectly bring about, the White House has said. 'As we see weather disasters worsen, as we see in the form of wildfires or more severe hurricanes, that only adds to costs. So the President does harbor those concerns,' Earnest said earlier this week. This overall map of the proposed 1,179 mile crude oil pipeline shows the already built portion of Keystone as well as the XL portion currently under review by the State Department. The XL pipeline is denoted by the dashed blue line . Another factor in the White House's decision to wave off Congress' attempts to fast track Keystone is that 'there’s already a well-established process in place to consider whether or not infrastructure projects like this are in the best interest of the country. 'In previous administrations when pipeline projects like this were considered they were evaluated by the State Department and other experts in the administration to reach a determination about whether or not that project was in the national interest,' Earnest said earlier this week. The White House said today that it would wait for State to finish its review before Obama comes to his own conclusion. 'The president believes the process should unfold at the State Department,' Schultz told reporters traveling with Obama today on his trip to Tennessee. The State Department has been reviewing Keystone since 2008. In 2012 President Obama rejected the initial route put forward for the XL pipeline and sent TransCanada back to the drawing board. Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman OK'd those plans the following January but a legal challenge put pipeline construction in limbo for the last two years. At the beginning of 2014, the State Department issued an environmental impact study that concluded that the pipeline would have minimal effects on carbon pollution. It also found that even if the pipeline were permanently shutdown, the crude oil it carries would most likely be transported through other means, then burned, and the same carbon emissions would eventually end up in the atmosphere one way or another. State was in the middle of conducting a 90-day review period, in which other government agencies could weigh in on the department's report, when it suddenly put a halt to the procedure, citing the legal battle in Nebraska. 'The Nebraska Supreme Court decision could lead to changes in the pipeline route, and it’s important to have that information and better understand that route, because it could have implications for environmental, socioeconomic and cultural impacts of the pipeline,' a State Department official told reporters during an April conference call, according to the New York Times. It was the second time the federal agency had delayed the process, having postponed a decision in 2011 until after the next year's elections. It attributed that hold up to the dispute over the route as well. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin,  a Democratic sponsor of the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline bill, flanked by Minnesota Sen. Al Franken to his right, makes his plea at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee markup on the controversial project on Thursday. With Manchin's help, Senate Republicans may be able to rally enough of their colleagues across the aisle to overturn a presidential veto . The government agency must now move forward with its review and Secretary of State John Kerry, and ultimately, the president, must determine whether or not to side with environmentalists, who strongly oppose Keystone, and Democrats on Capitol Hill begging him to allow construction on the final portion of the pipeline to begin. Congress has tried to needle the president for months to give his blessing to Keystone. A dozen Senate Democrats wrote to Obama last year warning that if his administration didn't speed up its review they would be left with little choice but to intervene legislatively. Last month a bill approving Keystone died in the upper chamber after it fell a single vote short of overcoming a procedural hurdle. The lead sponsors of the bill, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican, and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, now say they have the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation. And while they still have more lobbying to do, the pair believes they may be able to persuade enough Democrats to support the bill to cancel out a presidential veto. The Senate is expected to take a preliminary head count on the measure on Monday and will likely take a final vote early next week. The House approved Keystone on a vote of 266-153 this afternoon, attracting the support of 28 Democratic members, more than twice as many as voted for it in December. But nearly four dozen Democrats would have to sign onto the legislation to defy Obama's promised veto. Capitol Hill Republicans attempted on Friday to pressure Obama to change his mind, with members demanding that he stop making 'excuses.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Nebraska decision provides the 'perfect opportunity' for Obama to 'reverse his veto threat.' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement that he president 'is now out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline and the thousands of American jobs it would create.' 'Finally, it’s time to start building,' the GOP leader said. Newly minted Senate Energy Chair Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Obama's 'had six years to approve a project that will increase U.S. energy supplies and create closer ties with our nearest ally and neighbor, and he’s refused to act. 'Regardless of whatever new excuse he may come up with, Congress is moving forward,' she said. For their part, progressive groups hammered Republicans today over the zeal with which they have pursued Keystone legislation and again urged Obama to reject TransCanada's permit. 'The eleventh vote by House Republicans to force approval really begs the question: Why are Republicans so obsessed with Keystone XL?' Elijah Zarlin, senior campaigner at CREDO, said in statement this afternoon. 'It's not about gas prices or jobs, it primarily benefits Canadian oil companies at the cost of American land, water, and scorching our climate,' he claimed. 'The Republicans work for the American people, not Canadian oil companies. It's time they start acting like it and drop their obsessive Keystone XL fetish.' Danielle Droitsch, Canada Project director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said today's ruling clears the way for Obama - and only Obama - to decide whether the 'dirty tar sands pipeline is in the national interest.' 'The ruling doesn’t make it right for the Congress to act as a permitting agency, usurp presidential authority or short-circuit the president’s obligation to decide whether the pipeline is good for the country,' she said. 'It’s not. It needs to be denied.'","Nebraska's highest court threw out on Friday a suit challenging the proposed pathway of the XL portion of the pipeline .

"A journalist has revealed how the terrorists who massacred her Charlie Hebdo colleagues spared her life - because she was a woman. Reporter Sigolene Vinson survived the brutal attack on the French satirical magazine, in which 12 people including six of her co-workers and two police officers were shot dead. She told Radio France Internationale that one of the killers held a gun to her head, but decided against killing her too. Miss Vinson said the one of the shooters told her: 'I'm not killing you because you are a woman and we don't kill women but you have to convert to Islam, read the Qu'ran and wear a veil.' She added that the men shouted 'Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar' as they fled the scene. Charlie Hebdo magazine staff thought a terrorist attack on their offices was a 'joke' involving fire crackers before being gunned down in cold blood, it emerged today. Scroll down for video .

Shocking: The chilling image from the Charlie Hebdo office shows blood-stained wooden floors, papers strewn across the corridor . Survivor: Charlie Hebdo journalist, Laurent Leger (pictured), who survived the shooting said they initially thought the attack was a 'hoax' Audacious: Mr Leger (pictured) said he and his colleagues mistook the gunfire for 'fire-crackers' Gone: Six of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and staff members killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . Chilling new details of the Paris massacre emerged as police resumed the nationwide manhunt for the two French Algerian brothers believed to be responsible. Cherif and Said Kouachi have now spent almost two whole days on the run since Wednesday morning's atrocity, which claimed 12 lives. Today survivor Laurent Leger, a Charlie Hebdo journalist who was in the room where most of the victims were slaughtered, told how some were laughing when they first heard shots. 'We thought it was a joke, that it was fire crackers' said Mr Leger. 'Then we heard footsteps. The door opened. A guy shouted 'Allahu Akbar' (God is Great) Referring to French police special forces units, Mr Leger said: 'He looked like a GIGN and RAID guy, he was hooded. He was all in black. He had a gun he was holding with both hands.' Mr Leger said he saw 'barbarism enter the newspaper' as the terrorists called out the name 'Charb', referring to editor Stephane Charbonnier, one of those killed. 'They called out the name of Charb, yes. But after that they fired into the group,' said Mr Leger, who said he threw himself under a table to get away from the gunman and 'escaped his eyes.' The shooter then turned to his accomplice, with Mr Leger saying: 'He said he thought he had killed everybody, but did not kill women.' The suspected killers are described as 'extremely dangerous and likely to kill again'. Armed response: French special forces rush to the scene of a hostage-taking at an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele, where the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen are holed up in a printing business amid firefights with police . Suspects: The three men were named as Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, his brother Said Kouachi (right), 34, and Hamyd Mourad, 18, of Gennevilliers .

Hunt: Armed police train their weapons on a building where the the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen are holed up with a hostage as they sit in a helicopter over the village of Dammartin-en-Goele . A third man who gunned down a woman police officer in south Paris on Thursday with an automatic rifle while wearing body armour has also disappeared. It emerged today that Paris-born Said, 34, travelled to Yemen as recently as 2011, where he was trained by an Al Qaeda affiliate in marksmanship and other combat skills. Both French and American officials were aware Said was inspired by Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric who ran Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Before he was killed in an American drone strike in September 2011, al-Awlaki often called for the killing of Charlie Hebdo cartoonists who insulted the Prophet Mohammad. The Kouachi brothers made it clear they were taking vengeance for the provocative images, slaughtering the magazine's editor and three other cartoonists. Despite this, the magazine today announced it would publish a million copies of a new issue next week.","Terrorist ordered Sigolene Vinson to convert to Islam and 'read the Qu'ran'

"A tiny purple sweater is being credited with protecting a Chihuahua puppy from a raging fire that destroyed her owners' home in California earlier this week. Firefighters responded Wednesday at around 8am to a house fire in the 3300 block of West Camille Street in Santa Ana. The family living in the house were able to escape, but their 6-month-old Chihuahua named Mellie was left behind on the front porch, where she was tied by her leash. Scroll down for video . Lucky dog! This 6-month-old Chihuahua named Mellie escaped a house fire with relatively minor injuries thanks to the purple sweater she had on, which protected her body . Inferno: An electrical malfunction sparked a giant blaze inside this home in Santa Ana, California, Wednesday . As first responders were working to extinguish the 50-foot-high flames consuming the structure, Mellie came out running after the fire burnt through her tether, officials told KCAL. 'The first thing that I noticed was that it had a little sweater on that was literally melted to its fur,' Santa Ana Police Department Animal Services Supervisor Sondra Berg told KTLA. 'The sweater was so crisp it was almost like plastic on the outer layer.' Berg sliced off the knitwear with a knife, to reveal Mellie's body underneath almost entirely untouched by the flames. The puppy did suffer third-degree burns to her exposed tail and paws, and her whiskers were also singed off. The lucky dog was taken to the 17th Street Animal Hospital, where veterinarians offered to treat Mellie free of charge, as her owners could not afford to pay for her care after having lost everything in the fire. Great escape: Mellie had been trapped on the porch, surrounded by 50-foot flames, but she was able to escape to safety after the fire burned through her leash . New leash on life: Dr. David Weber (left) confirmed that the Chihuahua owes her life that the wee knitted outfit she had on; Mellie is expected to make a full recovery .

Dr. David Weber confirmed that the Chihuahua owes her life to the wee knitted outfit she had on at the time of the blaze. She is expected to make a full recovery. It is believed that the fire was sparked by an electrical malfunction. It took firefighters about an hour to put out the flames. The inferno, which impacted two homes, caused an estimated $175,000 in property damage and displaced more than a dozen members of two families, among them six children. The family living in the rear house also lost $80,000 worth of possessions, including collectibles, reported the OC Register. In addition, the fire also destroyed an SUV parked on the property. Mellie's owner was treated for anxiety symptoms she experienced after seeing her dog's injuries.","Electrical fire ravaged two houses in Santa Ana, California, trapping 6-month-old Chihuahua named Mellie on front porch .

"The first private healthcare operator to run an NHS hospital trust is to pull out of the deal, claiming it is 'no longer sustainable' due to funding cuts, and unprecedented pressure on A&E services. Circle Holdings was hailed a 'miracle cure' for the NHS when it took over hospitals in Cambridgeshire in 2012, as rates of patient happiness soared and waiting times plummeted. At the time, experts said the system in place at Hinchingbrooke could be used in dozens of other struggling NHS trusts. But  the operator will now pull out of the deal - a move that will cost it an extra £2m. The private company which turned failing Hinchingbrooke Hospital (pictured) in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, into an award-winner is set to pull out of running services,  blaming soaring costs and funding cuts . Circle Holdings said the level of cash it had pumped in to prop up Hinchingbrooke healthcare trust in Cambridgeshire was about to reach £5 million, meaning it would have the right to terminate the franchise. It pointed to 'significant changes in the operational landscape for NHS hospitals' since the contract was first procured in 2009. Circle said there had been unprecedented increases in A&E attendances and a lack of care places for patients awaiting discharge. Meanwhile, funding had been cut by 10.1 per cent this financial year, it said. The company said these conditions had 'significantly worsened in recent weeks'. It has already pumped £4.84 million into the trust and would be 'highly likely' to have to make further support payments that would breach the £5 million cap, it said. It also said it was facing an imminent report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) which it expected to be 'unbalanced'. Circle began operating Hinchingbrooke in February 2012, the first time the management of an NHS trust had been delegated to a private company. Hinchingbrooke, which is in Huntingdon and serves 160,000 patients, was described as a ‘financial and clinical basket case’ by then health minister Earl Howe in November 2011. It had run up debts of £40million while letting standards plummet. It was among the lowest ranking trusts in the region for patient satisfaction. Waiting time in accident and emergency regularly exceeded four hours and every target for suspected cancer patients to be seen within a fortnight had been missed since June 2010. The Royal College of Surgeons branded the 369-bed hospital ‘dysfunctional’. Hinchingbrooke Hospital is in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, and serves 160,000 patients . Circle took over in February 2012 – the first private contract for an NHS hospital – on a ten-year deal and quickly saw results. In an extraordinary turnaround, last May it was voted top in the country for patient care. It topped a ranking of 46 trusts in the Midlands and East Anglia for A&E waiting times, with 98.2 per cent of patients seen within the required window. It was fifth for referrals for cancer tests. The firm also saved millions of pounds a year by cutting out arduous paperwork and middle management. Under the former ownership, a lengthy form had to be filled out every time a lightbulb needed changing, in a process that often took more than a week. A key to the transformation was loosening the grip of managers and accountants. The majority of the 15 board members are now clinicians. Doctors, nurses and admin staff were put into small groups with representatives who meet senior managers twice a month to flag up problems. Nurses could recommend that consultants adjust the way they worked and any problems reported by patients had to be dealt with within three weeks . It warned in August that changes to funding mechanisms had left 'uncertainty over Hinchingbrooke's profitability over the next year' though it said its 'patient-centred and innovative approach should ensure the long-term sustainability of the contract'. But it spelled the end of the venture in a statement today. It said: 'Circle today announces that it has determined that its franchise to operate Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust is no longer sustainable under current terms. 'It has entered into discussions with the NHS Trust Development Authority (TDA) with the view to ensuring an orderly withdrawal from the current contract.' Circle defended its running of the hospital, saying that it had been transformed since the 2012 takeover when it was described as a 'basket case' facing closure.

It said it had invested in the quality of care, in staff and facilities and won a number of awards, while meeting key measures including low mortality rates, 'excellent' patient feedback and waiting time targets. In the first two years of the franchise, it had made financial savings well above the NHS average. It said it had saved the taxpayer £23 million. Circle said Hinchingbrooke was one of the first hospitals to be inspected under a new process by the CQC. 2011: Hinchingbrooke hospital was among the lowest ranking for satisfaction and was £40 million in debt. The then health minister Earl Howe called it a ‘financial and clinical basket case’ by then health minister Earl Howe in November 2011. 2012: Circle takes over the running of Hinchingbrooke Healthcare NHS Trust. It said it's 'John-Lewis-style model' which empowers doctors, nurses and staff to deliver better care could 'transform services'. 2013: Circle reduced the annual £10million deficit to £3.5million in its first year, and made up the deficit with its own money . 2014: Hinchingbrooke hospital wins major health award after being voted top in the country for patient care. Areas assessed included mortality levels, readmission rates and speed in dealing with cancer cases. Circle says it said it had saved the taxpayer £23 million. 2015: Circle is set to pull out of running the hospital trust, claiming it is 'no longer sustainable' due to funding cuts and pressure on its casualty department. 'We understand the CQC report will be published soon, and expect it to be both unbalanced and to disagree with many of its conclusions. 'We are not the only hospital to find their process problematic, and believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenge for acute hospitals in the current environment.' Circle said that under the terms of its contract it could be required to make a final support payment of £160,000 to Hinchingbrooke, bringing the total to the capped £5 million level. It said it was also obliged to cover the costs of up to £2 million of terminating the franchise and procuring a new operator. Further details on discussions with the TDA would be made 'in due course' and Circle said it expected to provide an update at its trading statement next month. Chief executive Steve Melton said: 'Like most hospitals, over the past year Hinchingbrooke saw unprecedented A&E attendances and not enough care places for healthy patients awaiting discharge. 'At the same time, our funding has been cut. 'We also believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenge for acute hospitals in this environment. 'This combination of factors means we have now reluctantly concluded that, in its existing form, Circle's involvement in Hinchingbrooke is unsustainable.' Chairman Michael Kirkwood said: 'Circle remains a committed partner of the NHS at our elective treatment centres and independent hospitals. 'Our clinician-led and employee co-owned model has a proven track record of efficiency and quality improvement, and we will continue to play a substantial role in the NHS.'","Circle  to pull out of running Hinchingbrooke Healthcare NHS Trust .

"A Saudi blogger underwent the first round of 50 lashes in public while shackled in chains for 'ridiculing Islamic religious figures'. Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 1,000 lashes and a decade in prison for insulting Islam on his online forum. The start of his corporal punishment began after prayers today outside the Al-Juffali mosque in the city of Jiddah, which has earned the grisly nickname 'Chop Chop Square' as the site of executions. Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, underwent the first round of 50 lashes in public . Reports from the scene said Mr Badawi arrived at the mosque in a police car and had the charges read out to him in front of a crowd. He was then made to stand with his back to onlookers and whipped, though he remained silent throughout the ordeal. In a statement, Amnesty International said: 'He was removed from a bus in shackles and brought to the public square in front of the mosque. 'Surrounded by a crowd made up of the public and a number of security officers, he received 50 consecutive lashes on his back. 'The whole ordeal lasted around 15 minutes. Afterwards he was put back in the bus and taken away.' The rest of the sentence would be carried out over a period of 50 weeks, the rights watchdog group said. A whip, a leather strap or a long cane can be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia, according to corpun.com, a website dedicated to the study of corporal punishment. 'Sometimes the lashes are confined to the buttocks, more often it seems they are spread out from the neck to the ankles, and usually with the prisoner simply lying face down on the ground. 'In one or two reports the offender was said to be tied upright to a post,' said corpun.com. A whip, a leather strap or a long cane may be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia (pictured) Mr Badawi was publicly flogged today as part of his jail term for 'ridiculing Islamic religious figures' The sentence was widely condemned by human rights groups. Said Boumedouha of Amnesty International said: 'The flogging of Raif Badawi is a vicious act of cruelty which is prohibited under international law. 'By ignoring international calls to cancel the flogging Saudi Arabia's authorities have demonstrated an abhorrent disregard for the most basic human rights principles.' Mr Badawi was arrested in June 2012 and prosecuted for offences including cyber crime and disobeying his father. Following his arrest, his wife and children left the kingdom for Canada. The prosecution had demanded he be tried for apostasy, which carries the death penalty in Saudi Arabia, but a judge dismissed that charge. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, a fine of 1 million Saudi riyals ($266,666) and 1,000 lashes last year after prosecutors challenged an earlier sentence of seven years and 600 lashes as too lenient. Yesterday the US tried - but failed - to convince Riyadh to cancel the sentence of 1,000 lashes. Badawi's lawyer Waleed Abul-Khair was sentenced in July to 15 years imprisonment and barred from traveling for another 15 years after being found guilty by an anti-terrorism court of 'undermining the regime and officials,' ''inciting public opinion' and 'insulting the judiciary.' Saudi Arabia's legal code follows sharia law. Judges are trained as religious scholars and have broad scope to base verdicts and sentences on their own interpretation of religious texts.","Online activist Raif Badawi publicly flogged outside Jiddah mosque today .

"Three teenagers have been killed in a car crash that erupted into flames. Joshua Rodriguez, 18, was driving 17-year-olds Sara Silvas and Zornitsa Petrova in rural Houston, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon when he lost control of his Honda sedan. The vehicle slammed into a ditch and burst into flames. Despite neighbors' desperate attempts to extinguish the blaze, all three Manvel High School students died on impact. Tragic: Josh Rodriguez, 18, and his girlfriend Zori Petrova, 17, were killed after they crashed into a ditch . Victim: Their friend Sara Silva, 17, who was about to study medicine, was also killed on impact . Rodriguez, an athlete on the football and soccer teams, planned to study engineering at the University of Houston and was discussing applications with his brother the night before. His girlfriend Petrova played tennis and swam competitively. The senior class president, she had accepted a place at Texas A&M University. Silvas, their friend, was the daughter of a Manvel High School teacher. She played softball on the school's varsity team and was headed to San Antonio to attend UTSA and study medicine. The bodies were so badly burned it took hours to identify the victims, firefighters told KHOU. The trio had been driving along Old Chocolate Bayou Road in Brazoria County at 2pm when they crashed. Detectives are working to discern a cause for the incident. Initial reports suggest they were driving very fast. The school's principal Charlotte Liptack paid tribute to each of the victims in a statement. 'Sara always had a bright smile and was a vibrant part of the Manvel High School community. She was kind, hardworking, and always helpful,' she said in a release read by KHOU. Burned: The Honda sedan crashed backwards into the ditch and burst into flames, killing all three students . Rescue attempts: Despite neighbors' desperate attempts to extinguish the flames, they could not save them . Mourning: Students, teachers and relatives descended on the scene of the crash to pay their respects . Devastated: Their friends hugged and wept as they paid tribute to the three star seniors of Manvel High School . Of Rodriguez, the second eldest of four brothers, she said: 'He was an active student who was always happy and loved life. He was enthusiastic, vibrant and athletic.' And Petrova 'had an outgoing, contagious personality. She was a brilliant student and an integral member of the debate and academic decathlon teams.' Families and friends gathered around a memorial at the scene of the crash to pay tribute on Thursday. Nick Rodriguez, older brother of the driver, described Josh to the Houston Chronicle as 'tough but sweet' and 'the family peacemaker'. 'There wasn't a heart she didn't touch,' fellow senior Logan Grimes, 17, told the paper about Petrova, who was described as a prankster with boundless energy. Sara, who transferred to Manvel in her junior year, had plans to study cancer and diagnostic sonography. 'She was the bubbly, funny person you wanted to know,' her mother told the Chronicle. Star: Petrova was the senior class president, played on school varsity teams, and was heading for college . Amibiton: Silvas was about to move to San Antonio to study diagnostic sonography at UTSA . Athlete: Rodriguez (right) was a star player on the football and soccer teams and planned to study engineering . The school sent a letter to student and families that read: . 'Manvel High School is deeply saddened to share that a tragedy impacted our campus family yesterday afternoon. 'Around 2 pm, three Manvel High School students were involved in a fatal car accident. Sadly, the Texas Department of Public Safety notified us this morning that seniors Sara Silvas, Joshua Rodriguez, and Zornitsa Petrova passed away at the scene of the accident. 'The Alvin ISD Crisis Response Team is currently on campus to provide assistance to both students and staff. 'Please be assured that the team will remain with students and staff as long as a need exists. We encourage you to speak with your children this evening and reach out to the school if you need any assistance. Our counselors can be reached by calling 281-245-2232. 'The Manvel High School community is a family that shows incredible support for one another during trying times. 'The three families need to know that we care, but they also need privacy today and throughout the week. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers, and please be there for each other. I know that we will get through this difficult time together.'","Josh Rodriguez, 18, his girlfriend Zori Petrova, 17, and friend Sara Silvas, 17, all killed on impact in crash south of Houston, Texas .

"Curran is accused of strangling his mother's friend Joan Roddam (pictured) after she spurned his advances . An elderly widow was murdered by a neighbour obsessed with 'granny porn' after he went to her home to try and have sex with her, a court heard. Patrick Curran, 38, is accused of strangling his mother's friend Joan Roddam, 74, in her bungalow after she refused his lewd advances. He then buried her frail body under a wheelbarrow in a field behind her house, Truro Crown Court heard. Pornographic material, depicting women in their 70s or older having sex with men in their 20s, was found on a computer seized from Curran's home two years later. Prosecutors say Curran went to Joan's home in a state of 'heightened sexual drive' - but when she said no he killed her. Curran is on trial accused of Joan's murder on November 8, 2003 - but has so far declined to attend court. Prosecutor Simon Laws, QC, said at the time of the murder Curran had a strong sexual interest in pornography between elderly women and younger men. He said: 'The prosecution's case is that Patrick Curran went around to Joan Roddam's house that morning because he was interested in having sexual contact with her. 'He went there seeking an outlet for his heightened sexual drive. It is not our case that he went there planning on killing her. 'Something happened after he arrived which caused him to strangle her. It is not hard to picture a scene in which he made advances to her and was rebuffed. 'His mother was her friend, they lived down the road, where does that scene go from there in this small community?' He said they would also present evidence to show that Curran had a heightened sexual drive, as he told a doctor the day before the killing, and had mental health issues. The court was told the victim was just 5'4 tall and weighed 65kg and would have been easily overpowered by the defendant. Mrs Roddam's body was discovered after a delivery driver raised the alarm. Curran is on trial accused of the murder in 2003 but has so far declined to attend Truro Crown Court (pictured) A post mortem showed she had been strangled and suffered numerous other injuries to her head and body. Curran was described in court as an isolated figure in the community, whose attic bedroom had views over Mrs Roddam's home in Delabole, Cornwall. Forensic evidence also linked Curran to the scene at her home where she had lived alone for seven years since the death of her late husband. Mr Laws said her body was moved in a wheelbarrow, which was partially covering her body when it was discovered by police dog handler. He added: 'Mrs Roddam had sustained bleeding injuries, particularly to the head, very probably as her body was being dumped in the field. 'A blanket covering her body was stained with blood and DNA found on the blanket matched the defendant's. 'This finding links the defendant indelibly to the scene and to the murder of Joan Roddam.' Mr Laws said fibres from clothing belonging to Curran were also found, including on Mrs Roddam's dressing gown, which she was wearing when she died. Curran has been in custody since his arrest last year. He has declined to attend the trial or be represented by lawyers but he has denied the murder. The trial is expected to last four weeks.

"In the days leading up to the shooting of convicted criminal Michael Ibrahim  on Sunday night, the family of a Sydney crime figure allegedly attempted to broker peace. Ibrahim was hit in the shoulder by one of a number of bullets fired at him on his way home in Macquarie Street in Sydney's CBD. After his release from jail, where he served six years for manslaughter, the younger brother of Kings Cross nightclub identity John Ibrahim had reportedly started a new relationship and became embroiled in a life of partying. Scroll down for video . Convicted killer Michael Ibrahim (left) was shot on a footpath just metres from NSW Parliament House on Sunday night.  He is the brother of Kings Cross identity John Ibrahim (right) The Sun Herald reported that Ibrahim, 36, had been seen at Cafe Del Mar in Darling Harbour, and the 'floating beach club'. Sources reported Ibrahim had used his new freedom to reconnect with a south-Western Sydney crime figure, before the relationship soured and the man's family intervened. Despite the alleged attempt to ease tensions, animosity escalated between the pair, before Ibrahim was hospitalised by the shooting. Ibrahim's brother, Kings Cross nighclub identity John Ibrahim, visited him in hospital, and the 36-year-old has been sitting up and in good spirits in a stable condition, said hospital spokesman David Faktor on Monday afternoon. Mr Faktor said the patient had not undergone surgery, correcting earlier information.

Family members outside at St Vincent's Hospital after visiting shooting victim Michael Ibrahim . Police are hunting for a gunman after a man was shot while standing on a footpath just metres from NSW Parliament House on Sunday night . Meanwhile, police continued their investigation at the scene of the attack on one of Sydney's most prestigious strip of apartments. Police are looking for at least two attackers and a white, possibly late model, Audi. Ibrahim spent more than six years in prison after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Robin Nassour in 2006. He was acquitted in 2012 of conspiring to murder nightclub owner John Macris, who he believed was responsible for gunning down his brother, Fadi Ibrahim, outside a home in Sydney's north. Macris was not charged over the incident. Sam Ibrahim has been behind bars on firearms charges since his bail was revoked in July last year. A crime scene remained on Monday outside Ibrahim's luxury Macquarie Street home where he has lived since he left prison in August 2014 . Several shots were fired, with a bullet removed from this tree at the scene of the shooting, but Ibrahim only was only shit by one bullet to the shoulder . The shooting took place on Macquarie Street just 200 metres from NSW Parliament House (pictured) Police closed off Macquarie Street shortly after the shooting between Bridge and Bent streets as police scoured the area for bullet casings. Apart from the man's gunshot wound, police have received no further reports of injuries. The shooting took place outside a multi-storey office building at 151 Macquarie Street - just 200 metres away from NSW Parliament House and less than 300 metres from the scene of the Lindt cafe siege in Martin Place. Michael Ibrahim had earlier vowed to move on with his life at his August 2014 parole hearing. He told the board he wouldn't break the law if released from jail and would abide by the ""most stringent"" parole conditions. Being behind bars while his mother was treated for cancer was a ""wake up call"", he told the parole board. He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney.

"It's happened to all of us. Hours of a flight left to go and you're stuck next to a seat companion who doesn't quite understand the meaning of 'personal space.' Thankfully, low-cost American airline, JetBlue, is here to help. Low-cost American airline, JetBlue, asks, ' What's your Flight Etiquette?' in new campaign . Through the company's new #FlightEtiquette campaign, JetBlue hopes to inspire passengers to be more considerate of one another. 'The series stemmed from an insight that the things that happen to you while you're at the airport or in-flight is always a fun conversation topic among those who are passionate about travel,' Chan Tran, Brand Analyst for JetBlue Airways, explains. '#FlightEtiquette is all about the situational behaviours that can occur between strangers during air travel.' JetBlue hopes to inspire passengers to be more considerate by addressing common in-flight concerns . One of the most common concerns? How to exit your row to use the toilet when your seatmates are sleeping . She points out that while every airline tries to glamorise flying, very few provide a realistic, truthful perspective of what the experience is really like. In this series of hilarious videos, JetBlue illustrates those uncomfortable moments that will inevitable arise while in close quarters with so many people for so long, including, how to handle those seat-hog sleepers and what to do when you really need to use the toilet but don't want to wake up your resting neighbour. 'Our approach is not only entertaining and humorous, it also says to our customers that we really get you,' Chan tells Skift. JetBlue is here to help, with their handy 'How to Make an Exit' video - showing all of the things NOT to try . Using the hashtag #FlightEtiquette, JetBlue hopes customers will take up the conversation on social media . The series of videos is all about situational things that occur while in-flight - and how frustrating they can be . 'We understand that on a plane, you're sometimes forced to rub elbows - literally - with people you don't know, and a little etiquette goes a long way.' The campaign also calls upon those on Twitter to weigh in on what they would do in similarly awkward situations, hoping to create a dialogue among travelers. 'First and foremost, we want our audience to get the humour of the videos,' she adds. As this actor shows, attempting to wake up your seatmate to go to the loo can be a serious challenge . JetBlue insists the ads are over the top on purpose, but that there is always an underlying truth behind them . 'They're over-the-top and exaggerated on purpose, and the actors we used are improv actors affiliated with New York's Upright Citizens Brigade. 'We also want our viewers to feel that they can totally relate or say that they've been in that situation before, and we hope to encourage engagement by having them tell us what they'd do in these awkward situations.

The couple had gone to court on Aug. 7, where Andrea dropped domestic violence charges against Caleb, the Post reports. They were on their way home when the two got into a dispute and Andrea threatened to call the police. In a recorded confession, according to NBC, Caleb told detectives that he 'didn't want to deal with another 911 call,' so he grabbed the phone from his wife's hand, pulled her into the back seat of his SUV, and began to strangle her.

"It might be almost 200 years since the first wagons rolled their way towards the Pacific coast along the Oregon Trail, but it seems it still has as much of a draw with Americans looking for a better life. The state has topped a list for the most popular place to move to for the second year in a row. More than 66 per cent of the Oregon moves carried out by United Van Lines were people relocating to the state, rather than moving out. In comparison, 65 per cent of the people it served in New Jersey moved away, according to the company. Oregon's outdoor space is one of the reasons more people move to the state than leave it, it is believed (Pictured is the Three Sisters Wilderness Area, Willamette National Forest) Portland also has a lot to recommend it - including being one of the most innovative cities for urban planning . Economist Michael Stoll,  chairman of the Department of Public Policy at the University of California, said the figures reflected the overall trend in migration towards southern and western states. However, it is Oregon's 'unique amenities' which he believes push it to the top of the pile. These include outdoor recreation, arts and entertainment activities, and green space - which the mountainous state has plenty of. Travel Oregon, the state's tourist board, lists its own 'seven wonders' - including the Columbia River Gorge, to Crater Lake and the Wallowa Mountains. The cost of living is also 1.2 per cent lower than the American average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Oregon was also named one of the top three states for job growth during 2013, while Portland was named one of the most innovative cities for urban planning, according to CNN Money. However, its education system was ranked 41 in the country by Education Week - with residents pointing to the state's lower-than-average spend on each student as a possible cause. South Carolina (pictured is Greenville) was named the second most popular place for people to move to . But 64 per cent of people moved in New Jersey were moving out of the state, rather than into it - making it the least popular in this year's list . However, while Oregon had the best moving in-out ratio, far fewer people decided to make their home in the state than elsewhere in America. United Van Lines moved 28,036 homes in California last year, with just over half moving into the state. This is in spite of the fact that those living in California need to earn, on average, $6,000 more than those living in Oregon - where the company had just 4,121 shipments in total. But Oregon was in no way the state with the lowest number of shipments  in the country: United Van Lines conducted only 325 shipments in Vermont, the fourth most popular destination for people to make their home.","Tops the table for the highest percentage of people moving into the state .

Military leader: Qing dynasty leader General Tso Tsung-t'ang gave his name to the popular dish, but by a coincidence of translation rather than design . Respected statesman: After his role in a civil war thought to have killed 20million people, General Tso became a respected politician who lived into relatively old age. He is pictured here as the governor of Shangan province in 1875 . A new film seeks to ask the age old question, just exactly who is General Tso and how did his chicken become so popular? Born into a poor family in Hunan province, Tso became a military leader who helped the Qing dynasty win civil war known as the 'Taiping Rebellion' in which 20million people are said to have died. He then became a respected statesman, however he would never have tasted modern-day General Tso's chicken and the fact that he gave his name to the most popular Chinese dish in America is thought to be coincidence. An account by author Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's account is regarded as the most plausible - she says the dish is a traditional one in Hunan province, and was given the name 'ancestral hall chicken'. The mandarin for 'ancestral hall' happens to name with General Tso's name, and thus a confused translation is thought to have given rise to the birth of General Tso's chicken in America. Lee's movie follows the filmmakers from Chinese eateries in the big city to country, with each serving the spicy chicken dish to hungry American fans. It also visits perplexed Chinese people in the General's hometown. 'I went to his hometown. This is a billboard that says, welcome to the birthplace of General Tso,' Lee told NPR. 'And I went looking for chicken. I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who were still in the little town, showed them all the pictures of General Tso's chicken that I showed you. And they're like, we don't know this dish.' Lee previously wrote a book called 'The Fortune Cookie Chronicles' about her interest in Americanized Chinese dishes. The documentary has received critical acclaim with a 93 per cent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. 'The film gets its charm from the Chinese restaurant owners themselves,'writes 8Asians.com reviewer Mitchell K. Dwyer. 'Some of them, second and third-generation entrepreneurs, some of them offering their observations even while their parents, sitting right next to them, offer a slightly different take.' The documentary has received critical acclaim with a 93 per cent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes . They also, according to NBC News, met with a retired chef in Taiwan who invented a Hunan-style chicken dish but called the modern, popular incarnation 'crazy nonsense.' The film follows the thread of food to weave a story about cultures, immigration, and how Asian-Americans have adapted in Western culture. The documentary, from writer Jennifer 8 Lee, chronicles the intersection of American and Chinese cuisine so well known in westernized Chinese restaurants around the U.S.","The documentary, from writer Jennifer 8 Lee, chronicles the intersection of American and Chinese cuisine so well known in westernized Chinese restaurants around the U.S.

"Disgruntled workers facing the axe were told to 'smile and have fun' in a flash mob style promotional video for the firm that builds James Bond's superyachts. Sunseeker, which is famous for providing powerboats for  movies starring Daniel Craig, laid off around 240 workers just before Christmas and a further 60 jobs are due to be slashed. But despite the impending cuts, bosses at the Chinese-owned company in Poole, Dorset, sent a memo to staff asking them to take part in the video to promote the launch of their latest luxury boat. Scroll down for video . Sunseeker staff received a memo asking them to take part in a flash-mob style promotional video as the threat of job cuts looms over their heads . Workers were told to 'smile and have fun' as they danced and clapped to the Queen hit We Will Rock You . Staff blasted the company as being 'heartless' and 'insensitive' for asking them to help film the promotional video . The note told disgruntled workers to 'smile and have fun' while clapping and stamping to Queen's hit We Will Rock You. The video, filmed at the company's base at Poole Quay, will be played at the launch of the Sunseeker Predator 57, a plush 60ft powerboat capable of speeds of more than 35mph. To add insult to injury, Sunseeker has forked out an unknown sum to hire popstar Nicole Scherzinger to unveil the boat at the London Boat Show today. The memo to staff, from 'Andrew', asked them to take part in a 'participative group flash-mob style sequence'. It said: 'We want you to do a right foot stomp, then left foot stomp and clap above your head in time with the rock track We Will Rock You', before signing off: 'Thank you all - smile and have fun!' Some furious workers refused to be part of the video and blasted the company for being 'heartless'. One employee who refused to take part said: 'They told us on Monday that everybody has got to go and dance for this video, but a lot of us just said we wouldn't. 'Morale is really low. People don't know what's going on. 'They are getting rid of lots of staff and then they tell us to dance around for a video. It's really insensitive.' Another employee said: 'Sunseeker is laying people off and at Christmas we were told we have no pay rise but there is plenty of overtime in the new year. 'Then we get told they want us over at shipyard five to do some dancing. It's ridiculous.' Another said: 'Why do they think people would want to clap and dance around when their future is so uncertain? It's pretty heartless of the company. Sunseeker yachts have  featured in four consecutive James Bond films. The current James Bond, Daniel Craig, pictured  in a vintage Sunseeker Sovereign 17 motorboat . 'It just shows they care more about ego and self congratulation than empathy for their employees.' A spokesman from Sunseeker said employees were invited to take part in the filming for the video which will be played at the boat show to launch the new Predator 57 boat. He said: 'The employees at the factory were invited to take part. No one was forced to do anything.' In 2013, Chinese property developer Dalian Wanda Group paid £320m for 92 per cent of the firm but in its latest accounts the company plunged into the red, recording a £26million loss on a turnover of £341million. Managing director Stewart McIntyre stepped down in July last year and in October Sunseeker, which employs about 2,500 people, announced up to 300 jobs would go as part of a 'strategic review' to 'increase efficiency'.

"Greater Manchester Police bosses have scrapped plans to axe 25 firearms officers following the terror attack in Paris. Senior officers met within hours of the massacre at the offices of French magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday where a dozen people, including two police officers, were killed. The two masked gunmen, armed with assault rifles, had forced their way into the building on Wednesday, shooting dead the editor Stephane Charbonnier, his police guard and nine other members of staff. As they fled in a waiting black car, they opened fire at police and shot dead an officer in the street. Masked gunmen, brandishing Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers, shot a French policeman in the street (pictured) after bursting into the Charlie Hebdo headquarters and opening fire on staff in the Paris massacre . Senior GMP figures insist no decisions have yet been made but it is understood they have done a u-turn over plans to lose 25 posts from the force's firearms unit and 50 officers from its traffic division. The decision also follows a warning by the director-general of MI5, Andrew Parker, who said Al Qaeda were planning 'mass casualty attacks' against the West. The UK terror threat is currently rated as 'severe' which means the security forces believe an attack is highly likely. Mr Parker said: ‘Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' 'We still face more complex and ambitious plots that follow the now sadly well-established approach of Al Qaeda and its imitators – attempts to cause large-scale loss of life, often by attacking transport systems or iconic targets. It is understood that Greater Manchester Police have done a u-turn over plans to lose 25 officers from the force's firearms unit (stock picture) Patrols stepped up:  Armed British Transport Police officers stand next to the Eurostar platforms at London St Pancras railway station . Concerns: The Mayor of London Boris Johnson leaves past two armed police officers after visiting the French Embassy  in London yesterday . ‘We know, for example, that a group of core Al Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West.’ He added that the number of 'crude' attacks had gone up and admitted it was 'almost inevitable' an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. Although there is no specific intelligence of an attack in Manchester, police bosses in the city are anxious about an increase in the 'heat' being picked up from Islamic fundamentalists. Officers have been warned to be on their guard as it is feared police officers themselves could be the target for the next terror attack. The plans to axe police marksmen and traffic officers emerged during a review into all departments which started six months ago. The government has ordered force bosses to slash £154m from its annual budget by 2017 on top of previous cuts worth £134m. Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins told the MEN: 'Greater Manchester Police have been reviewing all areas of business to cope with the level of cuts imposed upon us. As such, no areas of the organisation have been untouched in terms of considering where to make savings. The massacre, which left twelve people dead, including two police officers, ended with the men running off, sparking a massive manhunt . Police and rescue vehicles were called to the scene after a shooting at the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, January 7 . Members of the GIPN and RAID, French police special forces, walk in Corcy, northern France, as they carried out searches as part of an investigation into a deadly attack . Armed police outside the French Embassy in London after yesterday's terrorist attack in Paris on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo . 'No formal papers have yet been considered regarding firearms and traffic roles. 'However, what is clear is that in future we will have to make very difficult decisions around how we use the budget we are allocated taking into account the threats and risks of policing an area as diverse as Greater Manchester.' Asked whether he would reconsider cuts to policing budgets in the light of the Paris shooting, Prime Minister David Cameron told the MEN: 'Yes we have had to reduce policing budgets - we've done that by some 20pc. 'What's happened though is the percentage of police on the frontline has gone up, satisfaction with police has gone up, and crucially crime has come down. 'Crucially in Greater Manchester crime has come down by 20pc over the past four years. It's a good example of where when you're faced with difficult long term decisions, if you take them in the right way you can produce a better service for less money. 'It's very important Manchester's police force think through the changes they make very carefully. We have been putting more money into counter terror policing in recent weeks in response to what happened in Woolwich.' Shocking: The chilling image from the Charlie Hebdo office shows blood-stained wooden floors, papers strewn across the corridor .

A police photographer (partially hidden) works with investigators as they examine the impacts from machine gun fire on a police vehicle . People around the world have come out in support of the victims of the massacre with services in countries across the globe. Yesterday, France held a minute's silence will be observed at midday across the country and the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital tolled for the two policemen and ten others, mainly magazine staff, who were murdered. Seven people have been arrested over the Charlie Hebdo massacre, but the two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade, have not yet been caught. Cherif and Said Kouachi were today exchanging fire with police as they held hostages on an industrial estate near a Paris airport. At least two people are thought to have been killed and several wounded before Cherif and Said Kouachi entered business premises in the village of Dammartin-en-Goele, north-east of the capital. However, the public prosecutor has deny reports there had been casualties. The gunmen are believed to have taken one hostage with them into a storage unit, which is now surrounded by police commandos who have begun negotiations to try to secure their release.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Well at least they'd be easy to spot in a line-up. These hilarious computer-generated 'e-fit' images reveal some of the more unusual-looking suspects wanted by police last year-  including a ginger thief whose bright orange hair makes him look like Harry Potter character Ron Weasley.

His sketch featured a hoodie pulled down to his nose, making it difficult to see what he looked like at all.

Gloucestershire Police posted this e-fit, pictured with no eyes and most of his face and head obscured in a black hoodie, to their rogues gallery for a man they wanted to speak to after a 'suspicious incident' in Stroud .

"One of the Charlie Hebdo terrorists had links to the 'underwear bomber' who tried to blow up a commercial US flight on Christmas Day, it has been claimed. The revelation comes as French investigators try to establish the connections the suspects had with terror networks and one another. Two brothers who killed 12 in an attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine on Wednesday were shot dead yesterday as they fled a warehouse north of Paris, firing at police. Shortly afterwards in eastern Paris, anti-terrorist forces stormed a kosher supermarket where hostages were being held by a gunman with reported links to the brothers. The gunman and four hostages died. According to reports, Said Kouachi shared a flat with 'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (right) Abdulmutallab was badly burned when a bomb sewn into his underwear (pictured) failed to detonate fully in the plane carrying nearly 300 people . A Yemeni journalist and researcher, Mohammed al-Kibsi, told CNN he had met and spoken with one of the brothers - Said Kouachi - in Yemen in 2011 and 2012. He said Kouachi - who was studying Arabic grammar - shared a small apartment with the 'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab for one to two weeks in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. Abdulmutallab, a native Nigerian, was sentenced to life in prison in February 2012 for trying to bomb a US passenger plane flying from Amsterdam to Detroit as a would-be suicide mission for al-Qaeda. He was badly burned when a bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully in the plane carrying nearly 300 people. During his trial, Abdulmutallab said the bomb in his underwear was a 'blessed weapon' to avenge poorly treated Muslims around the world. Mr al-Kibsi told CNN Abdulmutallab and Kouachi also prayed together at the Al-Tabari School while they were staying together. As yet, his claims have not been given official confirmation. Elsewhere Cherif Kouachi (pictured) named al-Qaeda's Yemen branch as his commanders . It came as Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch, known as AQAP, released a statement saying they directed the attack to make good on previous threats. One of the brothers - Cherif Kouachi - named the terror group's Yemen branch as his commanders. A statement released in English said: 'The leadership of #AQAP directed the operation, and they have chosen their target carefully as a revenge for the honor of Prophet (pbuh) [peace be upon him]. 'The target was in France in particular because of its obvious role in the war on Islam and oppressed nations. 'The operation was the result of the threat of Sheikh Usama (RA). He warned the West about the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslims' sanctities. 'Sheikh Usama (RA) said in his message to the West: If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions. 'The Organization delayed to claim responsibility due to the executors' security reasons.' In a chilling telephone conversation with a journalist - later played out on French news network BFM - Kouachi said he knew he was talking to a reporter before saying: 'I am a defender of the prophet. 'I was sent by Al Qaeda of Yemen. I'm financed by Imam anwar al Awlaqi - Anwar is a predicateur (preacher). He has lived in the Yemen. He is one of the thinking heads of Al Qaeda.' A BFMTV studio journalist then reports how Kouachi speaks in a calm and determined manner during the recorded interview - almost as if he had prepared for it - explaining that he denied he had killed civilians. She said Kouachi did not consider journalists at Charlie Hebdo as civilians but targets. He said that he wasn't interested in killing women and children, but Westerners who kill children in Iraq, Syriah and Afghanistan. Amedy Coulibaly, who together with his girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene held terrified shoppers captives in a kosher supermarket in Paris, told a journalist his actions were carried out to defend Muslims . In a separate interview, also played out on BFM, Amedy Coulibaly, who together with his girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene held terrified shoppers captive in a kosher supermarket in Paris, told a journalist his actions were carried out to defend Muslims in Palestine and to target Jews. The reporter said that he claimed to have been acting under instructions from the Islamic State and that his actions were synchronised by the Kouachi brothers. He is asked: 'Are you in contact with the two (Kouachi) brothers,' to which he answered: 'Yes we made contact before the operations.' He then denied having been in contact with them recently and said he did not plan to take any further action. In the end, the studio journalist described the gunman's claim that the kosher supermarket had been targeted because it was popular with Jews and that he carried out the siege 'to defend Muslims... notably in Palestine.' It is not yet clear when exactly the interviews were carried out but they are believed to have taken place hours before they were killed. Dozens of commandos stormed a Jewish grocery 25 miles away in east Paris where accomplice Coulibaly was threatening to kill 15 terrified captives, including women and children . Four hostages were killed  following the dramatic end to the siege at the kosher market in the east of Paris . Koachi and his brother Said were killed after special forces brought an end to more than two days of slaughter which have left at least 17 dead and spread terror across France. The brothers died in a blaze of gunfire at a printworks near Paris where they had been holed up with one hostage, who survived. Moments later, dozens of commandos stormed a Jewish grocery 25 miles away in east Paris where accomplice Coulibaly was holding captives, including women and children. The gunman and four hostages died. It is believed they were killed before the police assault on Hypercasher supermarket, near Porte de Vincennes. Witnesses watched in horror as freed hostages fled the scene screaming, some carrying their children in their arms. 'It's war!' screamed a mother as she dragged her daughter from the scene.","Reports that Said Kouachi stayed with 'underwear bomber' in Yemen .

Jonchuck's mother and the girl's grandmother, Michelle Lynn Jonchuck, 51, told My Fox Tampa she never wants to see her son again and claims she wishes it was him who had died on the bridge. Scroll down for video . In custody: John Jonchuk Jr, 25, (left) has been charged with murder after his five-year-old daughter Phoebe (right) was thrown to her death off a 60ft bridge in Tampa Bay . Devastated: Jonchuck's mother and the girl's grandmother Michelle Lynn Jonchuck, has said she never wants to see her son again and claims she wishes it was him who had died on the bridge . Angelic: Tributes have been paid to Phoebe and a memorial set up for her near the bridge where she fell . Speaking to Click Orlando, she also paid tribute to the youngster, saying: 'She always had a smile on her face, she loved to dance and she sung. 'I don't forgive him. There is no sense in this. He didn't have to do this to her. I just wish there was one thing God could do was to bring her back.' She added that she was supposed to pick Phoebe up from school on Thursday. The last time she saw her son and daughter together, she said everything was normal. Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, told the station that Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. 'She was my angel, I always called her my angel baby. She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated,' she said. First hearing: Jonchuk said he wanted to leave himself 'in the hands of God' when asked about representation . Troubled relationship: Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, said Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. She added that he had been diagnosed with bipolar . 'My angel': Paying tribute to Phoebe, Miss Kerr said: 'She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated.' 'He would only let me talk to her on the phone. He wouldn't disclose his location, so I didn't know where to go.' 'He was very, very bipolar,' she told Tampa Bay News. 'He was Jekyll and Hyde all the way.' Among other medication, Miss Kerr says Mr Jonchuk took regular doses of bipolar pills Seroquel and anti-depressives Zoloft. When they met, she added, Mr Jonchuk was her 'gay friend', until he told her he 'liked women too'. Soon after, Phoebe was born. Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records. On the last night she saw Phoebe, Miss Kerr said she and Jonchuck had a nice evening together, but later on he called child protective services and made a false abuse allegations. She added that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and had been admitted to a mental hospital on several occasions. 'He does the Jekyll and Hyde. It's just something that goes on in his head, he just wasn't wired right. 'He's not mentally stable, but he was mentally stable enough to take care of a child for five years, so he knew what he did. He cried, the detective said.' It has since emerged Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. With no fixed abode, the father and daughter have been living with John Jonchuk Sr for two months. But at midnight last night Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report. The officer who spotted the Cruiser gave chase and saw the driver reach the top of Dick Misener Bridge then enter the approach to the Skyway. The car was then seen to stop and a figure emerged, throwing a child over the side of the rail into the water off Boca Ciega Bay. The officer said he heard the girl scream as she fell. Issues: Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records . Scene: Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report . Jonchuk returned to the car and drove south but was stopped by Manatee County authorities about 30 minutes later. He was arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder. Jonchuk also faces charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding police. The girl was found 40 minutes later by divers from Eckerd College and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and her mother was informed. At Jonchuk's first hearing on Thursday, Pinellas County Judge Michael Andrews asked him if he wanted an attorney. 'I want to leave it in the hands of God,' Jonchuck said. Arrested: An officer who claims to have witnessed the incident chased Jonchuk and detained him . Behavior: Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish . Tragic: This is the car seat, recovered from Boca Ciega Bay, in which investigators found the dead child . The judge responded: 'I'm pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial.' Details have since emerged of Jonchuk's 'strange' behavior on Wednesday that prompted his attorney Genevieve Torres to contact police. Torres said she met with John Jonchuck on Wednesday to discuss the custody case for his five-year-old daughter, Phoebe. After their meeting, she was so worried about the father and daughter that she reported the odd statements to police. Officers interviewed Jonchuck and his daughter as he was picking her up from a church day care and both appeared to be in good health. Jonchuck said he didn't want to harm himself or anyone else, the documents said. 'She was smiling and appeared healthy, properly clothed and happy,' according to the documents. A little more than twelve hours later, police said Jonchuck threw his daughter over a bridge.","Phoebe Jonchuk was thrown screaming from a bridge in Tampa Bay .

"Two brothers accused of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris murdering 12 people had already been flagged as a terrorist threat and placed on a U.S. no-fly list. Cherif, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, had been identified by both French and U.S. intelligence agencies as potential extremists, with the younger brother being convicted on terrorism charges in 2008. Heavily armed police SWAT teams have been swarming a region north of Paris as part of the hunt for the two gunmen. Scroll down for video . French police are hunting Cherif, left, and Said Kouachi, right, in connection with the Charlie Hebdo attack . The killers attacked the satirical magazine murdering 12 people over a cartoon of the Prophet Mohamed . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls confirmed both men were known to security services prior to the fatal attack. A senior U.S. official said Thursday the elder Kouachi had traveled to Yemen, although it was unclear whether he was there to join extremist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based there. The younger brother, Cherif, was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for his links to a network sending jihadis to fight American forces in Iraq. Both were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counter-terrorism official said. French President Francois Hollande called for tolerance after the country's worst terrorist attack in decades. He said: 'France has been struck directly in the heart of its capital, in a place where the spirit of liberty - and thus of resistance - breathed freely.' President Barack Obama signed a book of condolence for the people murdered in the Paris terror attack . The brothers were armed with automatic assault rifles and murdered 12 people during their rampage . French police have launched a major counter-terrorism operation following the attack on Tuesday . French police have arrested nine people who were connected to the brothers while 90 witnesses have also been interviewed. Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve confirmed that Cherif Kouachi left his ID card behind in the getaway car used during the attack. Security officials confirmed that the brothers were born in Paris to Algerian parents. The younger brother, who was a former pizza delivery driver, appeared on a 2005 documentary in French TV on Islamic extremism. He was jailed in 2008 for 18 months after he tried to travel to Iraq to join al-Qaeda. During the documentary, Cherif Kouachi said he had been radicalised in north eastern Paris by a hard-line preacher. He said the cleric told him 'that holy texts prove the benefits of suicide attacks. It is written in the texts that it's good to die as a martyr.' The brothers grew up in the multi-ethnic working-class 19th arrondissement of Paris. Cherif Kouachi's lawyer said at the time that his client had fallen in with the wrong crowd. During the trial, Kouachi was said to have undergone only minimal training for combat — going jogging in a Paris park to shape up and learning how a Kalashnikov automatic rifle works by studying a sketch. He was described at the time as a reluctant holy warrior, relieved to have been stopped by French counterespionage officials from taking a Syria-bound flight that was ultimately supposed to lead him to the battlefields of Iraq. The two brothers were filmed shouting 'we have killed Charlie Hebdo' after the murderous attack . His former lawyer Vincent Ollivier told Le Parisien newspaper that his client had changed him. In the documentary, the younger killer is seen as a young man in a black T-shirt with extremely close-cropped hair and a chunky wristwatch was keener on spending time with pretty girls than on going to the mosque. He appears relaxed and smiling as he pals around with friends. At one point, with his baseball cap worn backward, Kouachi belts out some rap music and breaks into a joyful dance. After he was released from prison, he worked in a supermarket's fish section in the Paris suburbs for six months beginning in 2009. Supervisors said he gave no cause for concern. In 2010, police detained him again in a probe of an alleged plot to free an Islamic militant sentenced to life in prison for bombing a Paris train line in 1995. Kouachi was ultimately released with no charges ever brought. Much less has become public about the older brother, Said, but Cazeneuve said the jobless resident of the city of Reims was also known to authorities, despite having never been prosecuted, because he was 'on the periphery' of the illegal activities his younger sibling was involved in. A French security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that American authorities had shared intelligence with France indicating that Said had travelled to Yemen several years ago for training. French authorities were seeking to verify the information, the official said. In Reims, about 90 miles northeast of Paris, Said frequented a prayer room on the ground floor of an apartment building, according to the local imam, Abdul-Hamid al-Khalifa. Al-Khalifa admitted that Said wore traditional North Africa clothes to prayers and didn't mix much — if at all — with other worshippers. 'Typically, he'd come late to prayers and leave right when they were done.' A third suspect identified by French authorities in the attack turned himself in Wednesday night. Mourad Hamyd, 18, surrendered at a police station after learning his name had been linked to the case in the news, said Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor. She did not specify his relationship to the Kouachis.","French police are searching for brothers Cherif, 32, and Said, 34, Kouachi .

"Two Seattle Seahawks mega-stars are flacking for Obamacare, but they won't need government-brokered medical insurance themselves – the NFL already provides one of America's best plans to its millionaire players, free of charge. Quarterback Russell Simmons and cornerback Richard Sherman appear in a Department of Health and Human Services video released online on Friday, urging Americans to visit HealthCare.gov and shop for coverage before the February 15 open-enrollment deadline. NFL players get medical, dental and life insurance. The medical coverage has a contract-mandated maximum $800 annual deductible for families, and $400 for individuals. That out-of-pocket cost pales in comparison to some Obamacare plans. CBS News reported in December 2013 that some 'bronze'-level plans offered at Healthcare.gov saddle policyholders with deductibles as high as $12,700. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Seattle Seahawks stars Russell Wilson and Richard Sherman star in an Obamacare enrolment ad produced by the Department of Health and Human Services; the video's subtitles include a dumb-athlete-sounding grammar error sure to make viewers cringe . EAT UP AND STAY HEALTHY: On November 27 Wilson and Sherman celebrated a win over their arch-rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, by carrying a Thanksgiving turkey to the Seattle locker room. A deductible is the cost of medical care that an insurance customer must pay for on his or her own each year before coverage kicks in and the company will pay a claim. Deductibles that are too high discourage people from seeking care. The NFL's policy also offers a benefit cap of $2.5 million, according to the DelDuca Sports agency, which represents players. 'When your health or the game is on the line, nothing is more important than quality coverage,' Sherman says in the video. Sherman's job is to 'cover' offensive wide receivers and deny them the chance to make leaping catches. Wilson tells fans to 'make the right call ... and get covered.' The National Football League's union-negotiated insurance coverage is included without cost to players in every contract, even though many of them have nine-figure, multi-year contracts and the league's minimum salary is $420,000 for active players. Even lowly 'practice squad' grunts are guaranteed at least $102,000, more than enough to pay for health insurance. The Obama administration has set $94,200 as the maximum salary for a family of four who want to receive a government subsidy to help with health insurance costs. Sherman has a four-year $56 million contract, while Wilson earns a paltry $2.4 million but is expected to sign a $100 million deal in the off-season, making him one of pro sports' most highly compensated stars. HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement that she was grateful to the players 'for volunteering their time to raise awareness about the importance of enrolling in health insurance coverage.' SCRAMBLING: Wilson's Seahawks crushed the Arizona Cardinals in Phoenix on December 21 by a 35-6 score . DENIED: Sherman defended this pass while 'covering' 49ers wide receiver Brandon Lloydin the first quarter of a Thanksgiving Day game. Her press release boasts that the once bug-plagued Healthcare.gov website now features 'a new streamlined application [that] reduces the number of screens to 16 with fewer clicks to navigate through the questions.' 'Last year, consumers went through 76 screens to sign up for coverage,' HHS said. Burwell's video includes one cringe-inducing moment that will remind critics of some athletes' reputation for being light on book-learning. Playing up the 'coverage' pun, Wilson tells a grinning Sherman that ‘All I know is their receivers are going to be covered on Sundays.' The English subtitle – turned on by default in the YouTube video – reads: ‘All I know is they're [sic] receivers are going to covered on Sundays.' HHS corrected its garbled closed-caption (CC) English after DailyMail.com pointed it out. A spokesperson told DailyMail.com that the agency is 'excited that Russell Wilson and Richard Sherman are encouraging Americans to visit HealthCare.gov and sign up for health insurance coverage through the Marketplace.' 'CC has been updated,' the spokesperson added, with another NFL pun. 'Thanks for the flag.'","Russell Wilson and Richard Sherman appear in a new government video flacking for Affordable Care Act-brokered medical insurance plans .

"A $100,000 reward has been offered to help solve the case of a teenage girl who disappeared in a disturbing abduction 17 years ago. Jessica Small, who was 15 at the time, was abducted from Bathurst in central west NSW on October 26, 1997. The teenager and her best friend, Vanessa Conlan, were leaving an amusement arcade in Bathurst at midnight when a man in a white car approached them and offered them a lift. Jessica Small, who was 15 at the time, was abducted from Bathurst in central west NSW on October 26, 1997 . The man drove the girls in his VK Holden Commodore sedan a short distance before turning his headlights off and attacking them on a deserted rural road. Vanessa managed to escape and ran to a nearby home  thinking Jessica was right behind her. But Jessica has not been seen since. Homicide Squad commander Superintendent Mick Willing said on Friday investigators believe Jessica was murdered. 'It's been almost two decades and this was a 15-year-old girl who vanished off the street of a NSW city,' he said. Supt Willing believes there are people who know what happened to Jessica. 'I implore these people to come forward and tell us what they know.' Police have released this image of a white VK Holden Commodore sedan, which is similar to the one they believe was involved in Jessica's kidnapping . The teenager and her best friend, Vanessa Conlan, were leaving an amusement arcade in Bathurst at midnight when a man in a white car approached them and offered them a lift . The current investigation has been thwarted by serious failings by Bathurst police back when Jessica initially disappeared. At an inquest into Jessica's disappearance last year, NSW deputy state Coroner Sharon Freund found there were serious inadequacies that had complicated the investigation. Local police did not initially believe Vanessa's version of events. They failed to properly interview witnesses or potential witnesses that could have uncovered crucial evidence. Detective Sergeant Peter Smith from the NSW Homicide Squad took on the cold case in 2007 and has conducted extensive inquiries into Jessica’s disappearance in recent years both in NSW and interstate. In an interview with 60 Minutes last year, Mr Smith said one of the key witnesses who had initially been ignored by local detectives had a strange conversation with a man who matched the description Vanessa gave of her attacker. Homicide Squad commander Superintendent Mick Willing said on Friday investigators believe Jessica was murdered . '(He said) an adult male had been in the amusement centre asking about Jessica and actually pointed her out and said, “She looks like she's up for a good time, who is that?” And then, during that conversation, he made mention that he was an employee of the Oberon Timber Mill,' he told the program. 'I just couldn't believe that no-one had asked him about that before. It's just so important.' The  investigation team interviewed 400 men throughout 2011 who had worked at the Oberon Timber Mill at the time Jessica went missing. They narrowed the list down to two and they were listed as persons of interest in the inquest into Jessica's disappearance. '(One) had access to a white VK Holden Commodore with holes in the passenger foot well. The car that the girls get into on the night, Vanessa sits in the front seat. And as it's driving along, Vanessa notices there's holes in the front passenger foot well,' he said. 'That's pretty explicit. It matches acutely Vanessa's description.' The coroner found there was no direct evidence linking the two persons of interest to the girl's abduction but said there was no evidence to eliminate them either. Vanessa, now 30, managed to escape and ran to a nearby home for help but police did not initially believe her version of events and failed to properly interview witnesses or potential witnesses . Jessica's mother, Ricki Small, said she still feels hurt and angry by the lack of police investigation at the time her daughter went missing . Eight months after Jessica vanished, two forestry workers found a pair of girl's underwear, a bottle of bleach and a blanket covered in blood in bushland 75km east of Bathurst. Police did not interview the person who found the items and the potential evidence wasn't DNA tested. It was later destroyed by local police. Jessica's mother, Ricki Small, wasn't told and said she still feels let down by the police. 'I would've been in the forest scratching the dirt, looking for her, physically,' Ms Small told 60 Minutes. 'I'm hurt and I'm angry. The treatment by… local detective who were on the case was just wrong. It was abominable. 'We haven't found her. 17 years and we haven't found her. 'All I can say honestly is that I hope things were over for her quickly... My head's entertained the ideas of her being locked up for days, or held for days or tortured or… I hate to go there. Jessica Small was abducted from Bathurst, west of Sydney, alongside Vanessa Conlan in 1997 and while Vanessa managed to escape, her best friend has not been seen since .

"Tommy Gilbert Jr appeared bedraggled and downcast as he stood before a judge in his orange prison jumpsuit today to be indicted over the fatal shooting of  his multimillionaire father. The Princeton grad, with his hands cuffed behind his back, said nothing and nodded in response to the judge's questions during the short appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court during the last minutes of Friday afternoon's session. He did not enter a plea. The 30-year-old, his 6-foot-3, broad frame hunched in a padded, Department of Corrections jacket, appeared unshaven and his blond, surfer locks unwashed. He stood in court alongside defense attorney Alex Spiro, a Harvard-educated criminal  lawyer from one of the city's top firms. It's not clear who is paying Spiro's fee. Gilbert Jr was being held without bail at Rikers Island while he awaits trial and is due back in court on February 5. The charges will be made public at that hearing. Scroll down for video . Tommy Gilbert Jr. appeared bedraggled and do wncast in his orange, Department of Corrections jumpsuit as he was indicted  on Friday at Manhattan Criminal Court . Gilbert Jr. is accused of executing his 70-year-old father in his bedroom on January 4 and then staging the body to make it look like suicide . Gilbert said nothing as he nodded in response to a judge's questions. He appeared alongside Alex Spiro (left), a Harvard-educated criminal defense lawyer who has been hired to represent him . A grand jury voted to indict him on Friday over the death of his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, boss of $200million Wainscott Capital Partners. The New York Medical Examiner's office confirmed to Daily Mail Online on Thursday that Gilbert Sr. died of a gunshot wound. The death of Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70,  was ruled a homicide on Thursday after he suffered a gunshot wound to the head . An autopsy ruled his cause of death as a homicide. Gilbert Jr.'s lawyer, told reporters outside the court hearing: 'No statement in light of the recent tragedy and no comment from the family.' Mr Spiro works for Brafman and Associates, one of New York's most prestigious criminal law firms. Benjamin Brafman, the founder of the firm, successfully defended Dominique Strauss-Kahn and - most recently civil rights lawyer Sanford Rubenstein. Mr Spiro has a Harvard law degree and worked for the CIA and as a New York Assistant District Attorney before going into private practice. Thomas Gilbert Sr was found dead by his wife in the bedroom of his luxury midtown apartment on January 4, shot once in the head. Gilbert Jr. had allegedly tried to stage the body to make it look like a suicide - placing the .40-caliber Glock pistol on his chest. Gilbert Jr. allegedly murdered his father after he cut the 30-year-old's allowance from $600 a week to $400 and threatened to stop paying the rent on his $2,400-a-month Chelsea apartment, according to authorities. Police found a case for the weapon, as well as extra magazines and ammunition at Gilbert Jr.'s apartment when they broke down the door and found him hiding out there on Sunday night around 10.30pm. He was arrested on murder charges the following day. Investigators also discovered a skimming device - used for stealing credit card numbers - and 21 blank credit cards inside the ground-floor home. Gilbert Jr. is also the main suspect in a September blaze that destroyed a historic Hamptons mansion that belonged to the family of a former friend-turned love rival, according to multiple reports. The New York Post reported that Gilbert Jr. burned down the home belonging to the family of Peter Smith Jr. because he believed Smith was sleeping with his girlfriend. Three days after the blaze - which razed the 19th-century mansion - Gilbert Jr. was arrested by Southampton police for violating a protective order taken out by Smith Jr. He was later released on bail, though that trial remains ongoing. He has not been charged with any crime related to the fire. Gilbert appeared calm but said nothing as he appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday before being remanded to Rikers over the shooting death of his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr . Medical examiners carry away the body of Thomas Gilbert Sr. from his apartment, where he was shot dead in his bedroom . Gilbert Jr., was a fixture at New York society events - often seen with a different women on his arm at charity galas and parties. But he was jobless, and didn't seem to have any interest in finding serious employment - despite graduating from Princeton University with a degree in economics. Instead, friends said, he was a yoga enthusiast and gym rat who spent most of his time at his family's $10million Hamptons home, where he enjoyed surfing. Gilbert Sr. was a longtime Wall Street fixture, who ran the $200million hedge fund Wainscott Capital. His son's ex girlfriend, twice-divorced Manhattan socialite Anna Rothschild, 49, said Tommy was obsessed with his father. He frequently complained about how controlling he was with money and said that his father was hard on him. Gilbert Jr. said he was upset because 'nothing he ever did was good enough' for his dad, Ms Rothschild said. Friends and family said that Gilbert Jr. suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder that had become more severe in recent years and made his behavior increasingly erratic. When he went to his parents' apartment on January 4 to confront his father, he sent his 70-year-old mother out and get him a sandwich and a soda. When she was gone, he is believed to have killed his father, investigators say. His mother, Shelley, returned 15 minutes later because she had a 'bad feeling' and found her husband had been executed. Gilbert Jr.'s eyes appeared blood-shot and his long surfer locks were unwashed after spending nearly a week behind bars .

"Scientists have discovered what triggers one of the most deadly types of breast cancer, raising hopes of new treatments for it. They have pinpointed a gene that drives triple-negative breast cancer – an especially fast-growing and hard-to-treat form of the disease. It accounts for up to one in five cases of breast cancer and is particularly likely to strike women when they are still in their 20s and 30s. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered a gene which drives a fast-growing, aggressive form of breast cancer . Breast cancer drugs from the gold-standard treatment tamoxifen to ‘wonder drug’ Herceptin are useless against it and it has a worse prognosis than other forms of the disease. The breakthrough, spearheaded by researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, brings hope of new treatments. The study of breast cancers from almost 3,000 women revealed a gene called BCL11A to be particularly active in triple-negative tumours. Women with the gene had cancer that was more advanced. And extra copies of the gene cut a woman’s survival chances, the journal Nature Communications reports. Experiments on mice confirmed the gene’s importance. For instance, animals destined to develop breast cancer remained free of the disease when the gene was inactivated. And ‘turning down’ the gene in cells made them less cancerous. Triple-negative breast cancer tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. Studies have shown it is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur after treatment. These risks appear to be greatest in the first few years after treatment. The breakthrough paves the way for new treatments for this type of the disease, which is notoriously difficult to treat. Breast cancer cells are pictured . Researcher Professor Carlos Caldas said: ‘This exciting result identifies a novel breast cancer gene in some of the more difficult-to-treat cases.’ Dr Emma Smith, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Figuring out the genes that play a role in triple negative breast cancer could lead to new ways to tackle the disease. 'This study is a promising step forward. 'But these results are from cells grown in the lab and studies in mice, so they’re still at an early stage. ‘The next steps will be finding out if the gene plays the same role in causing breast cancer in women, and whether drugs can be developed to target the faulty molecules. ‘Triple-negative breast cancer can be challenging to treat, so research into the biology of the disease is vital to help scientists come up with new treatments.’ This type of cancer tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. Studies have shown triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur after treatment. These risks appear to be greatest in the first few years after treatment. Anyone can get triple-negative breast cancer, but researchers have found it is more likely to affect: . Younger people: Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to occur before age 40 or 50, versus age 60 or older, which is more typical for other breast cancer types. African-American and Hispanic women: Triple-negative breast cancer most commonly affects African-American women, followed by Hispanic women. One study found that black women were 3 times more likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer than white women. People with a BRCA1 mutation: When people with an inherited BRCA1 mutation develop breast cancer, especially before age 50, it is usually found to be triple-negative. Like other forms of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy .

"They may be remembered as a fierce tribe of headhunters who would decorate their homes with the severed skulls of their enemies. But these incredible pictures of the Naga community taking part in fishing trips, preparing dinner and cooking raw opium, paints the tribe in a new light. Naga men are seen wading through an icy creek and warming themselves by the fire after catching fish on a hunting trip between Donhe and Lahe township in the Naga Self-Administered Zone in northwest Myanmar. Around 120,000 people live in the zone in Sagaing Division where they survive mainly by subsistence farming and hunting. But cultural practices are changing as the younger men now wear trousers rather than traditional loincloths and one can even be seen using a walkie-talkie as there is no phone reception in the area. One man who claims to be 100 years old has been photographed wearing a hat adorned with wild boar tusks in Donhe township, but this type of traditional dress is now usually restricted to festivals. The Naga speak dozens of languages and many of those in Myanmar use Burmese as a lingua franca, but many Naga communities remain impoverished and inaccessible by road. Traditionally, the Naga fish with nets or by crushing up poisonous leaves to kill fish that float to the surface to be collected but now  some use homemade explosive they throw in rivers. They had relatively little or no contact with the outside world, including that of greater India, until British colonisation of the area in the nineteenth century.

"Boston is 'wicked excited' to be the U.S. selection for the 2024 Olympics bid, city officials said today. The Massachusetts capital beat tough competition from San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington to be the United States Olympic Committee's choice for the American bid on Thursday. 'I'm wicked excited, Boston is wicked excited,' Bid Chair John Fish said as he dipped into local dialect while responding to the result with other city officials on Friday. Mayor Marty Walsh, who also addressed the media alongside Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, added: 'Wow, can you believe this?' Joy: Bid Chair Josh Fish said he was 'wicked excited' that the city had been selected as the American candidate for the 2024 Olympic Games as he appeared at a press conference on Friday . Assurances: Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he intended for the bid to be the most transparent in Olympic history so that skeptics would be assured funds were not being mishandled . He announced meetings would soon be held with residents to discuss the plans, vowing to make the process transparent and attempting to reassure those who fear public money will be misspent. 'I promise this will be the most open, inclusive and transparent process in Olympic history,' he said. Boston joins Rome and an as yet undecided German city in the race to host the 2024 Games. The International Olympic Committee's deadline for bid submissions is September 15 and the host city will be chosen in 2017. The U.S. has not held an Olympics since Atlanta in 1996. New York failed in a bid for the 2012 Games and Chicago failed in 2016. After Boston won the nomination, United States Olympic Committee chairman Larry Probst said: 'We're excited about our plans to submit a bid for the 2024 Games and feel we have an incredibly strong partner in Boston that will work with us to present a compelling bid. 'We're grateful to the leaders in each of the four cities for their partnership and interest in hosting the most exciting sports competition on earth. 'The deliberative and collaborative process that we put in place for selecting a city has resulted in a strong U.S. bid that can truly serve the athletes and the Olympic and Paralympic movements.' The team has not yet released plans for the stadiums and event spaces, but have previously said they will rely heavily upon structures that already exist in the city, including the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, university arena, and the city's park system. Boston, pictured, has won the right to bid for the 2024 summer Olympics following a 22-month process . America last hosted the Olympic Games in 1996 when the prestigious competition was held in Atlanta . Plans also include a temporary Olympic stadium in South Boston, which would be dismantled at the close of the Games. Last year, organizers said the venues required to host the Games would cost approximately $4.5 billion in private funding as well as $5 billion in regional infrastructure improvements. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh previously said: 'It is an exceptional honor for Boston to be chosen as the U.S. representative in the running for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 'This selection is in recognition of our city's talent, diversity and global leadership. 'Our goal is to host Olympic and Paralympic Games that are innovative, walkable and hospitable to all. Boston hopes to welcome the world's greatest athletes to one of the world's great cities.' International Olympic Committee President Thomas Back said: 'The Boston bid will be a strong one. Bostonians are well known for their enthusiasm for sport and the city has a great heritage in sport, science and education.' Boston will have to beat off competition from the likes of Italy, Germany and France . Boston hopes the fact that most of the venues will be within walking distance of the city center will improve the chances of their bid. So far, only Rome is the only other city to publicly announce its intention to bid for the games. Germany is expected to chose either Berlin or Hamburg, while Istanbul, Paris, Doha and an African city are also thought to be considering bids. Former Massachusetts governor and failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney has backed the Boston bid. He was part of the team that brought the 2002 winter games to Salt Lake City. Mr Romney said: 'We know Boston is the place to inspire a new generation of athletes to discover the greatness within.' The USOC considered 35 cities over a 22-month evaluation process before deciding upon Boston.","Boston secured the U.S. nomination to bid for the 2024 Olympic Games .

"Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid revealed today that he may permanently lose sight in his right eye as a result of an accident that took place at his Nevada home on New Year's Day while he was exercising but is 'very hopeful' he'll fully recover. 'This isn’t anything that is a slam dunk,' he told Las Vegas public radio station KNPR during an interview. 'I had a serious injury in my eye. There was some blood accumulation there and they’re hoping it resolves itself.' Reid traveled to Washington this week with plans to return to work on Tuesday when Congress began anew but wasn't able to leave his house on doctor's orders. He'll continue to work from home next week, he said today, as his face continues to heal. 'I’m just following their orders. It’s a day-to-day deal.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Nevada Sen. Harry Reid is pictured here at his Washington home in a still taken from a video his office posted to YouTube last Tuesday . Unable to go to work, Reid brought the work to him. The top Democrat held meetings with his staff and leadership team at his Washington, D.C. home last week. From left he is pictured with Sens. Patty Murray, Richard Durbin and Chuck Schumer . A former boxer, 75-year-old Reid still works out every day. On Jan. 1 he suffered a concussion after the resistance band he was training with hit him in the face and knocked him off his feet. The fall caused him to break three ribs in addition to multiple facial bones and landed him a nasty black eye. Not one to give up easily, the Democratic senator flew to Washington, D.C. over the weekend with the intention of joining his colleagues on Capitol Hill this week. His office announced on Tuesday that he would not come to Senate after all, however, on the advice of his doctors. Unable to go to work, Reid brought the work to him. The top Democrat held meetings with his staff and leadership team at his home and his office sent out statements on his behalf on major legislative initiatives. 'Senator Reid has spoken with President Obama multiple times since his injury and will continue to keep a busy schedule in the coming days,' the senator's communications director, Adam Jentleson, said in a statement on Tuesday. Appearing in a YouTube video that same day, a bandaged Reid said, 'Most people know I fought [boxed] for a couple of years. After any one of those fights, I never looked like I do now.' Reid joked that he didn't get his black eye from famed Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao or from bull riding or riding a motorcycle. 'I was exercising in my new home,' he said. 'The doctors have told me I'd better take it easy.' Meanwhile, at the Capitol, Reid's No. 2, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, supervised the Democratic caucus in the Nevada senator's stead. 'I think I’ve done a good job directing my crew without me actually being physically present at the Capitol,' Reid told KNPR today, according to the Washington Examiner. Reid told the radio station that his limited vision has caused him to rely more heavily on staff at present. The longtime lawmaker said the incident will have no lasting effects on his ability to do his job and that he still plans to run for reelection in 2016 when his current term is up. 'I’ve always been very confident in my ability to fight back, and I'm going to continue to fight back,' he said. 'I've been set back a little bit but I’m in the process of getting setup for the next go-around.' The septuagenarian pointed out that he's likely in better shape than most of the radio program's listeners. 'I don’t know how many people out there could sit down and do 250 pushups or do the strength exercise I did with those bands hundreds and hundreds of times — hundreds of times — every week, three times a week,' Reid said. 'So no one has to question my physical ability.' After the interview, Reid's spokesman reiterated how tough the senator is on twitter by sharing his workout regimen. 'To recap Sen. Reid's exercise routine: 250 SITUPS 3x/wk (750 total). Arm & chest: 420 reps w/exercise band 3x/wk. Walks 3 mi/day. Plus yoga,' Jentleson said.","Reid told a Nevada radio station that he's 'very hopeful' for a full recovery but 'this isn’t anything that is a slam dunk'

"Tick tock, tick tock. The clock is ticking for a Melbourne thief who brazenly stole a $22,000 Rolex Cosmograph Daytona from a heavily pregnant couple and fled  after threatening them with a screwdriver. The unnamed couple, who live in the Victorian suburb of Balwyn, placed the advert for the watch on online classifieds site Gumtree hoping its sale would help go towards baby costs. This Rolex Cosmograph Daytona . The expensive Rolex has a unique chocolate brown Arabic dial, ceramic black bezel strap and an 18 carat Everose gold folding buckle. A potential buyer, who calls himself 'Johnny', contacted the couple saying he was interested and the vendor and his six-months-pregnant wife arranged to meet at Cafe Max in the Doncaster Westfield. After discussing the price and asking to try it on 'Johnny', who was still wearing the watch, fled. The seller chased the thief but was forced to back off when the criminal pulled  a weapon out from his pocket, believed to be a screwdriver, and threatened him. Do you know this man? The thief asks to try the Rolex on and flees with watch, clearly visible, still on his wrist . Police say the couple, who are expecting their second child, are 'upset' and urge people selling expensive goods to be cautious and suggest selling expensive items 'via other means.' Detective Senior Constable Leanne Trusler told the ABC: 'It doesn't happen all the time, but it's an example of the dangers of selling online. 'I'd make some follow-up calls to make sure you're meeting someone who they say they are. 'But selling a piece of jewellery or a watch at that price, I'd be doing it via other means.' The unshaven thief, who was caught on CCTV, is described as being 20 to 30 years, athletically-built and about 180 centimetres tall. He was clad in a black baseball cap, a blue hoodie with white lines down the front, tracksuit pants with two stripes down the side and runners, . Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report.","Couple posts advert for $22k Rolex Cosmograph Daytona on Gumtree .

"Married murderers awaiting the death penalty for killing a teenage boy have been granted permission to have sex so their parents can have a grandchild to remember them by. Jasvir Singh and his wife Sonia filed a petition asking for conjugal visits and the right to have children after they were given the death sentence following a lengthy public trial. The couple kidnapped the 16-year-old son of a wealthy family and demanded a ransom - but when their scheme started to go wrong, they killed the boy to stop him identifying them. Married murderers: The couple kidnapped the 16-year-old son of a wealthy family and demanded a ransom - but when their scheme started to go wrong, they killed the boy to stop him identifying them . The bizarre ruling allowing the murderers to have sex was handed down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court - which accepted it was a fundamental human right to have progeny. When the couple first filed their petition, the court rejected that it was a human right to have sex. But it accepted that if it was purely for the purposes of having children, whether through conjugal visits or artificial insemination, it should be allowed. Justice Surya Kant of the high court said that authorities at the Central Jail in Patiala should make arrangements for the couple's wish to be carried out. Wants children: Sonia Singh hopes to have a child with her husband Jasvir before their death sentence is carried out . Lawyers for Jasvir argued that he is the only son of his parents, and that he and his wife had only been married eight months when they were arrested. Indian justice officials had originally rejected the plea because of the seriousness of the crime. But they overturned the earlier ruling in the broader public interest saying that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right of convicts and jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination in order to have children.

"Tony Blair phoned the Commons Speaker to discuss his appearance before Parliament to explain ‘comfort letters’ sent to IRA fugitives, the Mail has been told. The former prime minister contacted John Bercow in an apparent attempt to wriggle out of giving evidence to MPs investigating a secret deal to offer Republican terror suspects an amnesty, it is claimed. He failed, but managed to limit his appearance to an hour, which families of IRA victims believe is a snub. 'Comfort letters': The former prime minister (left) contacted John Bercow (right) in an apparent attempt to wriggle out of giving evidence to MPs investigating a secret deal to offer Republican terror suspects an amnesty, it is claimed . Through the controversial scheme set up under Mr Blair’s government in 1999, more than 200 paramilitary fighters were assured that they were not wanted by the police. Mr Blair, now the UN’s Middle East peace envoy, had faced anger for his reluctance for more than nine months to appear before the Northern Ireland select committee over the ‘on-the-runs’ programme. He wrote to MPs insisting he had ‘nothing new to say’ before the committee instructed him to appear this month. But in a phone call to the Speaker on Monday, the ex-Labour leader is understood to have asked whether he had to answer questions in person. Mr Blair had insisted it was unnecessary because he gave evidence in private to a review of the scheme by Lady Justice Hallett. The judge concluded last July that the letters, sent out after talks with Sinn Fein, were not unlawful but there were ‘significant failures’ in how the scheme operated. A Whitehall insider said: ‘Blair rang the Speaker to explain that he could not come on Wednesday 14th and tried to get the Speaker to say there was no need for him to come along at all. 'He said he’d said it all before to the Hallett review. But Bercow was pretty robust. He said it would be very, very bad form if he did not come.’ A Whitehall insider said: ‘Blair rang the Speaker to explain that he could not come on Wednesday 14th and tried to get the Speaker to say there was no need for him to come along at all' A Westminster source said: ‘Why did he need to go to the Speaker if he just wanted to discuss altering the date and time he appeared? 'It seems very odd. It would have been easier to contact the committee chairman or clerk.’ Mr Blair will now answer questions for an hour on Tuesday, which some MPs believe is disrespectful to IRA victims. The inquiry was triggered by the case of John Downey, the man accused of the Hyde Park bombing in 1982. The letters came to light when his trial collapsed last February after it emerged that the 62-year-old had been told he would not face prosecution for the blast, which killed four soldiers. A source close to the families said: ‘They are furious with Blair. They believe there are many questions to be asked about the issuing of letters to the IRA men.’ Northern Ireland select committee chairman Laurence Robertson said: ‘Mr Blair’s appearance will fill in some gaps. 'There are a lot of unsolved murders in Northern Ireland and a lot of people still feel very hurt, and we hope getting to the truth of this matter can help bring some closure.’ Sources close to Mr Blair said the allegations were ‘absolutely not true’.","MPs wanted to question him over deal for Republican terror suspects .

"Warm-blooded animals tend to be coloured darker the closer they live to the equator. Now that same rule has been found to exist in flowers as climate change warms up the planet, changing the pigmentation of plants around the world. US scientists made the discovery after looking to see how flowers appear from a bee's perspective in the ultraviolet range. It may look similar to the naked eye but flower bloom (left) shows a larger area of dark pigmentation under UV light (right). The flowers come from the extreme north (top) and south (bottom) of New Zealand . Bees see things very differently to humans. For instance, what appears bright yellow to a person can appear dark or patterned to a bee. Professor Matthew Koski at the University of Pittsburgh researchers studied the flowers of Argentina anserina. The plant, which belongs to the rose family, was examined across four lines of latitude - three in the Northern and one in the Southern Hemisphere. Using ultraviolet imaging, Professor Koski and his colleague, Dr Tia-Lynn Ashman, looked at the 'bull's-eye' centres of the flowers, which look dark to pollinators. Researchers predict that as Earth receives more UV light at northern and southern climes due to depletion of the ozone layer from fossil fuels, flowers farther from the equator are likely to begin to evolve traits. They discovered that they were larger the nearer to the equator the flowers grew. Larger 'bull's-eyes,' Professor Koski explains, are associated with higher levels of ultraviolet light, which is more intense near the equator. The team believe larger bull's-eyes absorb more ultraviolet light, acting as a protective trait because high ultraviolet light levels are known to damage DNA. A species of butterfly named the quino checkerspot has defied expectations of extinction by moving to cooler climes and changing its diet . As the planet warms, animals and plants are learning to adapt to their new environment by either migrating or evolving, new research has revealed. Many scientists believe the rate of climate change is too rapid for various species to keep up. But two studies released last year have offered some hope that experts may have underestimated their abilities. The first study reveals how a species of butterfly named the quino checkerspot has defied expectations of extinction by moving to cooler climes and changing its diet. Separate research led by Stanford University scientist Steve Palumbi found how some corals can quickly switch on or off certain genes in order to survive in warmer-than-average tidal waters. The research team discovered corals can adjust their internal functions to tolerate hot water 50 times faster than they would adapt through evolutionary change alone. In their study, they confirmed that extreme ultraviolet light reduces the viability of pollen in Argentina anserina. They predict that as Earth receives more ultraviolet light at extreme northern and southern climes due to depletion of the ozone layer, flowers farther from the equator are likely to begin to evolve traits. However, this may come at a cost as bigger bull's-eyes obscure the 'sweet centre' of the flower where pollen and nectar rewards are found, making poorer targets for bees. 'Spring is coming earlier, and plants and pollinators are no longer in sync,' Dr Ashman said. 'Increased ultraviolet radiation is causing the same sort of disruption.' The plant, which is in the rose family, was studied across four lines of latitude - three in the Northern and one in the Southern Hemisphere. In their study, the researchers confirmed that extreme ultraviolet light reduces the viability of pollen in Argentina anserina (pictured)","Scientists studied the Argentina anserina across four lines of latitude .

"An extreme snowmobiler who plunged into a freezing ravine says he was so certain that he would die that he wrote goodbye letters to his wife and children. But 33 hours after Barry Sadler fell 3,000 feet into a creek in northwestern Montana on Sunday, his friends miraculously found him alive after following his tracks and directed him out to safety. Sadler - who even put on goggles so crows wouldn't peck out his eyes when he died - did not think he would live to tell the tale. 'When you're an extreme snowmobiler and you get lost, you're usually dead,' the 54-year-old told KECI-TV. 'You're going places where people won't go - where people shouldn't go.' Lucky to be alive: Barry Sadler, 54, fell into a creek in Montana on Sunday after he was snowmobiling along a steep ridge. He thought he would not survive, so wrote goodbye notes to his wife and three children . The bodybuilder and MMA fighter, from Mullan, Idaho, was 'side-hilling' - snowmobiling along a steep ridge with one ski in the snow and one in the air - with friends when he took one wrong turn and the snow suddenly dropped out beneath him, he said. He dropped down a chute and into the ravine, landing in a creek with his snowmobile on top of him and breaking some bones in his hands. He was able to push away the sled, and switched on its engine for heat every 90 minutes over the next 30-plus hours - until it ran out of gas at around 10pm Monday. As part of his extreme mindset, he had also climbed on the snowmobile without survival gear or water. At one point he even accepted he might die from carbon monoxide poisoning because, when his snowmobile did have gas, he was getting so close to it to keep warm. Brutal: He fell into a ravine in northwestern Montana, pictured, but was found by friends 33 hours later . Final moments: He switched on his snowmobile (pictured) intermittently for heat and huddled beneath it for protection, but thought he would die. He even put on goggles so birds would not pluck out his eyes . Back home: Sadler is pictured enjoying being back home in Mullan, Idaho after five friends followed his tracks into the ravine and found him. They managed to pull him out and trek off the mountain . Certain he would never be found alive, he wrote goodbye notes to his wife and three children, aged 20, 18 and 16, on his cellphone and placed it in his jacket's inside pocket. 'I'm not a quitter,' he said. 'But I knew there was no way I was coming out of there.' Speaking to KHQ, he recalled the pain of feeling as if he was freezing to death. 'It's not quick. It's drawn out, and you're shaking so violently it hurts,' he said. But about two hours after his gas ran out, five friends who had followed his snowmobile track hiked into the ravine and rescued him. 'These guys shook me,' he said. 'I wake up, and all I see are two lights, and I thought they were angels. And I was kind of out of it, and the only thing I asked was, ""What are you guys doing here?""' The men gave him dry clothes, blankets and food, but they were still a long way from home. Fighting fit: Sadler, pictured in his gym in 2011, is a bodybuilder and extreme sportsman - but was scolded by sheriff's deputies for choosing to ride his snowmobile without proper gear or water . Relief: His relieved wife Dana said she believed her husband was alive 'by the grace of God' It took five hours to hike out of the drainage, and they had to walk another two miles to reach the snowmobiles. They then rode an additional six miles to Sadler's house. 'It was everything I could do to hold on,' Sadler told the Shoshone News-Press. Sadler suffered some broken bones in his hands, frostbite, hypothermia and dehydration but is now back home with his wife, Dana. He predicts he'll be healthy enough to be back on his snowmobile in about a month. Dana told KECI she believes her husband only survived 'by the grace of God... and really good friends'. Two sheriff's deputies involved in the search scolded Sadler for riding by himself and without survival gear, an avalanche beacon or a satellite locator.","Barry Sadler was snowmobiling with friends in Montana on Sunday when he took a wrong turn and fell 3,000ft down a chute and into a creek .

"Two men who were charged after counter terrorism police raided their homes will remain behind bars until at least next week. Omar Ammouche was charged with ammunition possession offences  after counter-terrorism police raided a home on Chiswick Road in Greenacre in Sydney's west on Friday. The 33-year-old  man was arrested and was later charged with acquiring and possessing prohibited ammunition without holding a licence. Following ongoing investigation, Jibryl Almaouie was charged with a string of offences, including unauthorised firearm possession, also on Friday after a separate terrorism raid in December. Scroll down for video . Omar Ammouche was charged after counter terrorism police raided a number of properties on Friday morning . The 33-year-old Greenacre man was arrested when police raided a home on Chiswick Road . The man has been refused bail to appear in Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday . The 21-year-old attended Surry Hills Police Station on Friday where he was arrested at 2.30pm  after counter-terrorism police seized a rifle, two shotguns and a large amount of ammunition at a Condell Park house in Sydney's west on December 18. The two men, who are not co-accused, did not appear when their cases were mentioned in Parramatta Local Court on Saturday. It comes as the raids were carried out in Sydney's southwest, in relation to Operation Duntulm which is part of the Joint Counter Terrorism Team, and allegedly seized a number of items including a quantity of prohibited drugs and documents. It was the same operation which saw the arrest of Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, at Sydney Airport on May 3 when she was trying to board a flight to Malaysia with her four children. It is part of Operation Appleby, which is investigating  domestic terrorism and foreign incursions in Syria and Iraq. Other warrants were executed in Leppington, Condell Park and Punchbowl. Police allege that a quantity of prohibited drugs were seized from another man in Punchbowl. A NSW Police statement said the raids were executed 'not as a result of any specific terrorism threat'. The raids were carried out in Sydney's southwest, in relation to Operation Duntulm which is part of the Joint Counter Terrorism Team, and allegedly seized a number of items including a quantity of prohibited drugs and documents . Other warrants were executed in Leppington, Condell Park and Punchbowl . Operation Duntulm is an ongoing Joint Counter Terrorism Team (Sydney) investigation into alleged financial assistance and support being provided for foreign fighters overseas. Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch, Commander of the Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics Command said Operation Duntulm the raids are a timely reminder that police 'will not become complacent, and remain committed to disrupting criminal activity'. 'The operation today is about the gathering of evidence and intelligence to enable us to take action against those who think they can engage in these activities,' he said. 'Investigators this morning seized a range of items from the premises searched including documents and computers, and these will be forensically examined. 'It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe in, if you choose to illegally fight in an overseas conflict you are not only breaking the law, you are placing yourself in immense danger.' Australian Federal Police Acting National Manager Counter Terrorism Peter Crozier said community safety was the primary objective of all Joint Counter Terrorism Team activities. 'The priority for all agencies involved in these operations is to ensure the safety of the community, and we encourage all people to speak to us if they have any concerns or have information they wish to provide,' Acting Assistant Commissioner Crozier said . 'Now more than ever, it is important for the community and police to continue to work together and promote the diverse, inclusive and supportive society we have here in Australia.' Counter terrorism police have raided a number of properties on Friday morning in relation to an ongoing operation which saw the arrest of Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima (pictured), at Sydney Airport on May 3 . Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, was arrested at Sydney Airport on May 3 when she was trying to board a flight to Malaysia with her four children . Mrs Elomar was then charged with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. She has denied the charges . Mr Elomar (pictured) is believed to have flown to Syria late last year with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport . Back in May, officers from Operation Duntulm arrested and charged Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. She has denied the charges. Her husband, Mohamed Elomar, is believed to be fighting with terror group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Mr Elomar is believed to have flown to Syria late last year with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport. Ms Elomar's property was not one of those raided by police. They raided one property in Greenacre and seized items not related.

"The New York prosecutor who handled the case in which a white police officer was cleared in the chokehold death of Eric Garner has announced he is running for Congress. Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan issued a statement saying he is formally seeking the endorsements of the Republican, Conservative and Independence parties. He said that since he first expressed interest, 'The enthusiasm for my candidacy has only broadened and intensified.' Running: Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan issued a statement saying he is formally seeking the endorsements of the Republican, Conservative and Independence parties . Cases: He oversaw the grand jury process which saw a white police cleared of killing Eric Garner, 43, in a chokehold in July in Staten Island . Donovan's announcement did not mention the July 17 death of Eric Garner, 43, after scuffling with officers who were arresting him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Amateur video showed an officer holding Garner around the neck as Garner gasped, 'I can't breathe.' A Staten Island grand jury decided against indicting the policeman, and Garner's death, like that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, touched off nationwide protests. They were cited by a gunman who murdered two New York City police officers last month. Donovan said when the officer was cleared that the grand jury found 'no reasonable cause' to charge him. His spokeswoman, Madelaine St. Onge, said Friday the campaign had no further comment on the Garner case. A call to the Rev. Al Sharpton, a leader of protests after Garner's death, was not immediately returned. No date has been set yet for the special election, made necessary by the resignation of Rep. Michael Grimm after he pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges. Candidates are to be chosen by parties or through petitions. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a statement that electing Donovan would create 'another political sideshow.' Predecessor: The special election in the New York constituency follows the resignation of Michael Grimm who pleaded guilty to a felony charge of tax evasion on January 5 . Republican state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis has also expressed interest in the congressional seat.  Potential Democratic candidates include state Assemblyman Michael Cusick and former U.S. Rep. Michael McMahon, who lost to Grimm in 2010. Donovan's previous experience in politics extends back to 2010 when he ran for state attorney general and lost to Democrat Eric Schneiderman. He is best known, however, for prosecuting a police officer who put Staten Island resident Eric Garner in a choke hold, contributing to his death. A grand jury's decision not to bring charges against the law enforcement officer earlier this month incited national protests and the 'I Can't Breathe' movement - Garner's now famous last words. Donovan's failure to convince the jury to allow the district attorney's office to move forward with its case has angered the city's African-American population. However, blacks made up just under 10 percent of the borough's population as of the last census.","Daniel Donovan has announced he's formally seeking endorsements .

"Great-grandfather George Bates, 76, was beaten unconscious outside his home after asking a woman who was swearing on the street to be quiet . A great-grandfather was beaten unconscious outside his home after stepping outside to ask a swearing woman to keep it down. Retired mechanic George Bates, 76, went outside to ask a woman who was talking loudly on her phone to lower her voice. Moments later a man launched a vicious attack on him, hitting the pensioner over the head and causing him fall to the ground outside his home in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire. Mr Bates was lying in his bed at 6pm on January 3 when the commotion began outside. After half an hour, the great-grandfather went out to ask the woman to be quiet. He said: 'There was a young woman ranting and raving on her phone. She was using foul language. I thought it was outside my house - but when I went to the door, it was across the street. 'I went over and said ""Do you mind?"" and that I had had enough. I told her I was going to ring the police. 'Just as I started to walk away, a man came round the corner and the next thing I know was I heard a whack.' 'I was in quite a lot of pain and I am a bit nervous to go out now. It is not what you expect when you are in your 70s.' Mr Bates, who suffered severe bruising and swelling around his eyes and face, managed to make his way back home after the assault. The pensioner did not report the incident to the police straight away - and it was not until his daughter, a nurse, visited him the next day and saw his injuries that officers were called. The 76-year-old was unable to describe what his attacker looked like because the incident happened so quickly. Police have now launched an investigation to try to track down the man and the woman. The retired mechanic was suddenly hit over the head by a man after asking the woman to keep it down . The pensioner suffered severe bruising in the attack but was able to make it back to his home after the attack . Police are now appealing for any information on the attack on Thwaites Road (pictured) in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire . PC Stuart King, of Lancashire Police, said: 'This was an unprovoked attack on an elderly man who has suffered a nasty injury to his face as a result. 'I appeal to anyone who may have seen the incident to contact us. 'I urge anybody who may have any information about the woman, who was on her phone for around 15 to 30 minutes in the area, to get in touch.' Councillor Peter Britcliffe, who represents Oswaldtwistle on Hyndburn Council, said he was appalled to hear about the attack. He said: 'My thoughts go out to Mr Bates. It is a dreadful incident. If anybody knows anything, I hope they contact the police. 'Let us hope this person is brought to justice quickly because they are not the sort of person we want in Oswaldtwistle.'","Great-grandfather George Bates was beaten unconscious outside his home .

Blonde Charlotte Christodoulou, 23,was discovered dead at Harlescott Junior School in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Two men aged 32 and 39 along with a 31-year-old woman were initially arrested on suspicion of her murder but the charge was later changed to obstructing a coroner. It is an offence to obstruct a coroner, whether by disposing of a body before they can inquire into the circumstance of the death, or acting to prevent an inquest, the Crown Prosecution Service say.

"Tragedy: Father-of-six Ceri Griffiths, 71, died when a tree he was felling crushed him, an inquest heard . A wildlife park boss was killed in front of his son after he was crushed by a tree he was felling for fuel, an inquest heard today. Father-of-six Ceri Griffiths, 71, could not escape as the tree crashed down onto his head at his South Wales bird centre. Mr Griffiths suffered catastrophic brain injuries from the accident at his Welsh Hawking Centre in Barry, near Cardiff, and died later in hospital. He cut into a v-shaped trunk believing it was one tree - not two - and the second tree fell on him. Falconry expert Mr Griffiths and son Griff were cutting down trees with a chainsaw to use as fuel for his wood burner. His son  told the Cardiff inquest: 'He had cut a v-shape in the tree four feet from the ground when I saw that the tree was two trees which had merged into one trunk. 'My dad cut through the trunk not knowing this and as it was it was falling it caused a split and the whole thing came crashing down. 'My dad could not get out of the way and it fell onto his head.' Paramedics treated Mr Griffiths at the scene before he was taken to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales in October where he died hours later. Former teacher Mr Griffiths bought a former zoo in Barry to turn it into one of Britain's leading falconry centres. He gave lessons, provided hawks and owls for films and TV and became a pioneer of breeding birds of prey in captivity. Passion: Former teacher Mr Griffiths bought a former zoo in Barry, South Wales, to turn it into one of Britain's leading falconry centres . Arab sheiks visited his centre and he had recently been working on a falconry project in Dubai. Cardiff assistant coroner Christopher Woolley told the inquest: 'Mr Griffiths was very experienced in cutting down trees. But unknown to him two trees had merged. 'It made the cutting down more complicated than he had anticipated. It split 20 feet high and came down unpredictably. He died from catastrophic brain injuries.' The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Father-of-six Ceri Griffiths, 71, was fatally injured in front of his son Griff .

"The red planet has a new scar after a fresh impact crater was found on Mars' Elysium Planitia volcanic region. Discovered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, astronomers believe it was created between February 2012 and June 2014. The image shows a very distinct crater rim and ejecta that is much darker than the surrounding dust-covered terrain.

The distribution of the debris around it suggests that the impactor struck from the west and Nasa is still calculating its size. Researchers used the Hirise camera to examine this site after orbiter's Context Camera had revealed a change in appearance. The 143lb (65kg), £26.4 million ($40 million) instrument was built under the direction of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. It consists of a 0.5 metre (19.7 inch) aperture reflecting telescope - the largest so far of any deep space mission. This allows it to take pictures of Mars with resolutions of 0.3 m/pixel (about 1ft). The distribution of the debris around it suggests that the impactor struck from the west and Nasa is still calculating its size.Researchers used the Hirise camera to examine this site after orbiter's Context Camera had revealed a change in appearance . Time to stop remarking about how unearthly cold it is outside because on Thursday, Mars was warmer than many parts of the U.S. The daytime high in the red planet's Gale Crater, as recorded by the curiosity Rover, -8°C (17.6°F), warmer than the -14°C (-6°F) high in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Temperatures in fourteen states from Washington to Maine reported temperatures colder than Mars, as a brutal blast of Arctic air sweeps the country. Mars just recently passed its closest orbit to the sun, which partially explains why the temperature was relatively balmy. The Gale Crater is also located in one of the warmest parts of the planet, near the equator. Elysium Planitia is the second largest volcanic region on Mars after Tharsis, and is around 1,050 miles by 1 490 miles (1,700 by 2,400 km) in size. All of Mars’ impact craters can be viewed using a map created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Virginia. Taking 16 years to create, this colourful map describes the geography of Mars as it is today while also shedding light on the red planet’s watery past. 'Spacecraft exploration of Mars over the past couple decades has greatly improved our understanding of what geologic materials, events and processes shaped its surface,' said USGS scientist and lead author, Dr Kenneth Tanaka. 'The new geologic map brings this research together into a holistic context that helps to illuminate key relationships in space and time, providing information to generate and test new hypotheses.' Out of the thousands of craters, earlier this year one has emerged as the likely source of most of the Martian meteorites that have been found on Earth. Researchers believe the Mojave Crater, a 34-mile (55km) wide basin on the Mars’s equator is the origin of the “shergottites” meteorites. These are a group of meteorites that includes about 75 per cent of the 150 known Martian meteorites. Scientists are keen to learn where the meteorites came from as it would help them piece together the history of Mars.

"A paranoid schizophrenic  who stabbed a nurse to death in a low security mental hospital to avoid being sent to a non-smoking facility without wifi  will never be released, a judge has said. Ryan Matthews, a patient at Wotton Lawn Hospital in Gloucester, stabbed 53-year-old Sharon Wall in the back with a smuggled kitchen knife in July. The 62-year-old had previously been admitted to Broadmoor Hospital and sectioned under the Mental Health Act after murdering two people in 1983. Scroll down for video . Ryan Matthews (left) was told he would never be released again after murdering nurse Sharon Wall (right) at Wotton Lawn Hospital in Gloucestershire where the 53-year-old was a nurse . On July 9, he stabbed Mrs Wall in the back with a Sainsbury's kitchen knife to the horror of other health workers and patients. His motive, Bristol Crown Court heard, was to avoid being moved to another facility which did not allow smoking and did not have wifi. Sentencing Matthews to a whole-life order today, Mr Justice Davis told the victim's family he would never be released. 'Obviously that man will never be released. 'Let us hope that he does not kill someone else in some other setting when he does not get his own way.' It comes as it was revealed the 62-year-old was serving a double life sentence for the murders of two people in 1983 when he killed the nurse. After serving 16 years behind bars, the mental patient was admitted to the notorious high security hospital for men, Broadmoor. Hospital chiefs have admitted they have 'no idea' how psychiatric patient Matthews smuggled the Sainsbury's kitchen knife (pictured above) into the facility . On the morning of Mrs Hall's death, he was seen calmly smoking a cigarette in the hospital's yard. Moments later a knife had been plunged into the nurse's back. She was pronounced dead shortly afterwards, after beginning rounds in the hospital ward. Questions have been raised over whether the nurse should have been working alone at the time of the attack. 'The practice was that when the night shift ended and the day shift started, what was supposed to be a pair of healthcare assistants would check the patients were in place and well,' said Richard Smith QC. 'There was some doubt as to why Sharon was going through that process on her own that day.' Following her killer's sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Porter said authorities were still at a loss as to why he murdered the 'compassionate' nurse. Staff at the mental health hospital where Sharon Wall was killed have vowed to step up security after admitting they have 'no idea' how her murderer smuggled a Sainsbury's kitchen knife into the facility. Shaun Clee, chief executive of the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, said searches would be beefed up at the 'low secure' Montpellier Ward at Wotton Lawn Hospital. It comes as staff admit they still do not know how Matthews smuggled the murder weapon into the hospital. 'What we know for a fact is we have no idea where the knife came from,' Mr Clee said. 'Our policies previously were in line with many other organisations’ policies but we feel at this stage now, in the light of what has happened, that it would be appropriate to enhance those further.' While it is not known how Matthews brought the weapon into the facility, he had fashioned a plastic sheaf to contain it, the court heard. The 62-year-old is said to have brought the blade into the facility in November 2013 - some nine months before using it to kill Mrs Hall, his lawyer said. 'Mr Matthews has told those who care for him that he purchased the knife some months previously,' Mark Sharman said. 'He purchased it for his own personal protection in November of the previous year.' 'We interviewed Ryan Matthews over three days, seven interviews, and he never answered a single question,' he said. 'Shortly before the attack, Matthews had made it known that he did not want to be transferred to Ty Catrin (Hospital) in Cardiff. 'On the day of the attack it was the very same day he was going to be moved to that hospital. 'The day before he did make specific mention that he would not be going. 'And that is why I do not believe that Sharon was the targeted individual he wanted to murder. 'She just happened, unfortunately, to be the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time.' He added the case had struck a chord with investigators working in the public sector. 'With myself and the investigation team this whole incident really hits home in the heart because as public servants we all come into work in the morning, we can hopefully do the best we can do. 'But we all go home to our families and Sharon’s family don’t have Sharon coming home any more.' Relatives and colleagues have paid tribute to the nurse, describing her as 'one in a million'. 'We would like to thank everyone for their support and such kind words that have been said about Sharon. 'She was nothing less than one in a million and to say that she will be missed is an understatement,' a family statement read. Meanwhile staff at the hospital expressed their shock over the sudden horror, describing Mrs Hall as 'a amazing person'. The woman's death shook the healthcare system, with the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt describing it as 'devastating'. 'The events in Gloucestershire are devastating and our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of the staff member involved,' he said in a statement in July. Wotton Lawn Hospital is an 88-bed acute mental health hospital near the centre of Gloucester which provides inpatient services for the county. While chiefs say it is predominantly a hospital, one unit - in which Matthews was being treated - has a security fence. Those held in low secure units can include patients previously admitted to high or medium secure units, the chief executive of 2gether NHS Foundation Trust said. Staff said security would be beefed up at the hospital in Gloucestershire (pictured) where Mrs Wall was described as a 'compassionate and amazing' nurse . Chilling footage of Ryan Matthews smoking a cigarette in the yard of the mental hospital where he was a patient moments before killing nurse Sharon Wall has emerged. Pacing across the concrete square, the 62-year-old appears relaxed on CCTV footage taken at around 7.30am. No more than a minute afterwards, he is believed to have plunged a Sainsbury's knife into the  53-year-old's back twice. After stabbing the woman, Matthews waited patiently in his room where ringing alarms brought other staff members running to the crime scene. Today it emerged the patient was already serving a double life sentence after murdering two people in the 1980s. Following a stint in prison, he was admitted to Broadmoor hospital for men before being released and admitted to Wotton Lawn in Gloucester. A judge told the psychiatric patient today he would never be free again. Chilling: The schizophrenic murderer was seen smoking a cigarette outside in the hospital's yard just moments before plunging a kitchen knife into the back of nurse Sharon Wall . It helps such patients 'move down through medium secure and low secure before being discharged,' said Shaun Clee. 'Depending on the individual’s presented circumstances, there will be times when people have leave from the unit, and that can be both escorted leave and unescorted leave.' On the day of Mrs Wall's death, staff were preparing to escort Matthews to a different facility in Wales. Speaking after today's sentencing, Mr Clee said: 'Our internal investigation has concluded that this attack could not have been predicted or prevented. 'Our first priority following Sharon's death was to make sure we understood how the tragic incident occurred and what changes need to be made to our policies and procedures. 'We launched a serious incident review within hours of the event occurring and an internal investigation followed shortly after. 'During the investigation, we have focused a great deal on how the weapon used in this crime was on the Montpellier Unit. 'Neither we, nor the police, know how Mr Matthews gained access to a knife and unfortunately we may never find that out. 'Robust control and monitoring of sharps within the low secure unit exist and all the unit's sharps are properly accounted for.' Paying tribute to the nurse, he added: 'Sharon was a highly compassionate, well-respected and dedicated colleague. 'Everyone who knew her speaks about her warmth, caring nature and good sense of humour and colleagues across the trust feel her loss every day.'","Ryan Matthews has been given a life order for the murder of Sharon Wall .

"The president of the Discovery Channel is finally speaking out about their recent special Eaten Alive. The highly hyped network event was supposed to show Paul Rosalie, a noted naturalist, as he was consumed by a giant Anaconda, something that would be made possible by a special suit he was wearing. In the end the snake never did eat Rosalie, and now, Discovery president Rich Ross is admitting that the show was misleading. Scroll down for video . Sorry: Rich Ross (above), the president of Discovery Channel, is admitting that the network's Eaten Alive stunt, where a snake was supposed to eat a grown man, was 'misleading' Not fun: The network special was supposed to show naturalist Paul Rosalie being eaten by an anaconda (above) while wearing a speical suit . Speaking at the 2015 TCA, Ross said the show had 'the right intention with a packaging that was misleading.' Then, according to The Wrap, he said the 'show probably erred on the side of sensationalism.' He also said there would not be a similar stunt on the network in the future. Roslaie and the program came under fire after, in the end, only part of his head was consumed by the giant anaconda for just seconds before he called it off. What's more, though the show featured a search for the perfect snake, in the end it was discovered that the reptile had been specially flown in for the stunt. That reptile was also far too small to eat a grown man it was later revealed. Cheating: In the end, the snake was called of after getting part of Rosalie's head in its mouth, this after it was flown in as no other snakes were found in the wild . Rosalie has also previously admitted that he too believed the special was misleading, and that it was actually meant to be 'an attempt at entering the belly of the beast not a promised outcome.' The show and Rosalie were bashed by many on social media, who felt they had been cheated following weeks of promotions that promised to show the naturalist being eaten by a snake. And while the stunt may have looked uneventful on television, Rosalie later said that the snake was actually constricting him for an hour before he was rescued.","Rich Ross, the president of Discovery Channel, is admitting that their Eaten Alive stunt was 'misleading'

"Jason Alexander has been jailed for spending thousands on electronic goods on his company's credit card . A 'Robin Hood' fraudster has been jailed after using his company credit card to buy £90,000 of electronic gadgets to sell to colleagues at bargain prices. Jason Alexander used his manufacturing company's accounts to buy iPads, phones and computer equipment before selling them on to workmates. The 39-year-old from Pontypool, South Wales, has been jailed for two years after details of his 'philanthropic' scam emerged. The city's Crown Court heard how Alexander, the purchasing manager Northern Automotive Systems in Gilwern near Abergavenny, spent as much as £5,000 on some items which he then gave colleagues for  £180. Buying gadgets on Amazon, eBay and Argos, he racked up a £90,956 bill on the company credit card - spending £10,000 more a month than in previous years. Among other charges made to the company, for which he had worked for 14 years, was petrol for his Land Rover and Mini and tickets to a Nicki Minaj concert. His deceit was revealed when the company asked employees if any of them had bought cut priced electrical goods. Sentencing Judge Stephen Hopkins QC described the scheme as 'philanthropic'. 'It seems you were doing it as some kind of philanthropic act. 'In some cases spending £5,000 on items and then selling the items to employees for as little as £180 on the philanthropic basis they will not have been able to buy the items themselves.' 'The impact upon your colleagues has been awful. You have stolen from the company and there was a dip in morale for a period. 'You had an enormous impact on a large number of perfectly innocent people. Those to whom you sold goods now feel stupid and stressed.

"If you are one of those people who didn't get a blender for Christmas, then surely the world's obsession with smoothies and juicing has you pining after your own right now? In case you haven't heard, benefits of blenders include: . Scroll down for video . FEMAIL writer Toni Jones puts the £100 Nutribullet (left) to the test against the £400 Vitamix (below) Toni's husband Dan Kennedy prefers the Vitamix blender . The best blenders aren't cheap but you should think about it as an investment in your future body. And if you're ready to splash out how will you decide which one to go for? The two hottest brands on the market right now are undoubtedly the Nutribullet and the Vitamix, both designed to pulverise fruit and vegetables and create easy, health-filled drinks (among other things). There's a lot of chat about which is the best buy and while the Vitamix's £400 price tag will rule some of you out straight away, for those of you with the cash to spend I've pitted the two against each other in a Battle Of The Blenders to see what the big deal is. Toni put the blenders through their paces testing five different recipes to see which produced the best result . I use the £100 Selfridges Nutribullet (Nutrition Extraction System to be technical). My husband Dan Kennedy prefers his Total Nutrition Centre aka the Vitamix. I know, such gross DINKYs. Our flat is too small for a dining table but we have two super blenders fighting for space in the kitchen. At least this means we know our stuff when it comes to juicing. Like most people I know, we mostly use blenders to make smoothies and juices. They are generally a fuss-free way to get fruit and vegetables, and therefore lots of health, into your diet. But there are several tricky areas that can be deal breakers when it comes to a smoothie blender. I tested them both against some immense kitchen challenges like: kiwis (ooh), ginger (aah), celery (eeh), carrots (oh no you didn't) and even nuts (I can't even!). Here's how they got on... Juice wars: Results of the Simple Green Juice test for the Nutribullet (left) and the Vitamix (right) TEST ONE: Simple Green Juice . A green smoothie is the best way to get as much goodness as possible from your blender. I used a simple recipe - apple / kiwi / kale / cucumber /almonds / sunflower seeds /chia seeds - leaving all skin/stalks attached and adding seeds as recommended by both brands. RESULT: The Vitamix bust up the nuts, seeds and skin within seconds and delivered a smooth and creamy drink (see picture above). Given the same time the Nutribullet couldn't quite pulverise everything, hence the darker colour and more bits on show, which makes for a more lumpy drinking experiece. After giving it another 10-15 seconds the consistency improved a lot. It still wasn't quite as smooth as the Vitamix version but both were totally delicious and very drinkable. WINNER: The Vitamix, (just) Although both the drinks looked virtually identical the Nutribullet was unable to blend the ingredients to the same extent as the Vitamix . TEST TWO: Ginger & Carrots . These two ingredients are brimming with good stuff and are included in lots of healthy drinks recipes. They are both very fibrous though, creating lumpy, stringy drinks if not dealt with properly. I added one carrot, several nubs of ginger and 100ml water to each blender to see what happened. RESULT: In the glass the 'drinks' look much the same but the Nutribullet wasn't able to liquify the carrot and ginger half as well as the Vitamix, as illustrated in the empty glasses. There was lots of stringy stuff left behind. And nobody wants a mouthful of stringy stuff. Lots more water and further blitzing reduced the amount of stringy stuff, but not completely. WINNER: The Vitamix . What lies beneath: The empty Nutribullet glass, left, features lots of pulp . TEST THREE: Nut Milk . A nice alternative to dairy and soy, nut milks like almond, cashew and hazelnut are a big deal to smoothie fiends. They offer protein, vitamins, good fats and a bit of calcium, plus they are low in calories. You can buy them ready made in most supermarkets now but most of them have added sugar, and it's a lot cheaper to make your own on demand. I added one cup of cashews and one cup of water to each blender and blitzed for 10 seconds. RESULT: A light, frothy milk in seconds from both of them. WINNER: A draw . Both the Nutribullet (left) and the Vitamix (right) produced an equally frothy milk in seconds . TEST FOUR: Kiwis . Eating the skin of these furry little fruits might be a bit of a weird concept, but it actually triples the fruit's fibre content and adds extra Vitamin C to the drink. In a standard blender the skin is pretty hard to squish, but what happened when I added 100ml water and one kiwi to each of these bad boys? RESULT: The fruit didn't even touch the sides in the Vitamix, it was pulverised into a green/brown liquid within 10 seconds. In the Nutribullet, one long blitz delivered a green, slightly furry sludge, but another 15-20 seconds and the result was almost a perfect match for the Vitamix's juice. WINNER? A draw (assuming you have those extra 20 seconds to spare) Toni put the blenders through their paces when it came to breaking down kiwi skin . TEST FIVE: Hummus . Both blenders claim to make dips as well as drinks, and being able to create an instant homemade hummus is a nice party trick. I added tinned chick peas, sesame seeds, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic (peeled) and salt to both. RESULT: The Vitamix was NOT happy to start with, despite me following the recipe straight from the Vitamix site. I've learned that this hungry blender requires a bit more lubrication to get things going, but once I had added a splash more chickpea liquid from the tin it created a smooth, great-tasting dip in seconds. This is where the Vitamix's multi-speed settings came into their own. NB don't run the motor for too long or the dip will become too thin. The Nutribullet created a dip with a nice texture but the ingredients didn't blend thoroughly enough and so it tasted very strongly of raw garlic. NOT great at parties. WINNER? Vitamix . Before and after: No mess hummus in the Vitamix (top) and the Nutribullet (bottom) VERDICT... The overall winner in the five tests was easily the Vitamix, a super blender that takes no prisoners and could probably atomize a car engine if you were so inclined. The different settings mean that it can heat ingredients into a soup, or freeze them into ice cream so it's very versatile and the size of the jug means it's great for families or small businesses. BUT considering there is a £300 price difference, the Nutribullet didn't fair so badly. It's definitely leagues above your average kitchen blender. It's a bit like comparing a Porsche to an Audi - they'll both get you somewhere but the results are going to be a little different. Yes the Nutribullet drinks weren't quite as smooth, but considering the skin, pips, pith and stalks that they contained they were very drinkable, and almost on a par with the Vitamix once they were whizzed for a bit longer. Other pluses include the slimline size, and the to-go aspect (the drinks are blended directly into the cup so you just pop the top on and go once you're done). If you're a serious chef with money to burn the Vitamix is the one for you. But if you don't care about making ice-cream/soup/hummus/the neighbours jealous, and just want to enjoy some healthy smoothies then there's no need to splash the cash, the Nutribullet will be your new best friend.","Toni Jones puts the budget and blow-out blenders to the test .

"He's called Kale Chips. But you wouldn't guess it. While most of his breed is healthy at 22-25 pounds, this seven-year-old Beagle weighs a hefty 85. And when he was surrendered to animal rescue volunteers by his elderly Chicago owner, they needed a wagon to wheel him into the shelter. Scroll down for video . Tipping the scales: Kale Chips weighs 85 pounds - quadruple the healthy weight of average adult Beagles . 'It was a huge shock, he is the most overweight dog we have ever encountered,' Heather Owen, co-founder of One Tail, told DailyMail.com . 'The shelter has a wagon on hand for dogs that can't walk,' she added. 'They used it to wheel him from his kennel to us, so we could take him out of the shelter. He had to be lifted out and helped to the car.' It was a shock - despite the fact that Beagles, according to the National Beagle Club, 'are one of a very few breeds that will literally eat themselves to death.' Julie Wright of the NBC explains that 'most dogs will self-regulate and only eat the amount of food they need to maintain the level of exercise they are getting. 'However, beagles have a tendency to eat all the food they can get and use those soft brown eyes to beg for more and more.' But few have been known to gorge to such extremes. 'His owner relinquished him to the shelter because they were elderly and unable to care for him,' Owen told us. 'We don't know much beyond that, but we think it was a situation in which they were unable to walk him, and as time went on it got worse and worse.' Hoping to tempt fate with a diet-friendly name, the volunteers came up with Kale Chips. Video courtesy: One Tail at a Time . Special measures: His joints are so weak he had to be wheeled into the rescue center on a wagon . He will now be placed on an intensive program to slim down. While exercise will be important, the volunteers will ease him into movement as he is so out of shape and his joints are weak. And on the menu, it won't be much more than kale chips. 'We called him Kale Chips to signify his new healthy life. We wanted to give him a fresh start with a new name. 'I'm sure he would have liked to be just Chips,' Owen said. The dog will remain at One Tail at a Time until he is adopted. 'We are currently waiting for blood test results to see if he has any underlying medical issues. 'If he does, we'll take care of those first. If not, we teamed up with The Honest Kitchen who will be providing him with high quality, high protein, low calorie dog food. 'We are also working with Integrative Pet Care and will be starting him on a slow weight loss program which will include hydrotherapy (underwater treadmill). It's going to be a slow, steady process.'","Kale Chips was surrendered to animal services by his elderly owner .

"This is the moment a distraught Montana police officer broke down in tears after shooting an unarmed suspect dead during a traffic stop. Billings Police Officer Grant Morrison killed 38-year-old Richard Ramirez in April when authorities said Ramirez — a suspect in a recent drug-involved shooting — appeared to reach for something as he sat in his car. The suspect, a meth addict, repeatedly to raise his hands before the officer shot him three times, according to video footage shown Tuesday during an inquest into the shooting. After Morrison shot Ramirez, he was captured on video walking away with his hand covering his eyes with another officer's arm rested on his shoulder. Scroll down for video . This is the moment distraught Officer Grant Morrison broke down in tears and is comforted by a fellow officer after shooting dead Richard Ramirez during a traffic stop in Montana . Police video footage of the April 2014 shooting of Richard Ramirez by Billings Police Officer Grant Morrison, (screen) is shown to a seven-person jury in Billings, Montana. An emotional Morrison can be seen sitting between two of his colleagues in the aftermath . Richard Ramirez had been wanted in an armed robbery and ignored the officer's orders, making a sudden movement during a traffic stop . In the previously unreleased video from a patrol car dash-cam, Morrison could be heard yelling 'Hands up!' at least six times before firing three shots into the vehicle in rapid succession. The actions of Ramirez could not be seen in the footage. The two-day inquest will determine if Morrison was justified in the killing. It comes amid heightened scrutiny of law enforcement and recent nationwide protests in response to police killings of unarmed suspects including in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. Detective Brett Kruger, who investigated the shooting in Billings, testified that two cellophane bags with a small amount of methamphetamine and a syringe were later found near where Ramirez had been sitting in the backseat of the vehicle. Kruger said Ramirez had two outstanding warrants and was trying to get the drugs out of his pocket to avoid arrest. Two of the three people in the car with Ramirez testified that Morrison's commands for them to raise their hands were clear. Both said they were in the front seat and couldn't see if Ramirez complied. The person sitting next to Ramirez, Tom Black, told The Associated Press in the days after the shooting that Ramirez was trying to unbuckle his seatbelt when he was shot. Police dash cam footage shows as Officer Morrison makes his approach (left) and gets ready to fire (right) In 2013, Morrison shot and killed another man during a traffic stop after the man reached for something that was later determined to be a BB gun. An inquest cleared Morrison of wrongdoing in that case. A seven-person jury will decide if Morrison acted appropriately in the killing of Ramirez and advise prosecutors on whether charges should be pursued. Montana law requires an inquest whenever someone is killed by law enforcement or dies in custody. Morrison was expected to testify when the inquest resumes Wednesday. Before Ramirez was shot, Morrison recognized him as the suspect in a shooting the night before where authorities had recovered 90 grams of methamphetamine, Senior Deputy Yellowstone County Attorney Ed Zink said. 'His hand goes up and down two or three times in his pocket while officer Morrison was screaming at him,' Zink said about Ramirez. Ramirez's sister Julie (left) consoles her mother, Betty Ramirez, during court proceedings over the cop shoot . About a dozen Ramirez family members and supporters attended the inquest. Most wore T-shirts with an image of him. Sister Julie Ramirez said outside the inquest that the family wants Morrison charged with murder. She noted that her family is half-Mexican and accused the police of racial profiling in the case. 'He could have tased my brother or called for backup,' Julie Ramirez said. 'When Officer Morrison got out of that patrol car he knew he was going to kill my brother.' Two of Morrison's co-workers, Sgt. Matthew Brewer and Officer Mark Snider, testified that on the night before his death, Ramirez was identified as the suspect in a shooting across town. Morrison was aware of that information and had been searching for Ramirez with other officers, testimony showed. Brewer and Snider said Ramirez was known to them as a methamphetamine user, which Snider said can make suspects violent and uncontrollable. Members of the Ramirez family have acknowledged his drug use and previous arrests linked to drugs. However, they say that criminal history was wrongly used to rationalize his death. Ramirez was the fifth man to be fatally shot during a two-year period by law enforcement in Billings, Montana's most populous city. Last week, the wife of one of those people, Daniel Brawley, filed a civil rights lawsuit in Montana District Court against the City of Billings and Officer David Punt, seeking damages for alleged excessive use of force. Brawley was shot by Punt after being arrested in a burglary and trying to escape in Punt's patrol car, striking the officer. An inquest into Brawley's death determined Punt's actions were justified. The city has not formally responded to the lawsuit, but Billings Police spokesman Lt. R.D. Harper said Tuesday the inquest confirmed Punt did not use excessive force.

"This is the Muslim man who has been hailed a hero after he hid shoppers in the freezer of the Jewish grocery store after an Islamic gunman raided the deli where he worked. Lassana Bathily, 24, originally from Mali in west Africa, guided terrified customers to safety in a supermarket chiller at the Hyper Cacher supermarket in Porte de Vincennes, Paris, yesterday. He has since been praised for his quick-thinking and bravery after 15 hostages, which reportedly included two children, escaped the ordeal, in which gunman Amedy Coulibaly was killed as he attempted to flee. Lassana Bathily, the Muslim shop assistant that led hostages to safety, has been hailed a hero since siege . Four of the hostages were killed before police stormed the building and ended the terror. Mr Bathily, who reportedly led six people to safety, told BFMTV: 'When they ran down, I opened the door [of the freezer]. 'There are several people who came to me. I turned off the light, I turned off the freezer. When I turned off the cold, I put them [hostages] in, I closed the door, I told them to stay calm.' Using a goods lift he escaped and was able to give the police valuable information about what was happening inside and where the hostages were hiding. Shy and reluctant to tell his story, Mr Bathily, who went to school in Paris, admitted that after the shoot-out many of the customers came to shake his hand and thank him for what he did. Today his picture – labelled Malian Muslim – has been tweeted around the world as a symbol of the good of people united against terrorism, and there have been calls for him to be awarded the French Medal of Honour for his bravery. The 24-year-old originally from Mali in west Africa, guided terrified customers to safety in a supermarket chiller at the Hyper Cacher supermarket in Porte de Vincennes . The scene was one of terror yesterday as 19 people were held hostage, including women and children . One of the shoppers, father-of-four Johan Dorre, 36, was able to call a relative on his phone to tell him they were trapped two floors below the ground floor, where they were being held at gunpoint. As the siege unfolded his uncle offered words of comfort as he waited behind police barriers with hundreds of anxious residents of the quarter who had been evacuated from their homes. 'Johan and the others were terrified that they would be discovered by the terrorists and were forced to huddle together like frightened animals to avoid hypothermia', another uncle Jacob Katorza told the Daily Mail, just minutes after hearing that his nephew had been freed unharmed. 'He was shopping for the kosher cakes and meat delicacies which we Jewish people enjoy on the holy day when he heard shots being fired above on the ground floor and immediately took cover with other shoppers in the basement. 'Johan was to speak to my brother Haim by phone for only two or three minutes and told him to stay quiet and wait until help arrived. 'Then we just stood at the barriers for five hours and waited for news. It was terrible- the longest five hours of my life. Shoppers cowered in a freezer at the Kosher supermarket in Paris after hearing gunfire. Pictured, security officers escort released hostages after storming the market . 'We know these people are monsters and would not hesitate to kill Jewish people. They targeted the supermarket because it was run by Jews. 'Thankfully none of his young children were with him when this happened'. Beside, at the police barrier, stood an elderly relative whose son had also been cowering in the storage room fearful for his life. He too wept with relief as friends told him his son was safe. 'In the past year 7,000 Jews have already left France and after this there will be many thousands more. We are not safe in France any more. There is no future for Jews here in France . We are finished in France.' Albert Guigui, the Chief Rabbi of Brussels and a close relative of hostages Sarah Bitton and her son who were led to safety, said Mr Bathily had saved their lives. 'They were saved thanks to the Muslim employee of the supermarket,' he told the Sunday Times. 'He pushed them towards the back of the shop and down to the cellar. It's thanks to him that they were saved.' Several people have now called for the hero shop assistant, Mr Bathily, to be recognised for his actions as details of the episode emerged. One tweet from @worldwithjan read: 'A true hero of the hostage crisis in the kosher grocery store yesterday.' Police are continuing to search for Coulibaly's partner and conspirator Hayat Boumeddiene. A security officer directs released hostages after they stormed the kosher shop.

"Child protection services have scrambled to overhaul their policies after it emerged they were alerted to a man's delusional behavior hours before he allegedly threw his five-year-old daughter off a bridge to her death. It was one of two red flags waved at government agencies on Wednesday that went ignored. An anonymous caller told Florida's Department of Children and Families on Wednesday afternoon they had seen John Jonchuk Jr, 25, driving around in his pajamas looking 'delusional and depressed'. But the call 'did not rise to the level of reasonable cause to suspect' according to the DCF's policies and the report was not investigated. Earlier that day, Jonchuk's attorney had called police warning that he was 'acting strangely' during a custody meeting, calling her 'God' and asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. Scroll down for video . In custody: John Jonchuk Jr, 25, (left) has been charged with murder after his five-year-old daughter Phoebe (right) was thrown to her death off a 60ft bridge in Tampa Bay . Devastated: Jonchuck's mother and the girl's grandmother Michelle Lynn Jonchuck, has said she never wants to see her son again and claims she wishes it was him who had died on the bridge . Angelic: Tributes have been paid to Phoebe and a memorial set up for her near the bridge where she fell . Officers went to interview Jonchuk outside daughter Phoebe's day care but they found nothing suspicious. Hours later, Jonchuk was allegedly seen driving at 100mph to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and throwing five-year-old Phoebe to her death. She was pulled from the water 40 minutes later but paramedics could not resuscitate the child. The DCF has announced that all warning calls will now be investigated within four hours, and a notice will be issued to law enforcement, Click Orlando reported. DCF Secretary Mike Carroll said: 'The horrible nature of this little girl’s murder at the hands of her father is heart wrenching and demands our most immediate and thorough response.' His statement added: 'We have to do more for the children, like Phoebe, who depend on us to protect them.' On Friday, relatives and friends remained gathered around a memorial site for Phoebe. Jonchuk's mother, Phoebe's grandmother, Michelle Lynn Jonchuk has said her son should have killed himself instead. Speaking to Click Orlando, she also paid tribute to the youngster, saying: 'She always had a smile on her face, she loved to dance and she sung. First hearing: Jonchuk said he wanted to leave himself 'in the hands of God' when asked about representation . Troubled relationship: Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, said Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. She added that he had been diagnosed with bipolar . 'My angel': Paying tribute to Phoebe, Miss Kerr said: 'She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated.' 'I don't forgive him. There is no sense in this. He didn't have to do this to her. I just wish there was one thing God could do was to bring her back.' She added that she was supposed to pick Phoebe up from school on Thursday. The last time she saw her son and daughter together, she said everything was normal. Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, told the station that Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. 'She was my angel, I always called her my angel baby. She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated,' she said. 'He would only let me talk to her on the phone. He wouldn't disclose his location, so I didn't know where to go.' 'He was very, very bipolar,' she told Tampa Bay News. 'He was Jekyll and Hyde all the way.' Among other medication, Miss Kerr says Mr Jonchuk took regular doses of bipolar pills Seroquel and anti-depressives Zoloft. When they met, she added, Mr Jonchuk was her 'gay friend', until he told her he 'liked women too'. Soon after, Phoebe was born. Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records. On the last night she saw Phoebe, Miss Kerr said she and Jonchuck had a nice evening together, but later on he called child protective services and made a false abuse allegations. She added that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and had been admitted to a mental hospital on several occasions. 'He does the Jekyll and Hyde. It's just something that goes on in his head, he just wasn't wired right. 'He's not mentally stable, but he was mentally stable enough to take care of a child for five years, so he knew what he did. He cried, the detective said.' It has since emerged Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. With no fixed abode, the father and daughter have been living with John Jonchuk Sr for two months. But at midnight last night Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report. The officer who spotted the Cruiser gave chase and saw the driver reach the top of Dick Misener Bridge then enter the approach to the Skyway. The car was then seen to stop and a figure emerged, throwing a child over the side of the rail into the water off Boca Ciega Bay. The officer said he heard the girl scream as she fell. Issues: Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records . Scene: Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report . Jonchuk returned to the car and drove south but was stopped by Manatee County authorities about 30 minutes later. He was arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder. Jonchuk also faces charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding police. The girl was found 40 minutes later by divers from Eckerd College and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and her mother was informed. At Jonchuk's first hearing on Thursday, Pinellas County Judge Michael Andrews asked him if he wanted an attorney. 'I want to leave it in the hands of God,' Jonchuck said. Arrested: An officer who claims to have witnessed the incident chased Jonchuk and detained him . Behavior: Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish . Tragic: This is the car seat, recovered from Boca Ciega Bay, in which investigators found the dead child . The judge responded: 'I'm pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial.' Details have since emerged of Jonchuk's 'strange' behavior on Wednesday that prompted his attorney Genevieve Torres to contact police. Torres said she met with John Jonchuck on Wednesday to discuss the custody case for his five-year-old daughter, Phoebe. After their meeting, she was so worried about the father and daughter that she reported the odd statements to police. Officers interviewed Jonchuck and his daughter as he was picking her up from a church day care and both appeared to be in good health. Jonchuck said he didn't want to harm himself or anyone else, the documents said. 'She was smiling and appeared healthy, properly clothed and happy,' according to the documents. A little more than twelve hours later, police said Jonchuck threw his daughter over a bridge.","A caller warned child services John Jonchuk was acting 'delusional'

"Currency trader Alex Hope, 25, is facing jail for a £5.5million Ponzi scheme . A currency trader nicknamed ‘King Popper’ after he spent £32,000 spraying himself with champagne is facing jail for a £5.5million Ponzi scam. Alex Hope, 25, boasted that he was a financial wizard as he swindled investors to fund his playboy lifestyle of exclusive nightclubs and gambling. He blew vast sums in exclusive casinos and in nightclubs around the world in a £2million binge. A jury of five men and six women unanimously found Hope guilty of fraud after just three hours and 57 minutes of deliberation. The court heard the former Wembley stadium catering manager reinvented himself as a currency markets expert after teaching himself economics. He eventually landed an office job with City-based training school Forex Academy, then met his ‘mentor’ Raj Von Badlo, 56, while working as an independent trader at Zone Invest. By the end of 2011, investors were pouring cash into the trading scheme and huge sums were appearing in Hope’s bank account. Hope pocketed an ‘eye-watering’ £5.5million in just 13 months, between March 2011 and April 2012 - which he used as a ‘personal piggy bank’ to fund his extravagant lifestyle. He spent £32,000 in one evening at a Champagne Spray event in the five-star Grange Hotel near St Paul’s Cathedral earning him the title ‘King Popper’. Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘This was an event that was organised where people could go to this hotel and buy bottles of champagne and, in effect, spray them over each other. Hope can be seen in a video of the event wearing a drenched blue t-shirt as hundreds of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around a packed room. Scroll down for video . Alex Hope was dubbed 'King Popper' after he sprayed £32,000 worth of champagne in a club in London . Hope can be seen in a video of the event wearing a drenched blue t-shirt as hundreds of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around a packed room . Another night partying at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool was so excessive Hope hit the headlines for his spending. ‘Mr Hope spent £45,987 in one night, and the lion’s share of that went on this bottle, this Midas sized bottle, of Ace of Spades champagne that was opened effectively as a publicity stunt by him,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘The nightclub PR in fact ran up a bill of something like £200,000 and then it was put out in the press that this high-roller spent £200,000 in one night.’ The nightclub lover blew a whopping £65,113 in a single night at the Aura nightclub in Mayfair which boasts Buckingham Palace and the Ritz as its neighbours. Hope hit the headlines for his spending at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool . The court heard part of that night's tab included a bottle of Cristal bought for singer Rihanna. Jurors heard that Hope demanded a table next to Rihanna after she performed at Aura, a members only nightclub in London’s Mayfair that charges a minimum table spend of £800. He then treated the 26-year-old singer to a Jeroboam bottle of Cristal following her set at the exclusive venue on February 26, 2012. Hope also spent £1m to the Palm Beach Casino, whose website brags it is the ‘most exclusive casino in Mayfair’. He lost £353,600 after playing games where more than £5m was passed backwards and forwards over the table at the lavish venue he visited more than 81 times. But £604,400 simply disappeared from the cash deposited with the casino, probably in cash withdrawals, and has not been traced. Ms Clarke said it was ‘quite clear’ that Hope’s money ‘must have belonged to confirmed investors’ in his trading scheme. ‘Were any of the investors told that their money was going to be put into a casino and then withdrawn in cash for it to disappear?’ she asked. Receipts unearthed at Hope’s address showed just a ‘snapshot’ of his wild spending, including a taste for Christian Louboutin trainers and expensive watches. Hope also treated himself to luxury trips around the world, blowing nearly £64,000 on ‘upper class’ travel to Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Dubai. He blew £130,327 on a stay at beach front resort the Fontainebleu in Miami and racked up bills of £38,838 in one night at the Cirque du Soir in Dubai. A video filmed at the five-star Trump SoHo hotel in New York shows Hope pan around the luxurious suite and ends with a shot of his bed, strewn with money and designer clothes. ‘Here is the bedroom,’ he says, ‘just being silly, laying some money out, you can see the 50s and the 100s. ‘Did a little bit of shopping today as you can see, bought some Ralph [Lauren], bought some trainers as well, bought some Burberry... yeah, this is me.’ Videos taken from his mobile show him panning stacks of cash, in one he brags ‘£28,000 profit, boys’ and in a second ‘£50,000 profit, boys, ten, 20, 30, 40’ before cutting out. Ms Clarke added: ‘This gives you a snapshot of the ways in which he was enjoying himself, treating himself with investors’ money during the period of the fraud. ‘His trading really wasn’t keeping pace with what was coming in from investors and what was going out. ‘As the money from investors was increasing and his expenditure was increasing, in fact the amount of money that was being deposited on trading platforms in the first place was drying up to virtually nil.’ Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott, 30, lost £50,000 after investing in the fraudulent scheme. The midfielder, who plays for Crawley Town in Football League One, handed the cash to Hope after he promised 50 percent returns in just three months. Retired teacher Christopher Millard ploughed £25,000 of his own money into Hope’s fraud which saw him lose £15,000. Alex Hope with actress Layla Flaherty at London's 55 Club in 2012 . In one email to Mr Millard, he wrote: ‘I am a man of my word, I have never not paid anyone, let’s get that straight first and foremost.’ Hope and Von Badlo used extensive PR to lure investors into the scam and spent £3,000 a month of client’s cash on publicity provided by London PR firm Full Portion Media. In one ‘spectacularly successful’ promotional push, Hope and Von Badlo held a seminar at the four-star Copthorne Hotel in Slough on 10 March 2012. Glossy folders informed potential investors about the ‘Alex Hope Private Fund’ and the crowd heard Hope needed £5m to start his ‘dream’ hedge fund. He was presented as a financial whizz-kid, capable of making huge profits for his investors at the same time as sustaining trading losses of £500,000 and capital liabilities of more than £3,500,000. A second promotional stunt saw Von Badlo interview Hope outside the Old Trafford football stadium in September 2011 for a video intended to impress potential investors. In it Hope boasts: ‘It is very easy to make quite a lot of money.’ Hope was using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme, in the classic Ponzi fashion. After suspicions around his Forex fund grew, the Financial Services Authority intervened and arrested him. Ms Clarke said Hope told a ‘pack of lies’ and added his trading was ‘spectacularly unsuccessful’. ‘The truth was this was not a successful trading scheme, in fact it wasn’t a trading scheme really at all - it was a fraud,’ said Ms Clarke. He admitted violating City rules which state he must have a licence from to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit. Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denied one charge of fraud. He pleaded guilty to carrying on a regulated activity when not an authorised by the FSA. Von Badlo, of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, admitted making misleading statements and communicating an invitation or inducement to encourage investment activity following the collapse of the first trial. Judge Deborah Taylor told Hope: ‘I am adjourning this case for sentencing until next Friday at this court, in the meantime you are remanded in custody.’ The pair will return to Southwark Crown Court on 16 January to be sentenced.","Alex Hope, 25, boasted he was a financial wizard as he swindled investors .

"An obese couch potato that would only exercise when bribed with ham has shed a quarter of her body weight to be crowned pet slimmer of the year. Daisy the bulldog, from Middlesborough, is the top loser of 2014, beating off stiff competition from other porky pooches, fat cats and even bulging bunnies. The six-year-old dog, nicknamed Lazy Daisy by her owners, weighed  28.3kg, or 4st 6lbs, making her 50 per cent heavier than she should be. Scroll down for video . 'Lazy' Daisy, the couch potato bulldog  weighed 28.3kg, making her 40 per cent overweight (pictured with PDSA nurse) Thanks to the PDSA's Pet Fit Club she lost 27 per cent of her body weight and now weighs 20.3 kg . But thanks to the PDSA's Pet Fit Club she lost 8kg or 1st and 3.5lbs, which is equal to 27 per cent of her body weight. Owner, Gillian Turrell, 60, had tried to help her to slim down, encouraging her to go on a treadmill under her close supervision, plus walks to gradually increase Daisy's exercise levels. But her beloved pet just detested exercise and when out walking had even been known to jump into any available car to catch a ride home when she'd had enough, leading to her nickname. Gillian said: 'Daisy always begged for food, and has even been known to steal things out of the fridge. 'I also got into the habit of spoiling her with treats and titbits. The weight crept up slowly, and I didn't notice how big she'd got. 'When I couldn't get the car harness around her, and she was struggling to get up the stairs, I knew things had to change. I love Daisy to bits, and I want the best for her, so when I heard about PDSA's Pet Fit Club, it was the perfect solution to helping her lose the weight.

'The difference in Daisy is amazing. Losing the weight has really improved her mobility. 'Before she struggled to climb the stairs but now she sprints up them, and she has a waist again. 'I'm so grateful to the vet staff at Middlesbrough PDSA Pet Hospital for their help and guidance, and for how they've helped to transform Daisy's life.' PDSA Senior Vet Elaine Pendlebury said: 'Daisy looks absolutely amazing since shedding the pounds in Pet Fit Club. The weight loss means Daisy will feel much fitter and happier, and her life expectancy may well be improved now than she's shed the excess weight. 'I'd encourage any owner who has concerns about their own pet's weight to discuss it with their vet. Vets and nurses are there to help and can provide lots of guidance on pet feeding and exercise.' The new-look Daisy was one of 11 obese pets selected to embark on the pet slimming regime. Animals were put through a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer. In total, the pets have lost a combined weight of 30kg (4st 7lbs) - the weight of a typical nine-year-old child. And statistics show that more and more pets in the UK are becoming obese. New findings from PDSA's annual Animal Wellbeing (PAW) Report have revealed that 81 per cent of vets have seen an increase in levels of pet obesity over the last two years. And four in five (80 per cent) of vets believe there will be more overweight pets than healthy weight pets in the next five years. The vast majority (89 per cent) of pet owners are aware that pets can suffer from obesity-related health issues such as diabetes, heart disease and arthritis, yet the number of fat pets continues to rise. Nine in ten (88 per cent) of owners acknowledge that overweight pets will have a shortened life span. The winner of the fat fighting contest will be revealed in a new TV show on ITV1 today called Fat Pets: Slimmer of the Year, presented by Angela Griffin and Kian Egan. Gillian has won a pet-friendly holiday as well as a year's free supply of Hill's pet food, to help keep Daisy at her ideal weight. Other top pet slimmers in PDSA Pet Fit Club . Bruce .

"The Charlie Hebdo killers and the fanatic who died in a gun fight in a Paris kosher grocery store are all part of the same terror gang which flourished in the heart of Paris and whose tentacles spread to hate preachers Abu Hamza, Abu Qatada, and top leaders of Al Qaeda in Yemen and ISIS. Both Cherif Kaouchi, one of the brothers behind the massacre of 12 at the Paris satirical magazine and Ahmedi Coulibaly, who held up to ten hostage on Friday in a kosher supermarket, are graduates of the Buttes Chaumont gang – named after the Paris park where they were radicalised more than ten years ago. The revelations that Kaouchi and Coulibaly - both killed on Friday afternoon - were in contact with some of Europe's most notorious fanatics will only raise more questions of the French authorities' failure to stop Wednesday's atrocity at Charlie Hebdo's office and the carnage that has followed. Scroll down for video . Mentor: Djamel Beghal, a key al Qaeda leader of recruited terrorists while worshiping at London's Finsbury Park Mosque, met Cherif Kaouchi and Ahmedi Coulibaly in prison in France . Hatred: Beghal was linked to many known terrorists - including hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza . Notorious: Kouachi was mentored by terrorist Beghal, who has links to London's Finsbury Park mosque . Until this week, the Buttes Chaumont gang was a name which appeared to have drifted into relative obscurity. But in the early 2000s, members of the gang were considered 'pioneers' of the foreign jihadi movement, raising money for terrorist attacks and sending fighters to Iraq. Named after a park in the 19th arrondisement, the members were young and disaffected: Cherif has been described as a 'loser' working as a pizza delivery boy during the period into drugs, girls, petty crime and alcohol. They appear to have first come to the notice of the police during protests against the Iraq war; later, members would be jailed for a range of offences linked to terrorism. And it was while in prison that both Cherif and Coulabily found a new mentor: Djamel Beghal, a key al Qaeda leader of recruited terrorists when he worshipped at London's Finsbury Park Mosque. Former MI5 informant Reda Hassaine described Beghal as a 'constant presence' at Finsbury Park Mosque in the late 1990s. He said he was particularly close to extremist preacher Abu Qatada, but also mixed in the same circles as Abu Hamza. Hamza was jailed for life by a New York court today after being convicted of international terrorist offences. But Benghal's influence was felt on both sides of the Channel, having lived in Leicester for several years after moving his family from France. Beghal is said to have recruited shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, the '20th hijacker' in the attacks of September 11, 2001. He openly admitted  meeting Osama bin Laden as he recruited British jihadists to fight in Afghanistan, and was jailed in 2005 for plotting to bomb the US embassy in Paris. Prison pals: Chérif and Beghal pictured playing football together in 2010, after Cherif was released . Link: Cherif (left) and Coulibaly were both implicated in a plot to free jailed Islamist Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem (right) Terror: Coulibaly was killed after French special forces raided a kosher deli where he was holding hostages . MI5 informant Reda Hassaine told the Telegraph: 'There is no doubt that you can see the influence of their teachings in him. 'Their warped view of the world has filtered down through him to a new generation. 'What happened in Paris was the legacy of Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza. 'A completely new generation, who have never met these people in London, have learned their ideology indirectly and are now willing to die in jihad.' The two young men maintained contact with Benghal after being released from jail: Cherif was secretly photographed by French intelligence officers meeting Beghal while he was under house arrest in Murat in central France in April 2010. According to French police reports, Coulibaly also made secret visits to Beghal's home after his release from prison. Cherif, who was jailed twice for terrorism-related offences, in 2005 and 2008, was photographed playing football and exercising with Beghal in prison by surveillance teams. But it was a plot to free another jailed Islamist Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem which first clearly linked Coulibaly and Cherif. Both men were killed this afternoon after police stormed the supermarket and office where they had been holding hostages . Claimed links: Beghal allegedly recruited the shoe bomber Richard Reid (left) and Zacarias Moussaoui (right), the ‘20th hijacker’ in the 9/11 attacks, at the London mosque . Belkacem was a leading members of the Algerian terrorist group GIA, or Armed Islamic Army, and was behind the attack on a suburban station which left 30 people injured. Both men would be named suspects in the 2010 plan, while it would Beghal who would later be named as the person behind the failed scheme. However, it would be another member of Buttes Chaumont who gave the brothers the strongest link to what is now the world's most notorious terror network, Isis. Boubaker al-Hakim was a member of Buttes Chaumont, and was jailed alongside Cherif in 2008. Like Cherif, he lived in the 19th arrondisement, and became radicalised as a teenager. Hakim, who is of Tunisian origin, was to become a key figure in recruiting young French Muslims to fight in Iraq, and both he and Cherif  rejoined the al Qaeda network in Iraq on their release from prison. Boubaker al-Hakim (right) was a member of Buttes Chaumont, and is now a commander with Isis . Yet while Cherif seems to have kept a relatively low profile in the past few years, Hakim has risen to prominence as a fighter with Isis. He claimed responsibility for the 2013 murder of two Tunisian Left-wing opposition politicians, claiming responsibility for it in a video released by Isis last month. 'We will return and kill several of you,' he warned. 'You won't live in peace until Tunisia applies Islamic law.' Jean-Pierre Filiu, an expert at Sciences-Po University in Paris, told the Telegraph this link would have been crucial. 'It is impossible an operation the scale of the one that led to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was not sponsored by Daesh [Islamic name for Isis],' he said. However, a witness quoted by Paris newspaper 20 Minutes as saying one of the assailants cried out before getting into his car: 'Tell the media that it is al Qaeda in Yemen!' This too is eminently possible, although this time is is Said who is believed to have strong links to the group, known as AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula). Radical: Beghal attended the prayer meetings held by hate cleric Abu Qatada (pictured) in London . Said is said to have met leading the US-born al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki during a trip to the middle eastern country in 2011. The Yemeni source said Said, 34, was among a number of foreigners who entered the country for religious studies. 'We do not have confirmed information that he was trained by al Qaeda but what was confirmed was that he has met with Awlaki in Shabwa,' the source said, noting that he could have been trained in one of the large parts of Yemen not under the control of the authorities back in 2011. AQAP emerged as one of al Qaeda's most aggressive international affiliates and a direct threat to the United States, when it claimed responsibility for an attempt by a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, to down a Detroit-bound airliner on December 25, 2009 with a bomb concealed in his shoe. It said it was also behind a foiled plot to send two air freight packages containing bombs to the United States in October 2011. However, Awlaki- who was seen as an influential international recruiter to the al Qaeda movement - had been killed the month before in a drone strike widely attributed to the CIA. The mass murder at Cherif Kouachi's hands appears to have taken the French security services by surprise. There are suspicions he may have been written off as a 'failed jihadist' after reverting the low-level crimes and chaotic lifestyle of his youth. Experts suspect a French-Tunisian jihadist now fighting for ISIS could link Cherif Kouachi and Islamic State militants occupying swathes of Iraq and Syria. Boubaker al-Hakim claimed responsibility last month for assassinating two politicians, Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi, in Tunisia in 2013. Al-Hakim was previously part of the Butte Chaumont network alongside Kouachi and experts believe Islamic State must have played some role behind the sophisticated attack. Jean-Pierre Filiu, of Paris's Sciences Po university, said it is 'certain' that Islamic State is following events closely and may well be preparing a video claiming responsibility. Suspicions that Islamic State were aware of the attack were heightened by a mysterious tweet by a jihadist 24 hours beforehand. Reading simply: 'snail eating people' it was followed by a second message 'you heard it here first #snaileaters ate lead' posted within hours of the shooting. In a further development, a senior intelligence source revealed Said Kouachi met Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki during a trip to Yemen. The official said the terrorist suspect travelled to the country for 'several months' in 2011 with several other foreign fighters. Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike in September of that year, is one of the most influential Islamist figures of modern times. His huge catalogue of videos and audio sermons remain a grim inspiration for Islamists in all corners of the world. The Yemeni source said: 'We do not have confirmed information that he was trained by al Qaeda but what was confirmed was that he has met with Awlaki in Shabwa.' The southern province of Shabwa is a lawless area where Al Qaeda militants and the security forces have clashed in recent years.","Two of the terrorists who brought carnage to Paris were mentored by Djamel Beghal, a key al Qaeda leader, in prison .

"Prince Andrew and his ex-wife have secretly splashed out on a Swiss ski chalet thought to be worth up to £13million. The Duke and Duchess of York bought the seven-bedroom property in upmarket Verbier shortly before Christmas as a ‘family investment’, with the deeds listing them simply as Andrew York and Sarah Ferguson. It is the same property that the divorced couple were staying in last week when claims that the prince had sex with an under-age girl were made in documents lodged at a US court. Sources in Switzerland say the chalet is worth between £10million and £13million, although it is not clear how much the couple paid. Scroll down for video . Lap of luxury: The seven-bedroom chalet in the exclusive Swiss alpine resort of Verbier . A source close to the duchess told the Mail that she and Andrew took out a joint mortgage on the property and did not buy it outright. It is not known what proportion of the purchase was funded by the mortgage. The development shows how close the pair still are even though they separated in 1992 after six years of marriage and divorced four years later. But it also raises questions as to how they can afford the chalet, which has up to six permanent staff including a chef. Andrew is not known to have a vast private fortune, while Sarah only recently managed to clear £5million in debts she ran up through a series of disastrous business investments. However, the couple did sell their former marital home, Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, which had been a wedding present from the Queen. They received £15million for it in 2007 – a price considered to be well above its market value. They may still have some money from that, although Andrew has spent around £7.5million on improvements to Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, where both now live despite their divorce. Prince Andrew with Beatrice and Eugenie, left, and right, Sarah Ferguson in the resort last week . Buckingham Palace declined to comment last night. But a source close to the duchess confirmed she and Andrew have bought the chalet jointly as a nest egg for their children Beatrice and Eugenie. ‘They have bought the chalet as a family investment. Neither of them have their own property and wanted to buy the chalet as an asset to leave to their children,’ the source said. ‘They holiday in Verbier several times each year as all the family are keen skiers and it makes sense to have their own place there.’ The chalet, which the Mail is not naming for security reasons, is in one of the most expensive areas of Switzerland’s premier resort. It has a master bedroom draped in furs, a living room filled with antiques, sauna, boot room, indoor pool and terrace with stunning views. Neighbours include Sir Richard Branson and singer James Blunt. In 2013, Andrew rented the £22,000-a-week chalet for his annual family ski holiday to celebrate his 53rd birthday. Prince Harry was there with his then girlfriend Cressida Bonas. One of Eugenie’s best friends, Cressida was also there last week. The chalet was owned by Pamuca, a company based in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. Getting in the swim: The chalet's heated indoor pool has stunning views across the resort in the Swiss Alps . The sale took several months to conclude, say sources, as deals involving foreign buyers are more complicated. The purchase was completed on November 11 but was not legally approved by the Swiss government until December 19. The chalet has been split in two for the purposes of the sale as, according to local regulations, it was too big for a sole foreign purchaser to buy outright. Legally, Andrew has the upper floor and attic space, Sarah the lower floor and basement. They share the land. The chalet is managed for them by a company in Verbier, Swiss Tax Services SA. Local land registry officials confirmed to the Mail that the chalet had been sold to the couple. News of the purchase comes as Andrew faces lurid allegations arising from his friendship with US tycoon Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile. In court papers, the prince was accused of having sex with a teenager. Virginia Roberts claims she was ‘forced’ by Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 – a minor under US law – and was kept as a ‘sex slave’ by the billionaire, who was jailed in 2008 for soliciting sex with minors. Andrew, 54, fiercely denies ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts and says the claims are false. Buckingham Palace says ‘any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue’. The scandal over Andrew’s friendship with Epstein and his continuing globetrotting have led senior politicians to call for more transparency over his public role and how it is funded. The prince was forced to quit as an international trade envoy in 2011 after repeated criticism about the post’s cost and worth to the nation, but last year he still undertook 90 foreign engagements in places as diverse as China, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, India and the UAE. Some of his travel was funded by taxpayers but the cost of many trips was met privately, according to the Palace, which has led to concern about who is bankrolling the prince. Home is where the hearth is: The living room with the log fire to thaw out skiers . Under new fiscal regulations, the Queen now meets the cost of his private office out of her personal fortune, but it unlikely she would pay for the private jets Andrew regularly uses. Former Home Office minister Norman Baker told the Mail: ‘It’s important that people who undertake duties on behalf of the country are transparent in terms of public money allocated for their activities and also for any potential conflict of interest that may exist. MPs and members of the House of Lords are rightly expected to be open and transparent on these matters and have registers of interest accordingly. ‘Members of the Royal Family also represent the country and in my view should be subject to the same regime.’ Labour MP Austin Mitchell, a member of the Public Accounts Committee, said the prince’s private business dealings were a ‘legitimate area of public concern’. He said: ‘Clearly he should declare not only the costs and details of taxpayer-funded travel, for whatever purpose, but also any business relationship he develops in the course of that travel.’ Sources close to the prince expressed their frustration yesterday at the way in which his role has been portrayed. One royal insider said: ‘Since 2011 the duke and his team have worked hard to carve out a new and clear agenda for him – based around education, technology and start-ups.’ Last year Andrew visited more than 30 technical colleges and educational projects around Britain and hosted several events to link entrepreneurs with potential investors. They made £15m from South York... The Duke of York stood accused of cashing in on his royal links in 2007 after he sold his former marital home, Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, to a controversial businessman from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan for £15million in 2007. Energy tycoon Timur Kulibayev paid £3million over the asking price – even though the house, dubbed South York, had languished on the market for more than five years. Sunninghill Park, dubbed South York, had languished on the market for more than five years . More puzzlingly, the property has since been left empty. Andrew, who has always denied any impropriety, is a close friend of Kulibayev’s father-in-law, Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been mired in accusations of corruption. The prince has met Nazarbayev through his former role as a global trade ambassador, but has also visited Kazakhstan privately and even joined the president on goose hunting expeditions. One of Andrew’s closest friends, Kazakh businesswoman Goga Ashkenazi, had a baby by married Kulibayev, and has even previously suggested she was instrumental in helping to seal the deal for Sunninghill. There have also been suggestions that Andrew may have benefited from a complicated legal arrangement to ensure he was not forced to pay 40 per cent capital gains tax on the sale of what had been a wedding gift. Inquiries subsequently found that the 125-year lease was in the Queen’s name. And his other home costs just £250 a week . The Yorks’ main family home is Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, a 30-room mansion once owned by the Queen Mother. Andrew shares the house with Sarah and Eugenie. Beatrice still has a suite there but has her own apartment at St James’s Palace. Sarah recently started renting a flat in Belgravia but still lives at Royal Lodge. It has emerged that the prince effectively pays just over £250 a week for the residence, having snapped up a 75-year lease on the Grade II listed house in 2003 for £1million. An additional payment of £2.5million was waived because the prince had spent more than £7.5million on renovations, which include installing an indoor pool and golf driving range. If he terminates the lease early he is entitled to claim back up to £7million. Royal Lodge: The Yorks’ main family home in Windsor Great Park cost £7.5million to renovate .

"A woman whose father raped her because he 'couldn't afford a prostitute' has finally spoken out about her ordeal to encourage other victims to prosecute their abusers. Sylvia Prescott, from Sunderland, was tormented by her parent Oliver Garside while she was a teenager but kept the abuse secret for nearly 30 years. The 47-year-old couldn't bring herself to go to the police while her grandmother was still alive for fear that the details of the case would upset her. Brave: Sylvia Prescott has spoken out about her ordeal at the hands of her father in the hope it will give other victims the courage to prosecute their abusers . But when she died in 2012, Sylvia knew it was time to stand up to her bullying father, 68. He was jailed for eight years in May last year and Sylvia feels like a weight has been lifted. Now married with three sons aged 30, 29 and 25, she wishes she had gone to the police sooner. She hopes her story will help other women to find the strength to prosecute their abusers, even if they are family members. Sylvia said: 'I was terrified that I wouldn't be believed. The abuse happened such a long time ago and it took all the strength I had to go to the police, but in the end I'm so glad I did. 'The prosecution were able to build a strong case against my dad and he pleaded guilty to the abuse meaning I didn't have to go through the trauma of a trial. Decades of misery: Sylvia Prescott was raped by her father Oliver Garside, right, while she was a teenager but kept the abuse secret for nearly 30 years. He has now been jailed . 'It was during the sentencing that the judge said my dad's excuse for the abuse was that he couldn't afford a prostitute. I was sicked. 'What kind of defence was that? However, I finally feel free to live my life without him hovering over me and I should have done it sooner. 'I am so thankful for the support of my children and my husband, I don't know where I would be without them.' Sylvia's nightmare began with non-sexual violence. Garside would drag the teenager around the house by her hair, demanding she clean floors and do dishes. She said: 'I was afraid of my father. He and my mum split when I was one and I lived with my grandmother until I was 11, then all of a sudden he wanted me to come and live with him. 'The first time he abused me I knew I had to go along with it, but I never imagined how much worse it would get.' Sylvia's husband Paul, 52, had no idea about the abuse and didn't find out until Sylvia decided to go to the police. She said: 'I didn't want anyone to know, it ate me up and I was very very depressed, I even tried to kill myself, I had to have my stomach pumped because I took an overdose two years ago. 'Everything was getting too much but I didn't feel comfortable telling anyone while my gran was still alive, it would have killed her to know what went on.' Moving on: The 47-year-old feels like a weight has been lifted now her father has been brought to justice . Sylvia kept her ordeal to herself for almost three decades, but her father was convicted of the historic abuse after pleading guilty to two charges of rape and one of indecent assault last year. At Newcastle Crown Court the judge told him: 'You told the author of the pre-sentence report you would rather have paid a prostitute but you did not have the money to do so. Your behaviour has cast a shadow over her life to date. 'Even today she has to live with what happened so long ago.' Sylvia said: 'I'm so relieved that he's in jail now and I can breathe again.'","Sylvia Prescott, of Sunderland, was tormented by her father Oliver Garside .

"Romanian police have issued a warning over reckless motorists using autopilot systems to let cars drive on their own following a new, worrying trend. The warning came after a shocking video showing a 'driver' sitting in the backseat of his car while driving at 40mph as his terrified girlfriend screams from the passenger seat. The Mercedes S Class in the footage is fitted with dozens of sensors which read the road ahead to adjust the steering, speed and brakes. Scroll down for video . A Mercedes driver sits in the back of his seat as his car continues at 40mph along a road in Romania, causing his girlfriend (right) to scream in terror . The autopilot system controls the brakes, steering and speed and only works when the driver has a hand on the wheel - but it can be easily fooled by a bottle of fizzy drink, it seems . The system only works while the driver's hand is on the wheel, but it appears the sensor is easily fooled when any other object, such as a bottle, is hung there instead. Speaking in Romanian, the man is heard telling his girlfriend not to worry, and boasting that the car can drive itself. A fizzy drink bottle can be seen tied to the steering wheel as the car travels along the road at 40mph. The woman can be heard yelling at her boyfriend to stop the car but he tells her it is ok, adding: 'The option works. Stop yelling, stop yelling. The car drives itself, trust me.' The young woman replies :'No, don't leave it, are you nuts?' He then says: 'We won't die, it works. I trust my car'. Romanian police issued a warning over the autopilot after a number of videos of drivers using the system dangerously appeared online . Police believe the incident was filmed on The Sun Highway, a stretch of motorway between Bucharest and the Black Sea city of Constanta. The people involved are yet to be identified and police are still investigating, but the footage is from just one of a number of similar videos in which people post about fooling the autopilot system. Comments on the video were mixed, with one person saying: 'Real funny until somebody gets killed. Douchebag.' However another viewer wrote: 'The car's electronic [system] does everything for you and you can relax by pushing the driver's seat backwards, into a comfortable couch position. The car brakes, speeds up, holds distance - all on it's own. Above 60 km/h (40mph) you have to take over the command again.' The ‘Intelligent Drive’ package on the 2014 S-class sedan has integrated sensors, controls and 36 separate technologies. While the technology is cutting edge, it isn't yet good enough to provide completely autonomous driving, despite attempts to hack the system. The system’s most notable feature, which has been in development for 15 years, is something called ‘traffic-jam’ assist. This allows the car to steer, brake and accelerate itself at speeds lower than 37 mph (60 km/h). A ‘Magic Body Control suspension system’ uses two cameras in the windshield to spot imperfections in the road, such as bumps, potholes. The suspension is then changed before the wheels hit bumpy surface. ‘Distronic Plus cruise control’, meanwhile, is a radar-based feature which maintains a safe distance from the vehicle in front by braking when necessary and accelerating again when possible. A feature called ‘Pre-Safe braking’ works up to 31 mph (50 km/h) whether or not the driver steps on the brake. According to Mercedes, it can 'partially mitigate' accidents up to 45 mph (72 km/h). The features are made possible using 12 ultrasonic and six radar sensors, alongside eight cameras that monitor every angle around the car. A control unit collects data from the sensors and the camera and then uses algorithms to provide commands to the car – all in just a 10th of a second. The car also has technology to help prevent collisions by recognising pedestrians, as well as keeping in the lane and distance control with the car ahead. More common features include parking assistance and rear-crash monitoring. There is also an updated attention-assist feature that checks to see when the driver is tired. It is linked to the car's navigation system, can even tell the driver where coffee and fuel can be found. Radar position in the back of the car can detect whether a vehicle is approaching too fast. If this happens, rear signal lights are flashed to catch the attention of the approaching car. If the driver doesn't react, the car automatically closes all its windows and adjusts seats upright. However, the most controversial feature is a sensor to make sure the driver keeps his hands on the wheel. It appears that the sensor is easily fooled when any other object such as a bottle of drink is hung there instead.","Reckless driver seen using autopilot to drive Mercedes from the back seat .

"The family of a pedestrian who was mowed down and killed by a 91-year-old has questioned why the elderly man was allowed behind the wheel. Brenda Forster, 89, was hit by Thomas Craig's car at a pedestrian crossing after he failed to notice a red light. The retired taxi driver was handed a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving in the accident in June last year. The family of a pedestrian who was mowed down and killed by a 91-year-old has questioned why the elderly man was allowed behind the wheel . Miss Forster's daughter said in a statement read out at North Tyneside magistrates' court: 'I feel angry that someone of 91 was still driving, but feel I can't criticise too much because my mum was still driving at 89, albeit against my wishes.' She added: 'I do feel very sorry for the driver and think about how he must be feeling. I would not want him to suffer – I just want his licence taken away from him so he can't drive again.' Motorists over the age of 70 must reapply for a licence every three years, but there is no medical examination required. Instead, applicants are asked to declare medical conditions and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency may request more information. The court heard Craig does not intend to apply for a licence again. The DVLA claims there is no evidence older motorists cause more accidents. Brenda Forster, 89, was hit by Thomas Craig's car at a pedestrian crossing after he failed to notice a red light . But the case follows a warning last month from Judge Stephen Holt who told elderly drivers to 'face up to facts' if they are no longer safe on the roads. He was sentencing a woman of 84 who killed an 80-year-old man in a head-on crash. Helen Harrison, prosecuting, said Ms Forster had been on her way to some local shops at the time. She said: 'The collision occurred at a pedestrian crossing, fitted with pedestrian-operated traffic signals. There is also zig-zag markings on the approaches from both sides. 'The deceased spoke to her daughter on the phone from her home address at 10am. 'Her daughter said it was a normal conversation and there were no issues or concerns but it was not known what her intentions were for later in the day. 'Just prior to the collision, Ms Forster parked her car on Armstrong Drive, outside the local shops. 'She walked the short distance to a nearby pedestrian crossing where she pressed the button for the traffic lights. 'She paused at the curb edge before attempting to cross the road in a normal or safe manner.'","Thomas Craig, 91, drove through a red light and knocked over elderly lady .

"This is the moment a snubbed girlfriend whose boyfriend ignored her during a stadium 'kiss-cam' appeared to get her own back by ditching him - and kissing the stranger next to her instead. But the playful couple are thought to be playing a prank on the cameraman and the hilarious moment was all in jest. The mystery couple were picked out by the cameraman who scanned Madison Square Garden during the New York Knicks' game against the Houston Rockets on Thursday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The woman is seen kissing the stranger next to her as her boyfriend (far left) looks on in anger . Usually couples snuggle up for a quick smooch which is shown on a huge screen, but the dark-haired man appeared to refuse to look up from his mobile phone. His pretty girlfriend, along with other sports fans, tried to grab his attention, but when he failed to look up she turned to the Knicks fan sat on her other side. The good-looking pair enjoy a passionate clinch which eventually attracted the attention of her furious boyfriend, and was met by cheers and laughter from the New York crowd. Fans said the apparently inattentive man spent the rest of the game in the huff, while crowd members congratulated the quick-thinking kisser nearby. The couple at the match have not been identified but the kiss was watched by thousands, including British tourist Hugo Davies, 19, who filmed it. Student Hugo, who was visiting family in New York, said: 'I definitely wasn't expecting it. The woman appeared upset when her boyfriend kept on texting during the kiss-cam, but it appears to be a stunt . 'I was filming because this was my first basketball match and it was a normal kiss cam until this happened. 'At first people were shouting and laughing because he was ignoring her but when she kissed the other guy everyone went crazy cheering and laughing. 'When it did happen I couldn't stop laughing at the time, like she totally embarrassed the guy. 'I think he was on his phone and wanted to finish sending his text or something so she kissed the other guy instead. 'Everyone was talking about it when they left the building, some people even went and high-fived the guy she kissed. 'I think the event happened at the end of the 3rd quarter. 'I don't think it was staged because the guy looked genuinely angry and embarrassed after, he was blushing dark red for the rest of the game and didn't talk to her afterwards', he added. However it appears that the couple had just put on the dramatic show for the audience. The New York Knicks lost to the Houston Rockets 120-96.

"A transgender women  who allegedly performed illegal cosmetic surgery on women's buttocks will likely remain in jail until her trial - as a judge set her bond at more than $40,000 on Friday. Oneal Ron Morris, 33, is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue, Fix-A-Flat and cement, at homes across Florida. In addition to multiple counts of practicing medicine without a license with serious bodily injury, she is also facing a manslaughter charge after one of her 'patients' died following surgery. The victim, Shatarka Nuby, passed away from acute and chronic respiratory failure reportedly caused by the silicone used in the procedure while serving time in a Tallahassee prison in 2012. Scroll down for video . Hearing: Oneal Ron Morris (pictured, center, in court on Friday) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat, at Florida homes . Imprisoned: The 33-year-old will likely remain in jail until her trial - as a judge set her bond at more than $40,000 during Friday's hearing. Above, Morris, who earned herself the nickname 'toxic tush doctor', is seen in court . Transgender: In addition to multiple counts of practicing medicine without a license with serious bodily injury, Morris (pictured) is also facing a manslaughter charge after one of her 'patients' died following surgery . On Friday morning, Morris appeared in court for her bond hearing, donning prison overalls and with her previously long hair cut short. She appealed for a low bond, claiming she was not a flight risk. However, Broward Circuit Judge Michael Rothschild refused her request and instead, set her bond at $40,000, an amount Morris had indicated she would not be able to pay, CBS Miami reported. This means she will likely remain in Broward Main Jail until her trial, for which an exact date is yet to be finalized. She could face up to 100 years in prison if she is convicted of manslaughter. It comes more than a year after Morris, known as 'The Duchess', finished serving a prison stint for a previous conviction in Miami-Dade for one count of practicing health care without a licence. She was sentenced to 336 days after pleading guilty to the charge as part of a plea deal. She began serving time on January 7, 2014, with the seven charges she is currently facing hanging over her. Mugshot: Morris's  bond means she will likely remain in Broward Main Jail until her trial. She could face up to 100 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter . In November 2014, the convict was extradited to the jail at which she is currently being held. Morris, who was born a man but identifies as a woman, was first arrested by police on November 18, 2011, after a 'patient' came forward claiming she had entered a toxic concoction into her backside. She was freed but later rearrested after a second person told police they had been illegally treated by Morris and her associate, Corey Eubank, Miami Gardens Police said. Eubank, who pleaded guilty culpable negligence for his role in the surgery, was handed one year's probation at the time. The accusations against Morris escalated following Nuby's death, with an assistant medical examiner determining that she died of 'massive systemic silicone migration' as a result of cosmetic injections. Shockingly, the injections, allegedly given to the victim by Morris - who earned herself the nickname ‘toxic tush doctor’ - in South Florida in 2007, were reportedly sealed with cotton balls and super glue. They were among around 10 illegal treatments - costing $2,000 - that Nuby underwent between 2007 and 2011 to enhance her buttocks, hips, thighs and breasts, it is claimed. During a police investigation into Morris's alleged illegal surgeries, more than 30 people from across the US reportedly came forward with claims they were scammed by the bogus doctor. Shaquanda Brown, of North Miami, told the Miami Herald she had to be hospitalized for more than a month after receiving the injections. Even after her release, she continued to suffer from sickness. She said she recalled seeing a tube of super glue, a black hose and a syringe but she said Morris instructed her not to look so she continued to lay face down. She also said she remembered seeing Morris squeezing super glue onto gauze and placing the tape on the site of each injection, but the procedure quickly stopped because it was so painful. Toxic: Morris, who was first arrested in  2011, after a 'patient' came forward claiming she had entered a toxic concoction into her backside, allegedly used cement (left) and Fix-A-Flat (right) in her illegal surgeries . Angry: In 2005, 'patient' Rajee Narinesingh (pictured) accused Morris of making her 'into a monster' after she received several procedures from the 'doctor', including surgeries for fuller lips, cheeks and chin . According to the Herald, Ms Brown was later admitted to a Tampa hospital, where underwent a series of surgeries to treat multiple abscesses. She also apparently contracted a staph infection. Brown's claims came after another 'patient', Rajee Narinesingh, accused Morris of making her 'into a monster' after she received several procedures from the 'doctor' in 2005. Ms Narinesingh, a transgendered woman, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon, using medical silicone. She said she had heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth through the transgender community, the Sun Sentinel reported. Botched: Ms Narinesingh claims her face (left and right) has been left misshapen by the illegal treatment . After being injected with a cocktail of toxins she allegedly left with lumpen shapes in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and a swollen upper lip. She later paid a real surgeon to repair the botched job. Meanwhile, another woman, Valentina Lopez, from Hallandale Beach, told police that substances injected into her buttocks by Morris during illegal procedures had made her ill. She said the  injections resulted in knots, which required a staggering seven surgeries to fix. Morris's next court appearance is expected to be in July.","Oneal Ron Morris, 33, 'left women ill and disfigured after illegal surgery'

"Jennifer Aniston recently revealed she never appreciated her first love until it was too late, adding that he died of a brain tumor years later. 'He would have been the one,' she says now.'But I was 25 and I was stupid.' And although she didn’t reveal the name of the man she once loved and let slip through her fingers, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively, the man was actor Daniel McDonald. McDonald, who was nine years Jen’s senior, was a successful Broadway musical actor who was nominated for a Tony Award in 1997 for his role in Steel Pier. He also starred in High Society, and Contact. McDonald appeared on TV too, guest - starring in shows such as CSI Miami, Sex in the City and Law and Order. Scroll down for video . The one that got away: Jennifer Aniston (left) dated Broadway actor Daniel McDonald (right) for four years in the early 90s, but the two broke up just before she landed a part on Friends . The couple dated for four years from about 1990 to 1994, when they decided to go their separate ways. ‘Jennifer never stopped loving Daniel, but things were happening very fast with her career by that time – it was just a year before she landed friends. 'She’d moved to Los Angeles, and Daniel stayed on in New York and was doing Broadway. ‘After Dan and Jen split, she went on to date and become engaged to actor Tate Donavan, but I don’t think she ever got over letting Dan slip through her fingers.’ Too soon: Jen was talking about McDonald when she recently described a former boyfriend who was 'the one' but who died an early death due to brain cancer, according to a source close to the actress. Before his death in 2007, McDonald married Italian actress and film maker Mujah Maraini-Melehi. Their family pictured above . Famous family: Jen's former flame was the younger brother of actor Christopher McDonald (pictured). The younger McDonald was a rising star on Broadway, where he was nominated for a Tony award in 1997 for the musical Steel Pier . New man: Jen is currently planning her wedding to boyfriend of three years Justin Theroux. The couple pictured above at the Governors Awards in Los Angeles on November 8, 2014 . Separate ways: In 2000, year after McDonald got married, Jen tied the knot with Brad Pitt. The couple later broke up when Pitt fell in love with Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr and Mrs Smith . McDonald, was the younger brother of actor Chris McDonald. Ironically, Chris’s major breakthrough came when he played Geena Davis’s husband Daryl, in Thelma and Louise – the same movie that gave Jen's ex Brad Pitt his big break. ‘Daniel went on to marry Italian actress and film maker Mujah Maraini-Melehi, in 1999,’ says the source, ‘and they had two adorable children. And the following year, Jennifer walked down the aisle for the first time with Brad Pitt. Friends at the time wondered if Jennifer would still have married Brad had it not been for the fact Daniel married just a few months earlier. 'He was my first love—five years we were together,' Aniston told the New York Times. 'He would have been the one. But I was 25, and I was stupid. He must have sent me Justin to make up for it all.' Pictured above with Friends castmates Matthew Perry (left) and David Schwimmer (right) in 1995, a year after she broke it off with McDonald . ‘Daniel was a lovely guy,’ says the source. ‘He was open, honest and funny, and I know Jennifer really loved him. The timing was just off for them I guess.’ According to the source, Daniel was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2007, and passed away at age 46, in February, 2007. ‘When Jennifer heard the news she was heartbroken,’ says the source. ‘There will always a special place in her heart for him. 'Now she feels as though Daniel may have had something to do with helping her find Justin -  also a New York actor - because she feels her new fiancé reminds her a lot of Dan.’ In the New York Times in which she references McDonald, Jen said : 'He would have been the one.

"Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, told a small group of loyalists on Friday that he's considering another run for the White House. The move will throw the GOP's fast-coalescing race into chaos as it now must make room for both Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, two moderates seen as competing for the same heavyweight donors. 'Everybody in here can go tell your friends that I'm considering a run,' Romney told donors during the get-together in New York City, according to a source who spoke to Politico. A longtime Romney camp insider contacted by DailyMail.com expressed surprise at the news and had no knowledge of the event. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . DIFFERENT FOE AWAITS: Presdient Barack Obama can't run for the White House again, so if Romney were to win the GOP nomination a second time he would face Hillary Clinton or another high-profile Democrat . THIRD TIME'S A CHARM? Romney ran for president in 2008 and 2012 but never succeeded; his wife Ann (left) has said she's done with politics but allowed that Mitt might run if former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush doesn't . The inside-the-beltway newspaper learned that financier Alex Nabab, who participated in a fundraising event for Bush, attended the Romney gathering of about 30 influential money-men and women. The Washington Post reported Friday that Romney met Wednesday in California with a select group of aides from his 2012 campaign, including counselors Ben Ginsberg and Katie Biber Chen, press secretary Andrea Saul and policy director Lanhee Chen. The Post interviewed Spencer Zwick, Romney’s former national finance co-chairman, who attended the New York meeting on Friday. 'I believe Mitt Romney is too much of a patriot to sit on the sidelines and concede the presidency to Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren when he knows that he can fix the country,' Zwick told the newspaper. 'He traveled the country in 2014, met with voters, met with citizens, and I think at the end of the day he believes he could actually make a difference.' Another person in attendance said that Romney answered a question about his intentions by saying, 'People ask if I really want to be president. ... I've run twice. Yeah, I want to be president.' Romney ran in 2008, losing the GOP nomination to Arizona Sen. John McCain, and in 2012, becoming the Republican nominee but failing to beat President Barack Obama. The Mormon politician's ties to big business caused him trouble three years ago in the harsh spotlight of an unsympathetic mass-media. Another Romney run has long been rumored but never substantiated, and he has outpaced the field in polls where his name is included among GOP hopefuls. 'At one point during the meeting,' The Wall Street Journal reported, 'one of the attendees asked Mr. Romney if he wanted to be president, a person present said. The 2012 nominee said, yes, of course.' The meeting was reportedly scheduled weeks ago in December, long before Bush announced the formation of a leadership PAC – the first step toward a likely candidacy. Romney has no timetable for a decision, according to the Journal, but said the domestic U.S. economy and the tumultuous foreign affairs environment in which the Obama White House has made some stumbles, are on his mind as he mulls his future. His first hurdle, however, may be persuading his wife Ann to withstand another bruising campaign cycle. She seemed to slam the door on the idea in October, telling the Los Angeles Times that she and Mitt were 'done' running for president 'completely.' 'Not only Mitt and I are done, but the kids are done,' she said, referring to the couple's five sons. 'Done. Done. Done,' Mrs. Romney added. But other statements from the politician himself have left prognosticators scratching their heads. NEVER WENT AWAY: Despite his 2012 presidential loss, Romney has stayed in party politics by campaigning for other candidates including New Hampshire U.S. Senate runner-up Scott Brown in this October photo . He said in August that while he had no plans to run again, 'circumstances can change.' Then his wife suggested he could make a political comeback – but only if Bush stayed out of the race. In October he swatted away a scrum of reporters in Kentucky, where he was campaigning for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election, telling them, 'I'm not running, I'm not planning on running and I expect to be supporting one of the many people who I think are looking at this race.' He repeated the refrain days later in an interview with Bloomberg News. 'I'm not letting my head go there,' Romney said with cameras rolling. 'Where I'm focused on making sure we nominate the right person, who cares about the kinds of issues I care about.' By November he was re-engaged in policy issues, taking a direct swipe at President Obama for what he called an 'extra-constitutional' move to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants. Following through, he warned, would be 'poking an eye of the Republican leaders in Congress.' 'The president has got to learn that he lost this last election round,' Romney said on the NBC News program Meet the Press. 'The American people spoke loud and clear. Let those people who were elected come together with a piece of legislation on this and other topics, and then he has a chance to veto them if he doesn't like them.' 'But the idea of violating the principles of our constitution, which is a balance of power, checks and balances, that is something which is wrong.' In July amid an Obama public-opinion malaise accelerated by the release of five Taliban soldiers in exchange for a captive Army sergeant, a CNN/ORC poll found that Romney would win a do-over election against the president. Romney would have taken 53 percent of the popular vote to Obama's 44 percent, in that snapshot in time. MITT-KILLER: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (center) is already beating the bushes to lock in donors who might otherwise choose to help Romney regain his political power in the GOP . Weeks earlier a WMUR/Granite State Poll found that in the critical early primary state of New Hampshire, Romney crushed his Republican competition when his name was added to the field. His numbers there emerged nearly as dominant as Hillary Clinton's on the Democratic side, capturing 39 per cent of the vote. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul were each a distant second with a 7 per cent showing. A followup poll by the same company in November found the margin had narrowed, with ROmney at 30 per cent and Paul at 11. Nationally, CNN and ORC found in early December that Romney has a narrower lead among Republicans, winning the support of about 20 per cent. Bush placed third in that poll at 9 per cent, one point behind former pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. But that was before Bush publicly expressed an interest in running – and before Carson was embroiled in a plagiarism scandal surrounding his 2012 book 'America the Beautiful.' In July, Romney's fellow Utahan Jason Chaffetz, a hard-charging Republican congressman, declared on MSNBC that Romney is 'actually going to run, and I think he will be the next president of the United States.' 'He’s been proven right on a lot of stuff,' said Chaffetz.","Former Massachusetts governor ran for the White House in 2008 and 2012 .

"The funeral has taken place of a five-year-old boy whose mother has been charged with his murder. Scott Chiriseri was found injured at his home in Alva, central Scotland on December 5 and pronounced dead at the scene. Around 200 people who gathered at a service in the town today were told about his love of motor racing and how he was an expert at the Mario Kart computer game. Mourners were led out of the church after the service by Scott's father, Tichakunda Chiriseri, and his sister, Natasha. Scott Chirashi, five, was found injured at his home in Alva, central Scotland, last month and later died . The five-year-old's coffin is brought into the Alva Parish Church in the town near Stirling today . Scott was found dead with what police described as a 'significant injury' at his home. His mother, Farai Chirashi, 32, has been charged with his murder and detained at a psychiatric unit. Rev Fraser said today that family and friends had come together to celebrate the young boy's life. 'We remember the life of Scott. You know that Scott loved life; if you close your eyes and you picture Scott, there is the young man we will see again. He loved life, he enjoyed his life,' he said. 'So happy on the first day of primary one. So happy. Well loved by all of his friends.' He added: 'He would come into the room and it was like ""I'm here now"". Running along, in our church, in the Baptist church down the road, the sound of life when he's present. 'He excelled at his work and he was happy to do well. Did you know that he loved motor racing? Like his dad. Sitting alongside watching that sport.' He told them Mario Kart was Scott's 'expert hobby' and that was why a picture of the character was on the front of the order of service below a photo of the smiling five-year-old. Scott's father Tichakunda Chiriseri and his daughter Natasha leave the church after the funeral . Locals wept as the small, white coffin was brought from the church after the service . Rev Fraser added: 'It was his fun pursuit that he would have beaten anyone in the room at. When they brought out a new game and the adults were trying to figure it out, there's this little boy saying ""Here's how it works, let me show you"". 'He loved his church. This is the boy that we are remembering, the fullness of life pouring out of him.' The hymns What A Friend We Have In Jesus and Jesus' Love Is Very Wonderful were sung before the coffin was carried from the church to the sound of Jerusalem Our Home, sung in the national language of Zimbabwe. A collection was also made in aid of the Children's Ministry of Alva's Baptist church, in memory of Scott. Floral tributes were left outside the church, with one message reading 'from the Alva community'. Flowers from the family were accompanied by the message: 'Beloved Scott. You are missed by all of us' Mourners lined the streets of the small town as the funeral cortège made its way along the main road . After the service, many stood silently in the town's Stirling Street as the funeral procession made its way to Alva Cemetery. Farai Chiriseri, also known as Chirashi, was charged with murder and assault following the child's death. The 32-year-old was held under mental health legislation following a hearing at Alloa Sheriff Court on December 9. She appeared in the same court in private last week where the sheriff made a treatment order. No further court date was set.

"Murderer Johnnie Allan wrote to the 21-year-old student after he saw her reading on the famous Carols From King's service broadcast on Christmas Eve . A 'shaken' female student fears for her safety after receiving a chilling letter from a convicted killer. Notorious murderer Johnnie Allan, 45, sent the revealing letter from maximum security Long Lartin Prison because he saw the 21-year-old student – who wants to remain anonymous – reading on the famous Carols From King's service broadcast on Christmas Eve. He was able to track her down after seeing the young woman's name on the BBC 2 programme's credits. It was delivered after Mr Allan simply wrote her name above the address of the University of Cambridge on an envelope. Mr Allan – who was found guilty of a multi-million pound drug plot in 1997 and the murder of a fellow suspect – sent the letter after the student's 'beautiful reading […] touched [his] heart.' On December 29 he wrote from the prison in Evesham, Worcestershire, joking: 'I doubt I can convince you to swap places?' He writes: 'I found you tweaking my imagination after seeing and hearing you. 'Trapped inside my concrete cube I decided to send you this speculative (almost message-in-a-bottle) type letter, taking the million-to-one chance you might be interested. 'This message could: a) Spark off a stimulating connection; b) Make you turn my envelope into a paper aeroplane floating into your wastebin.' And it looks like Allan, who describes himself as a 'naughty but nice' prisoner who 'likes to communicate' is starting a campaign. He adds: 'I could lay in my cell and remain paralyzed by the situation or I can try to influence my future by starting a campaign of writing to people.' Allan claims: 'After I tried to expose high level police corruption I actually became their prime target to silence and cover their ass… . 'They fabricated and manipulated evidence using extreme tactics of fear, threat, promise and misinformation utilizing techniques developed during 'PROJECT MKULTRA,' 'KUBARK' and more recently 'Persistent Adversity' methods employed by the CIA.' The letter sent by murderer Johnnie Allan to a 21-year-old student at one of Britain's top universities . Allan sent the revealing letter  because he saw the student – who wants to remain anonymous – reading on the famous Carols From King's service (pictured) 'They fabricated and manipulated evidence using extreme tactics of fear, threat, promise and misinformation utilizing techniques developed during 'PROJECT MKULTRA,' 'KUBARK' and more recently 'Persistent Adversity' methods employed by the CIA.' The baffled King's third year said: 'After reading a couple of lines I realised what the letter was and totally freaked out. 'I ran to my friends and had to ask them to read the rest of it for me. I was shaking like a leaf. 'I was terrified - I never expected to get anything like this. I can't believe he's allowed to do this. I'm not even sure how he managed to write to me. 'I didn't think people serving life could just send letters out to random people. 'I was in a state of shock at first. 'I've just about got over it now and find it funny. But I do worry for my safety.' The student broke down when she realised the four-page hand-written note had been penned by killer Johnnie Allen, currently serving life . The convicted murderer wrote in his letter that the student's reading had 'touched his heart' and 'tweaked his imagination . Murderer Johnnie Allen has his a profile on the PenPals Behind Bars website where he describes himself as a 'naughty but nice' prisoner who 'likes to communicate' According to the PenPals Behind Bars, Allan could be released as early as next year. Johnnie Allan, 50, was convicted in 1997 of an £8 million drugs conspiracy. Six years later, he was also convicted of the murder of his co-defendant in the drugs case. He is currently serving a life sentence at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire. But according to PenPals Behind Bars website, Allan - who previously claimed he had been training in prison to become a drugs counsellor, could be released as early as next year. It is not the first time the convict has written. Allan had struck up a bizarre friendship with heiress Eva Rausing after he sent her a letter. Their correspondence lasted four years and Eva laid her innermost thoughts bare to the notorious jailed killer in dozens of letters. In one letter on March 1, she even told the convict he was 'the only person I talk to.' His pitiable plea describes the fortified prison as 'a metropolis of men without women, a beehive without honey, caged loneliness without privacy, a farm where all the sheep are classified as black, a cement park with barbed-wire trees and an enormous microscope under which shrinks study the smear from civilisation's ulcers. 'This prison is a place of punishment, pain, gladiatorial entertainment, stigma, labels, loss, cover-ups, state secrets, metapathologies and despair.' Allan isn't the only one to randomly get in touch. She explained: 'I've got no fewer than ten friends requests from mostly creepy guys. 'Clearly, going on TV like this only leads to a cornucopia of harassment. 'It's mostly been amusing and quite flattering but this letter is more extreme than anything I expected.' She added that she hopes 'never to be contacted by him again'. The Ministry of Justice said Allan's letter did not break any rules, but if the student complains he will be barred from writing to her again. Other readers at the service watched by millions report similar experiences but this is the only instance of criminal interaction.

"Warning: Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, says that Jews are fleeing France and this will increase because of today's terror attack . Jews are fleeing terror-hit Paris because of growing anti-Semitism in France, one of Britain's most influential Jewish journalists said today. Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, spoke out after an Islamic terrorist took six people hostage and held them captive in a Kosher supermarket in the French capital. This afternoon police ordered all shops in a famous Jewish neighborhood in central Paris to close. The mayor's office in Paris  announced the closure of shops along the Rosiers street in Paris' Marais neighborhood, in the heart of the tourist district and less than a mile away from the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo where 12 people were killed on Wednesday. Hours before the Jewish Sabbath, the street is usually crowded with French Jews and tourists alike. Mr Pollard said today's terror attack in Paris, linked to the massacre  at the office of Charlie Hebdo, will force more French Jews to flee the country. Many are moving to Britain or to Israel, according to a report published in the newspaper last year. He said the fact that a terrorist had chosen to target a Jewish store was no 'fluke'. In a series of tweets he said: 'Every single French Jew I know has either left or is actively working out how to leave'. 'So, it's a fluke that the latest target is a kosher grocer, is it? 'What's going on in France - outrages that have been getting worse for years - put our antisemitism problems in perspective'. The hostage situation in the Porte de Vincennes part of the city is ongoing today. But amid fears the terror attack may be linked to anti-Semitism police have also demanded that  shops on Rue des Rosiers, in the Jewish quarter of Paris, to close early 'as a precaution' in case of further violence. 18 months ago France had around 500,000 Jewish residents - the largest population in the EU - but experts expect the number to fall to 400,000 within a few years, Mr Pollard's newspaper said. Mr Pollard said: 'It is the largest emigration of Jews anywhere since the war. That's a simple fact. Last summer the new Chief Rabbi of France, Haim Korsia, admitted there was a mass exodus of Jews leaving the country for the UK, other parts of Europe, Israel and North America. New threat: The scene today where around six people were being kept hostage in a Kosher supermarket, which was not chose by 'fluke', Mr Pollard said . Mr Korsia said this was a 'warning signal' for France. He said: 'Jews have been killed and there were the shootings in Toulouse and in Brussels. In general, Jews feel vulnerable in our society. 'The Jews who were murdered were targeted specifically because they were Jewish. 'This means France hasn't found the words and actions necessary to reassure them.' Joel Mergui, lay chairman of the National Union of French Synagogues, added: 'At some synagogues, whole benches are suddenly empty.' Strasbourg-born banker Myriam Amsellem left France for London because the UK is 'safer and freer' than her home country, where she claims Jewish traditions were stopped. She told the Jewish Chronicle last year: 'We feel a lot more comfortable here. I look at France now and I know I would not want to be there.' Today police across Britain were stepping up security in Jewish areas after the terror outrage in France, a community body said. The Community Security Trust (CST), which provides security advice to Britain's estimated 260,000 Jews, said police in London and Manchester in northern England had agreed to increase patrols at synagogues and other venues over the next days. 'There is currently no known link to the UK, but CST is in continuing contact with police and government, and there will be increased policing in Jewish neighbourhoods for this weekend's Sabbath,' the trust said on its website. Last July, the CST said anti-Semitic incidents in Britain had risen amid fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinians in Gaza.","Stephen Pollard says terror attack on Kosher store in Paris is no 'fluke'

"A paste that mimics and even helps to rebuild worn tooth enamel could soon bring relief to sufferers of sensitive teeth. Researchers in Taiwan have developed a material that can form a barrier over areas of teeth that are responsible for causing pain when eating hot or cold foods. The study found that when tested on dogs, the paste provided relief for at least 70 days. Scroll down for video . The paste developed by the researchers enters the exposed dentine tubes (a) and gradually crystalises (b) until the tube is completely sealed (c) preventing the fluid in the tubes from being disturbed and causing pain . At least one in five adults suffer from sensitive teeth at some point and the problem is particularly high among people aged between 40 and 50 years old. It is caused by areas of the soft dentine that lies beneath the hard enamel of teeth becomes exposed. This dentine contains hundreds of thousands of microscopic tube-like structures that radiate out from the pulp and contain a fluid. Tooth sensitivity tends to occur as a result of the gradual exposure of the softer inner parts of the tooth that lie beneath the enamel, known as 'dentine'. Dentine is composed of tiny tubules that lead to the nerves that extend though the tooth pulp. These tubes are filled with fluid that can be disturbed by sudden changes in temperature that occur when eating or drinking cold and hot foods. Extremely sweet or hard foods can also cause changes in the fluid. The movement of the fluid triggers the mechanoreceptors on the nerves in the tooth, triggering a short, sharp pain. Dentine can also be exposed as gums recede or if tooth enamel is chipped. Changes in the flow of the fluid in the dentine tubes due to physical pressure or hot or cold drinks triggers nerves located on the pulp side of the tubes. Now Professor Chun-Pin Lin, a researcher at the school of dentistry at the National Taiwan University, and his colleagues claim to have an answer. They have developed a material using calcium carbonate and silica that can seal the exposed dentine tubes and catalyse the regeneration of enamel. They have now tested their new paste on dogs and found that it plugged exposed tubes more deeply than other treatments, such as special toothpastes. Tests on the dogs' teeth revealed 'significant crystal growth' and 'no pulp irritation after 70 days,' wrote researchers. Professor Lin said: 'The biomimetic crystal layer can serve as a more reliable barrier that protects the pulp tissue. 'In fact, this crystal layer may act as a promoter for the mineralization of the pulp-dentin complex by inducing the permeation of calcium ions. 'We believe that the novel mesoporous biomaterials presented here have great potential for serving as both a catalyst and as a carrier in the repair or regeneration of dental hard tissue. 'Overall, the animal study revealed that the paste exhibited a more favorable dentin pulp response than did the other treatments.' Cold foods like ice cream can trigger sensitive teeth . The natural 'glue' used by mussels to stick to rocks has offered another potential cure for sensitive teeth. Quan-Li Li, of China's Anhui Medical University, and Chun Hung Chu, of the University of Hong Kong, drew inspiration from the sticky secretions produced by mussels. His team created a compound that could help keep minerals in contact with dentine long enough for the teeth to rebuild. They created a sticky polydopamine material mixed with the minerals calcium and phosphate. In tests in the lab, reported in journal Applied Materials and Interfaces, teeth bathed in the sticky material and minerals reformed dentine and enamel. In contrast, teeth bathed just in minerals reformed only enamel. They authors say that the substance 'may be a simple universal technique to induce enamel and dentine remineralisation simultaneously'. Sensitive teeth is caused by the soft dentine beneath the enamel becoming exposed, meaning that hot and cold foods can trigger nerves inside the tooth to cause shooting pains that affect around one in five adults . The graphic above shows how the molecules of calcium carbonate silicate (labelled CCMS) paste combines with phosphoric acid to produce calcium (labed Ca2+) crystals that eventually seal the exposed dentine tubes . Tests in dogs showed that the new paste treatment could be used to repair cavities in their tooth enamel . An estimated 40 million adults in the US suffer from sensitive teeth at some point. It normally occurs as the enamel on teeth is worn down by over brushing and decay, or if enamel becomes chipped. While some toothpastes have been developed to help reduce the pain from sensitive teeth, they are only temporary and require continual use to prevent it from returning. However, writing in the journal American Chemical Society Nano, Professor Lin believes his paste may provide a more permanent solution. It uses gelatin to deliver a calcum carbonate silicate to the problem tooth. This is mixed with phosphoric acid, which causes crystals to grow on the dentine and seals up any exposed tubes. These crystals penetrate deeper into the dentine tubes and so provide a far longer lasting seal, he said. The researchers hope the treatment could also be used to repair minor damage to teeth caused by tooth decay and to reduce the pain caused by tooth chips. Professor Lin added: 'The material I have developed is for use in a dental clinic as a treating material not for tooth paste.'","Researchers from the National Taiwan University developed the new paste .

"Detox season is well and truly upon us, with sales of juice makers rocketing 275 per cent in the past week alone.

Everyone’s heard about the Nutribullet (this is the one Kate is rumoured to have chosen), and it’s a nice-looking piece of kit. It has a strong extractor blade which completely breaks down the fruit and veg, so no need for chopping anything, and it’s extremely efficient. It comes with a variety of lids and cups you can use if you want to take your drink out with you. Easy to clean? Absolutely.

This squat-looking juice maker is pleasing to use the minute you unwrap it — there’s hardly any assembly to do, and it has squidgy rubber feet which keep it really stable on your worktop. You just have to drop your fruit and veg into the chute, which was wide enough so I didn’t have to chop anything. Not too noisy and extremely efficient — I had a vast jug of bright orange, zingy juice in seconds. Easy to clean? Yes!

The dual-speed motor seemed to find the ripe (peeled) pineapple chunks I added quite tricky to manage — it slowed right down and made a funny noise and I wondered if it was going to conk out. But it produced nice juice. Easy to clean? It’s not hard but there are an awful lot of parts to wash. Most of it can go in the dishwasher though. 6/10 . SLEEK SPACE-SAVER . Novis Vita Juicer, £299.99 . Debenhams, Lakeland and other retailers . This extremely smart machine comes from Switzerland and is just as efficient as its heritage implies. Consisting mainly of a cylinder, it comes in eight colours and takes up barely more space on your worktop than a kettle. Novis Vita Juicer is an extremely smart machine with a wide funnel which means no chopping . It comes with a citrus press which means that unlike nearly every other juicer, you don’t have to peel oranges or grapefruit (you just slice them in half instead) and its wide funnel means no chopping. It boasts three patents on its design, and claims to retain 20 per cent more nutrients than conventional juicers. The only downside (apart from the price) is that it’s pretty heavy to lift. Easy to clean? Surprisingly so. All elements of it that come into contact with juice or pulp can go in the dishwasher. 9/10 . GWYNNIE'S FAVOURITE . Angel Juicer Angelia 8500S, £1,105, Juiceland.co.uk . If you’re still recovering from overspending at Christmas, be thankful you didn’t take Gwyneth Paltrow’s present advice — she recommended a gold-plated one of these for £3,100. The one I tried was made of surgical grade steel, so it costs a mere £1,105. Dubbed the Rolls-Royce of juicers, it’s one of a new generation of twin gear, horizontal machines that masticate the fruit and veg slowly, producing absolutely delicious juice that is apparently far higher in nutrients. Gwyneth Paltrow recommended a gold-plated one of these for £3,100 as a great gift for Christmas . Using this machine does take a little longer, around three to five minutes, or more if you’re using green veg, and you have to chop up everything first, so it’s not for anyone in a hurry. But the juice is sublime. Easy to clean? Yes, it was pretty simple to take apart, and the gears can go in the dishwasher. 9/10 . FABULOUSLY RETRO . Retro Cold Press Juicer £299.99, Juicemaster.com . This sleek retro design looks fabulous, and it claims to produce juice with more nutrients intact because it juices slowly, so the fruit and veg retain more goodness (see the Angel Juicer) as it’s not affected by oxidation. The Retro Cold Press Juicer looks fabulous, and it claims to produce juice with more nutrients intact . There’s a large chute, so no need to chop fruit or veg, and it chugged (quietly) with ease through the apples and ginger I tried, crushing every last drop and churning out pulp that was almost bone dry. If ever a juicer is going to be sexy, this is it. A highly desirable machine. Easy to clean? Yes, but the manual says not to put the parts in the dishwasher as they’ll wear out faster. 10/10 . BUDGET OPTION . Cookworks KP400 Juicer, £24.99, Argos . Juice makers below the £50 mark are few and far between, so this is a steal. Looking at the manual, it only has a 400W motor (most of those I tested were around the 800-900W mark), so I expected inferior results but not at all — it was great! Juice makers below the £50 mark are few and far between, so this Cookworks iuicer at £24.99 is a steal . The funnel’s a little narrow so you have to pull an orange into three pieces and push them down individually, or chop an apple into several pieces, but apart from that, it was absolutely brilliant. Quiet, made lovely juice with no trouble, and extremely easy to operate. Easy to clean? Easy to take apart but quite a few parts to clean, and the manual said not to use a dishwasher, which is a shame. 8/10 . HESTON'S BIT OF KIT . Sage by Heston Blumenthal the Nutri Juicer Pro, silver, £299.95, John Lewis . I’m normally suspicious of gadgets with celebrity endorsements, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. It’s massive, looks very serious rather than glamorous like the Nutribullet, and sounds like a plane taking off. But what results! Sage by Heston Blumenthal the Nutri Juicer Pro is massive and sounds like a plane taking off . I threw in three medium whole apples, a whole (peeled) orange, a (peeled) chunk of fresh ginger and a (whole, unpeeled) carrot, and within about 15 seconds had a jug full of the most delicious fresh-tasting juice. And a satisfactory lot of sludge in the pulp container. It is enormous, however, so not suitable for those with small kitchens. Easy to clean? Well I did have to wash up seven parts afterwards (though they could have gone in the dishwasher). But the juice it made was so good, it was worth it. 8/10 . AMERICAN RIVAL . Vitamix Professional Series 750, £650, John Lewis . The publicity surrounding Vitamix machines is phenomenal, and it seems as if every time I go into John Lewis there’s a gaggle of eager women watching a Vitamix demonstration. So I was keen to try this wonder gadget for myself. Simple to operate, you can put in your chosen ingredients and leave the machine to it — it’ll switch itself off when done. The Vitamix juicer is not too noisy, despite the ice cubes, and its strength was impressive . I threw in big ice cubes, pineapple, handfuls of spinach, blueberries, oranges, and a piece of ginger and within about 20 seconds was left with a vast jug of seriously good, silkily smooth juice. Not too noisy, despite the ice cubes, and its strength was impressive. Easy to clean? Yes, very. Just the jug and its lid. You’re advised not to put them in the dishwasher, but there’s not a lot to do by hand. 9/10 . BEST FOR BEGINNERS . Jason Vale Fusion Juicer, £99.98, Juicemaster.com or Amazon . Endorsed by Jason Vale, or the Juice Master to his fans, this is a nice little machine, and a good one to go for if you’re new to making juice and don’t want to spend the earth. It has a fairly wide chute, so I didn’t have to chop up the small apple, carrots or clementines I dropped in, and it doesn’t take up too much space on the worktop. Not the most attractive piece of kit, but it made short work of the fruit and fresh ginger I tried in it, and the motor was pretty quiet, too. Easy to clean? Not bad. There were a few pieces but they came apart easily and could have gone in the dishwasher. 8/10 . The Jason Vale Fusion Juicer is a nice little machine, and a good one to go for if you’re new to making juice .","Sales of juice makers rocketed 275 per cent in the past week alone .

"Wildlife photographer Manoj Shah took these amazing pictures of the action of the female cheetah, known as Malaika, attempting a hunt. The big cat had spotted the wildebeest from her cheeky vantage point, perched atop a tourist safari vehicle. Just minutes later, she jumped off the truck and launched into her attack in Kenya's Masai Mara. Wildlife photographer Manoj Shah took these amazing pictures of the action of the female cheetah, known as Malaika, attempting a hunt . From her cheeky vantage point, perched atop a safari vehicle, Malaika spotted the wildebeest in the long grass plains . Manoj said he first noticed the cheetah scanning the bush as he drove up to the site - and knew that she was about to hunt. 'Driving towards the vehicle, I noticed a female cheetah, popularly known Malaika - meaning 'angel' in the local Kiswahili language - looking intently at the line of wildebeest running across the savannah plains,' he explained. 'In places where the grass was tall and ant hills were absent, Malaika cleverly used a tourist vehicle as a vantage point. Manoj first noticed the cheetah scanning the bush as he drove towards the site - and he knew that she was about to hunt . With her powerful eyesight, she spotted a young wildebeest following its mother - and immediately jumped from the vehicle in its direction . 'Thus she was able to scan vast areas of the Mara with her powerful eyesight. 'Suddenly her eyes gleamed upon noticing a wildebeest youngster closely following its mother. 'Malaika spotted her target, immediately jumped down from the vehicle and hurried through the long grass in the direction of her prey. 'She broke into a fast run when about 70 metres away from her target.' Malaika broke into a fast run about 70 metres from her target, confusing the wildebeest who was then separated from its mother . Once she caught up to her target, the cheetah used its front paw (and razor sharp dew claw) to grab hold of the wildebeest . The young wildebeest became confused and was quickly separated from its mother. He took off, running for his life. 'While all the big cats are specialist hunters, the cheetah has pushed specialism to an extreme,' Manoj added. 'It is sleek with its trim waist and long slender legs, its deep chest and small head - like a greyhound with a coat of a leopard. 'Catching up with her fleeing target, the cheetah slapped its front paw onto the hind of the wildebeest, grappling it with its razor sharp dew claw.' Surprisingly, however, the wildebeest held its ground and turned the tables on the cheetah, who fell to the ground . The wildebeest youngster faced Malaika and tried to attack her with its horns, which quickly drove the cheetah back into the tall grass . But the wildebeest held its ground strongly and, surprisingly, it was the cheetah who fell. The tables had now completely turned. 'The wildebeest faced the cheetah and tried to attack her with its horns,' the photographed said. 'It charged at Malaika and drove her off, the hunter had become the hunted.'","In Kenya's Masai Mara, a wildlife photographer snapped these amazing action shots of a female cheetah hunting .

"Just the thought of you partner cheating may make you feel queasy. But a new study has found that men and women fear different scenarios more. Most men would be more upset if their other half had a sexual affair, but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity, researchers have claimed. The fear: A new study has found that most men would be more upset if their other half had a sexual affair (illustrated with a stock image), but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity, researchers have claimed, citing evolutionary reasons . Scientists asked 64,000 people what would upset them more: their partners having sex with someone else - but not falling in love with them – or their partners falling in love – but not having sex with them. They found that 54 per cent of heterosexual men were more likely to be more hurt by sexual infidelity than emotional infidelity, whereas just 35 per cent of women would be more hurt by sex than if their partner fell in love with another person. The gender differences emerged across age groups, income levels, history of being cheated on, history of being unfaithful as well as the length of relationships. But gay men and women did not differ significantly in how they felt, according to the study of people aged from 18-65. Men fear sexual infidelity more because if his partner becomes pregnant, he cannot be sure the baby will be his, the researchers said . The results, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, were consistent with the evolutionary perspective of paternal uncertainty, the researchers said. That is, if a man is in a relationship with a woman and she becomes pregnant, he can never be sure if that child is his, or has been fathered by someone else - barring a paternity test - and will therefore fear sexual infidelity more. In contrast, women never face the problem of maternal uncertainty, because they can be sure that the child they are carrying is theirs. So while it is expected that both men and women will experience sexual jealousy, ‘men may exhibit particularly heightened responses compared with women’, according to the researchers at Chapman University in Orange, California. ‘While women do not face maternal uncertainty, they risk the potential loss of resources and commitment from partners [as they are left with a child to care for] if their partner channels their investment to another mate.’ The researchers explained that men are brought up to be masculine, which includes having great sexual prowess. ‘If a man’s partner commits sexual infidelity, this brings into question his sexual prowess and therefore threatens his masculinity, which leads him to react more negatively to his partner committing sexual rather than emotional infidelity,’ they said. ‘In contrast, women are taught to think relationally and to be emotional nurturers in a relationship. ‘If their partner commits emotional infidelity, this may threaten her sense of self more so than if her partner commits sexual infidelity.’ People who are 29, 39, 49 or 59 are more likely to cheat and make life-changing decisions as they approach a milestone birthday, a study published in November revealed. Researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults from more than 100 countries who completed a survey about their values between 2010 and 2014. They found that people with an age ending in nine were more likely to make changes ‘that suggest a search for meaning’ such as taking up marathon running or joining an extramarital dating site. Lead author Adam Alter, from New York University, said: ‘People audit the meaningfulness of their lives as they approach a new decade. 'People tend to either conclude happily that their lives are meaningful or they decide their lives lack meaning. '...some people might struggle to come to terms with the conclusion that their lives lack meaning. They might seek a socially damaging extramarital affair.' The researchers obtained data from an online dating site that targets people who are already in a relationship and found that there were far more 9-ender men - 18 per cent more - than would be expected by chance. Further analysis found a similar, though less-pronounced, pattern of results for women.","Study by Chapman University, California, found 54 per cent of heterosexual men were more likely to be more hurt by sexual infidelity .

"An Elvis fan took his family straight to McDonald's and started planning his dream trip to Graceland after scooping more than £4million in the National Lottery. David Hendry, 45, and his wife Donna, 44, from Edinburgh won the jackpot in Wednesday's triple rollover draw - on what would have been the King of Rock and Roll's 80th birthday. The couple took their Vauxhall Astra  for an MOT and said they are planning to move house and take a few family holidays with their 12-year-old son, including a trip to Memphis. Scroll down for video . David Hendry, 45, and his wife Donna, 44, from Edinburgh won more than £4million in the lottery . Mr Hendry said: 'I checked the winning numbers on my mobile phone as usual, to see whether I'd won anything. It was 6.30am and my wife Donna and our son were in the house. I knew immediately I had won the jackpot as I knew the numbers off by heart. 'I told Donna first, who obviously didn't believe me until I showed her our ticket. We then told our son Lewis who was flabbergasted, especially when he saw the full amount we had won. It is his birthday next week, so I think he's already thought of a lot of extra presents he would like. 'I love Elvis so maybe a trip to Graceland could be on the cards.' The family are planning a trip to Memphis, pictured is Elvis Presley in the back garden at Graceland in 1956 . The sales engineer, who works for cooling company Fenn Tool Limited, placed his numbers at a local post office three weeks in advance so he wouldn't miss any draws over the festive period. 'I tried not to say too much to anyone at the garage as I was still in shock and I didn't want to blurt it out - we've still only told a few people so far, until now,' he said. Mr Hendry and his wife, a commercial executive for Johnson & Johnson, said they have yet to decide whether to give up work. 'It's been 21 years in November since we've been putting the numbers on,' he said. 'The car passed its MOT. I don't honestly know at this time what car I'll get next. I've got a family so it might be a family car. 'It's too early to say what we are going to do with the money, and it's a lot to take in. It's got to look after us for the rest of our lives. 'Some of the family members know and some of my close friends know but that's it. It is just a bit of a whirlwind.' The winning numbers were 4, 5, 10, 12, 20 and 23 and the bonus ball was 24. Another ticket also matched the winner numbers, netting its owner £4,078,509 too.

"Mr Justice Holman heard the case in the Court of Protection in London, and ruled that the mentally-ill man should undergo the mastectomy against his will . A mentally-ill man in his sixties diagnosed with breast cancer has undergone surgery against his will after a judge ruled he does not have the capacity to make decisions about his treatment. Mr Justice Holman heard the case in the Court of Protection in London, where judges consider issues relating to sick and vulnerable people. Specialists said they thought that the most appropriate treatment for the tumour was a mastectomy but the man had refused to have an operation. The judge said it was 'quite clear' that the man did not have the mental capacity to make decisions about treatment, and that surgery could be life-saving. He ruled that it was lawful and in the man's best interests for surgeons to remove the tumour. He also gave medics permission to 'covertly' sedate and physically restrain the man if necessary. Mr Justice Holman was told that staff had planned to mix a sedative in the man's breakfast to calm him prior to the trip to hospital. The judge said while some people might 'recoil' at such an idea, the ends justified the means. Doctors, court-appointed lawyers who represented the man and the man's nearest relative, his sister, all agreed he should undergo surgery. The man's sister told the judge at the hearing: 'Something happening against his will is awful but we are talking about his life.' Mr Justice Holman said the man had to be told about what was going to happen to him prior to being anaesthetised. The man's sister said he was 'very scared' and would go 'berserk' when he heard the news. Breast cancer is much rarer in men than women. Only about 1 in 1,000 men develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Around 350 - 400 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in men in the UK every year. The condition is most often diagnosed in men aged 60-70. The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge. In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer along with a section of the breast. This is usually followed by a long-term course of hormone therapy using a medication called tamoxifen. Tamoxifen helps to block the effects of hormones on breast tissue that are known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells. It should help prevent the cancer from returning. In some cases, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose. The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there is reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose. Source: NHS Choices . Mr Justice Holman listened to evidence at a public hearing on December 18, but ruled that nothing could be reported by journalists until surgery had taken place. He was told that the man, who had learning disabilities and suffered from autism, might learn of the planned operation if there was prior reporting. And he concluded that a reporting embargo was justified and in the man's best interests. Lawyers involved in the case say the man underwent surgery earlier this week and is now doing well. Mr Justice Holman ruled that neither the man nor the NHS trust which had responsibility for his care and had applied for a ruling could be identified. He said the man, who had never married and had no children, was in a care home in southern England. 'I am quite satisfied on the basis of the written evidence I have heard in this case that it is highly likely that he does have cancer in the area of his breast,' said Mr Justice Holman. 'His sister says he is very scared and will not agree to an operation.' The judge added it was 'quite clear' that the man lacked the mental capacity to litigate and make decisions about appropriate treatment. 'The risks of not having surgery far outweigh the risks of having surgery,' said Mr Justice Holman. 'It is overwhelmingly in his best interests to have surgery.' He said it was likely the man would need to be restrained and gave permission for doctors to sedate the man 'covertly' by giving him a sedative in his breakfast. 'Many people may indeed recoil at the proposal that this gentleman should be given covertly a sedative with his breakfast at the care home in which he lives,' said the judge. 'But in my view this is a situation in which, to put it bluntly, the ends justify the means. 'Minimal force is necessary to enable the man to be taken to hospital for surgery to take place.' But the judge said patients in the man's position had to be told what was going to happen to them. The Court of Protection, where the ruling was made, is based at the Royal Courts of Justice, London (pictured) He said: 'My own view is that even in the case of an incapacitated or very incapacitated patient - leaving aside those who lack consciousness - it remains extremely important in any civilised society that they are not subjected to investigative or invasive surgery that as a minimum being informed in sensitive and appropriate language as to what is about to be done to them before it is done. 'The patient must be told in clear and sensitive terms before he is anaesthetised that he is going to be anaesthetised and that an operation is going to be performed, even at the risk of him going berserk.'","Surgeons said man needed a mastectomy but he refused to have operation .

"The iPhone may just put the 'I' in phone as a new study reveals that those who left their devices behind for even a few minutes felt a 'lessening of self.' A study from the University of Missouri called 'The Extended iSelf: The Impact of iPhone Separation on Cognition, Emotion, and Physiology,' found that being separated from the iPhone can lead to 'physiological anxiety' and 'poor cognitive performance.' The study published on Thursday in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication surveyed 40 iPhone using subjects from three different journalism courses. Scroll down for video . I miss my iPhone: The iPhone may just put the 'I' in phone as a new study reveals that those who left their devices behind for even a few minutes felt a 'lessening of self' The group was meant to be representative of students at a large university. CBS reports that during the first experiment members of the study were told to sit in a room and complete a puzzle while they still were in possession of their phone. They were then instructed to complete a second puzzle but were told that their phone was causing Bluetooth interference and would need to temporarily be confiscated. While subjects were completing the puzzle, the researchers called their phones and the subjects were able to hear it but did not know where it was nor were they allowed to answer it. During the study the researchers conducting the study took note of participant’s heart rate and blood pressure. A release published by the researchers said that when the subjects were separated from their phones their anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure increased and they were less able to complete the puzzle. Researchers wrote that people should avoid being separated from their technology at all costs, especially during an important task. 'iPhone users avoid parting with their phones during daily situations that involve a great deal of attention,' said the release. Russell Clayton who worked on the study said that  people in the study who were separated from their phones had debilitating separation anxiety. 'Our advice would be to carry your iPhone with you but to silence your phone during cognitively demanding tasks (i.e., work, meetings, exams, etc) in order to avoid any potential distractions that may reduce your attention throughout the day,' Clayton told The Huffington Post.

"Korean pop-star Bobby Kim may soon become famous America - but not for his music. The singer made headlines in South Korea on Wednesday, after he was escorted off a flight in San Francisco for causing a ruckus on board. The 41-year-old star's agents say he started drinking after he learned he would have to fly economy, and that he blacked out. Commotion: Korean pop-star Bobby Kim allegedly got drunk and had to be escorted off a Korea Air flight to San Francisco and is now under investigation for sexually harassing a flight attendant . According to witnesses,  Kim got drunk about five hours into the flight from Incheon, and began shouting and  sexually harassing a flight attendant by touching her waist. Those on board the flight reported that the scene lasted for about an hour, and that FBI agents and airport security escorted him off the plane when it touched down in San Francisco just after 10am, the Korean Times reports. Officials in the U.S. are now allegedly investigating Kim for sexual harassment. Since the incident happened mid-flight, both the country of arrival and the country where the airline is based have jurisdiction to investigate. Korean Air has reportedly filed a complaint against Kim, and South Korean officials will look into the matter when the pop-star returns to his home country.

For the time being, Kim is to remain in San Francisco for questioning. Two flight attendants and two passengers sitting next to Kim were called to give their account of events. Kim's label Oscar Entertainment issued a statement in response to the incident, published in The Korea Herald, which doesn't deny his behavior. 'Kim drank some wine on the flight after he got distressed by Korean Air,' the agency said, adding that Kim was upset that the air line wouldn't upgrade his economy seat to business class.

"Entertainer Lance Percival has died at the age of 81. The actor was renowned for his comic renditions of calypso songs on the 1960s satirical television show That Was The Week That Was, hosted by David Frost. He was later given two series of his own, The Lance Percival Show and Lance at Large, a 1964 sitcom which featured Bernard Bresslaw, Gladys Bacon and Eric Barker.

"Ethereal washes of green, inky blues and a shining white moon. Not many worldly sights equal that of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, captured at night. This dramatic series of photographs, taken by Norwegian photographer Tor-Ivar Naess, shows the phenomenon in all its glory. The 31-year-old from Nordreisa, Norway, became fascinated by the colour range of the lights that extend from 50 miles (80km)  to as high as 400 miles (640km) above the earth's surface.

Tor-Ivar says: 'The Aurora Borealis is a very special phenomenon in itself. 'I began watching these lights for hours and it ignited something inside of me. 'Due to the fact that I have them available to me from the beginning of autumn until the beginning of spring I have the opportunity to perfect my photos.

'My Aurora Borealis photos show the diversity in this spectacle, from the normal green veil to fast moving 'curtains' of light.' The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south. Straumfjorden in Norway: It takes a lot of patience and luck with the weather and behaviour of the lights to create the ideal image . For Tor-Ivar, the perfect shot takes patience and luck with both the weather and the behaviour of the auroras. Areas that are not subject to 'light pollution' are the best places to watch for the lights. Luckily, he doesn't have to stray far from his home town of Nordreisa in the county of Troms to produce these beautiful shots, all of which were shot in Norway. For two years he has scoured the area looking for the best possible locations and, once in the right spot, he can spend up to eight hours a time photographing the light display. Tor-Ivar: 'I still hope that no one hears me scream like a teenage girl at a boy band concert when these lights put on a show' Tor Ivar wants to show the beauty that northern Norway can conjure so that people from around the world will be tempted to visit themselves . 'Photographing the aurora borealis is very exciting, especially when the normal green veil bursts into curtains moving extremely fast over the night sky,' says Tor-Ivar. 'I still hope that no one hears me scream like a teenage girl at a boy band concert when these lights put on a show.

"He once referred to himself as the 'Kanye West of food' and now Kim Kardashian's best friend Jonathan Cheban is set to open a 'fast casual' restaurant. The Burger Bandit will open in Long Island, New York, 'any day now' and Cheban hopes to turn it into a global franchise. He believes there is a gap in the market for his restaurant, which will have mini burgers on potato buns topped with a secret sauce, and toasted marshmallow milkshakes on the menu. Scroll down for video . New venture: Jonathan Cheban with best pal Kim Kardashian will open The Burger Bandit this week . 'There are places all over the world that are missing burger places,' Cheban told The Wall Street Journal. He described his establishment as a 'fast casual' outlet, rather than a fast-food restaurant. Explaining what this means, he said: 'You can sit down and you can take it to go. It's a cross between a Five Guys (American burger outlet) and a Shake Shack (trendy gourmet burger chain).' Cheban's burgers are a little over two ounces - bigger than sliders but smaller than conventional burgers. The burgers at Burger Bandit are a little over two ounces, bigger than sliders (pictured) but smaller than conventional burgers. The restaurant also plans to serve toasted marshmallow milkshakes . 'I can't stand eating sliders because they're often hard as a rock and they're dry,' Cheban explained. Meanwhile, he thinks 'a big burger is kind of a pain in the butt.' So, he developed the bandit. 'It fits in your hand and you could have two or three,' he said. 'In one sitting, I can do about three.' 'But I don't like fancy burgers, or burgers that come with blue cheese and potato and a thousand things. I don't like them with 55 toppings,' he said. 'I like burgers how I like my pizza: plain and simple.' His reality TV superstar pal Kardashian-West has said she's impressed by his new venture. 'I'm really proud of him,' she said at a recent event. 'I love it when people do entrepreneurial kinds of things.' This isn't the 40-year-old's first foray into the food and beverage industry.

"Married couples should get ‘milestone’ tax breaks which would mean that the longer they stay together the less tax they pay, a senior judge suggested yesterday. Sir Paul Coleridge said the allowances would reward families that remain stable and encourage couples facing a break-up to try to stick it out. The system would also mean that couples who split up – often at high cost to the taxpayer – would be penalised. High Court Judge Sir Paul Coleridge has suggested married couples should get milestone tax breaks . Family breakdown was recently estimated by the independent Relationships Foundation organisation to cost the State more than £40 billion a year – a figure including more than £18 billion in additional welfare benefits, £1.8 billion spent treating mental health problems and a social services bill of almost £5.5 billion. Sir Paul floated the tax allowance proposal at a debate on cohabitation organised by the Marriage Foundation, the think-tank he chairs which campaigns for stable families. He described the small-scale tax break that David Cameron will give to some married couples this spring as ‘ridiculous’, and asked: ‘Where is the incentive for people to stay together?’ Sir Paul, who retired as a full-time High Court family judge last year but who remains active on the bench, said: ‘Why not give people an incentive? People would know that if they were together for five years their tax allowances would get bigger, and it would get bigger still after ten years. ‘Couples who were on the point of breaking up would think that if they could stick it out for another two years or so there would be money in it for them.’ Prime minister David Cameron promised a tax break for married couples at the 2010 election . He added: ‘We need tax incentives and they would have a real effect on the way people behave. They would also reflect the reality that people who stay together do not cost the State much, whereas couples who split up cost the State an absolute fortune.’ A milestone tax break could be staged so newlyweds would have minor advantages over unmarried couples. But there could be increments to increase the tax allowances at five and ten years, possibly linked to the arrival of children. By the time of a silver wedding anniversary after 25 years, a married couple would expect to enjoy a major income boost under the scheme compared to people their age who never married. Mr Cameron promised a tax break for married couples at the 2010 election. The concession, which means that married couples and civil partners who are not higher rate taxpayers will be able to transfer £1,000 of their tax-free allowance to their spouse or partner, will apply from this April. A milestone tax break could be staged so newlyweds would have minor advantages over unmarried couples . Analysts believe this will mean that around 1.6million people get just £3.85 a week, and 1.1million people will only see a benefit of £1.35 a week because the Coalition’s welfare reforms will take away the rest of the gain. The Prime Minister’s Tory critics, including former chancellor Lord Lawson and former party chairman David Davis, have called for all married couples to be allowed to transfer income tax allowances to each other, to provide support for married families and partners who choose to be stay-at-home parents. Sir Paul, one of the country’s most experienced family judges, has abandoned his former support for a law that would force cohabitees to accept financial duties to each other, a proposal that has near-universal backing among judges and lawyers. He said it was dangerous to blur the distinction between marriage and cohabitation – as cohabitee couples are likely to split after three years, but the average divorce only takes place after 11 years.","Senior judge suggested married couples should get a 'milestone' tax .

"Twitter is abuzz with rumours that Cuba's former communist leader Fidel Castro has died, although the speculation has emerged close on the heels of the death of another high-profile person with the same name. There has been no official confirmation that the 88-year old former leader of Cuba has died and social media has an impressive track record of prematurely announcing Castro's demise. Also casting doubt on today's speculation is the possibility that twitter users are confused by the name, after Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died several days ago at the age of 41. Scroll down for video . Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, pictured during a speech in 2003. Twitter is abuzz with rumours he has died, but it remains to be seen if they are correct . Media including a Venezeulan newspaper - Diario de Cuba - said that a government press conference was imminent, but no such broadcast emerged. Cuban officials denied that Raul Castro- Cuba's leader and Fidel's brother - was due to speak live, saying no such programme had been planned. Some later said it was 'a lie fabricated by anti Cuban elements in Miami'. Castro, who passed on Cuba's leadership to Raul in 2008, became Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state.

It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses. Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants.

"Two brothers accused of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris were on a British watch and no-fly list, it can be revealed. Cherif, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, had been identified as a potential terror threat and placed on the list in case they tried to enter the UK or transit through a British airport. The pair were added to the list as potential extremists, after the younger brother was convicted on terrorism charges in 2008 and rubbed shoulders behind bars with known jihadis who had trained with Al Qaeda and visited Osama Bin Laden’s headquarters. US intelligence placed the brothers on the list as the same time as the Britons raising further questions over why they were not monitored more closely by the French. Two brothers accused of murdering 12 in the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris had already been flagged as a terrorist threat and placed on a U.S. no-fly list. Heavily armed police SWAT teams have been swarming a region north of Paris as part of the hunt for the two gunmen - who are currently surrounded in a design company's office where they are holding a hostage. Scroll down for video . French police are hunting Cherif, left, and Said Kouachi, right, in connection with the Charlie Hebdo attack . The killers attacked the satirical magazine murdering 12 people over a cartoon of the Prophet Mohamed . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls confirmed both men were known to security services prior to the fatal attack. A senior U.S. official said Thursday the elder Kouachi had traveled to Yemen, although it was unclear whether he was there to join extremist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based there. The younger brother, Cherif, was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for his links to a network sending jihadis to fight American forces in Iraq. Both were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counter-terrorism official said. French President Francois Hollande called for tolerance after the country's worst terrorist attack in decades. He said: 'France has been struck directly in the heart of its capital, in a place where the spirit of liberty - and thus of resistance - breathed freely.' President Barack Obama signed a book of condolence for the people murdered in the Paris terror attack . The brothers were armed with automatic assault rifles and murdered 12 people during their rampage . French police have launched a major counter-terrorism operation following the attack on Tuesday . French police have arrested nine people who were connected to the brothers while 90 witnesses have also been interviewed. Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve confirmed that Cherif Kouachi left his ID card behind in the getaway car used during the attack. Security officials confirmed that the brothers were born in Paris to Algerian parents. The younger brother, who was a former pizza delivery driver, appeared on a 2005 documentary in French TV on Islamic extremism. He was jailed in 2008 for 18 months after he tried to travel to Iraq to join al-Qaeda. During the documentary, Cherif Kouachi said he had been radicalised in north eastern Paris by a hard-line preacher. He said the cleric told him 'that holy texts prove the benefits of suicide attacks. It is written in the texts that it's good to die as a martyr.' The brothers grew up in the multi-ethnic working-class 19th arrondissement of Paris. Cherif Kouachi's lawyer said at the time that his client had fallen in with the wrong crowd. During the trial, Kouachi was said to have undergone only minimal training for combat — going jogging in a Paris park to shape up and learning how a Kalashnikov automatic rifle works by studying a sketch. He was described at the time as a reluctant holy warrior, relieved to have been stopped by French counterespionage officials from taking a Syria-bound flight that was ultimately supposed to lead him to the battlefields of Iraq. The two brothers were filmed shouting 'we have killed Charlie Hebdo' after the murderous attack . His former lawyer Vincent Ollivier told Le Parisien newspaper that his client had changed him. In the documentary, the younger killer is seen as a young man in a black T-shirt with extremely close-cropped hair and a chunky wristwatch was keener on spending time with pretty girls than on going to the mosque. He appears relaxed and smiling as he pals around with friends. At one point, with his baseball cap worn backward, Kouachi belts out some rap music and breaks into a joyful dance. After he was released from prison, he worked in a supermarket's fish section in the Paris suburbs for six months beginning in 2009. Supervisors said he gave no cause for concern. In 2010, police detained him again in a probe of an alleged plot to free an Islamic militant sentenced to life in prison for bombing a Paris train line in 1995. Kouachi was ultimately released with no charges ever brought. Much less has become public about the older brother, Said, but Cazeneuve said the jobless resident of the city of Reims was also known to authorities, despite having never been prosecuted, because he was 'on the periphery' of the illegal activities his younger sibling was involved in. A French security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that American authorities had shared intelligence with France indicating that Said had travelled to Yemen several years ago for training. French authorities were seeking to verify the information, the official said. In Reims, about 90 miles northeast of Paris, Said frequented a prayer room on the ground floor of an apartment building, according to the local imam, Abdul-Hamid al-Khalifa. Al-Khalifa admitted that Said wore traditional North Africa clothes to prayers and didn't mix much — if at all — with other worshippers. 'Typically, he'd come late to prayers and leave right when they were done.' A third suspect identified by French authorities in the attack turned himself in Wednesday night. Mourad Hamyd, 18, surrendered at a police station after learning his name had been linked to the case in the news, said Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor. She did not specify his relationship to the Kouachis.","Pair were singled out as extremists after Cherif Kouachi, 32, was convicted on terror charges in 2008 and were linked to Al Qaeda jihadis in prison .

"Former Coronation Street star Ken Morley has boasted of 'groping and grabbing' women alongside his high-placed television friends in the 1980s, claiming 'everyone was at it'. The 71-year-old actor said touching women was 'part of the course' and that some of those arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree had been victims of a witch hunt. Speaking before he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, Morley added that while the Eighties were 'a promiscuous age', today he refrains from making sexual advances for fear of being accused of impropriety. Scroll down for video . Former Coronation Street star Ken Morley said 'groping and grabbing' women in the 1980s was 'normal' and that 'everybody was at it' before entering the Celebrity Big Brother house on Wednesday (above) Asked whether any of those arrested had been victims of a witch hunt, Morley told the Sun's Katie Earlam: 'People like Jim Davidson were.' The comedian was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences but released without charge before going on to win the Channel Five reality show in which Morley is now taking part. Of touching women, the Coronation Street actor continued: 'Everybody was at it. I was at it, we were all at it. 'Groping and grabbing was just part of the course. It was regarded as normal.' In the same interview, the father-of-one observed that authorities are 'touchy' about paedophiles and described Hitler as 'a funny guy.' Morley starred in the BBC1 sitcom Allo! Allo! from 1988, before joining ITV's Coronation Street the following year. In the past he has spoken out against the Crown Prosecution Service in its pursuit of Operation Yewtree arrests following the trial of his former colleague Bill Roche, who was cleared of sexual offences. 'Considering the Michael Le Vell farce, they should be careful about the waste of taxpayers’ money,' he said after the unanimous verdict at Preston Crown Court in February last year. The 71-year-old, pictured above in the Celebrity Big Brother house, said the 1980s was 'a promiscuous age' Morley said the comedian Jim Davidson (left) had been the victim of a witch hunt after being released without charge over alleged sexual offences. The actor previously spoke out in defence of former Coronation Street colleague Bill Roache (right) who was cleared of a string of assaults last year . Le Vell, another of his Coronation Street colleagues, was also cleared of sexual offences on children in September 2013. Morley became known for his role as a womanising shop owner in the soap between 1989 and 1995. Since then he has taken on parts in pantomimes across the UK and appeared in a swathe of celebrity reality television programmes. In 2010 he shocked others taking part in a Coronation Street special of the Channel 4 cooking programme Come Dine With Me by groping female guests and making suggestive comments. Dressed as an American preacher, the actor touched fellow actor Tupele Dorgu inappropriately. In the same episode, Morley cornered another Celebrity Big Brother veteran, Julie Goodyear, telling the actress: 'Sorry Julie, I must, I must... accept me', before trying to kiss her. A spokesman for the star was not available for  comment this morning. ITV and the BBC have yet to respond to MailOnline's requests.

"Farmers are warning that the UK dairy industry could face extinction if retailers continue to drive prices down . The price of milk has fallen to just 22p a pint thanks to a fierce war between supermarkets. Farmers have warned the UK dairy industry faces extinction if retailers continue to drive down the price – now at its lowest level in seven years. Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland are selling four pints of milk for just 89p, while Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waitrose are not far behind at £1. Pint for pint, milk is now cheaper than mineral water in most supermarkets. Retailers insist they are funding the cost of the price reduction from their own profits, rather than paying farmers less. Many supermarkets have guaranteed the price farms receive will stay above the cost of production. But farmers say the price war is also devaluing milk as a product at a time when they are under unprecedented pressure. They are worried smaller shops without fair deals in place will try to match supermarket prices, driving down the cost further. Rob Harrison, who chairs the National Farmers Union dairy board, said: 'It looks like this is going to be the worst crisis the dairy industry has ever seen. 'Retailers are fighting over market share and they are driving farmers out of business. 'If they don't support us there will be very few dairy farmers left in this country in six months' time.' The global price of milk has collapsed in the past three months, meaning British farmers also receive less for milk they export. Some are now being paid less than 20p a litre (11.4p a pint) – the lowest price in a decade and far lower than the sum it costs them to produce the milk. Mike Gorton, 58, who milks 70 cows in Cheshire, said: 'Last year I was getting 31p a litre – now I am getting less than 20p. It costs me 24p a litre to produce so I am losing money fast.' The father of two said he is furious that supermarkets have become engaged in a price war at a time when farmers are struggling to make ends meet. 'They are playing games, devaluing the product I am working 14 hours a day to produce,' he said. The number of dairy producers in England and Wales dropped below 10,000 for the first time last year, down from 20,000 in 2001. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, warned traditional farmers who feed their cows on open pasture were most at risk of going out of business. He said: 'People are being pushed into big, indoor, intensive systems … consumers don't want that – they want to see cows in open fields.' Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer pay a pool of farmers a guaranteed price for their milk, rather than buying it on the open market. Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland are selling four pints of milk for just 89p, while Tesco (pictured), Sainsbury's and Waitrose are not far behind at £1 . Other supermarkets, including Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Morrisons, buy their milk from large co-operatives and processing firms who pay farmers a fixed price. At the Oxford Farming Conference, Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said she would do all she could to help dairy farmers stay in business. Last night, supermarkets defended their policies. Spokesmen for Asda and Iceland maintained that they had absorbed the cost of the price cut for customers, and not reduced the amount paid to suppliers. Lidl also said it 'absorbs the costs of any market-led price reductions'. An Aldi spokesman said it ensures a fair deal for milk suppliers by 'paying an amount above the farm gate price'. Elsewhere, Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said she was doing all she could to support farmers, by pushing for dairy exports and promoting British products at home. Speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference, she said: 'I understand that many dairy farmers are feeling the pressure when there's been such a steep drop from the 33.8p per litre seen at the start of last year to prices now quoted in the low 20s in some cases. 'We want to make sure the hard-working farmers in this industry are able to withstand as far as possible the immediate effects and also to have the resilience to handle volatility in the longer term.'","Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland are currently selling four pints of milk for 89p .

"A woman who had been struggling with body issues for much of her life has seen her confidence soar after taking part in a challenging nude photo shoot. Claire, a 48-year-old working mother based in Denver, Colorado, felt the time had come for her to silence her inner-critic after her father - the first person to make a comment about her weight - passed away last year. 'You're kind of a little tank,' Claire's father had told her when she was eight years old, planting a seed that would embed itself stubbornly into her psyche long into adulthood. Moving on: Claire had been struggling with body issues for much of her life, but has seen her confidence soar after taking part in a challenging nude photo shoot (pictured) Claire, was has teenage children, took part in journalist Shannon Bradley-Colleary's Love Your Body Now project, which involved working with body coach Marlene Zaleznick while posing nude for fine art photographer Beth Sanders. Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Claire says of her experience: 'I still have the annoying voice in my head that tells me I am not good enough, thin enough, fit enough. 'That likely won't ever go away. However, I have a relationship with that voice now where it no longer has power over me. 'This alone is a huge transformation that feels absolutely liberating.' Old wounds: 'You're kind of a little tank,' Claire's father had told her when she was eight years old, planting a seed that would embed itself stubbornly into her psyche - (Claire would rather not reveal her face) Speaking to Shannon about her childhood, Claire explained that while her father's comments were 'seemingly innocent and supportive' - he would sometimes suggest they 'get fit together' - they did more harm than good. At one point in her childhood, her father, an avid runner, even suggested Claire and her mother try and 'lean down' on a diet of 1,000 calories or less per day. Claire was fit, incidentally. She loved to dance, and though she didn't go as far as some of her peers in regards to dieting, she did use diet pills and diuretics. 'I wasn’t a fan of making myself throw-up, which was kind of trendy at the time,' she says. 'There was something, my inner rudder, telling me to hold on a second.' She told herself: 'You don’t want to be about anorexia like many of the girls in dance class.' Still, Claire, who stands at 5ft 4in and weighs 150lbs, held on to a fixation over weight as she grew older. 'I’ve been chasing the same 20-30lbs since college and the effort and exhaustion of the things I say to myself is crazy-making,' she admits. Joy: Marlene, a 'body-centered' emotional coach,  suggested Claire lose herself in dance as part of the shoot - a childhood passion which remains a great source of comfort and freedom for her . During her 18-year first marriage, Claire disliked being seen naked, particularly after she started having children. 'My only purpose was to serve my children, to be their sustenance,' she says. 'My sexuality went right out the window.' Claire's second marriage was to someone she describes as an 'extremely lovely conscious man.' Their relationship remains strong and Claire's career is on the upswing. Yet still she couldn't quieten the constant self-berating inner-dialogue she had regarding her body. Although anxious about taking part in her nude photo shoot, Claire had high hopes based on similar projects Shannon had run before. Marlene, a 'body-centered' emotional coach, astutely suggested Claire lose herself in dance as part of the shoot - a great source of comfort and freedom for her. She shed her clothes and describes the dancing she performed as Beth snapped away as both 'celebratory' and a course of 'grieving'. Emotionally loaded: Claire describes the dancing she performed as the photographer snapped away as both 'celebratory' and a course of 'grieving' Claire had a particular breakthrough when Marlene - who Claire said expertly 'midwifed' the process' - placed bricks on her back to help her feel the weight of her body image issues pressing down on her. 'I had a transcendent experience when I shook off those bricks,' she recalls. When Claire reviewed the black-and-white portraits, she says that 80per cent of her embraced what she saw. 'To see Beth’s genius was moving to me,' she says. 'There is a sense of peace and release in my face that was exactly what happened to me during the shoot.' The remaining 20per cent of Claire noticed 'the softness' of her stomach. 'I don’t have a flat tummy and even when I worked out I didn’t,' she remarks. 'There was a feeling of disappointment in that part.' Process: When Claire reviewed the black-and-white portraits, she says that 80per cent of her embraced what she saw, but the remaining 20per cent of her noticed 'the softness' of her stomach . It's been more than six months since Claire had the photos taken, and she describes the experience as enduringly 'healing.' 'I have a much more positive attitude about my body, and have grown more comfortable with the skin I am in,' she tells us. 'I find myself feeling grateful for this body that allows me to be in this world, so I may offer my work and talents, experience life and love, savor food that nourishes me, touch and be touched.' She adds: 'The experience has allowed me to step more fully into who I am, back to who I was before the negative voice set up camp in my head. 'I am now gentler with myself. Loving. Accepting. And I am so grateful that I have the rest of my life now to feel this way.'","Claire, who stands at 5ft 4in and weighs 150lbs, has struggled with a negative self body-image since childhood .

"A judge has sparked fury after jailing a rapist who attacked three different women for just nine years, claiming the man did not pose a 'serious' risk to future victims. Despite leaving the women 'terrified and shaken', Marc Partridge did not pose the risk of 'serious harm', Judge Andrew Woolman told Preston Crown Court. The 28-year-old from Accrington had been found guilty of raping two women and harassing another, with the latter two offences taking place while Partridge was on bail for the first. Judge Andrew Woolman jailed rapist Marc Partridge (right) for nine years, telling a court the 28-year-old did not pose a risk of 'serious harm' despite attacking three women . The court heard how Partridge, a scaffolder, taunted one woman: 'How does it feel to be locked inside a house with a rapist?' before raping her, muzzling her cries for help. At the time he was on bail after being arrested on suspicion of raping another victim. Months later he harassed a third woman, pouring a cup of boiling tea over her body and slapping her over the face. But despite such 'intimidating and bullying behaviour', the aspiring PE teacher was found not to pose a serious enough threat to warrant a longer jail term. 'In some senses your conduct shows that you may be a dangerous individual but although you are a risk of causing harm you are not at risk of causing serious harm and I trust that after a period in prison those risks will be reduced,' Judge Woolman told the court. 'You clearly have a real problem in dealing with relationships with women. It may be that you need psychiatric help. 'The victim personal statements from each of the girls show they were terrified as a result of what you did and are left shaken. It may be that the effect on them does not go.' The scaffolder raped one woman while on bail for attacking another, taunting her: 'How does it feel to be locked in a house with a rapist?' Preston Crown Court (above) heard how Partridge had shown 'bullying and intimidating' behaviour . One of the man's victims lambasted the sentence as 'a joke'. 'It is a joke and I do not understand how the judge does not see him as a danger to the public,' the woman said. 'I think it’s a very light sentence compared to what this man has done. The judge has been extremely lenient. According to official sentencing guidelines, rape is punishable by jail terms of between four and 19 years. The maximum term a judge can hand down is a life sentence. Courts must however take into consideration the harm and culpability afforded in each case. In the most serious cases where there is extreme harm to the victim and a strong element of culpability on the part of the offender, a starting point of 15 years per offence is advised. However where there is found to be no residual harm to the victim and little culpability on the part of the offender, a starting point of five years is advised. The minimum sentence for rape is four years. 'Partridge was smirking and laughing as he went down. I suppose I should be just happy because he is not walking the streets anymore.' The court had heard how Partridge raped his first victim after threatening: 'If you want me to show you that I'm a man I will show you.' He went on to bombard the woman with 1,500 text messages in one month. He was arrested but released on bail, allowing him to lock a second woman inside his home to rape her. Neighbours told police the woman's muzzled cries were similar to those 'of an animal in pain' while she was being attacked. 'He held her down despite her telling him no, he  told her to take the pain,' prosecuting counsel Sarah Johnson said. 'He covered her mouth to muffle her complaints. She submitted. After he acted as if nothing had happened. 'The woman grabbed the keys to the door in a bid to flee but was pursued and caught by Partridge which was witnessed by a neighbour who saw him pick the victim up and carry her back into his house as she screamed for help.' Later he launched a campaign of harassment on a third victim, pouring scolding tea over her body, slapping her across the face and throwing her over a table. The 28-year-old admitted two charges of rape and one of harassment. He was issued restraining orders banning him from contacting any of the women who brought charges against him. Jason Leonard appeared in court weeks after being released from prison over child pornography charges . A spokesman for Rape Crisis, said victims' confidence that the legal process will bring offenders to justice is crucial. 'The criminal justice process can be extremely difficult for survivors of this kind of crime,' Katie Russell, national spokesman for the charity said. 'If levels of reporting are ever going to significantly increase, survivors of sexual violence need to feel confident that engaging with the criminal justice process is going to be worthwhile.' Last month Judge Woolman complained at not being able to sentence a paedophile for longer under Parliament rules. In December he jailed Jason Leonard for eight months for breaking a court order which banned him from accessing the internet. The 33-year-old had been released from prison weeks earlier after being convicted of child pornography offences. 'This was a very, very deliberate breach...and if I had the powers, I would undoubtedly have made this sentence consecutive to the current sentence,' Judge Woolman told Burnley Crown Court. 'But Parliament for reasons best known to itself had abolished the right of judges to return a defendant to custody to serve the balance of a sentence and to impose a term to then be served.'","Marc Partridge raped two women and violently harassed another .

"Tech juggernaut Google may be hatching a plan to make their claim on the U.S. auto insurance industry. An entity named Google Compare Auto Insurance Services is not licensed to sell insurance in 26 states as well as being authorized to sell policies in one state for six insurers, revealed analyst Ellen Carney. More evidence: A Google executive was recently given authorization to sell insurance using Google Compare. Tech juggernaut Google may be hatching a plan to make their claim on the U.S. auto insurance industry . The Wall Street Journal reports that there's evidence Google could work with CoverHound, an auto-insurance comparison site in San Francisco. It's likely the company wants to displace middle men in the industry just as it's done to the shopping business and travel industry. 'We can't comment on speculation,' said a Google spokeswoman in response to the reports. 'Don't fault us though, we enjoy your coverage.' Insurance Solutions at CoverHound president Greg Isaacs agreed that the Meredith Stechbart of Google is now endorsed on the company's insurance license. It's likely the company wants to displace middle men in the industry just as it's done to the shopping business and travel industry . However he added: 'We haven't been acquired' and declined to comment further on any shared plans. Google could meet with pushback in their plans as insurance companies will be reluctant to share information with a potential competitor. Some retailers have also declined to add a 'buy' button for their products to be bought direct from Google pages. As smartphone users are increasingly directed to different company's apps to make purchases, Google is being forced to provide better searches, the Journal notes.","An entity named Google Compare Auto Insurance Services is not licensed to sell insurance in 26 states as well as being authorized to sell policies in one state for six insurers .

"A grandmother who couldn’t remember her children’s names has had her memory fully restored thanks to a new treatment for the brain. Maureen Lansdale was the first person in Europe to receive the pioneering surgery and has now made a complete recovery. The 75-year-old widow was heartbroken when two years ago she started to lose her memory and couldn’t remember her own address or even the names of family members. Maureen Lansdale, 75, is the first person in Europe to have a new memory restoration surgery . At first she thought she could be suffering from dementia but as the pains in her head grew worse and her memory deteriorated, she decided to visit her GP. Mrs Lansdale was quickly transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where she was told she had a vascular malformation – when a vein and artery have incorrectly joined together – affecting her brain, with potentially fatal consequences. But thanks to the pioneering treatment, where the vascular malformation is removed through the nose, Mrs Lansdale’s health and memory have been restored. The grandmother of nine from Telford, Shropshire, who has three daughters and a son, said: ‘I’d suffered for years with terrible headaches that were often so bad I couldn’t lift my head from the pillow. ‘At times I thought my head would explode. The pain became so bad it affected my memory. I forgot who my son was, then my daughter. I thought I was losing my marbles or had a terrible disease. ‘Things came to a head at a birthday party. The music seemed so loud so my son went to ask them to turn it down. When he returned I realised I’d forgotten who he was. I remember saying, ‘‘I know I’m at a party with you and I know you’ve got a sister but I can’t remember her name either’’.’ After an hour the symptoms usually passed, but then kept recurring. Mrs Lansdale recalls visiting her local shop and being unable to remember her way home. She was diagnosed in November 2013, after which NHS surgeons tried to remove the vascular malformation using keyhole surgery, before discovering there was a danger she could have been left blind. ‘The doctors suggested I try a new treatment which meant going through my nose and into my brain to cut out the bits causing me problems,’ Mrs Lansdale said. ‘It sounded scary being the first – but I couldn’t live the way I was living, so I agreed.’ She was referred to consultant neurosurgeon Alessandro Paluzzi who created the procedure where parts of the brain can be removed through the nostrils. He is the first surgeon in Europe to try it. A day after the six-hour operation last July Mrs Lansdale was walking. She was home after a few days. Dr Paluzzi said: ‘Maureen’s abnormality began within the nasal cavity and extended through the base of the skull into the brain. It made sense to approach it from the nose, a much safer route than coming from the top of the head and passing through normal brain. ‘It is the first time that a vascular malformation has been removed through the nose in UK and in Europe. The operation was possible here for the first time due to special endoscopic instruments which were donated by the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham Charity.’ Maureen Lansdale’s vascular malformation, called a dural artero-venous fistula, disrupted the flow of blood to and from the brain. This caused her extreme pain resulting in memory loss, and put her at imminent risk of a fatal brain bleed or stroke. The keyhole surgery doctors tried in order to make the vein and artery work properly involves tiny incisions through the skin and into the brain. But the malformation was so close to the optic nerve there was a danger of blindness. Instead consultant neurosurgeon Alessandro Paluzzi at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital used his procedure to insert tiny endoscopic surgical instruments through the nostrils and sinus cavity to the malformation, and remove it through the nose. Proper blood flow was restored, and the pain and memory loss rectified. A second patient with the same condition has now had the operation at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Mrs Lansdale said: ‘I’ve had the most wonderful thing done for me and I’m so grateful as I wasn’t ready to die. I’ve had a second chance to see my grandchildren grow up, which is the greatest gift anyone could have.’ She is raising money for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham Charity’s Brain Surgery Appeal, and added: ‘I am lucky that I was fixed. I hope many others can benefit too.’ Mrs Lansdale had a vascular malformation, when a vein and artery have incorrectly joined together, that affected her brain.

"At least one in six flowering plants is blooming, with hundreds more in flower than is normal for the time of year. A stunning 368 species of wild plants are in flower when botanical books suggest there should be only 20-30. Daisy and dandelion were the most commonly recorded wild flowers by amateur plant hunters around the country. More exotic species include heliotrope, gorse – found in all areas – and sea campion located on the coast of Anglesey. A wild flowers area in Wisley garden, Surrey. A stunning 368 species of wild plants are in flower when botanical books suggest there should be only 20-30 . Early spring flowering plants include Hazel, Lesser Celandine and Primrose. The findings come from the New Year Plant Hunt run by the Botanical Society of Britain & Ireland. Plant lovers spent up to three hours between 1st and 4th January hunting for wild plants in flower. They compiled 143 lists, of which half contained 20 or more plants in flower. A total of 2,908 records of plants in flower from across Britain and Ireland were submitted, including 368 different species. The most commonly recorded plants were Daisy and Dandelion, each of which was recorded in 115 lists – three-quarters of the total. Only 12 species were recorded in more than half of the lists, and most were only rarely found in flower. Some 160 species were only recorded in flower once, and 60 were only recorded twice. Dr Tim Rich, Plant Hunt co-founder, said ‘368 species in flower is an unprecedented 15 per cent of the flowering plants in Britain and Ireland: the books suggest there should only be 20-30 species in flower. ‘As expected, the mild south and west of Britain had the highest numbers of species still in flower, but we also had lists of over 50 species from the east and north of England, and an amazing 39 flowering in Edinburgh. ‘We thought that the snow and hard frosts before Christmas would have finished most flowering in the north but it seems not to be the case. Plant lovers spent up to three hours between 1st and 4th January hunting for wild plants in flower during the New Year Plant Hunt. The most commonly recorded plants were daisy (pictured) and dandelion . ‘In terms of absolute numbers, Cardiff won with 71 species in flower and Cornwall came second with 70 species in flower’. Co-ordinator Ryan Clark, said ‘It was astonishing to see so many records flooding in, from Guernsey to the Moray Firth and Norfolk to Donegal. ‘As in previous years, it was clear that urban areas tended to have more species in flower than rural areas. 'This is to be expected: there are more sheltered corners and disturbed ground with wild flowers with a short life cycle and high seed production and plants spreading out from gardens. ‘Around one third of the plants in flower proved to be species not native to Britain and Ireland, which may have escaped from gardens or cultivation. 'Plants from warmer climates may be continuing to flower in the mild autumn weather before winter frosts knock them back.’ Dr Rich says there is no suggestion of an early Spring. ‘Only five per cent of the species recorded were spring-flowering native specialists, such as Dog’s Mercury, and half of the records of spring flowering plants were from just three species: Hazel, Lesser Celandine and Primrose’ he added. Dr Sarah Whild, who co-founded the Plant Hunt in 2012, said the total number of species recorded this year was much higher than 222 spotted in 2014, mainly due to an increase in botanists involved. ‘I’m delighted to see the Plant Hunt blossoming and even inspiring other countries to follow suit, with The Netherlands launching their own Plant Hunt this year’ she added. But the blooming numbers don't suggest an early spring. Only five per cent of the species recorded were spring-flowering native specialists .","368 species of wild plants are in flower when there should be only 20-30 .

"It took the supermarket world by storm when it began selling the French delicacy of champagne at slashed prices. Now Lidl is hoping for the same result as it forays into the Scottish market with its new range of cut-price kilts and sporrans. The German supermarket chain, which has become increasingly popular with Britons over the past few years, is offering Scots a Highland Dress outfit for little more than £50. Lidl has launched a Highland Dress range, featuring cut-price kilts, ghillie shirts and leather sporrans . The poly viscose kilt retails at a penny under £30 while a set of children's playable bagpipes are just £12.99. Those who want to add a polyester ghillie shirt can do so for £11.99 – along with a no-frills leather sporran and chain for £9.99. The outfit will be rolled out across 610 UK stories in the run-up to Burns Night on January 25. The chain said it has launched the range following a successful pilot in Scotland in July, ahead of this year's Glasgow Commonwealth Games, which saw stock sell out within a couple of days. During that trial, kilts were £10 cheaper and also three yards shorter - but they now measure the traditional eight yards. Lidl non-food buying manager Josie Stone said: 'This fantastic range, at unbelievably low prices, will give everyone the chance to celebrate Burns Night in proper Scottish style whilst showcasing Scotland's proud heritage and traditions. The leather sporran and chain for £9.99 will be sold in the run-up to Burns Night on January 25 . Traditionalists can also get their hands on a set of playable children's bagpipes for £12.99 . 'Highland wear can often be unaffordable to many, costing hundreds of pounds, so it's great to be able to offer an eight yard kilt for under £30.' The kilt, available in two tartan patters, has a 24in drop and, unravelled, measures eight yards – the exact length of traditional specifications. The discounter said it would also promote Scottish food across its UK network from mid January, including Ben Bracken Blended Malt Scotch Whisky Aged 12 Years for £17.99 and a haggis for 99p. The discounters from the continent have already made the most of their wide-ranging appeal with British shoppers, with Aldi having launched ski and equestrian ranges.

"The 380-pound star of TLC's new reality series My Big Fat Fabulous Life has revealed details about the 'shame and darkness and depression' that she suffered for ten years after a medical condition caused her to gain over 200 pounds in a matter of months. Speaking at the Television Critics Association winter press tour earlier this week, where she was promoting her upcoming series, Whitney Thore, 30, from Greensboro, North Carolina, explained that, while she is now able to embrace her larger size, her obesity initially caused her more than a decade of emotional suffering. 'I lived in so much shame and darkness and depression for over a decade that I wasted 10 years of my life, and it wasn’t until I finally learned that I had to love myself regardless,' the former cheerleader said. Scroll down for video . 'So much shame and darkness': Whitney Thore, 30, spoke candidly about her struggle to come to terms with her obesity at the Television Critics Association winter press tour earlier this week . Family affair: Whitney's new TLC reality series My Big Fat Fabulous Life also stars her parents, Glenn (far left) and Barbara (far right) Thore, and her close friend Tal Fish (right) 'I have to claim my joy and my happiness, because there are people out there who don’t want me to be happy, but I have one life.' Whitney hopes that her upcoming reality series will help her to change the way in which society views obesity - and enable other larger people to embrace their own body image. 'Obesity in America is such an issue that no one wants to talk about, and it’s filled with so much shame that even my family and my friends, nobody said anything. 'And I was too ashamed to say anything, so if we could speak a little bit more candidly about obesity, which is something that I hope My Big Fat Fabulous Life will accomplish.' She added: 'I think that fat prejudice is one of the last socially acceptable prejudices that we have in America, and I think that’s really a shame because if you want to pursue a life of happiness and health, you can’t do it when you hate yourself. Dance it out: While the former cheerleader no longer dances herself, she teaches movement classes for other men and women . TLC initially approached Whitney to take part in the reality series after a video of her dancing to a song by popstar Jason Derulo on YouTube hit headlines around the world; to date it has received more than six million views. But behind the entertaining footage, which sees Whitney showcase a variety of energetic and spirited dance moves, the new reality show also documents the dance instructor's emotional journey to find happiness in herself. At the age of 19, Whitney was a normal-sized prom queen in high school but began gaining weight rapidly in college. At age 23 she was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, a hormonal issue that can result in weight gain and difficulty in taking it off. It was a challenging time emotionally, she said. Whitney gave up dancing, one of her favorite activities, because she was concerned about how she looked and what people would say about her. The pursuit of happiness: Whitney has now learned to embrace her size rather than wasting time hating herself . She heard plenty of remarks, and still does. But Whitney decided not to let others rule her life and as a sign of her new-found confidence, she posted the video of herself dancing to Derulo's hit single 'Talk Dirty To Me' online. Now Whitney is enjoying a whirlwind promotional tour for My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which also features her parents and her friend, Tal Fish. She's not only dancing again, but is instead teaching a class in dancing. In one scene from the show, she talks tearfully to her students about how she overcame a reluctance to put herself out there in that way. 'People are either inspired by the fact that I'm dancing or they're very put off,' she said. Whitney said she hopes the series encourages people to speak more candidly about obesity.","Whitney Thore put on more than 200lbs in a matter of months after developing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)

"David Cameron will seek to secure the release of the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay during talks with Barack Obama, sources have revealed. The Prime Minister is expected to travel to the White House this month, his last scheduled encounter with the US President before May’s General Election. Aides said he would raise the plight of Shaker Aamer, who has been held in Guantanamo without charge for almost 13 years. Prime Minister David Cameron (right) will seek to secure the release of the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay during talks with Barack Obama, sources have revealed. Aides said he would raise the plight of Shaker Aamer, who has been held in Guantanamo without charge for almost 13 years . Mr Aamer, a Saudi citizen, has resident status in the UK, and his British wife and four children, the youngest of whom he has never met, live in South London. Paul Lewis, the Pentagon’s special envoy on Guantanamo, said the US administration was now ‘aggressively pursuing the transfer’ of the controversial detention camp’s remaining inmates. Mr Aamer was cleared for release from the prison by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by President Obama in 2009. The Prime Minister is expected to travel to the White House this month, his last scheduled encounter with the US President Barack Obama before May’s General Election . Paul Lewis, the Pentagon’s special envoy on Guantanamo, said the US administration was now ‘aggressively pursuing the transfer’ of the controversial detention camp’s remaining inmates . He has not faced a trial or been charged with a crime, despite his long detention. He was sent to Guantanamo in 2002 after being picked up in Afghanistan. The US says he was an ally of Osama bin Laden, a claim he denies. Government sources said his case was raised by the Foreign Office with US Secretary of State John Kerry last year, and will be discussed by Mr Cameron and Mr Obama during the Prime Minister’s visit to Washington. ‘We are not expecting immediate release but we will be seeing whether they can look at this case with more urgency,’ said one. US officials say 28 inmates were released last year from the facility in Cuba, the largest number since Mr Obama took office in 2009. The detention centre was opened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the US to hold ‘enemy combatants’ in what the US called a war on terror. The US president has pledged to close the controversial prison, but his efforts have been delayed by resistance in the US Congress. Of the remaining 127 inmates at Guantanamo Bay, half have been approved for transfer to other countries. Mr Aamer’s release is understood to have been held up because US authorities have cleared him for release to Saudi Arabia, but not the UK, despite him being resident in this country. British officials, however, are seeking to persuade the US that they can address any concerns about a return to London. Last month, five men held for more than a decade were sent to Kazakhstan for resettlement. The three Yemenis and two Tunisians had been captured in Pakistan and were suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda. US officials said the men, who were also not charged, no longer posed a threat. The human rights organisation Amnesty International has started a petition demanding the release of Mr Aamer, describing his detention without charge as a scandal. UK director Kate Allen said: ‘We need the UK Government to definitively establish what the blockage over his release actually is – this terrible farce has gone on long enough.’ Cori Crider, of the campaign group Reprieve, who is also Mr Aamer’s lawyer, said: ‘Shaker has been cleared for release twice and has a country – and beloved family – ready and waiting for his return. ‘If we are to believe that the US-UK relationship is as special as the Prime Minister claims, he must secure Shaker’s release.’ Mr Cameron has been urged to raise Mr Aamer’s case by MPs from across the political spectrum, while a number of celebrities have backed a campaign to secure his release, including Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

'Many communities are witnessing them struggling to stay in business and everybody has memories of visiting them when they were thriving. 'Because of the memories we share of visiting spaces like this in the not terribly distant past, abandoned malls can be an eerie presence.

"After years of sticking to its signature, small handsets, Apple finally gave in to demand and launched two phablet-style iPhones in September. But as phones increase in size, the screens become harder to use - especially when trying to navigate or type with one hand. To see how phones measure up to the average hand size, designers created a graphic that reveals the 'natural' and 'unreachable' thumb zones of four of the most popular handsets from Apple and Samsung. The graphic (pictured) was created by California-based technology professionals site Experts Exchange. It compares the average hand measurements of men and women, as well as the hand size of sports figures such as Lebron James. The hand size of Robert Wadlow, dubbed Giant of Illinois, was also included . This included the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and Samsung's Galaxy S5 and Note 4. The graphic was created by technology professionals site Experts Exchange. 'Smartphones have continued to increase in size but our hands have not. Have you ever wondered how big your hand needs to be to easily reach the entire screen with one hand?,' explained the California-based site. In December, a study found that smartphones have become so integral to modern life, they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain, according to new research. Experts found that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs. They think that the more time someone spends fiddling with their smartphone, the bigger the link between brain and hand. Neuroscientist Dr Arko Ghosh, who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use, said our ‘newfound obsession’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances. ‘We ran some calculations for the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4, then compared that to several athletes.’ According to the graphic, the average woman is 5ft 4in (1.6 metres), with an average hand height of 6.7 inches (17.1cm) and width of 2.9 inches (7.3cm). While the average man is 5ft 9.5in (1.6 metres), with an average hand height of 7.4 inches (18.8cm) and width of 3.3 inches (8.3cm). Apple’s iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch (12cm) screen. The Samsung Galaxy S5's display is 5.1 inches (13cm), the iPhone 6 Plus’ screen measures 5.5 inches (14cm) and the Galaxy Note 4’s display is 5.7 inches (14.5cm). To put this into perspective, retired basketball player Shaquille O’Neal could use the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S5 comfortably, but Michael Jordan would struggle with the S5. Even Lebron James, who is 6ft 7in tall can't use Apple or Samsung's flagship phones comfortably with one hand. The only person who could comfortably use the iPhone 6 Plus and Galaxy Note 4 is Robert Wadlow - also known as the Giant of Illinois. Mr Wadlow was 8ft 11.1in (2.72 metres) tall and died in 1940. According to the graphic, the average woman is 5ft 4in (1.6 metres), with an average hand height of 6.7 inches (17.1cm) and width of 2.9 inches (7.3cm). Apple’s iPhone 6 (left) has a 4.7-inch (12cm) screen. The graphic reveals the ‘natural’ thumb zone (green), the 'reach' zone in yellow and the 'unreachable' zone in red . The Samsung Galaxy S5's (pictured left) display is 5.1 inches (13cm). The right-hand image shows the average thumb zones for the average woman and man when using the Galaxy S5 . To use the iPhone 6 with one hand, the graphic shows that a user would need to have a hand that measures 9.6 inches (24.3cm) high, and 4.6inches (11.7cm) wide. This increases to 11.4 (29cm) inches and 5.5 inches (14cm) for the iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Note 4. Using these measurements, the graphic then reveals the ‘natural’ thumb zone for all four handsets, for the average hand size of both sexes. The iPhone 6 Plus’ screen (left) is 5.5 inches (14cm) and the Galaxy Note 4’s (right) is 5.7 inches (14.5cm) To use the iPhone 6 with one hand, the graphic shows that a user would need to have a hand that measures 9.6 inches (24.3cm) high, and 4.6inches (11.7cm) wide. This increases to 11.4 (29cm) inches and 5.5 inches (14cm) for the iPhone 6 Plus (left) and Galaxy Note 4 (right) It also shows the so-called ‘reach zone’ in yellow, and in red are the areas that the thumb can’t comfortably reach. Apple is aware of this issue and introduced a Reachability feature for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which is activated by rubbing a thumb over the Touch ID scanner. This brings the app icons nearer to the bottom of the screen to make them easier to reach. A Japanese company has also devised an extension for the thumb that lets people access the entire screen while holding the phone in one hand. Tokyo-based Thanko's thumb-shaped style, called the Yubi Nobiiru - which translates to ‘finger growth’ - retails for £8.51 ($13.63). Made of silicon, the fake digit weighs 0.024lbs (11g) and is hollow inside so it can be worn on a thumb or finger. At its tip is a small black conductor, which ensures that modern touchscreens can register it when it makes contact. To put this into perspective, retired basketball player Shaquille O’Neal (left) could use the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S5 comfortably, but Michael Jordan would struggle with the S5. Even Lebron James (pictured right), who is 6ft 7in tall can't use Apple or Samsung's flagship phones comfortably with one hand .

Mr Wadlow was 8ft 11.1in (2.72 metres) tall and died in 1940 . Wearing the extender means that, with one hand, most people will be able to access the entirety of a phone screen with one hand. In December, a study found that smartphones have become so integral to modern life, they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain, according to new research. Experts found that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs.

Neuroscientist Dr Arko Ghosh, who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use, said our ‘newfound obsession’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances. The iPhone 6 Plus is 7.78cm (3.06 inches) wide, while other large phones include the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which is 7.92cm (3.12) inches wide. Of course, that’s just from side-to-side - diagonally the 6 Plus is 14cm (5.5 inches), and the Note 3 is 14.5cm (5.7 inches). The average male thumb is 6.96cm (2.74) inches long and for women it’s 6.32cm (2.49 inches). Clearly this poses a problem, as the average thumb cannot stretch from one side of a phone to the other without part of the palm touching the screen, which can accidentally register an input. Using the Yubi Nobiiru thumb extender, though, 0.6inches (1.5 cm) is added to the length of the thumb. This means people can more easily reach from side of the phone to the other - as long as they don’t mind wearing the extender.

"As Cate Blanchett gets set to star in the upcoming remake of the 1950s Disney fairytale, Cinderella, she is looking younger than ever. So what's the secret behind the 45-year-old star's timeless looks and healthy glow? The Australian actress has revealed that she swears by the power of emu oil for keeping her skin in check as she opens her make-up bag for FEMAIL. Scroll down for video . Australian actress Cate Blanchett, 45, has opened her beauty bag for FEMAIL and shared the secrets behind her timeless look as she poses in her new beauty campaign . Speaking about the peculiar lotion, she said: 'I tend to use really basic creams, and I like to put anoil on, like an emu oil from Australia. It’s from the emu and it’s really nourishing. I prefer an oil to a cream.' ‘In indigenous Australian culture, that’s the first oil they put on a baby because it’s so hydrating,’ she also told Refinery 29. ‘It’s all pretty basic.’ The product is made from oil taken from the fatty tissue on an emu's back and has been used by Aborigines for thousands of years for its powerful soothing properties. It is thought to be a natural anti-inflammatory. A study at Victoria University in Melbourne showed a significant reduction in pain in subjects with osteoarthritis in their hands with either application or ingestion of emu oil. The Hollywood stalwart says she's picked up some vital beauty habits from her years in the industry and has been using SK-II products, for which she is the face of, for 13 years . Emu oil, right, is made from oil taken from the fatty tissue on an emu's back and has been used by Aborigines for thousands of years for its powerful soothing properties. Beyonce, left, is said to be a fan of the lotion, which has also been praised by Oprah Winfrey . Cate swears by it for treating scars and sunburn and Oprah Winfrey, Charlize Theron, Beyonce, Demi Moore and even Zac Efron are also reported fans. Cate, who is the ambassador for beauty brand SK-II, shared her day-to-day skincare tips. She said: 'I drink hot water with lemon. Everyone says, “Try this” or “Try that”, but they all come back to basic principles. They all come back to hydrating, drinking enough water and making sure you don’t eat over-processed food. 'The other thing that’s really bad for your gut and skin, and really bad for your mind, is stress levels. Anything you can do to reduce your stress levels - which is hard if you’re under economic pressure or in relationship pressure - those things take a toll on you and your skin. 'But anything you could do to ease that part of your life will have an impact. How you feel affects how you look.' The Hollywood stalwart, who has won countless awards, says she's picked up some vital beauty habits from her years in the industry. She swears by not overplucking her eyebrows, and when it comes to make-up, finding the right foundation that works with her moisturiser is essential, she says. Cate, pictured, left, in May 2014, and, right, in the late 90s, seemingly hasn't aged a day. So what's her secret? Hot water and lemon, hydration and a regimented skincare regime . 'I’ve gotten very quick and easy about [my beauty regime]. I don’t think about it a lot. I don’t wear a lot of makeup during my everyday life - I would for a character - but it’s all about making sure your skin is clean. 'For me, the thing I’ll never give up is my skincare. I’ve also learnt how highlighting can change your face. I’m also not faddish about it, so it hasn’t really changed that much to be honest. I use the SK-II LXP Ultimate Perfecting Essence, Serum and Cream and I cleanse, and I get up and do the same thing,' she said. The blonde beauty also opened up about ageing gracefully, admitting: 'Whenever I have those days - and we all have them - and I go “Oh, I don’t like this bit or that bit”, I always have to ask myself what it is and that’s what I have to work on. 'We’re all getting older, there’s no point panicking about it, you just try to look as good as you can at whatever age you are.' Cate revealed that working out and meditating more will be at the top of her priorities list this month . She continued: 'I really subscribe to the Asian philosophy that in order for something to be perfect, it needs to contain its grain of imperfection. 'In Japan for instance, when a plate breaks, they’ll put it back together but they’ll put gold along the cracks – they’ll celebrate the crack. Whereas in the West, I feel like we’re always trying to pretend the crack’s not there or throw it away and get another one. 'I think we should throw out the notion of trying to attain all that perfection that isn’t possible. We should try to be better but we should celebrate who we are and what we have. I certainly wasn’t born with incredible skin but I worked with what I’d been given.' Discussing her New Year's resolutions, she revealed that working out is at the top of her priorities list. 'I’m so regular with my skincare, so I’d love to get regular with my exercise too because it always goes out the window,' she said. 'If I don’t do something in the morning then I don’t get it done because then the day takes over. And often it does take over for one thing or another. 'I’ve so many friends who have incorporated the idea of meditating at some point during the day, so I would love that. There’re so many apps now and the world can get so noisy; we’re so addicted to being busy. I would really love to find that 15 minutes a day to just be still and quiet.' It seems that Cate may find it difficult to find some downtime  over the coming months thanks to her new movie role alongside Helena Bonham Carter. Helena, 48, who recently split from her director husband, Tim Burton, plays the kooky Fairy Godmother in Cinderalla, while Cate plays the menacing evil stepmother. In the recently released international trailer for the movie, Bonham Carter, armed with a pumpkin and a few mice, swaps her trademark black curls for a bright blonde hairdo while Blanchett is transforms into a redhead. Blanchett taps into her sinister side as she's transformed into the stepmother, following in the footsteps of fellow wicked queens Charlize Theron and Julia Roberts. The mother-of-two is the picture of nonchalant villainy as she is seen scouring at any given opportunity alongside the ugly stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella, played by English actress Holliday Grainger and Downton Abbey star Sophie McShera. Kenneth Branagh directs the recreation which will hit theatres on March 13, 2015.","Cate, 45, loves emu oil, which has been used by Aborigines for years .

"Three caesarean sections had taken their toll on the body of Suzie Adams, 39, leaving her overweight and self-conscious about her sagging stomach. But when the Somerset mother flew to the Czech Republic for a cut-price tummy tuck, the consequences were worse than she could ever have imagined. Far from getting the flat tummy she had always longed for, Ms Adams was subjected to a botch job that left her badly scarred and attached to a shunt for six months. Botched: Suzie Adams, 39, from Somerset, was left in agony following a badly bungled tummy tuck . Unhappy: Suzie had been embarrassed about her flabby tummy - the result of three pregnancies . Now Ms Adams, who has since had much of the damage repaired in the UK, has warned of the dangers of travelling abroad for surgery and says she was left feeing like a 'walking, living freak'. 'I've got three children, I had three caesarean sections with them and I had this roll of fat that I didn't like - like an apron of skin,' she explains. 'I looked around the UK and there was nothing I could afford. They were asking from £8,000 upwards really.' Desperate to get rid of the flabby tummy that was making her self-conscious, she decided to look abroad. 'I found this company in Prague and they were a lot cheaper,' she explains. 'Prices were anything from £1,500 to £3,000 really.' Beguiled by the prospect of a cheap tummy tuck, Ms Adams packed her bags and flew to the Czech capital. But soon, she realised things weren't quite as they seemed. 'The accommodation I was supposed to have gone into wasn't ready so they dumped me in a hotel,' she remembers. 'It was at that point I realised it was going to go wrong.' Despite her qualms, she decided to go ahead with the surgery. 'They took me into see the surgeon,' she says. 'Communication between us was difficult but the agreement was, he was going to cut me from right to left, one scarring, tighten up the stomach muscles, end of story.' But when she woke up, she was appalled by the results. Not only had the surgeon cut right to left, he had also cut top to bottom from her belly button down. 'I was horrified because it was not what we agreed,' she reveals. 'They didn't explain why. They just said they had to.' After 10 days recuperating in Prague, Ms Adams flew home. But things were about to get even worse. Already suffering from excruciating stomach pain, she had to be rushed to hospital after her scar burst open and a mysterious, painful lump appeared on her side. Doctors said her skin was no longer attached to her stomach muscles and discovered that the wound had become badly infected. Roll: Ms Adams hated the roll of fat left around her middle following three pregnancies . Damage: She had to be rushed to hospital after her scar burst open and became badly infected . Scarred: The scars left by the infection and the botched surgery left her feeling like 'a walking, talking freak' 'They said they had never seen anything like this before,' recounts a horrified Ms Adams. 'Injuries like this normally come through gunshot wounds - not surgery. 'They then turned round and told me I'd have to have a vacuum pump so they could heal me from the inside out.' She was attached to the pump for 24 hours a day for the next six months. When it was finally removed, her scars were worse than ever and the lump hadn't gone away. 'I hated looking in the mirror,' she admits. 'I didn't even like my partner seeing it. But I forced myself to look in the mirror to remind me of the stupid mistake I made by going over there. 'I was a walking, living freak.' Eventually, two years after the bungled operation that almost destroyed her life, Ms Adams decided to take action and travelled to Norwich to see surgeon Elaine Sassoon. Big improvement: Ms Adams has now had a second operation to fix the damage and restore her confidence . Having gained weight due to the upset caused by the failed tummy tuck, Ms Adams was told she needed to lose a stone and a half before she could even be considered for an operation. Astonishingly, she managed to lose the weight in just 10 weeks and finally went under the knife to have the damage repaired. During the lengthy operation, Dr Sassoon was forced to remove 626g of tissue, including internal scar tissue and the lump itself. She also fixed the scars that left Ms Adams hating her body and completed the tummy tuck the Czech surgeon had botched. 'It's been a long emotional road,' says Ms Adams, who is delighted with her new-look stomach. 'It's the end of a book and a new chapter is opening for me. 'I have so much more confidence than I ever had before. It is what I should have had in the first place.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A woman gave birth to a 10 pound baby girl less than one hour after discovering she was pregnant. Katie Kropas, 23, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, was admitted to hospital for an ultrasound on Tuesday, after complaining of severe stomach cramps and back pain, only to be told by doctors that she was actually nine months pregnant and ready to give birth at any minute. 'I ended up having an ultrasound and with that they were like, ""You're full term and giving birth now"", she told local news channel NECN. Scroll down for video . A sweet surprise: Katie Kropas, 23, was told that she was expecting a baby just one hour before giving birth . New mother: The catering supervisor welcomed her 10-pound baby girl Ellen Olivia on Tuesday . Baby weight: Katie, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, thought that she had put on a few pounds over Christmas and had no idea that the extra weight was actually an indication she was pregnant . 'I found out at 10.15, I had the baby at 11.06.' The new mother admits she 'doesn't know' how the pregnancy went unnoticed - but insists she was using birth control right up until her daughter, Ellen Olivia, was born and had even been having regular monthly cycles. Although she confessed she had put on some weight and noticed her feet had become swollen, she put it was down to a combination of over-indulgence during the holiday period and too many hours spent on her feet while working as a catering supervisor. 'At the time, I was like this has got to be a joke but, I had no idea what to think,' she added. 'I don't know, I wish I had a better answer but I think that being on my feet all the time for work, and Christmas is so busy as it is, it just caught everything off guard.' Mother and baby: Despite the surprise, the young mom is loving her new role . 'I didn't know what to think': The news of the pregnancy was a complete surprise to Katie and her boyfriend . After discovering his girlfriend was expecting, Katie's long-term boyfriend rushed to get hold of her mother so that she could be there to support her daughter as she welcomed a child of her own. '[He said to me]: ""Katie's nine months pregnancy and we didn't know she was having a baby""' new grandmother Karen Kropas said. 'And I said ha ha ha, put Katie on the phone and he was like, ""Karen, this is serious, how soon can you get here?""' She added that, while she had heard stories similar to that of her daughter in the past, she had never really taken them seriously. After seeing it happen to her own child however, she urged others to recognize that 'it is real and true and it happens'. 'This is just the beginning': Despite the initial shock, Katie admitted that she and her boyfriend are 'having a lot of fun' being parents . 'It happens': Katie's mother Karen said that she had never thought situations like this were possible, but having seen it with her own eyes, she is urging others to accept that surprise pregnancies 'are real' Professional opinion: South Shore Hospital's Dr Kim Dever said that it is not uncommon for first time mothers to be unaware of what some might see as obvious signs that they are pregnant . Indeed, one of Katie's doctors at the South Shore Hospital in South Weymouth explained that first-time mothers often don't know what symptoms to look for in a pregnancy and can often miss what some people might consider to be the most obvious signs. 'They aren't perceiving those symptoms,' Dr Kim Dever said. 'Whereas when you're on the lookout for them, you're waiting for it to happen.' The family are now preparing to settle three-day-old Ellen Olivia in at home - but first have to rush out and buy all of the essentials for their new daughter, from a crib to diapers. And despite the initial shock at finding out about the surprise pregnancy, Katie and her long-term boyfriend are overwhelmed with joy at the new addition to their family.

"This is the dramatic moment a herd of elephants rush to the rescue of a baby elephant trapped in a mud pool. The youngster had become stuck in the tranquil watering hole along with a nyala antelope in Tembe Elephant Park, Southern Mozambique. But the quiet atmosphere was shattered when the herd realises the baby elephant is stuck. With a trumpeting of their trunks, the herd of elephants rush to rescue the trapped calf . The young elephants had earlier been playing around in the mud with their parents . Frantically trumpeting at full blast the herd en-masse dashes to help, desperately bundling the baby up and out of the mud pit. The chaotic scenes were captured by Chris Vaughan-Jones, 21, during a leisurely 4x4 drive with two American tourists. He said: 'We were at a quiet little water hole and there was absolute silence other than birds and grass hoppers There probably wasn't another human for 50km. But as the seniors got out of the mud bath, the calves found the route out somewhat difficult . After a cry for help, ten elephants rush to rescue the calf, sadly trampling to death a nyala who was also there . Then the elephants all started trumpeting at full blast, which was a shock to suddenly have this tranquil water hole turned into a chaotic scene with 10 trumpeting elephants. 'I saw this situation panning out and knew something was going to happen, as the elephants hadn't become aware of the nyala until one of the babies actually flops its trunk onto it. 'We all felt very lucky to have seen this but at the same time scared. 'Seeing that we were about to go down and free the nyala just before the elephants arrived, we knew that could have been us being trampled to death.' The elephants were forced to share their mud bath with a nyala, who wasn't fazed at first . But as the adult elephants rushed in to save their young, the nyala escape route was sadly blocked . Tragically the nyala was fatally trampled by the elephant herd as they tried to rescue their young. Chris added: 'After a minute of awed silence that followed the chaos, while we watched the elephants, we all knew we had just seen something that not may people have ever seen. 'We knew the whole event only took one to two minutes and if we had either driven passed the water hole or had arrived a few minutes later we would have been non the wiser that anything had ever happened. 'We waited around for 15 minutes watching the elephants and in the hope the nyala would get up, but after a while we knew it was dead.'","Elephants were pictured enjoying a mud bath in Southern Mozambique .

"As the owner of a food shop, Sarah Lemon was constantly surrounded by temptation - and saw her weight balloon to 27 stone 7lb. The 43-year-old, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, spent years overeating and snacking on the treats that she sells at her upmarket delicatessen, resulting in the pounds piling on. However, the final straw came in 2013 when Sarah realised her size 30 frame would not fit into a plane seat, and she changed her eating habits - and lost half her body weight in just 18 months.

Mother-of-two Sarah, pictured at her heaviest, had been overweight since childhood, which she attributed to emotionally-motivated binge eating . She's now shed more than half her body weight and plummeted 18 dress sizes to a size 12-14 and tips the scales at 12st 6lb. The weight loss has been so dramatic that people no longer recognise her - especially customers coming into her Lots Of Lemons shop in Cheltenham. She said: 'About six months ago one elderly customer asked me very sternly ""What happened to that other very stout girl that used to work here?"" 'I replied with a very big smile: ""That’s me ma’am!"". ""Well I never,"" she replied whilst reeling backwards!' Mother-of-two Sarah had been overweight since childhood, which she attributed to emotionally-motivated binge eating. 'Looking back, food has been my crutch and my drug of choice for my entire life and I had reached an enormous weight,' she said. 'Never have I wanted to be fat, even at my darkest points and my deepest binges. 'I hated the way food controlled me and dictated my life, from the clothes I wore to how I felt about myself. I felt useless and pathetic and a complete failure.' At the beginning of 2013, her doctor recommended fitting a gastric band after her BMI hit 60 - twice the obese level of 30. But she says the produce in her shop was easier to resist once she decided to shed the pounds. 'Following a diet plan made it easier for me to work in the deli - because I couldn’t make any decisions about what I was eating,' she said. 'Before that, it was lethal. It was just too easy to have a snack in the deli. I did not once - in one year - have one thing I wasn’t meant to have. I didn’t put a piece of ham off the slicer into my mouth, I didn’t take a biscuit out of the jar.' The weight loss has been so dramatic people have stopped recognising her, even customers from her deli . Now she is off her strict plan, Sarah has a light breakfast of half a grapefruit and a piece of toast, a Cambridge product for lunch and whatever the family is having for dinner. But Sarah does not feel the battle with her weight is over. 'I feel scared that I will go back there one day,' she said. 'It terrifies me. But I am incredibly grateful that I found tools to fix a problem I made. I am slimmer, healthier and happier with myself than I have been in over 25 years.'

"Spoon thieves are getting a chance to redeem themselves and get a free plate of food at the same time. Mexican restaurant Wahaca is offering an amnesty to light-fingered diners who keep stealing their spoons by giving away tacos for the safe return of their colourful cutlery. The street food chain is giving people until the end of January to recoup some of the 4,000 spoons stolen each year. The restaurant chain, which has 16 outlets in London, has just opened an outlet in Cardiff . But those returning spoons on 1 February will not be eligible for free food. Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2005 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, has outlets in 16 London locations and one in in Cardiff. The company is offering a free bowl of tacos to any customer willing to walk into one of their restaurants and hand back their sought after brightly coloured plastic spoons. The amnesty was first launched in  2012. The restaurant has since recovered approximately 100 spoons a year since they started offering food for spoons. Wahaca spokesperson Oli Ingham, 32, said to MailOnline: 'What we tend to find is that people are more nervous at the very beginning of the year. 'A trickle come in the beginning and when they find that we really are forgiving them, more start coming towards the end of the month.' Every year, Mexican restaurant Wahaca has 4,000 of its colourful spoons stolen from its restaurants . According to Mr Ingham, the first couple of years were slow. But he is expecting a better response this time round. 'We are expecting it to be a lot higher this year. People seems to be getting behind the idea each time we do it and we try to spread the word a little further around every time.' The Mexican standoff has led to Wanted posters being put up online by the street food company. The posters state: 'Sure, they're irresistibly bright and some say ergonomically perfect. True, there's no finer ladle for your last mouthful, but please, PLEASE can we have them back? Cardiff assistant general manager Rebecca Jones said: 'Four thousand people a year steal our spoons because they are quite fun and different. The amnesty was first launched in 2012. The restaurant has since recovered approximately 100 spoons a year since they started offering food for spoons . 'We remain convinced that the good customers of Wahaca wouldn't pocket anything underhandedly, and reassure ourselves at every stockcount, that most of our spoons are simply being borrowed. 'Which is why we're giving you another chance to seek absolution, by joining the Mexican Spoon Amnesty this January.' To receive a free plate of tacos customers  who visit the restaurant in January simply have to return any stolen spoons to their waiter before ordering. But those who try to return the cutlery in February will not be entertained. 'It's a one month only  amnesty. Our love has its limits,' Mr Ingham said. 'Those who are more honest and haven't stolen spoons can still get free food,' he continued. 'They just have to sketch a cutlery crime fighting souperhero, snap and share their #SpoonCartoon online to enter.'","Wahaca restaurant amnesty held throughout January .

"President Barack Obama wants publicly funded community college available to all Americans, a sweeping proposal that would make higher education as accessible as a high school diploma to boost weak U.S. wages and skills for the modern workforce. The initiative's price tag has yet to be revealed, and it faces a Republican Congress averse to big new spending programs. But it will likely be a centerpiece of Obama's State of the Union Address in a week and a half. But the White House tweeted on Thursday that 'President Obama's plan could save a full-time student an average of $3,800/year in tuition.' If all 50 states were to participate – they would have to pick up the tab for one-quarter of the tuition cost – the idea could benefit up to 9 million students, the White House officials said in a fact sheet Friday morning. Those figures could be costly, adding up to $34 billion per year, provided Congress green-lights the proposal. Scroll down for video . The White House crowed about a community-college access plan on Thursday and Friday, boasting that it could give 'free' education to 9 million students . President Barack Obama's Facebook video announcing the plan drew a stunning 5.7 million views in its first 18 hours . Obama was promoting the idea in a visit Friday to Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tennessee, and in a video message posted to Facebook Thursday evening. 'Put simply, what I'd like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who is willing to work for it,' Obama said in the video, which attracted 5.7 million viewers in less than 18 hours. He spoke seated on the front of his desk from his office aboard Air Force One, in the midst of a three-day tour to preview the agenda he'll be outlining in his Jan. 20 in the State of the Union address. 'It's something that we can accomplish, and it's something that will train our work force so that we can compete with anybody in the world,' Obama said. Administration officials on a conference call with reporters Thursday evening said the funding details would come out later with the president's budget next month. Students would qualify if they attend at least half-time, maintain a 2.5 GPA and make progress toward completing a degree or certificate program. Participating schools would have to meet certain academic requirements. The idea got a chilly response from House Speaker John Boehner's office. 'With no details or information on the cost, this seems more like a talking point than a plan,' said spokesman Cory Fritz. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama proposed universal preschool, which Congress did not take up because of cost. Obama policy adviser Cecilia Munoz pointed out that even without federal action, many states are taking up the idea and expanding preschool. And she pointed out that a Republican – Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam – last year signed into law a pioneering scholarship program that provides free community and technical college tuition for two years. It has drawn 58,000 applicants, almost 90 percent of the state's high school seniors. Munoz said Obama's proposal was inspired by the popular Tennessee plan and a similar program in Chicago. Tennessee Republican Rep. Diane Black said her state's plan, called Tennessee Promise, is paid mostly with lottery funds, while the federal funding source for Obama's plan is unclear and states will have to pay something. 'Ultimately, any efforts to reboot Tennessee Promise as a one-size-fits-all nationwide approach will be met with heavy skepticism from Congress,' Black said. President Barack Obama spoke at Central High School, on Thursday in Phoenix about the recovering housing sector; he will address his community college plan Friday in Tennessee . Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, a former education secretary who is set to take over the Senate committee that oversees education, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But he planned to join Obama Friday aboard Air Force One, along with fellow Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker. Obama was being joined on the Tennessee visit by Vice President Joe Biden. They also planned to visit a manufacturing facility, Techmer PM in Clinton, Tennessee, to promote a second proposal to create a fund to help low-wage workers with high potential get training in growing fields like energy, information technology and advanced manufacturing.","White House will likely make proposal a centerpiece of the president's State of the Union Address on Jan. 20 .

"He was a smooth-talking, self-made celebrity tailor with a champagne lifestyle to match. Leslie Danso kitted out his famous clients for red carpet film premieres, TV shows and society weddings. He posed for pictures with actor Idris Elba and his customers included former England footballer Emile Heskey and ex-Premier League star Fabrice Muamba. Many received free clothes in return for the publicity that their appearances in the spotlight inevitably created. But none of them knew that, behind his smiles, Danso was a ruthless fraudster and illegal immigrant who used false identities to rent properties across the capital – which were turned into underworld drug dens. Leslie Danso (right), 39, poses with actor Idris Elba. The Qumi Couture proprietor's famous clients included former England footballer Emile Heskey and ex-Premier League star Fabrice Muamba . Danso poses with customer Emile Heskey (left). Police raided safe-houses rented by Danso and found crack cocaine, heroin, cannabis, cash and ammunition . His boutique near London’s Tower Bridge was a vanity venture funded by his life of crime, and he even fraudulently leased six top-of-the-range BMWs. The Ghanaian now faces being deported – for the second time – after he was jailed for fraud and using counterfeit documents. Scotland Yard remains unsure if Danso is his true identity, and believes that many of his victims have yet to come forward. Danso, 39, posed as the dapper proprietor of Qumi Couture, a bespoke menswear store. On his website, he described himself as ‘ever the sharp dresser’ and ‘a man going places’. His shop outfitted clients for racing at Ascot and gala dinners, and his tailoring even featured in the pages of GQ Magazine. But it all collapsed after police uncovered a chain of drug safe-houses rented in false names across south-east London. The illegal immigrant fraudster also posed with The Only Way Is Essex star Jamie Reed . In 2013 they found two flats in Rotherhithe rented under the fake names George Branson and Adam Smith. At one, they found crack cocaine, heroin, cannabis, cash and ammunition, and at the second a man was caught red-handed cutting up heroin. Investigators learned that Danso had rented both flats and also used the names Kevin Walters and Kevin Reece. Danso was jailed for 14 months after admitting 11 counts of fraud and manufacturing and possession of false documents . Eventually, police linked him to at least eight safe-houses in central London and affluent suburbs such as Sidcup and Bexleyheath. Last May he was arrested at his luxury four-bedroom home in Dartford, Kent, where his designer clothes filled the entire loft conversion. The same day, officers found cash and more than a kilo of heroin and crack at a flat he rented in Bermondsey. Danso came to Britain in 1999, but was thrown out in 2008 in a deal struck by prosecutors after he was arrested over credit card fraud. He returned just months later and set up Qumi, first as a designer and later as a director. Danso failed to pay rent and bills at the rented properties, including his Tower Bridge showroom. Some were stripped bare, and their fittings may have been sold on eBay or shipped abroad. Photographs found on his computer suggest Danso bought properties in Ghana. Victims said that he was ‘well-educated, smooth-talking and arrogant’, and he begged police not to tell anyone about his arrest – while boasting that other inmates in Belmarsh Prison were in ‘awe’ of his clothes. DC Jenny Woodward, who led the inquiry, said she had no doubt that other victims have yet to come forward. She said: ‘He clearly lived the life. He loved flash cars and opening events. He was very proud that he did the tailoring for the wedding of a famous footballer.’ Danso claimed he did not know the rented flats were used to store drugs, and was not charged with any offences linked to the raids. But he was jailed for 14 months after admitting 11 counts of fraud and manufacturing and possession of false documents at a hearing last month. The judge at Woolwich Crown Court ordered two counts of theft to remain on file. His cousin Manfred Gaisie, 34, of Stirling, admitted three counts of fraud and was handed 140 hours of community service. Two other men, both 27, were jailed for three years for drugs offences.","Leslie Danso, 39, kitted out famous clients  as proprietor for Qumi Couture .

"Millions of people have been feeling the arctic chill this week as America's deep freeze continues. And one Minnesota resident decided to show just how cold it is - by jumping on a frozen trampoline. Nathan Ziegler filmed himself clearing snow off his trampoline, before spraying two layers of water over it. After it froze, he then jumped backward onto its surface, causing ice to fly everywhere.

"Liverpool are prepared to pay an increase on the £10million fee they have agreed with Lille to accelerate Divock Origi’s release in January. The Belgium forward, whom Brendan Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer. But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in, they would be ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year. Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling. Belgium's Divock Origi, second left, scores the second goal against Iceland on Wednesday night . Origi (right) celebrates with team-mates after his goal against Iceland at the King Baudouin stadium . Lille, however, have given no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant he would stay the full season in France, and hand Origi to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old has admitted he would be happy to move in January. ‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday. ‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January. Brendan Rodgers is in contact, he (speaks) regularly, he wants to know how I am feeling. ‘It makes me feel very good and wanted. Also the medical staff, they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved, telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club. If there was that chance of joining Liverpool sooner I would take it. Liverpool bought Origi from Lille  for £10million but loaned him back to the French side for the season . ‘I would love to move to Liverpool sooner rather than later. I am here at Lille. It’s fine, they are a good club and they have helped me. But I can’t wait to be playing in the Premier League because I can now see that it will suit me better. I think there are good things waiting for me with Liverpool.’ Origi, who has scored five goals in France this season, played for Lille in both their Europa League matches against Everton recently. He has made a point of watching how Liverpool have fared and believes their current position in the Barclays Premier League does not reflect their capabilities. ‘I have been following Liverpool closely, the events of what has been going on and I think they have had a difficult time,’ said Origi. ‘They have a team with a lot of talent, with a lot of good players. They also have a very, very good coach. ‘But they have had a lot of injuries and this has not helped them. It is difficult when you do not have a player like Daniel Sturridge, for instance. What I believe is that they just have to be more efficient but I also believe that it is only a matter of time before it comes.’ Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.","Divock Origi joined Liverpool for £10m in the summer .

"Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said, 'China, the sky's the limit there,' at an earnings conference. The Apple Store in Beijing is among the company's highest earners. But a court in China has ruled that a local tech company, Proview, which registered the name 'iPad' in China in 2001, still owns the trademark - and Apple doesn't. The official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Proview Shenzhen will seek to claim 10 billion yuan (£1 billion) in compensation from Apple for copyright infringement. The official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Proview Shenzhen will seek to claim 10 billion yuan (£1 billion) in compensation from Apple for copyright infringement . Apple iPad 2: A court in Southern China ruled that a local company, Proview, owns the trademark 'iPad', having registered it in 2001 . The court, in southern China, claim by Apple Inc. that a Hong Kong-headquartered tech company has violated its iPad trademark, in the latest development in a case that could affect the U.S. company’s financial prospects in the country. Apple’s Beijing-based spokeswoman Carolyn Wu declined to comment Thursday on the decision by the Municipal Intermediate People’s Court in the southern city of Shenzhen. The court said on its website that it dismissed a lawsuit Monday by Apple against Shenzhen Proview Technology over the ownership of the iPad trademark. The company is a subsidiary of LCD screen maker Proview International Holdings Ltd., headquartered in Hong Kong. Apple and its resellers in China are fighting in court against a US$1.5 billion (1.12 billion euro) claim by monitor manufacturer Proview International that it holds the rights to the name in mainland China . The court ruled that the Shenzhen company is not bound by a 2009 agreement that its Taiwanese affiliate, Proview Taipei, made with Apple to transfer the trademarks to the Cupertino, California-based company for 35,000 pounds ($54,700). Proview in Taiwan had registered the trademark in various countries as early as 2000, while Proview in Shenzhen registered the trademark in China in 2001. According to the Shenzhen court decision, Apple says its trademark transfer agreement with Proview’s Taiwanese company should also apply to the Shenzhen company, but the court rejected that, saying that the Shenzhen company was not involved in those negotiations. The U.S. company has the right to appeal the verdict.","Local company Proview registered name in 2001 .

"This is the moment a grieving mother was dragged shouting and screaming from her soldier son's graveside after losing a three year legal fight over where he should be buried. Battle lines were drawn today at the Royal British Legion Club in Forfar, Angus, when Linda McComiskie and her family were refused entry to the private funeral service of her son,  private Mark Connelly. Afghanistan war hero Private Connelly of the 3rd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, died in May 2011 from a freak punch while fighting a friend at the base in Germany in which they were stationed. A row erupted at the graveside between mother Linda McComiskie and wife Stacy Connolly over where Mark, who suffered severe arm injuries and burns in a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2009, should be buried . Linda McComiskie (pictured right) and her son,  private Mark Connelly (left) who died in 2011 . Mr Connolly and wife Stacy - she has been arguing with his mother for years over where he should be buried . A row then erupted between mother Linda McComiskie and wife Stacy Connolly over where Mark, who suffered severe arm injuries and burns in a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2009, should be buried. Mrs McComiskie has always insisted that her son wished to be buried in the family lair at MacDuff Cemetery in East Wemyss, despite claims by Mrs Connolly he wanted to be laid to rest at a plot earmarked for her in Forfar. A protracted and bitterly fought legal battle to decide the issue came to an end last year when a sheriff ruled Mrs Connolly had the right to bury him in her home town of Forfar - and blasted Mrs McComiskie for a 'distinct lack of compassion'. After waiting more than three years while her husband lay in a morgue in London, Mrs Connolly was finally able to make arrangements to lay him to rest. Stacy Connolly is pictured here stopping Mrs McComiskie's flowers being brought back to the graveside . Mrs McComiskie is pictured here shouting and swearing over her son's empty grave at his widow . A private humanist funeral service at the Royal British Legion Club was to be followed by military burial at the Newmonthill Cemetery in Forfar. There was a heavy police presence outside the service when a coach from Fife arrived. Mrs McComiskie, friends and family were then refused entry to the service. Mark Connolly's step-father Les Sneddon, 49, said: 'We could have been told last night we weren't getting in. Mr Connolly suffered severe arm injuries and burns in a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2009 . The two families were split up on either side of the grave but still managed to argue . 'All the way through this it has been the same. We are always the bad ones while she looks like the grieving widow.' Mrs McComiskie said: 'Why wait until the last minute to tell us. I mean today of all days. 'This was meant to be Mark's day. She had no right to do this to us. 'This is Mark's proper family.' The soldier's burial was delayed by almost an hour until both sides were arranged facing each other over the empty grave. The hearse bearing Mr Connolly's coffin draped in a Union Flag arrived preceded by a piper. As six of his  comrades lifted the coffin from the hearse for the slow march to the graveside, Mrs McComiskie started shouting abuse and swearing at Mrs Connolly across the empty grave. Mrs McComiskie is led away from the graveside following the spat with her son's widow . Police were forced to intervene as Mrs McComiskie shouted: 'You are horrible despicable scum. You are not Mark's friends. I hope you are all proud of this.' As police dragged Mrs McComiskie away both sides traded insults while six  soldiers fired volleys of shots over the grave. She was allowed to return to her son's grave by the officers but continued to hurl abuse as Mark Connolly's comrades knelt to lower his coffin into the ground. When the service was over and the crowds dispersed Mrs McComiskie with friends and family conducted a small private ceremony at the graveside. They left the cemetery, having removed the floral tributes they had hoped to leave at the soldier's grave. Mrs Connolly declined to comment after the funeral but a friend said: 'We didn't want them to attend the service. 'We feared that there would be trouble.' There was a heavy police presence outside the service and police stepped in when a row broke out .

"As part of Navy procedure, incoming female recruits have been forced to cut their hair so that it is only reaches 'the lower edge of the uniform collar' when they enter the boot camp pilot program. But now, after complaints from some sailors that the short haircuts do not properly prepare women for service - where longer hair is allowed - the Navy has temporarily halted the procedure as part of a trial. Recruits entering the program for the first three months of this year - starting this week - will be able to keep their long hair, so long as it keeps with the overall grooming policy, such as keeping it in a strict bun. The Navy had been the only remaining branch of the U.S. armed services to still require short hair. New trial: For the first three months of this year, incoming female recruits will be allowed to keep their hair long, while have previously been forced to cut it above the collar upon entry. Here, Chief Logistics Specialist Natali Philip measures the hair of Seaman Recruit Briana Cochems on January 6 as part of the new trial .

Too long?: Hawa Jenkins  (left) a recruit division commander, instructs Seaman Recruit Cohlena Jones-Tipton, on proper hair grooming standards as new recruits are allowed longer hair for next three months . They have set up an interactive web page showing hairstyles what is acceptable as per the grooming regulations, from how to maintain everything from pixie cuts to corn rows. For longer hair, 'no portion of the bulk of the hair (minus the bun) will exceed two inches, as measured from the scalp,' the website states. The Navy said the move is 'an effort to standardize training and education across the military services'. Time reported that the change came about following complaints that the short hair requirements didn't prepare women for graduating from boot camp, after which their hair can be longer. The Navy said there was 'fleet feedback that junior Sailors and officers are not taught proper grooming standards with longer hair'. 'Grooming standards education will be incorporated into the curriculum, but will not impact other training,' the Navy said in a statement. Strict grooming policy: On its website, the Navy has instructions on how to keep every hairstyle, from long hair to short, curly to straight . Under a new pilot program, the armed services branch will no longer require females to cut their hair short . 'This will allow women to style longer hair in the same manner that they would wear it daily in the Fleet while providing the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the standards before transferring to the Fleet.' However, 'females requesting a haircut may still receive one', the service branch said. It is tradition for recruits to have a haircut on arrival at the camp. Time also reported that the move may also be implement for incoming male soldiers who have longer hair. Men are currently required to have their heads shaved - no longer than an eighth-inch - upon arrival. Are they next?: There are suggestions that the hair requirements for male recruits may also soon change .","Sailors had complained the short hair requirements didn't properly prepare them for service, where longer hair is allowed .

"The mother of a two-year-old girl suffering from leukemia has been left devastated after photos of her cancer stricken daughter were stolen and used on a fake account. Melissa Clifton from Portland, Oregon, set up a Facebook page for her daughter Addy following the youngster's diagnosis in 2014 to keep loved ones updated about her progress. However she was horrified when she learned the pictures were copied by a stranger and used on Facebook and Instagram accounts set up under a false name - Cooper. Treatment: Melissa Clifton set up a Facebook page for her daughter Addy (pictured) following the youngster's leukemia diagnosis in 2014 to keep loved ones updated about her progress. She later found out some of the pictures had been stolen and used on social media under a different name . Fake: The Instagram handle, @hopeforcooper (right), had more than 340 followers, and featured 38 photos of little Addy Cliffton, including one of her dressed as Elsa from Disney's Frozen. It has now been taken down . According to ABC a child cancer advocate who was a member of Addy's Facebook group found the images and immediately alerted the family. The Instagram handle, @hopeforcooper, had over 340 followers, and featured 38 photos of Addy. Last week the Cliffords learned that the account had been removed from the site. One person under the  name @sophiabenge_ claimed that 'Cooper' was her cousin when she uploaded the picture. Many users commenting on the photo suggested the profile was fake. The account however is still active. Following the discovery, the Cliffords kept searching the internet for other evidence, but couldn't find any. They also found no crowdfunding sites using Addy's images, suggesting they had not been used to generate financial benefits. She told the station: 'I share pictures on there because I have family members and friends that live across the nation that want to follow Addy’s story. 'In the group there’s pictures of her in the bathtub at the hospital, visitations, her dressing up as Elsa from Frozen – pretty much doing normal, everyday things. 'They were our pictures, but someone had taken them and made a whole new story with them. I felt violated. 'That’s my child. It’s not only wrong to pretend someone else’s kid is your own, but you’re claiming to go through something that's not even true.' The station contacted Instagram for a comment but they did not respond.

"A nine-year-old boy was stalked down the street on his way to school, grabbed, then stabbed in the neck. Jermaine Colver, from Staten Island, New York, was walking down a snow-covered street when an unidentified man crept up behind him and lashed out with a bladed weapon. He was jumped by the man at 7.55am Friday as he walked to school through the Mariners Harbor neighborhood. Scroll down for surveillance footage of the attack . Victim: Jermaine Colver, nine, was jumped as he walked to school in Staten Island, New York City . Stalking: The attacker, seen above in surveillance footage, creeps up behind Jermaine (left) , grabs him (center), then stabs him three times (right) Fleeing: Jermaine is seen above running away from the scene of the stabbing. He was later taken to hospital . Surveillance footage captured the attack, which shows the man approaching from behind, grabbing the small boy and swinging his arm in a stabbing motion three times around his head and upper body. The fifth-grader stumbles to the ground then flees. The attacker does not appear to follow him. According to the New York Post, Jermaine described his attacker to police as an old man, and said he was wearing a blue hoodie. Despite the apparent viciousness of the attack, Jermaine was reportedly not badly wounded. The New York Daily News reported that Jermaine ran home and told his older brothers about the attack, who called 911 and went looking for the attacker. Jermaine was eventually taken to Richmond University Medical Center on Staten Island. He was said to have non life-threatening wounds, including a graze to the shoulder. His family hopes that he will be able to come home tomorrow.

"Criticism: Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, blasted the Tory plans to make it harder to call industrial action . Coaliiton Ministers last night descended into open warfare after Tory plans to curb public sector strikes were condemned by Liberal Democrats as a ‘brutal bid to strangle workers’ rights’. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, blasted the Tory plans to make it harder to call industrial action if it would affect health services, transport, fire or schools. While under the current laws a strike can be called if it is backed by a simple majority of those balloted, under the new Tory plan the backing of 40 per cent of eligible union members would be required. Mr Cable – who last week defied his leader Nick Clegg’s attempt to remove him as the party’s lead spokesman on the economy during the Election – condemned the move as ‘entirely ideologically-led’. He said: ‘Setting a mandatory 40 per cent level of support for strike action seems odd when MPs do not need to reach such a high hurdle to get elected. There’s no doubt these ill-conceived Tory plans wouldf have major implications for other democratic elections, from MEPs to police commissioners. ‘Industrial relations in the UK are good and the Conservatives would do well to turn their attention to creating a fairer society.’ Mr Cable added: ‘These Conservative proposals are... a brutal attempt to strangle the basic rights of working people in this country.’ The ‘40 per cent’ rule, which will form part of the Tory Election manifesto, was raised yesterday by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who said it was ‘ridiculous’ that a planned London bus strike later this month had been voted for by only 16 per cent of people entitled to take part in the ballot. ‘I think before a strike is allowed to go ahead it must have much more support from the union members and cannot be called by politicised union leaders,’ Mr McLoughlin said. Mr Cable  last week defied his leader Nick Clegg’s attempt to remove him as the party’s lead spokesman on the economy . The proposed changes were immediately condemned by Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, who said they would have a ‘chilling’ effect, while TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady even invoked this year’s 800th anniversary of Magna Carta to condemn the ‘anti-democratic’ crackdown. She said: ‘These attacks are not worthy of the Government – they’re being launched in the year we celebrate Magna Carta, for goodness sake.’ With the General Election now just four months away, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrat members of the Coalition are keen to ‘differentiate’ their political differences to appeal to their core voter base. The row between Mr Cable and Mr Clegg came after the Deputy Prime Minister announced on Wednesday that Mr Cable will lead on business policy during the campaign – a blow to Mr Cable who led on the economy at the 2010 Election. Mr Clegg said that Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (L) would replace Mr Cable (R) as the lead economic spokesman, including in any televised debates . Mr Clegg said that Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander would replace Mr Cable as the lead economic spokesman, including in any televised debates. However, Mr Cable insisted that he was going nowhere, and dismissed the matter as a ‘minor internal question’. When Tory MP Philip Davies said during a Commons debate that he had been ‘removed as the economic spokesman for your party at the General Election’, Mr Cable replied: ‘Well, I actually remain as our economic spokesman but that’s a minor internal question.’ But a spokesman for Mr Alexander later said: ‘Danny has been appointed as the economics spokesman by Nick Clegg. That is the reality.’ A source close to Mr Cable then said: ‘He remains economic spokesperson but Danny is also an economic spokesperson.’ The two men are said by sources to be barely on speaking terms.","Vince Cable blasted Tory plans to make it harder to call industrial action .

"There can't be many levels of excitement that can be greater than three-year-old James Blakeman's when he hears the opening strains of John Williams' famous Star Wars theme. Purist fans of George Lucas's films will be delighted little James' dad Sam Blakeman, 33, is introducing his son to the legendary science-fiction franchise starting with A New Hope, the original 1977 release.  'Was there any other option?' he says. But not as pleased as Wigan-based Sam is that his young man has such fine taste. 'What's this dad?' asks James as the movie begins. Asked what he thinks it is, James thinks for a moment before saying enthusiastically, 'Storm Woopers, and the people!' He's so close to Storm Troopers we all know what he means, and Sam says the only reason he gets it wrong is 'I haven't corrected him on that one yet'. It's so cute, who can blame him? As the famous tune kicks into gear, James' reaction escalates apace with arm waving and jumping, no doubt influenced by his dad's mutual appreciation of what's to come. James most certainly approves. 'I like it!' he says. The look on the face of James Blakeman when he sees the start of Star Wars: A New Hope is priceless . 'StormWoopers,' James proclaims - he only doesn't say Stormtroopers because dad Sam hasn't told him to . 'Is it exciting?' Sam asks, and gets a repeated response in the affirmative. 'There's a space ship!' James says, becoming increasingly excited. Incredibly, James hasn't even seen the whole film yet. 'This was the first time,' Sam says. 'He has seen clips and trailers on YouTube and his sister Phoebe has seen A New Hope, so he has seen bits of it whilst she was watching. He hasn't made it through the whole film yet as his attention span can't last that long.' James jumps around and laughs with great enthusiasm as John Williams' famous score plays . James is also a massive fan of the Disney Pixar films Monsters Inc and Monsters University but Sam says 'nothing else gets such a reaction' as A New Hope, the first of six Stars Wars films by Lucas featuring the Princess Leia-led Rebel Alliance in their attempt to destroy the Death Star. But while James enjoys the Stormtroopers - sorry, StormWoopers - he's yet to be fully introduced to their evil leader Darth Vader. 'He doesn't seem that fazed by Darth Vader but again he hasn't seen much of Darth's antics yet and I'm conscious of his age not to spook him too soon,' Sam says.","Three-year-old James Blakeman is already massive Star Wars fan .

"A group of schoolgirls claims to have made a scientific breakthrough that shows wifi signals could damage your health – by experimenting with cress. In a twist on the traditional science project of growing cress on a paper plate, the 15-year-olds set out to test whether mobile phone signals could be harmful. They say the result could affect millions of people around the world. An experiment in Denmark claims to show that Wi-Fi signals are powerful enough to kill cress seeds after just 12 days of exposure . Pupil Lea Nielsen said: ‘We all . thought we experienced concentration problems in school if we slept with . our mobile phones at the bedside, and sometimes we also found it . difficult sleeping.’ However, . because they were not able to monitor their brain activity at their . school in Denmark, they chose to monitor plants near wireless routers, . which emit similar radio waves to mobile phones. When the girls grew trays of garden cress next to wifi routers, they found that most of the seedlings died. In the experiment, they placed six trays in a room without any equipment and another six trays in a room next  to two routers. Over 12 days many of the seedlings in the wifi room turned brown and died, whereas those in the others room thrived. But . critics claim that the cress seedlings left next to the routers . probably struggled because they were dried out by heat emitted from the . devices. Kim Horsevad, the . students’ biology teacher at Hjallerup School, said: ‘This has sparked . quite a lively debate in Denmark regarding the potential adverse health . effects from mobile phones and wifi equipment.’ The . results will bolster the findings of researchers in Holland, who found . that trees exposed to wireless radio signals suffered from damaged bark . and dying leaves. There is . little evidence, however, that  wireless emissions pose any danger to . human health. Wifi signals use very low intensity radio waves – 100,000 . times less powerful than a microwave. Sitting . in a wifi hotspot for a year would only expose you to the same dose of . radio waves as making a 20-minute mobile phone call. Wireless radio waves also diminish significantly with distance. There is some debate about whether the negative effects were due to the cress seeds drying from the heat emitted by the computer Wi-Fi routers . Those . who want to reduce their exposure to wifi emissions should sit more . than 3ft away from their router and place their laptop on a table rather . than on their lap. Wi-Fi signals use very low intensity radio waves. Whilst similar in wavelength to domestic microwave radiation, the intensity of Wi-Fi radiation is 100,000 times less than that of a domestic microwave oven. The type of radiation emitted by radio waves (Wi-Fi), visible light, microwaves and mobile phones has been shown to raise the temperature of tissue at very high levels of exposure. This is called a thermal interaction, but researchers are divided as to whether the radiation we receive daily can cause damage. The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) has been monitoring the safety of . Wi-Fi. It says people using Wi-Fi, or those in the proximity, are . exposed to the radio signals it emits - and some of the transmitted . energy in the signals is absorbed in their bodies. However, the signals are very low power. Sitting in a Wi-Fi hotspot for a year results in receiving the same dose of radio waves as making a 20 minute mobile phone call. But there is some debate over whether the negative effects were due to the cress seeds drying from the heat emitted by the computer Wi-Fi routers used in the experiment. The study will raise fears that Wi-Fi radiation may also be having an effect on the human body and will lend weight to parents and teachers who have campaigned to stop wireless routers being installed in schools. Three years ago, research in Holland showed that trees that were planted in close proximity to a wireless router suffered from damaged bark and dying leaves. The Dutch scientists carried out their research on ash trees which had been suffering with bark bleeding and dying leaves. The city of Alphen aan den Rijn, in the . West of the country, ordered the study five years ago after officials . found unexplained abnormalities on trees which they did not believe had . been caused by any known viral infection. The trees were exposed to six sources of . radiation with frequencies ranging from 2412 to 2472 MHz and a power of . 100 mW at a distance of just 20 inches. Trees placed closest to the Wi-Fi radio . developed a ‘lead-like shine’ on their leaves that was caused by the . dying of the upper and lower epidermis. This would eventually result in the death of parts of the leaves, the study found. The study will raise fears that Wi-Fi radiation may also be having an effect on the human body and will lend weight to parents and teachers who have campaigned to stop wireless routers being installed in schools . In the Netherlands, about 70 per cent of all trees in urban areas show the same symptoms, compared with only 10 per cent five years ago, the study found. Trees in densely forested areas are not affected. But scientists have expressed scepticism about research such as this. At the time of the study, Marvin Ziskin, a professor of radiology and medical physics at Temple University in the U.S. said: 'Stuff like this has been around a long time . . . there's nothing new about Wi-Fi emissions. Scientifically there's no evidence to support that these signals are a cause for concern.’","Plants and people have been shown to absorb radio signals Wi-Fi emits .

"The bunker in which Adolf Hitler married Eva Braun shortly before the couple  committed suicide is being re-created by a German museum despite fears it may be deemed insensitive. A replica of the Fuhrerbunker, where Nazi leader Hitler spent his final months in Berlin, is being planned for a summer opening at The 'Top Secret' museum in Oberhausen, in the Ruhr valley more than 300 miles from its original location. 'We're just in the planning stages – the architects are working on it,' museum director Ingo Mersmann told thelocal.de. Scroll down for video . Adolf Hitler's final hideaway the Fuhrerbunker is being re-created by a German museum . The underground complex was destroyed in 1947, after it was stormed in 1945 as the Third Reich fell . 'We want this to be an educational experience so that families or groups of school kids can see how it really was: To experience the tiny rooms and the dampness of the bunker. We want to recreate it to show people.' Mersmann added: 'We are doing so very carefully and with sensitivity.' The museum is being careful not to create a place of pilgrimage for the few who still identify with the ideology of Hilter in their rebirth of the bunker that was originally at Potsdamer Platz and Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Empty black frames will hang on the walls of the bunker instead of the portraits of Hitler that were in the original to make the bunker an educational piece and avoid it being considered any sort of tribute. The Fuhrerbunker in Berlin was where Hitler married Eva Braun (below) before they committed suicide . Eva Braun, who died Eva Hitler, was the long-time companion of Nazi leader Hitler until their death . A carpark marks the spot where Hitler ended his own life as his Nazi regime collapsed . An unadorned plaque was erected in 2006, but it's policy in Germany to make Nazi landmarks as dull as possible so not to make them attractive destination for those who identify with Hitler's policy . 'We certainly don't want to recreate a place for the misguided people who still see him as a hero to come as a pilgrimage. We are planning against that,' Mersmann said. The re-created complex will include the Nazi leader's rooms, his secretary's office, the radio room and the clinic occupied by Hitler's personal physician, Dr Morrell. Plans will be based on floor plans from the Federal Archives, along with historical pictures and documentation.

An emotional Jeannette Bougrab  rushed to the scene of the shooting (pictured) when her boyfriend, Stephane Charbonnier, did not reply to her texts . 'Human nature is ugly. We loved each other because we were both independent personalities,' she said. ‘We didn’t do a press release to announce our relationship but we weren’t hiding it.’ Charbonnier was among four cartoonists killed in the Paris massacre which left 12 people dead. He had received death threats in the past and had been under police protection. Reports say he was in an editorial meeting when gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi burst in and opened fire with Kalashnikov assault rifles shouting 'Allahu akbar!' (God is great). The lawyer and former French Secretary for Youth and Community Life described to French TV station BMFTV how she got the news he was killed. 'I was at a state meeting and I learned there had been a shooting,' she said. 'Then I sent him a text, a second text, third text, and then I phoned him and he wasn't answering and he never did that. 'When I got there, there were the cordons and we weren't allowed to get in and I learned there that he was dead.' Anger: Miss Bougrab slammed the 'inadequate' security around the Charlie Hebdo offices, saying: 'We could have avoided this massacre' Lost: Jeannette Bougrab (right) had lived with Charb (left) and her adopted daughter May for three years . Six of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and staff members killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and  Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . The daughter of Algerian immigrants, Jeannette Bougrab (pictured) was a fierce critic of religion - particularly Islam . Proudly, Miss Bougrab added: 'He died standing. 'He defended secularism. He defended the spirit of Voltaire. He, in fact, was really the fruit of this ideal of the Republic that we've almost forgotten. 'He died, executed with his comrades, as he would say.' Bougrab, a member of the French National Council of State who served under Nicolas Sarkozy's administration has been described as a 'hard secularist'. The daughter of Algerian immigrants she is known as a fierce critic of religion, particularly of Islam. Hitting out at the inadequate security given to the satirical magazine and its staff, she later told TF1: 'I haven't lost Charlie Hebdo. I've lost a loved one. 'I am here, not as a former government minister, but as a woman who has lost her man, who has been murdered by barbarians. 'I admired him before I fell in love with him and I loved him because of the way he was, because he was brave. He thought that life was a small thing when he was defending his ideals. 'Do you know people capable of dying for their ideas today? No. Because they've just died, they've just been murdered. 'That's the reality, we could have avoided this massacre. We could have avoided it and we didn't.' Asked if she had been comforted by the world's adoption of the 'Je Suis Charlie' symbol and that it could be seen as a sign of victory, of hope, Bougrab said passionately: 'Absolutely not, because he's dead. It's absolutely not a victory. 'It's a defeat. It's a tragedy for our country and I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life.' Unmoved: Miss Bougrab took no comfort in the global show of solidarity with the deceased Charlie Hebdo journalists, saying the 'Je Suis Charlie' - I am Charlie - symbol is not a sign of victory . Harsh truth: Jeannette Bougrab said of the 'Je Suis Charlie' movement: 'I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life' Armed response: Police train their weapons on a building where the the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen are holed up with a hostage as they sit in a helicopter over the village of Dammartin-en-Goele . On the run: French special forces (pictured) rush to the scene of a hostage-taking at an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele, where the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen were holed up in a printing business . She admitted herself that she and Charb were an unlikely pairing although she'd been fascinated by him before they met. He was a communist, she a member of UMP, the centre right party. 'I have lost my love, lost a part of me. I was with a hero I admired. We tried to live normally but it was complicated.' Now she would like to see all the murdered cartoonists buried in the Parthenon where Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau lie. 'They died defending freedom of expression, secularism. They died so we can stay free in this country in France in 2015.' Miss Bougrab is one of many people trying to cope with the sudden and shocking loss of their relatives. The wife of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist, Georges Wolinski - who was among 12 people killed in the massacre in Paris - described the horror of learning about her husband's death through the news. Maryse Wolinski told RTL: 'Nobody official told me - I was quite shocked by that. Talking about my husband in the aftermath of this horrific shooting is not very easy. 'I think he died with his comrades, with his brothers, such as Cabut - in the service of his beloved freedom, for which he has always fought.' Regarding the controversial nature of their illustrations and the danger it brought, the children's author said: 'My husband was not aware of such things, he was going forward, he fought with his drawings with pencils, leaning on her drawing board.' Maryse and Georges' daughter, Esla, posted a picture of her father's office on Instagram with the caption: 'Dad is gone, Wolinski is not.'","Jeannette Bougrab, 41, claimed she was 'partner' of Charlie Hebdo editor .

"A kebab shop worker shot eight times at an undercover detective who tried to arrest him during a gun attack on a north London pool hall. Sedat Meric fired three rounds into the pool bar in a revenge attack when he was approached by the undercover detective from the National Crime Agency. Meric, 25, turned to the officer, raised his semi-automatic hand gun, and fired at the detective. Scroll down for video . Sedat Meric approaches the West Green Road Pool Bar in Haringey, North London reaching for his gun . Without warning the 25-year-old kebab shop worker, pictured,  fired three rounds into the pool hall . Sedat Meric, left, was jailed for 15 years for shooting at the police officer while his accomplice Oktay Ayanoglu, right, also received a 12-year jail term also for possession of a  firearm with intent to endanger life . The chilling incident was captured on CCTV. The footage shows Meric, who was wearing a balaclava and hoodie open fire into the West Green Road Pool Bar in Haringey, north London. A second camera shows the detective approaching and Meric opening fire before running onto Carlingford Road. He continued shooting at the officer, who was forced to seek cover behind a car on the opposite side of the road. Meric fired seven rounds at the officer, who despite being under heavy fire, continued to advance on the attacker. Several witnesses can be seen running for their lives. The officer, known only as NC32 was praised by an Old Bailey judge for his 'courage and resolve' for the manner in which he risked his life pursuing Meric. Meric only surrendered when he ran out of bullets. Meric turns around when officer NC32 shouted 'Armed Police' and began shooting at the detective . Despite being shot at eight times, officer NC32 continued his chase on foot until Meric ran out of bullets . The 25-year-old and his accomplice Oktay Ayanoglu were found guilty of possessing a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life on May 23 last year following a trial at the Old Bailey. Meric, who worked in a family-run kebab shop, was jailed for 15 years while Ayanoglu, 22, was handed a 12-year prison sentence. Judge Michael Topolski said it was 'miraculous' no-one was injured in the pre-meditated attack on the pool bar. Commending the National Crime Agency officer NC32, the judge said: 'He displayed all that is most creditable of police officers on whom we trust to put their own safety on the back seat for the protection of all the public. 'He acted with courage and resolve - literally in the face of live rounds being fired at him. 'In my judgment he should not only be thanked but highly commended for his bravery that night.' Meric attacked the West Green Road Pool Bar, pictured, over a turf war between rival criminal gangs . The undercover officer, pictured, returned fire because he thought his life was in immediate danger . As he sentenced the two north London men, the judge said: 'The irony at the heart of the events was that the police were on the streets that night to preserve and protect life while the two of you were there to endanger it. 'This was a pool bar in a busy, densely populated area of north London. It was a mild spring night, the first evening of a bank holiday. There were people on the streets - we saw them on CCTV. 'It is clear there could have been several people injured - or worse.' Meric and Ayanoglu were found not guilty of attempted murder of NC32, while the group's alleged leader, Bulent Eren, was cleared of all offences after the jury decided it could not be certain that he was the man who had stayed by the getaway car and fled before he could be apprehended. The court had heard that NCA officers were at the scene to protect Eren from a potential threat which may have emanated from the bar and had not expected him to arrive there armed. Eren, 35, from Liverpool, and others were involved in a 'bitter and violent argument' with a gang associated with West Green Road Pool Bar in Haringey, jurors were told. The prosecution said they had gone to the club for an 'armed revenge attack' following a fight in Tottenham less than 24 hours earlier, involving baseball bats, billiard cues and metal poles. After running out of bullets, Meric dropped his gun, pictured, and surrendered him to the police . Giving evidence from behind a screen, NC32 recalled the dramatic gun fight, saying that he returned fire because he felt his life and the lives of members of the public were in danger. He told jurors: 'I thought he fired at least two shots. 'My reaction was of shock and having to make a decision on what I was going to do and his reaction was to turn back the way he had come from. 'I started to run across the road. 'While I was running across the road, I drew my pistol from my right hip and shouted to him ""Armed police, stand still"".' He was about 15 to 20 metres away when the gunman reacted, NC32 said: 'He turned to face me and he brought his pistol up and fired at me. 'I returned fire with a single round.' The gunman carried on running into Carlingford Road and the officer made the decision to get into some cover on the opposite side of the road behind a car, the court heard. He said: 'As I moved down the side of the vehicle I am bobbing up and down. 'I can see the male on the opposite pavement and he is looking at me. 'I continue to shout ""Armed police"" and ""Police"" and got to the end of the first vehicle and he fires again at me.' Asked how many times he was shot at, the officer said: 'It just sounds and feels like a continuous round being fired at me. 'I continue shouting ""Armed police"", hoping he would stop firing, and it was at this point that I fired again at the male on the opposite side of the road. 'He immediately returned fire again at me. 'The firing had stopped. 'I came up and looked towards him and could see he was throwing the gun to his right-hand side and putting his hands in the air. 'He did so saying something to the effect ""OK, OK"". 'It was a gesture of surrender.' The officer said he realised he would have to go towards the gunman and get control of him as none of his colleagues had yet arrived. 'I had my gun on aim and closed the gap towards him and I told him to turn and put his hands up against the wall,' he said. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC asked NC32 why he fired. The officer replied: 'Because I thought I was in danger of my life and I believed, if he had carried on, any member of the public was in danger of their life.' Meric was arrested along with Ayanoglu, who had tried to run back to the Vauxhall Signum which was later found burnt out. The court heard that 11 spent cartridges from Meric's self-loading pistol littered the pavement and road after the incident and bullets were found embedded in the pool club building. On the day of the shoot-out, the Arctic Monkeys were performing at nearby Finsbury Park and people were sitting drinking on a grassy bank opposite the pool bar. At the time of the shooting the NCA's Armed Operations Unit was conducting a surveillance in the West Green Road area of Harringay when the shooting started. Meric received a 15-year jail term for possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life with a further six years for possession with intent to cause fear to run concurrently. His co-accused Ayanoglu was jailed for 12 years for possession of a fire arm with intent to endanger life. Both men were acquitted of teh attempted murder of officer NC32. Three days after the original shooting incident, armed police arrested two men aged 34 and 21 in Harringay. During the arrest, an armed police officer fired one round. The Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled that the use of firearms was proportionate. Detective Inspector Shaun Fitzgerald, from the Trident Gang Command, said: 'Meric went out that evening intent on causing fear and intimidation and with no regard for who may have got caught up in the crossfire. 'Shooting at officers of the law highlights his complete disregard. I commend the officers from the National Crime Agency for their bravery in the face of an armed man. It is sheer luck that no one was injured as a result of this incident and it highlights the inherent dangers present when carrying a gun.' Rob Lewin, Head of the NCA's Specialist Operations Unit, said: ''The NCA officer demonstrated professionalism and bravery in the face of extreme danger. All NCA firearms officers are trained to the highest standards; the measured and proportionate actions of the officers protected the public in what was a highly volatile situation.''","Sedat Meric launched a surprise attack on a north London pool hall in May .

"A traditional Italian nonna swapped her love of pasta 20 years ago for exercise and healthy living and is now a professional runner who has even won a body-sculpting competition. From down and out housewife to sizzling hot Super Gran, Paula Moorhouse, used a horrible insult made about her image to become the person she could never have dreamed to be. In her mid 40s, the mother-of-four was going through menopause and her self-esteem was at an all-time low when her partner at the time called her a 'barge a**'. The 66-year-old, from Sydney, used the remark as motivation to turn her life around and she now goes to the gym for an hour and a half every morning, before heading out to clean a couple of houses for a living. No time for nanna naps, the sexy Sexagenarian then hits the running track to train in the afternoon before finishing off her action-packed day by whipping her clients into shape during her personal training sessions. Scroll down for video . Forty years ago - Paula swapped her love of pasta (left) and all things Italian for a passion for exercise (right) Paula (right) runs rings around her daughters Mirella (left) and Susan (centre) in training sessions . A traditional housewife - Paula decided to do something for herself and even won a body-sculpting competition . Weighing 61kg in her old life, Paula was hardly a large woman in the past - now seven kilos lighter - it is more about her frame of mind and outlook on life. 'It's weird how a statement like that can set you off but I probably needed it to take a look at myself to get motivated and change a few things,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'You've got to do things for yourself instead of being at home and being a house mum - looking after teenage kids who can really look after themselves.' Paula successfully rose above the repressed situation that she was living in with her partner 20 years ago. 'I had a partner who kept putting me down and telling me I would never amount to anything - if you hear that often enough you do tend to believe it,' she said. The snide comment was enough for her to become an avid gym-goer where she started back to back aerobics classes but with no results. Mirella (centre) and Susan with five-month daughter Charlotte (right) asked Paula, 66, (left) to dress her age . Paula says she feels 16 and dresses like she's 20: 'I like the way I look and I feel good - life is great' 'A personal trainer told me I needed to do resistance work and weights and change my diet,' she said. 'I became hooked because I could see the results.' Although Paula didn't loss crazy kilos - she did drop from a size 12 down to a 6. As a true-to-form Italian Nonna, carbohydrates were Paula's best friend but it wasn't long before not even one potato chip (her biggest love) would pass her lips. 'I stopped fatty foods and frying everything,' she said. 'I have a non-stick pan and cook stir fries or cook things in the oven.' Reducing her alcohol intake was another big lifestyle change that paid off volumes. 'I used to have a couple of drinks every night while cooking dinner but it's just unwanted calories so now I just drink socially.' A born and bred Queenslander, she packed up her life at 58 years old and drove to Sydney - and has never looked back. 'I had spent 30 years dependent on two different men and did not want to then be dependent on my children,' she said. 'We are all creatures of habit but what is the worst that can happen? If you hate it do something else.' She may have given up her Italian food - but Paula is still a true doting Nonna to grandaughter Charlotte . The Moorhouse family used to eat 'man-size' meals as children before Paula adapted to a healthier lifestyle . Running very quickly became Paula's passion and she has the achievements to prove it: setting a new age group in the Australian 800m indoor record and being part of the team that broke the world record for the 4 x 800m. When Paula injured herself and wasn't allowed to run for three months instead of kicking back on the sofa - she decided become a body-sculptor and even won a competition. Her two daughters, Mirella, 38, and and Susan, 35, have been on a few gruelling training sessions with their mother who has put them to shame. 'I won't be training with her again,' Mirella laughed. 'The more she pushed the less I tried - we ended up arguing.' Her daughters have asked their mum to wear 'age-appropriate' clothing but to no avail. 'I feel like I'm 16 and dress like I'm 20,' Paula said. 'I like low cut dresses that go to the middle of the thigh but it has to be done tastefully. 'I've got to be me - I don't want to be anyone else.' So, will the super fit Nonna still be running in 20 years time? 'I give myself ten years - there is no way I want to be one of those women in their 80s who is clapped and lapped,' she said. 'I don't want to be hurried to get over the line - I want to go out in a blaze of glory.' Paula's sons were embarrassed to see her body-sculpting photos and her mates thought she was 'hot' However, Paula's four children are very inspired by their mother's motivation saying she is a great role model . But this doesn't mean that her girls don't see their mother as an amazing influence in their lives. 'We used to have man-size meals growing up so we she first started changing her lifestyle we didn't think she would stick to it but she did,' Mirella said. 'She always inspires us and is definitely a good role model.' Paula may have curbed her Italian ways with food but she is still a doting Nonna to Susan's five month old daughter Charlotte. Her sons, Christopher and Stephen, used to get embarrassed because their friends would comment on how 'hot' their mother looked. 'I would send them my body-sculpting competition photos and they would say they don't want to see them because I'm in underwear on stage with young men looking at me,' she laughed. 'I like the way I look and I feel good - I never get sick - life is great.' Paula succeeded in rising above the repressed situation that she was living in with her partner 20 years ago .","Paula Moorhouse, 66, didn't discover a love for exercise until her mid- 40s .

"Resemblance: Lily Travers is often mistaken for her famous grandmother Virginia McKenna, who is best known for the film Born Free . There’s something about the wide-set eyes, the prominent cheekbones, and even that distinctive smile. Lily Travers is often mistaken for her famous grandmother Virginia McKenna, who is best known for the film Born Free, about the plight of African lioness Elsa. And the comparisons are about to continue because 24-year-old Lily has now embarked on an acting career that has already seen her rubbing shoulders with A-list stars Sir Michael Caine, Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson. Kingsman: The Secret Service – a Bond-style film that has its London premiere this week – is Lily’s first major role. To land the part, she has had to turn her back on a successful modelling career – but, she says, following in her grandmother’s footsteps was more important. ‘People tell me I look like my granny – and I’m proud of that,’ she says. ‘She is the person who more than any other has inspired me. If I can achieve some of her success, I will be more than satisfied.’ Granny, of course, has starred in some of the most popular and enduring films of our time, among them Carve Her Name With Pride and A Town Like Alice, for which she won a Best Actress Bafta. But it was her depiction of Joy Adamson in the 1966 wildlife classic, which co-starred her real-life husband Bill Travers, for which she will always be remembered. It sparked Virginia’s growing concern for the plight of endangered animals and eventually led the couple to establish the Born Free Foundation in 1984. Lily’s father Will is president of the charity. Lily says: ‘My grandmother taught me so much about being a better person. I’m glad to have been able to learn from her experiences. ‘I’m especially proud of the fact that she then used her fame and influence to improve the lives of animals. She instilled in me and the rest of the family a great passion for all creatures. My brother and I were brought up with an innate sensitivity for animal welfare and we are vegetarians.’ Iconic: Virginia Mckenna as Joy Adamson in 1966 wildlife classic movie Born Free, which co-starred her real-life husband Bill Travers . One of Lily’s strongest memories is a two-month family trip to Africa about ten years ago. ‘We went to Kenya and Tanzania, visiting some of the projects the charity supports,’ she recalls. ‘We went to see confiscated ivory and I saw for myself how poachers kill and mutilate elephants just to get their tusks for ivory. ‘They would chop off the animal’s feet to make stools. How barbaric is that? I can’t believe people still think it a status thing to own, along with items like tiger rugs. How could anyone consider such things beautiful when they have come from such barbarity? ‘It was not a comfy ride. I was confronted by sights that were quite shocking. On one anti-poaching patrol we came upon a dead elephant, whose face had been hacked to get the ivory out and the rest of the body was left to rot. ‘The smell was horrendous and it was such a waste. It made me understand even more why my father and grandmother do what they do.’ Inspiration: Lily Travers, pictured with her father William, (R) says her grandmother Virginia McKenna (L) is her greatest inspiration . Virginia, now 83, is, by all accounts, a ‘cool’ grandmother. Lily remembers a childhood where bedtime stories were not fictional, but about her grandmother’s early years. ‘She would regale us with tales about being on set in Africa, the things she saw, the famous people she worked with, and even about meeting the Queen,’ Lily says. ‘She was really good at accents and voices – it was like having my own personal drama teacher from a very young age. I soaked it all up like a dry sponge.’ Lily says that she also learned her craft from watching both her grandparents on screen. ‘I watched all their movies, including the animal documentaries that are not so well known,’ she says. ‘I saw how they brought the characters to life with the simplest of gestures. First major role: Miss Travers features in Kingsman: The Secret Service – a Bond-style film that has its London premiere this week . ‘One of the best tips my gran gave me about being an actress was that the eyes are the key to the soul. She said I should be able to convey a lot through my eyes.’ Such was Virginia’s influence that she was the first person Lily told after she landed the role in Kingsman. Lily says: ‘I usually call her after an audition, but this time I was standing by a bus stop shrieking with joy. She was thrilled. She told me to be calm and relax during filming.’ Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organisation that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid, who is taken under the wing of suave older spy Harry Hart (Firth). Lily plays the part of society woman Lady Sophie, but is reluctant to reveal anything more about the character, maintaining ‘it’s all very hush-hush until the premiere’. The rising star has landed a number of minor roles since leaving university, and it is rumoured that director Tim Burton told her she was too beautiful for a role in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. She hopes that Kingsman will open the door to more success. ‘It’s my first speaking role and I was a bit nervous, but I kept remembering my grandmother telling me to be calm and just enjoy the experience,’ she says.

"It is being called the hardest rock climb on earth and for a while Kevin Jorgeson's attempt to scale the sheer face of Yosemite Park's El Capitan was hanging from the fingertips - literally. But despite his torn and bleeding hands, Jorgeson cleared one of the 3,000 ft ascents most difficult stretches, after days of failed attempts and waiting. Crowds of onlookers at the foot of the Dawn Wall at El Capitak broke into tears and cheers as Jorgeson, 30, finally grasped a razor sharp hold that had eluded him for days, clipped an anchor to secure himself and then screamed out in triumph, according to those who witnessed the dramatic climb. ""Pure joy,"" Jorgeson wrote afterward on his Facebook page, next to a photograph showing his bloody, bandaged hands. Scroll Down for Video . Waiting: Tommy Caldwell is waiting for his colleague and climbing partner, Kevin Jorgeson to join him for the final ascent of the arduous El Capitan climb in California . Hands torn and bleeding, the second of two men attempting a grueling climb up a half-mile of sheer granite in California's Yosemite National Park cleared one of the ascent's most difficult stretches after days of failed attempts and waiting . Friday's climb keeps Jorgeson in the effort, after Caldwell moved several segments ahead of him. Caldwell is now 2,000 feet up, about 1,000 feet from finishing. Support crews have said they hope the two men will reach the top by mid-next week . Jorgeson, 30, of Santa Rosa, California, and Tommy Caldwell, 36, of Colorado are two weeks into what is billed as the first free climb of the vertical Dawn Wall to reach the 3,000-foot summit of El Capitan. Free climb means the men are climbing without the aid of pegs, ropes or other gear to help them ascend, although they are using safety gear to guard against what could be deadly falls. Friday's climb keeps Jorgeson in the effort, after Caldwell moved several segments ahead of him. Caldwell is now 2,000 feet up, about 1,000 feet from finishing. Support crews have said they hope the two men will reach the top by mid-next week. Indeed, Caldwell is only 1,000 feet from finishing the groundbreaking climb. Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are attempting to become the first men to free-climb - using only hands and feet - the Dawn Wall of the park's towering El Capitan rock formation. On Thursday, Caldwell climbed to a ledge 2,000 feet up, says Tom Evans, a photographer and climber who has been chronicling the journey. His partner, however, is hundreds of feet below.

Stuck: Kevin Jorgensen is still nursing the split skin on his fingers as he struggles at a lower-down point . Jorgeson, 30, is struggling to recover from splitting open the skin on the fingertips of his index and middle fingers of his right hand. This has severely hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner, and led to the pair taking three ‘rest days’ in the hope the skin will heal. This weekend, after a short break, Jorgeson plans to try surpassing the particularly difficult section lower down once more. Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson are relying completely on their physical strength and dexterity to make their way up the Dawn Wall, a vertical face on one side of El Capitan. Caldwell could become the first to accomplish the feat. Progress: Caldwell makes his way up the rock face last Sunday. If all goes well, he could do it this weekend . Don't look down: Jorgeson calculates his next move up the mountain despite suffering cuts to his fingers . The men have been climbing toward the 3,000-foot summit for two weeks. Speaking from the foot of the Dawn Wall at the start, Tom Evans, a fellow climber and photographer in contact with the pair, told the Daily Mail their spirits are still high. ‘They remain determined to complete the climb,’ he says. ‘They are definitely going for the top. They say they are not coming down until they’ve got there. The human body is not designed to take the kind of abuse they are enduring up there. ‘The granite flakes when you grip it, creating tiny razor-sharp edges which cut the skin deep. Kevin has taped up his fingers to protect them, but underneath, the skin is dry like toast.’ While many people have climbed the Dawn Wall — renowned for its smooth surface — using ropes and metal pins, no one has ever free-climbed it in a single attempt. Although the pair are clipped to ropes, they must not use them to help in the ascent. Instead, the ropes are to stop them falling if they misjudge a move or lose a grip with their fingers or feet. The men, who started the expedition on December 27, begin their climbing day shortly after 3pm, just two hours before sunset. December and January were picked for the climb in the hope it would be cold — sunlight and warmth cause fingers to sweat and so lose grip. Climbing shoes are also nowhere near as effective at clinging to the rock if the rubber gets warm because it becomes softer. But Yosemite National Park has been unusually warm this winter, so they are forced to do most of their climbing during the chill of night, using head torches. Kevin Jorgenson pulls on a relatively big hold during the climb . Precarious: The climbers have been living in a vertical world for weeks . Logistics: Aside from the actual climbing, the climbers have a great deal of work to do managing their ropes on the long climb . Filmed all the way: A cameraman hangs from the rock face awaiting the arrival of Caldwell and Jorgenson . Daring: Free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent. Above, Caldwell makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on El Capitan using a headlamp on Sunday night . Up they go: Kevin Jorgeson, 30 (left), and Tommy Caldwell, 36 (right), reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb Yosemite's El Capitan earlier this week. They've now been forced to separate . At the dead of night, temperatures can plummet to well below freezing, as ice-cold winds sweep across the face of the rock. At midnight, after nine hours of climbing, they clamber into their ‘portaledges’ — 4ft by 6ft tents that hang from ropes fixed to the cliff face. Each has a stove to cook dried pasta, chilli and vegetables, brought by a six-strong support network of porters who haul food along with 12 gallons of water in huge sacks up the ropes to their precarious camp. On occasion, the pair have even celebrated the completion of a particularly demanding section with a swig or two of whisky — ‘to take off the edge’, Caldwell says. Before bed, they treat their cuts, grazes and bruises. Writing from his tent via social media, Caldwell says: ‘It’s the most chapping environment in the world up here. Windy. Cold. Super dry. [It feels like] we’re grabbing razor blades. I wake up twice a night and reapply lotion to my hands.’ Bizarrely, they are not alone — a photographic team and film crew, charting their ascent, camps alongside them. ‘We have three double “portaledges” set up. It’s like a five-star hotel up here!’ Caldwell says. In truth, few hotel guests face the prospect of falling rocks and ice hitting them as they sleep. They wake at 10am and have breakfast. By then the sun is out and they use solar-powered devices to charge their smart phones, and report back via social media to base camp, as well as family, friends and supporters. Tom Evans believes Jorgeson and Caldwell — who have trained for six years — could complete the challenge by early next week. The greatest threat would be a turn for the worse in the weather, or an acute injury to the hands. But even that might not stop this remarkable pair from conquering what is surely one of nature’s greatest challenges.","Kevin Jorgeson has had to fight through the pain of split fingers as he battles to join climbing colleague Tommy Caldwell .

"A warehouse worker lost two fingers when his hand was drawn into a giant woodworking machine just days after securing a full time job. Mathew Bell, 28, suffered 'life changing injuries' after he was using a cutting machine while working for Workshop Fabrications in Nottingham. Mr Bell was feeding a piece of wood into the machine, which had an unguarded blade, when the accident happened. Mathew Bell, pictured, lost two figures on is left hand and may need to amputate a third after the accident . Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard that the 28-year-old victim now has difficulties with simple tasks such as tying his shoe laces. The court heard that the company had adapted the Brandt Optimat KD 77-C Edgebending machine to operate without a guard protecting the blade. Mr Bell had been working in the workshop as an agency worker for the previous 13 weeks on the day of the accident in June 2012. He said: 'I was going into work full of joy because I had been given a permanent role which meant I would be paid more - but then this happened. 'It's definitely changed my life; I have to live with half a hand. 'Things I used to take for granted are now a lot harder - tying shoelaces, carrying stuff, fastening trousers, opening a door when I have something in my other hand. 'I was learning how to play guitar at the time but I had to stop and I can't type anywhere near as fast. 'It can get really frustrating but I try not to let it stop me from doing things. 'If the company hadn't modified the machine the way it did, then it would never have happened. It's ridiculous that health and safety just went out the window.' Mr Bell's hand was drawn into a massive wood-cutting machine at Worktop Fabrications in Nottingham . Workshop Fabrications admitted breaching health and safety regulations by modifying the machine so it could operate without its safety guard. Mr Bell was feeding wooden worktops into the machine which cuts them to the correct dimensions using several circular saws. He said: 'I was watching a board go through and the next thing I remember is panicking and pulling my hand out of this machine as it made these awful grinding noises. 'I just saw my mangled left hand with the white bit of bones where my little finger should have been and screamed. 'Whenever I think about it, I just shiver and cringe. Because it was a tooth blade, it chewed and ripped them off.' Mr Bell, from Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham but his little and ring fingers were too badly damaged and what was left of them had to be amputated. He also severely damaged his middle finger and says doctors may yet decide to remove it. He was in hospital for three days and off work for seven months. He is now taking a computer-based animation course. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive found the blade had been unguarded since 2008 or 2009. Health and Safety Executive inspector Judith McNulty-Green said in a statement: 'This man's painful and life-changing injuries were borne out of a catalogue of failings on the part of Worktop Fabrications Ltd. 'The risks associated with cutting machinery are well known in the industry, and so are the measures that should be taken to minimise or remove those risks.' Emma Evans, defending at Nottingham Magistrates Court on Friday, said the firm previously had a clean record and had since made changes to reduce risks. She said: 'The company accepts it relied too heavily on verbal instructions to staff.' Worktop Fabrications was ordered to pay a £20,000 fine, £4,754 legal costs and a £15 victim surcharge after pleading guilty to breaching Regulation 11(1) of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998. A company statement said: 'The company regrets the events which led to the prosecution and since has taken steps to ensure that an accident of this nature does not happen in the future.'","Mathew Bell had just secured a job with Worktop Fabrications, Nottingham .

"It's a gripping TV drama that features some of Britain’s most acclaimed actors. Yet for many of its ten million viewers, the biggest star of Broadchurch isn’t David Tennant or Olivia Colman – but the stunning Dorset scenery. Interest in the hit show is fuelling a boom in holiday rentals, and house prices, on the Jurassic Coast, as fans flock to visit the locations. Visitors can even stay in the blue chalet where Tennant’s character, DI Alec Hardy, anguishes over the murder case at the centre of the drama – for just £41 a night. But the bad news is that Britbank, a 100-year-old two-bedroom chalet on the banks of the River Brit in West Bay, the real-life Broadchurch, is booked out for months. Scroll down for video . A place to think: The Dorset chalet where David Tennant's DI Hardy lived is available for just £41 a night . The blue chalet, on the banks of the River Brit in West Bay, Dorset, has two bedrooms and sleeps four . But holiday letting agent Malcom Gill said: ‘One thing’s for certain, it’s not going to be £41 a night for long’ Holiday letting agent Malcom Gill added: ‘One thing’s for certain, it’s not going to be £41 a night for long.’ The price wasn’t even hiked for the producers of the series, who hired the chalet for two weeks to shoot Tennant’s scenes. Mr Gill added: ‘We just treated it like a standard let. The crew came in on check-in day and left two weeks later. They were the perfect customers.’ The show’s creator, Chris Chibnall, who lives in nearby Bridport, spotted the holiday home when he was writing the first series in a local cafe. He said the chalet ‘holds lots – if not all – of the secrets’. It is not the only Broadchurch property that fans can rent. In the first series, Pauline Quirke’s Susan Wright lived in a mobile home at Freshwater Beach Holiday Park, where the father of the murdered Danny and the son of his killer secretly bonded over video games. A week in the three-bedroom caravan ranges from £350 to £1,000, depending on the season. Even Dorset’s beach huts have benefited from the Broadchurch effect, despite being the scene of the brutal fictional murder. One recently went on the market for £225,000, even though it’s uninhabitable with no bathroom, mains electricity or running water.","Biggest star isn’t David Tennant or Olivia Colman, but the stunning scenery .

"A good soak in a hot bath is really all you need on a cold day. Snow monkeys living near the resort of Yamanouchi, in the heart of central Japan's hot springs country, have taken to spending much of their time hanging out in the warm waters. And while the macaques are already well prepared for Japan's harsh winters, boasting a thick coat of sand-coloured fur, their bright red faces seem most relaxed when they fall asleep in the warm pools. The water in the naturally hot springs can get very hot and can reach temperatures of between 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (15-32 degrees Celsius). Though these Japanese macaques can be found in other parts of the country, the monkeys here are considered unusual for their love of hot water - and are among the best-loved symbols of wild Japan. At Jigokudani, or Hell's Valley, snow covers for approximately four months of the year with temperatures averaging minus ten degrees Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) during winter months. Snow monkeys living in Japan's hot springs country spend most of their time hanging out in the warm water . The water in the springs can get very hot, reaching temperatures of up to 15-32 degrees Celsius . Mr. Takizawa, one of five employees at Jigokudani Monkey Park, says the Japanese macaques have adopted a small build to survive such extreme weather conditions. 'The typical features of Japanese macaques are their short tails and small ears,' he says. 'These descriptions form the basis of Allen's rule - that animals in colder climates have shorter appendages particularly in temperatures below zero - which means their petite physical features total to a smaller surface area allowing them to be less exposed to the cold, thus being protected from forming frost bite.' A lot of time is also spent grooming, which is important to strengthen bonds between the monkeys, so they carefully pick lice out of each other's fur coat . Jigokudani Monkey Park is where many of the macaques call home, spending time bathing and grooming . The close bonds forged amongst members of the snow monkey troop of approximately 160 attract many tourists. Despite its relatively remote location, roughly 100,000 visitors trek through the woods of Nagano each year to visit the macaques at the Jigokudani Wild Monkey Park. And the tourists' favourite gadget - the camera - has evolved over the past half century. Despite the remote location, roughly 100,000 visitors trek through the woods of Nagano each year to visit . Now everyone wants a selfie with a snow monkey, but it remains unclear whether the monkeys are keen to participate. 'When taking pictures with a smart phone, you stretch your arms out without realising, it is easy for people to stretch their arms out wide, which, from a monkey's point of view, this closely resembles the act of physical force,' says Takizawa. And getting the primates to look at the camera is proving to be a whole other challenge, as American tourist Amber Kioninie has quickly realised. And it seems as though what everyone really wants is a photo of the monkeys - up close and personal! 'I heard that the selfie stick was really big in Japan, so I bought my first one, and I'm trying to get my first selfie picture with the snow monkey,' she says. 'I've got a few, but I'm trying to get one with our faces looking at the camera.' Jo and Troy, Australian tourists from Brisbane, are also adopting the selfie stick for their family photos. 'We're trying to take a selfie to make the monkey look like it's taking the selfie with us in it, if you know what I mean, but, it's not working out for us,' they explain, before continuing to perfect their shot. In order to keep the wild monkeys from getting spooked, tourists are encouraged to use selfie sticks . However, there are concerns that some technologies are alarming to the monkeys. Drones, Takizawa says, are particularly risky as they resemble certain animals that the monkeys are wary of. 'Some people have even attempted to use drones, which have the capability of shooting video as it flies into the sky. 'However, monkeys really dislike this kind of device, as for them it resembles animals that fly within close distance to them,' he warns. The unusual creatures have long been considered a favoured symbol of wild Japan . 'In Japan, there is a creature called Petaurista, which looks like a squirrel with a pair of wings and it flies between trees. 'When the monkeys see them they panic, and once they start panicking it also increases the risk of them injuring humans.' The monkeys first learnt how to bathe when the small wooden inn at Korakukan opened to the public as a hot spa over one hundred years ago in 1884. Tourists can still visit the spa today, and, if lucky, they may find a monkey bathing alongside them in the hot waters.","These red-faced monkeys spend most of their time in warm water .

"Zimbabwe has defended its decision to send 62 baby elephants to zoos in China, France and the United Arab Emirates, saying the country is 'overpopulated' with the animal. Buyers from China want 27, the UAE 15, and France between 15 to 20, in deals that conservationists have described as 'ethically unconscionable'. Jerry Gotora, head of Zimbabwe's parks and wildlife management authority, said its elephant population was not sustainable. The country had 80,000 elephants, but only had a 'capacity' for 42,000, he said.

"Suffolk MP Tim Yeo, 69, claimed £1,319 for two computers and monitors . A group of MPs used their parliamentary expenses to go on a computer-buying spree – just a few months before they stand down at this year’s General Election, it was revealed last night. Six MPs bought more than £6,000 worth of equipment between them, shortly before they would have been banned from doing so under House of Commons rules. MPs are forbidden from using public funds to buy expensive new equipment when a General Election is less than six months away. MPs are asked to pass on IT equipment to their successors or a charity when they leave the Commons, but that is only ‘guidance’. They can keep it if they prefer. The MPs, who have already announced they are leaving the Commons, charged a total of £6,300 for computers, iPads and other equipment. They all filed the claims before the cut-off date of September 30 last year – six months before the end of the final Commons session ahead of this year’s May 7 poll. The group includes wealthy Suffolk MP Tim Yeo, 69, who was deselected by his local party over claims he did not spend enough time in his constituency. He claimed £1,319 for two computers and monitors. Fellow former Conservative Minister Jonathan Evans, 64, claimed more than £1,500 for two computers, as well as an iPad Air costing £479. Multi-millionaire former Conservative Energy Minister Charles Hendry, 55, who is giving up his Wealden seat in East Sussex, claimed £1,024 for a Dell ‘Latitude’ computer. Hove Tory MP Mike Weatherley, 57, claimed £849 for a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet and £109 for a Pro 3 keyboard. Ex Labour Minister and Leeds MP George Mudie, 69, claimed for a £579 computer and £101 for a printer pen. And former Conservative Minister James Arbuthnot, 62, MP for North-East Hampshire, claimed £594 for an iPad Mini. Multi-millionaire former Conservative Energy Minister Charles Hendry, 55, who is giving up his Wealden seat in East Sussex, claimed £1,024 for a Dell ‘Latitude’ computer . All the claims were made in the weeks leading up to September 30 – and all were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority which controls MPs’ expenses. There is no suggestion the MPs broke any rules – and the MPs deny any impropriety. Mr Evans said he had bought his computers so his office could function properly right up until the Election. He joined Mr Mudie, Mr Hendry and Mr Weatherley in saying he would give his equipment away after May 7. Mr Arbuthnot declined to comment and Mr Yeo was not available. TaxPayers’ Alliance spokesman Andy Sylvester said: ‘It’s hard to shake the suspicion that MPs are claiming as much as they can on their own personal Black Friday before they leave Westminster.’ lRestaurants in the House of Lords lost almost £2 million last year – with taxpayers left to pick up the bill.

"It has emerged Martin Place siege victim Katrina Dawson was struck by a police bullet when officers stormed the Lindt Cafe firing at Man Haron Monis. A police investigation has also revealed the gunman had enough ammunition with him to kill all of the hostage. Ms Dawson, 38, was not directly hit by a bullet but possibly a ricochet when Tactical Operations Unit officers raided the cafe just after 2am on December 16, multiple sources have confirmed to Fairfax Media. Monis had just executed another of the hostages, cafe manager Tori Johnson, at close range, and was killed in the shoot-out. Scroll down for video . Some of the hostages of the Sydney siege were able to escape the Lindt cafe before the shoot out took place . Police investigation reportedly reveals Katrina Dawson, left, was hit by a bullet fired by police as they stormed the Lindt after Man Haron Monis executed Tori Johnson, right . This news comes after it was revealed police found 20 more rounds of ammunition inside the pocket of Monis, according to news.com.au. From initial lines of inquiry, it is believed Ms Dawson was struck in the heart by a ricocheting bullet while on the floor and again in her shoulder. The siege's second victim, Tori Johnson, was shot in the head from behind - at close range - by Monis before officers raided the cafe, a source told News Corp. The circumstances surrounding the 16-hour Martin Place siege is still the subject of a critical incident investigation by the homicide squad. Ms Dawson's cause of death will be determined by the NSW Coroner once that investigation is completed. A police spokeswoman told Fairfax Media the force would not be commenting on any aspect of the investigation until that process had been completed. Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson were both held hostage by Man Haron Monis, pictured, in Sydney's Lindt cafe . Police also would not confirm if bullets had been found in Monis' pocket following the end of the siege. But a source confirmed to News Corp after his shoot-out with police, where they sprayed more than 27 shots at the gunman, they found at most 20 rounds on his body. The details of the final moments of the Sydney siege emerge days after it was revealed the gunman Man Monis was dropped from the national watch lists on the same year he was reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal. As more information comes to light about Monis’ violent and disturbing past, people continue to question why the man with a history of threatening behaviour was not being more closely monitored by authorities. It is alleged Monis repeatedly made threats to the principal of a South Sydney school, accusing him of being a traitor and a 'sell-out' for allowing the school to engage in interfaith activities, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. After sending about 12 abusive faxes, ranting about the school’s choice to associate with a Jewish school and for holding an inter-faith Anzac Day ceremony, Monis' messages became more sinister. 'People like you will get what's coming your way,' he wrote to Osman Karolia, who was the then-principal of Arkana College in Kingsgrove. Mr Karolia became concerned and asked if that was intended as a threat, to which Monis replied ‘yes’. Mr Karolia contacted Australian Federal Police, deeply concerned Monis was acting in a hostile manner towards himself and the school. Although Monis was investigated, police still elected to stop monitoring Monis by removing him from watch lists that same year.","Katrina Dawson was one of two victims killed in the 16-hour stand-off .

"Anna Soubry judged the George’s Chapel of Remembrance's £50,000-a-year running costs as an 'inappropriate use of defence resources' David Cameron has vowed to save the chapel dedicated to heroic Battle of Britain pilots after a public outcry over its threatened closure. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how St George’s Chapel of Remembrance for ‘the Few’ faced the axe after Defence Minister Anna Soubry judged that its £50,000-a-year running costs were an ‘inappropriate use of defence resources’. But in a dramatic move last week, the Prime Minister pledged to do ‘whatever it takes’ to save the chapel at Biggin Hill, Kent, after a furious backlash from Mail on Sunday readers and campaigners. Built on the site of the former RAF station – which played a key role in the 1940 battle to repel Hitler’s Luftwaffe – the chapel has stood since 1951 as a memorial to all the British airmen who died during the Second World War. The local airport of Biggin Hill offered to make up the funding shortfall following our report, but Mr Cameron’s announcement now means the Ministry of Defence will maintain ownership and provide public money for the site. ‘I can absolutely confirm to the House that the chapel will be preserved for future generations, as we have always recognised its importance and its rich heritage,’ he said at Prime Minister’s Questions. He added: ‘I think it’s possible that of all the great moments in British history, the Battle of Britain stands out as one of the most important times that there have been. ‘We will protect the chapel and will do all that we can to protect it for future generations.’ His intervention followed an online petition to save the church which gained more than 28,000 signatures. Campaigners also took to Twitter to express their anger at Ms Soubry. In an embarrassing turnaround last Sunday, Ms Soubry retreated from her previous stance, telling one complainant: ‘It doesn’t mean the chapel must close. I’m working hard to save it.’ On Monday she tweeted that there would be a meeting about the chapel’s future, and a day later she met local Tory MP Jo Johnson, when she again expressed her support for its ‘continued preservation’. Outcry: Our report last week on the plans to close the chapel, which caused furious backlash from Mail on Sunday readers and campaigners . The Prime Minister’s announcement was welcomed by Mr Johnson, who has championed the campaign to keep the historic monument open. He described the U-turn as a ‘triumph’ for the public. ‘We’re in a very good place and the security of the chapel is secured,’ he said. ‘It’s a great triumph to keep the chapel open, and one The Mail on Sunday has played a huge part in.’ David Cameron has pledged to do ‘whatever it takes’ to save the chapel at Biggin Hill, Kent . TV presenter and local resident Jan Leeming was also pleased with the about-turn, but she criticised the MoD for the ‘lack of thought’ shown in its initial decision. ‘I welcome Mr Cameron’s promise and hope he keeps his word,’ she said. ‘Apart from anything else, the chapel is iconic – a place of peace, beauty and remembrance. Although a modern building, it has an aura of spirituality usually associated with ancient churches.’ In a statement released on Thursday, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ‘We have been in discussions with Bromley Council for 18 months and we are pleased that the council wants to create a heritage centre on the site. Subject to agreeing suitable terms to secure the future of the chapel, the garden of remembrance and the car park, we will lease the site on a long-term basis to the council for a token rent.’ Approved by Sir Winston Churchill as a ‘permanent’ shrine to ‘the Few’ of the Second World War, St George’s was originally built to replace a military chapel destroyed by a fire in 1946. It is expected to welcome 25,000 visitors this year as it commemorates the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. The chapel was also threatened with closure in 1989, when the airfield was closed as an operational RAF base, but it was later saved because of its historical significance.","St George's Chapel of Remembrance in Biggin Hill, Kent, faced the axe .

"Of all the statistics from the recent New Year's Eve in Times Square - 1 million revelers, 2,000 pounds of confetti, thousands of police officers, dozens of surveillance cameras - there is one number that stands out: zero, as in zero tickets for low-level crimes. No tickets for having an open container of alcohol, no tickets for public urination, no tickets for double parking, no tickets for furry, costumed characters hassling tourists to take their picture. Add in low-level arrests, and there was just one, for a subway-related offense. And that wasn't just on New Year's Eve. That was for the entire week containing the holiday. During the Christmas week, when the neon-lit streets were every bit as jammed, the total for such infractions was 23 - compared to more than 650 summonses per week the previous year, according to police statistics. Scroll down for video . Zero tickets: No tickets for having an open container of alcohol, no tickets for public urination, no tickets for double parking, no tickets for furry, costumed characters hassling tourists to take their picture were isued . Times Square is perhaps the most jarring example of a slowdown in low-level enforcement across New York City amid tension between rank-and-file police and Mayor Bill de Blasio, whom they accuse of encouraging violence against cops by siding with protesters after the chokehold death of Eric Garner. They were particularly incensed by comments in which the mayor warned his biracial son to be wary in dealing with officers. In the two weeks after two NYPD officers were shot to death in their patrol car December 20 by a fugitive who had ranted online about avenging police killings, low-level arrests citywide dropped 61 per cent. Summonses were down more than 90 percent. Arraignment courts have been so slow they have sometimes closed early, and Rikers Island's jails have about 2,000 fewer inmates. 'They haven't been on top of us like they used to,' Luis Martinez said on a recent night in Times Square, where he roams the streets in a Cookie Monster costume posing for photos in hopes of tips. 'They're minding their own business now.' On Friday, Police Commissioner William Bratton said he'd concluded that some officers had purposefully cut down on small-time arrests and tickets - and that enough was enough. Free to celebrate: Revelers celebrate after midnight during New Year's Eve festivities at Times Square in New York none of whom were penalized for low level crimes such as public intoxication or urination . 'We'll work to bring things back to normal,' he said, adding that the numbers were already rising. No officers are being disciplined, with Bratton noting 'the extraordinarily stressful situations' in a month filled with protests, police funerals and discord. The latest figures will be available Monday. Police unions say there was no sanctioned work slowdown, and they are quick to point out that officers are still rising to the call of duty. Just this past week, two police officers were shot and wounded responding to a report of a robbery moments before their shifts ended. 'Our members are doing their job,' said Patrick Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents 24,000 officers. The 14-block precinct in the heart of Times Square was among at least seven across the city where not a single summons was issued for parking, moving or criminal violations during New Year's week - a statistic that makes some people nervous. 'It's dangerous for the public to know that the police are doing less,' said Madeline Sorel, 57, who teaches knitting at a senior center in Brooklyn's Coney Island, one of the zero-summons precincts. 'It might make criminals more eager to do crime.' Bringing in the New Year: Police commissioner William Bratton (Center) with members of the NYPD in Times Square on New Years Eve . Decrease:In the two weeks after two NYPD officers were shot to death in their patrol car December 20 by a fugitive who had ranted online about avenging police killings, low-level arrests citywide dropped 61 per cent . To Army veteran Hortensia LaCorbiniere, police aren't in a position to back off on doing any part of their jobs, whatever the reason. 'Their orders are to protect and serve,' LaCorbiniere said as she went to a medical appointment in another precinct with zero tickets on Manhattan's East Side. 'You do your job, or you get out of that occupation.' The slowdown has overshadowed an overall, years-long decrease in every measurable crime statistic: complaints of crime, arrests and summonses. Crime of all kinds decreased 4 percent to all-time low in 2014, when there were 332 homicides, down from 335 the previous year. The slowdown in enforcement hasn't translated to a rise in crime. In the past two weeks, reports of serious crimes were down to 3,704 from 4,130 in the same period a year earlier. That has critics questioning Bratton' signature crime-fighting tactic: the ""broken windows"" theory that targeting low-level infractions discourages more serious crime. Some police reform advocates say the slowdown proves that the city can do without a tactic they see as heavy-handed. 'There have been unnecessary arrests, and this proves it,' said Monifa Bandele of Communities United for Police Reform. But Bratton says the arrests are no less necessary, despite the let-up. 'The whole thesis of `broken windows' is: If over time you don't address an issue, over time it will create a larger issue,' he said.","This New Years Eve in New York City there were no tickets for having an open container of alcohol among other low level crimes .

"Latest arrest: This is George Zimmerman's mugshot from the Seminole Sheriff's Office in Florida after his arrest on Friday night for assault and domestic violence with a weapon . Florida authorities say George Zimmerman, whose acquittal of murdering an unarmed black teen sparked a national debate on race and self-defense laws, has been arrested for allegedly throwing a wine bottle at his girlfriend. The Seminole County Sheriff's Office says the 31-year-old Zimmerman was arrested for aggravated assault in Lake Mary about 10 p.m. Friday and is being held at the John E. Polk Correctional Facility. During a court appearance Saturday morning, Zimmerman's bond was set at $5,000 and he was ordered to avoid contact with the woman who was not identified. Judge John Galluzzo gave few details of the incident, but said a wine bottle was involved and that the alleged assault happened at Zimmerman's home. Prosecutors questioned whether substance abuse treatment was needed, but the judge said that didn't seem to be a factor. After the brief hearing, Zimmerman's attorney, Don West, told the Orlando Sentinel  his client was arrested after allegedly throwing a wine bottle at his girlfriend several days ago. It is not known at this time who the girlfriend is but Zimmerman was known to be living with Samantha Scheibe earlier this year. Police arrested Zimmerman after his girlfriend told them about the row when they pulled her over for a routine traffic stop.

"Dawn French will reprise her role as Geraldine Granger for a one-off comedy as the Bishop of Dibley . She is surely Britain’s best-known clergywoman and now – if she has her way – she is set to become one of the first female bishops in the Church of England. Even if she is fictional. Geraldine Granger, better known as the Vicar of Dibley, is to return to TV screens for a one-off episode of the hit comedy inspired by the Church’s historic decision to allow women bishops. Dawn French has dusted down her dog collar and has spent the past few days filming a ‘Bishop of Dibley’ BBC special in Central London locations, including the Inner Temple. In the show, to be broadcast as part of Comic Relief’s Red Nose Day on March 13, Granger faces competition for the bishop’s job – with some of Britain’s biggest female comedy stars cast as her rivals. A source close to the production said: ‘Geraldine’s character assumes she is a shoo-in to become the Bishop of Dibley but the joke is that there are some other very unexpected names in the frame. Some big names have been cast as the rivals but to name them would give away the joke.’ French’s decision to return to the role comes just weeks after the Church of England announced that the Reverend Libby Lane will take over as suffragan Bishop of Stockport, becoming the Church of England’s first woman bishop after decades of debate. The Vicar of Dibley originally launched in 1994 following the General Synod’s decision to allow the ordination of women priests. Show creators Richard Curtis and Paul Mayhew-Archer consulted the Rev Joy Carroll, one of Britain’s first female vicars to ensure their scripts were true to life. The sitcom has addressed the issue of female bishops before, including in a 2013 Comic Relief sketch that revolved around a General Synod vote on lifting the ban. The actress dons a joke bishop's hat in a 2013 Comic Relief sketch (above). The episode will be broadcast on March 13 . And as long ago as 2008, French hinted that Geraldine could return as a bishop. ‘All I am saying is that Richard has got his eye on the ball,’ she said. ‘There are conversations, obviously, in the Anglican Church about female bishops – so watch this space!’ The new one-off special is being written by Curtis who co-founded Comic Relief with Lenny Henry, French’s ex-husband. A BBC spokesman said: ‘I can confirm there’s going to be a Dibley sketch for Red Nose Day on Friday, March 13, but I can’t confirm anything further or provide any more detail at this stage.’ A call to Richard Curtis’s home last night was answered by his wife Emma Freud, who has worked as a script editor on The Vicar Of Dibley, but she declined to comment. A spokesman for Comic Relief also declined comment.","Dawn French is to return to TV screens as Geraldine Granger for one-off .
