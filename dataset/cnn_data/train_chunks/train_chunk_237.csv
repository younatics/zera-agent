"(CNN) -- No one hopes Hurricane Sandy lives up to its potential. The storm that has already claimed nearly two dozen lives in the Caribbean churned Friday near the northern Bahamas, and meteorologists warn that it packs the potential to slam the U.S. Northeast as soon as Monday with powerful winds and pelting rain. Worst case, Sandy could merge with a strong cold front from the west. The double threat could morph into a ""superstorm"" that could sit over New England for days, making untold trouble for millions of residents. Weather experts said it's a recipe not unlike 1991's ""Perfect Storm."" ""Expect it to move very slowly,"" said James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center. ""The large size of the system and its slow motion will mean a long-lasting event with two to three days of impacts."" At 8 p.m. ET Friday, forecasters said Sandy was about 400 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, heading north at 7 mph. It was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph. It's possible, the hurricane center says, that Sandy may weaken to a tropical storm. Nonetheless, experts said, it's not to be taken lightly. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . ""Forget about the category with this,"" said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""When you have trees with leaves on them still, this kind of wind and rain on top of that, you're talking about trees that are going to come down, power lines are going to be out and the coastal flooding situation is going to be huge."" Sandy's death toll in Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba this week was 21 people. The U.S. target area is hard to predict at this point. Some landfall computer models show the storm striking somewhere between the border separating North Carolina and Virginia north to Connecticut, some of the most densely populated areas of the country. The District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and New York have declared states of emergency, while Maine's governor signed a limited emergency declaration. The National Hurricane Center reported tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect, covering parts of the Florida and Carolina coasts. With a national election already under way in many early-voting states, Sandy's wrath could have a ripple effect on politics. In Virginia Beach, a campaign rally scheduled for Sunday for GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was canceled because of Sandy. There was no word yet on the status of other events scheduled later in the week. ""We're keeping an eye on it,"" said a senior campaign adviser. How Sandy was dubbed 'Frankenstorm' Similarly, Vice President Joe Biden canceled his visit to Virginia Beach on Saturday, ""out of an abundance of caution to ensure that all local law enforcement and emergency management resources can stay focused on ensuring the safety of people who might be impacted by the storm,"" according to the campaign of President Barack Obama. Bad weather in Maryland or Washington, D.C., could make it harder for people to get out and cast their ballots. Early voting kicked off Monday in Washington and is scheduled to start Saturday in Maryland. But Friday, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley warned that his state's early voting could be affected by the pending storm, leaving open the possibility that the vote could be rescheduled, or relocated. U.S. residents in Sandy's path, forecasters said, should prepare for the possibility of several days without power. ""There is potential for widespread power outages, not just for a couple of days but for a couple of weeks or more, if the storm stays on track,"" said meteorologist Kathy Orr of CNN affiliate KYW-TV in Philadelphia. The computer weather predictions are murky, but by Friday afternoon, it seemed unlikely the storm would bring freezing rain or snow to the coast. Snow is possible in mountain areas, including the Appalachians. Sandy could be a storm ""of historic proportion,"" Orr warned, and the City of Brotherly Love could take a direct hit. In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is studying whether it should suspend all or some service ahead of the storm, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In Maryland, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company expects that several hundred thousand customers could be affected, as early as Sunday. ""This could be like the 'Perfect Storm' 21 years ago,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. A combination of three weather systems produced the famed ""Perfect Storm"" in the north Atlantic over Halloween 1991, when moisture flung north by Hurricane Grace combined with a high pressure system and a cold front, according to the weather service. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out . The current weather conditions are not exactly the same as what produced the tempest. Although Grace contributed significantly to the storm, it did not progress to New England and did not make landfall, weather records show. On Friday, residents in South Jersey were already stocking up on batteries and bottled water, and hardware stores have put up preparedness displays, KYW reported. One location quickly sold out of electric generators. ""This is the worst timing for a storm,"" Newark Mayor Cory Booker told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. ""You have fall ending, a lot of loose branches. ""The storm itself will be bad, but I worry about the aftermath, people being caught without power."" Along the Jersey shore, storm preparations included bulldozers shoring up piers with mounds of sand. Worried residents filled sandbags in case of flooding. 'Superstorm' meets barnstorm as weather and politics collide . ""We will be piling up as much sand as possible along the beachfront,"" said Frank Ricciotti, Margate, New Jersey, public works director. ""I think the water damage is worse than another type of damage, and the hardest thing is to stop water, once it starts coming up."" Farther south, in the Norfolk, Virginia, area, more than two dozen ships were being sent to sea for their own protection. Strong winds whipped Florida, where CNN iReporter Simon Davis shot video of an overcast Melbourne Beach. ""I was surprised at just how intense it was for a storm so far off the coast. I was thinking, wow and this is going north? Scary,"" he wrote. Miami International Airport on Friday canceled more than 20 flights to or from Jamaica or Bahamas, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. Nearby Fort Lauderdale airport canceled 13 flights to the islands. Stay well-fed in any disaster .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has accomplished some extraordinary things but can he really shoot down a fighter jet? The F-22 Raptor is the most expensive jet fighter ever built. The plane is the F-22 Raptor, a supersonic stealth marvel that looks like it's flown straight out of a Hollywood action film. It is being built for the U.S. Air Force, boasting the most advanced technology in the sky. ""You talk to any aviator in the world, ask what they would like to fly, and if they don't say the F-22 then they are lying,"" U.S. Major Derek Routt told The Atlantic magazine. ""I would kill to fly it."" The U.S. government has ordered nearly 200 of them, even as the price has rocketed to more than $350 million each, making the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 the most expensive fighter ever built. But it's never been used in combat and it's not clear when it will be. The U.S. simply doesn't face any enemies with planes advanced enough to bother sending out an F-22. ""The reality is we are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, ""and the F-22 has not performed a single mission in either theater."" Gates doesn't want any more of them. Obama, who campaigned for the presidency criticizing what he considers wasteful military spending, doesn't either. Is the F-22 essential military spending or a waste of money? Sound Off below . But it's the U.S. Congress that actually funds the military. A lot of its members want to see more F-22s taking off, to keep the U.S. air force ahead of potential rivals and protect thousands of factory jobs across the country. ""We need to maintain that air superiority,"" said Congressman Phil Gingrey, whose district is home to the main F-22 assembly line. ""This is not just about 2,200 jobs, although with the economy as it is, and all these job losses, it's kind of preposterous to think that this administration would close (them) down."" The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives has voted to order a dozen more planes. But the full Congress would still have to vote and Obama would have to sign the legislation. He says he will veto it instead. The president is taking aim at the F-22 but the fighter jet probably won't go down without a fight.","U.S. President Obama faces battle with Congress over new F-22 Raptor .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Investigators say they think a female suicide bomber caused a blast that ripped through a passenger bus in the southern Russian city of Volgograd on Monday afternoon, killing at least six people and injuring 33 others, Russian authorities said. Early indications are that the bomber was a 30-year-old woman from Russia's semiautonomous republic of Dagestan, Russia's Investigative Committee said. Video taken behind the bus from another vehicle -- aired by state-run TV outlet Russia 24 -- shows the bus moving on a busy road when the explosion occurred around 2 p.m., with at least one vehicle swerving out of the way. Of the 33 injured, eight were in critical condition Monday evening, the Investigative Committee said. Investigators say they think the bomber boarded the bus at a stop, and the blast happened shortly afterward, the committee said, citing in part a woman who survived the blast. Dagestan is part of Russia's North Caucasus region, where Islamic militants have been fighting Moscow's rule. Volgograd is more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) north-northwest of Dagestan's northern boundary.

"(CNN) -- When Superstorm Sandy hit New York, it blacked out Lower Manhattan and crippled the mass transit system. I was fortunate that the rising water from the East River never reached my home in Brooklyn. But it was heartbreaking to see many parts of my beloved city wounded and so many people struggling. When the ferry service was partially restored, I took the first boat with a friend to Lower Manhattan at dawn. We walked through the financial district -- normally bustling with activity -- where the traffic lights were dead and the streets were eerily quiet. Like my experiences after 9/11 or during the Blizzard of 2010 and the Northeast Blackout, people seemed more aware of each other. Strangers said good morning. People seemed to look out for each other, stopping to discuss the weather, the news or their personal stories in getting through the storm. ""Hey! Where'd you get that coffee?"" became a key conversation starter in a city where getting a coffee has always been so easy. We met a harried transit worker who said he had been working for several days straight without sleep, toiling on the massive project of pumping water out of the flooded subway tunnels and inspecting the tracks. He told us about incredible levels of water, mountains of rats and the unimaginable stench. Over the next two weekends, I volunteered in the Rockaways, an ocean-facing peninsula of Queens that was one of the most severely affected areas. I teamed up with Occupy Sandy volunteers, a disaster relief group of young men and women from St. Bonaventure University, to help the residents with cleanup and recovery. I also joined a volunteer group known as the Rockaway Renegades that was focused more on organizing relief efforts. Opinion: Photographers, embrace Instagram . Along the way, I met a man who had no family and lived alone and couldn't haul the wreckage from his home by himself. I helped sift through the soggy rubble for the personal artifacts that someone might hold dear and want to keep: family heirlooms, photos, high school diplomas. It was a gut-wrenching experience. I met residents who were adamant that I leave the area before dark, because roving gangs of looters came to homes at night. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . Despite their remarkably dreary circumstances, those affected by the storm stayed amazingly positive and hopeful. They were grateful for the help, or even just someone to talk to. Some of the communities showed their resilience by putting up Halloween and Christmas decorations as well as American flags, pulled out from the flooded basements and set up in comically absurd ways. In one street someone topped the mountain of sand washed several blocks inland with beach chairs and a sign that read ""lifeguard on duty."" Opinion: Rebuilding after Sandy is too big a risk . While many parts of New York resumed normalcy, there were whole neighborhoods that suffered and are still struggling. I felt frustrated that I could not help out in the cleanup as much as I would have liked. I was torn between the responsibility of my work and deadlines and the tugging feeling of wanting to drop everything to assist those in need. But I found a different way to help when I could not be on the ground. Throughout the weeks, I would share images and stories of my experiences through Instagram. The responses were overwhelming. Commenters from near and far asked how they could help, where to donate money or how to volunteer. I was glad to have a platform and an audience to provide information about local networks and initiatives, and nimble grass-roots organizations that were making an impact on people's lives in a direct way. It's important to remember that even as the effect of Superstorm Sandy recedes from the news, there are still devastated areas that are without electricity, heat or hot water. The outpouring of generosity has been incredible, but there is more to be done. There are high-rise apartment buildings with sick or elderly residents trapped in their freezing homes without enough food, water or medication who are unable to walk up and down several or dozens of flights of stairs to get what they need. There are lower-income areas of hard-hit neighborhoods that have not gotten much attention. These people will need help for weeks if not months. How you can help . For those who are interested in helping, OccupySandy.org is a great resource with up-to-date information. Its Twitter feed, @OccupySandy, is a constant sounding board for local initiatives with specific tasks. The most meaningful way to contribute is to be physically present in an affected area. There is no shortage in the need for helping hands, especially on weekdays and over the holidays. People who want to visit the scenes should recognize that residents have been through a lot. They're exhausted, they're chilly, sometimes they're frightened or frustrated or just plain overwhelmed. A hello and a kind word go a long way. As the cold winter arrives, let's not forget the disaster and the people whose lives have been turned upside down by it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steph Goralnick.","Steph Goralnick: It was heartbreaking to see how Sandy wounded New York .

"(CNN) -- The leaders of Sudan and South Sudan met Sunday in Ethiopia, attempting to resolve -- under international pressure -- issues arising from the latter nation's independence just over a year ago. The creation of South Sudan stemmed from a referendum, agreed to by leaders in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, in which people in the southern part of the landlocked African nation voted for independence. South Sudan formally became a new nation in July 2011, though significant issues with Sudan remain. Chief among them are the demarcation of the border between them, the possible creation of a demilitarized zone and the transportation and processing of oil from South Sudan, which got around 70% of the formerly united country's reserves when it became independent. On Sunday, top officials from the two countries, including South Sudan President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, met at the Sheraton Hotel in Addis Ababa in an attempt to bridge these differences. More on Sudan: Wanted president visits Egypt . Speaking from Ethiopia, Sudanese official Badreldin Abdalla said there had been ""progress"" in the talks, which were broken into different ""clusters"" reflecting the specific issues being discussed. ""They are going to have very substantive meetings to finalize the negotiations,"" Abdalla said. At the United Nations headquarters in New York, Sudan's ambassador to the U.N., Dafalla Al-Haj Yousif, likewise pointed to what he described as ""good progress in all the issues discussed between the two parties."" Members of the delegations plan to talk with officials in their respective capitals, then to meet again soon to ideally move even closer to a final resolution, he said. His South Sudanese counterpart at the United Nations, Francis Nazario, said his nation is committed to reaching an agreement in accordance with a U.N. resolution ""and the African Union roadmap"" -- which lays out details for a possible final deal, including setting up a demilitarized zone along the two countries' border. But Nazario said Sudan was not on board, at least yet. ""The Republic of South Sudan is concerned that the Sudan negotiating team has not accepted the African Union road map for the purpose of setting up the demilitarized zone,"" he said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice called Sudan's refusal to ""accept ... the map"" was ""an issue of utmost concern."" She said the international community is prepared to act to spur the countries to reach a resolution. ""Our aim is not to propose sanctions,"" Rice said. ""Our purpose is to spur the parties to meet their obligations and to create a foundation for lasting peace."" Peter Wittig, Germany's U.N. ambassador and the current president of the U.N. Security Council, noted the governments have failed to reach a peace deal in the past but said they cannot afford to let the disagreements linger. ""Council members shared the view that the suffering of the people ... requires that both sides act with a sense of urgency, and both parties should not allow technicalities to stand in the way,"" said Wittig.

"(CNN) -- A 23-year-old gunman killed two co-workers early Friday at a Pathmark supermarket in Old Bridge, New Jersey, and then shot himself to death, Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce J. Kaplan said. The shooter wielded an AK-47 assault rifle and a handgun, and was carrying multiple ammunition magazines, he added. ""I believe everyone in the store was a target,"" said Kaplan, who noted that the gunman fired 16 rounds during his attack. The gunman killed an 18-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man, and may have opened fire just before he walked into the store, he said, citing broken glass in front. There were between 12 and 14 night shift workers in the store, Kaplan said.

"(CNN) -- Two interim leaders of the war-torn Central African Republic have announced their resignations, the French Foreign Ministry said Friday. Interim President Michel Djotodia and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye said they were stepping down at the Central African States summit in N'Djamena, Chad, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement. The development comes despite an earlier denial from a Djotodia spokesman that the interim president was resigning at the regional summit in Chad. The country plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, the latest in a series of coups since it gained independence. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Djotodia, one of the Seleka leaders, became interim President. Since then, political turmoil and violence have spiraled. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and to counter the attacks on Christian communities, vigilante Christian groups have fought back. The United Nations has said it fears a genocide is brewing, and aid agencies warn of a humanitarian crisis. U.N. aid deliveries resume at capital's airport . Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency resumed aid deliveries earlier this week to an estimated 100,000 people who've sought refuge from the violence at the capital's international airport. The UNHCR had halted assistance to the refugees thronged at the airport in Bangui amid security concerns. But the distribution of food and supplies started again Tuesday after steps were taken to calm the situation, including the deployment of African Union and French peacekeeping troops around the airport, a news release said Thursday. The UNHCR will now distribute aid including blankets, sleeping mats, soap, mosquito nets and plastic sheets to some 20,000 families, or about 100,000 people, it said. ""It is a relief for UNHCR and the displaced people staying at the airport site. We had to suspend distribution of aid on several occasions, and were frustrated that we could not properly assist people living on this site due to security concerns,"" said Kouassi Lazare Etien, the agency's representative in the Central African Republic. People at the airport are ""living in a desperate situation,"" he added. More than 1,000 families have been moved to another part of the airport zone, which should ease the delivery of aid, the U.N. refugee agency said. It appealed Friday for $40.2 million to help respond to the crisis over the next three months. The money is intended to support more than 1 million people, the agency said, including 958,000 people displaced by fighting, many of whom are children. There are also more than 86,000 refugees in Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo who fled the Central African Republic in 2013, the UNHCR said. The latest appeal comes on the back of previous U.N. requests for funds and reflects the worsening situation in the country, the UNHCR said. The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders warned this week of measles outbreaks among children in camps in Bangui. The group is vaccinating 68,000 children in five camps to prevent an outbreak. Measles, which can be deadly to children, is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in overcrowded conditions.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea's neighbors have condemned the secretive nation's launch of a long-range rocket, with Seoul calling the launch a ""challenge and threat"" to stability on the Korean peninsula and the world at large. The rocket passed close to the territory of Japan and South Korea, but both have refrained from any retaliation. Japan said it did not take any action to destroy what it termed ""a missile,"" which passed over its territory near the island of Okinawa, and had not seen any signs of damage. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the launch was ""extremely regrettable."" Beijing, North Korea's main ally in the region, took a softer line. North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch . Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei expressed regret at North Korea's decision to launch despite the concerns of the international community. ""We hope relevant parties stay calm in order to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" the spokesman said. South Korea's government urged North Korea not to devote resources to developing missiles. ""North Korea will be further isolated from the international community after this launch,"" a statement from the presidential Blue House said. Debris from the rocket landed 300 km east of the Philippines, which urged Pyongyang to ""desist from acts of provocation."" A special broadcast on North Korean television struck a triumphant tone, declaring that its rocket had successfully put a satellite into orbit. The stakes were high after a botched attempt at launching a rocket in April. Ordinary South Koreans, meanwhile, worried about the motivations behind the launch. ""Confrontation isn't good, it will also cause military tension, but I think North Korea just wanted to show off,"" Kim Hyun-ok said. ""I am not happy with the continuous confrontation this launch will cause."" In a commentary published by state news agency Xinhua earlier in the day, Beijing said there was a ""dangerous lack of trust"" between North Korea and Japan, South Korea and the United States. It said Pyongyang should abide by U.N. resolutions but that the country had ""the right to conduct peaceful exploration of outer space."" North Korea shouts 'look at me' with rocket . Its reaction to North Korea's move and how it responds to any U.N. Security Council initiatives will be key. Japan has asked for a meeting of the Security Council and reports Wednesday suggest that a meeting may take place later in the day. Beijing is a major source of aid for North Korea and is thought to have the most leverage when it comes to reining in its nuclear ambitions. Analysts say, however, that Beijing is unlikely to take a hard line on its neighbor. China is thought to be primarily concerned with maintaining the status quo on the Korean peninsula given that any long-range missiles developed by North Korea are unlikely to be aimed at Beijing. Why did North Korea launch a rocket? ""From China's perspective it has very little interest or need to come down very hard on North Korea until the U.S, Japan and South Korea make it clear to China that allowing North Korea to do this is going to be more costly than cracking down on them,"" said Dean Cheng, research fellow in Chinese Political and Security Affairs at the Heritage Foundation. Cheng added that China does not have many subtle tools at its disposal when it comes to influencing Pyongyang's behavior. ""What they have is a giant hammer. They could hurt North Korea by shutting down all economic relations and trade, but that would likely generate a large number of refugees, something the Chinese aren't interested in."" American detained in North Korea . The U.N. has already passed two resolutions aimed at preventing North Korea from launching ballistic missile technology and suspending all activities related to its missile program. North Korea claims the rocket tests will enable it to launch a satellite but many nations consider the launches a cover for testing ballistic missiles. The U.S. tried to tighten sanctions against North Korea in the wake of April's failed launch by targeting banks, businesses and government entities that are violating the resolutions, but China vetoed all but three of the 40 entities the U.S. had suggested should be added to the sanction list. The other forum for engaging Pyongyang are the ""six-party talks"" between South Korea, Japan, China, the U.S. and Russia. Plans to resume the talks after Kim Jong Un took power in December, following the death of his father, were scuppered after North Korea's failed missile launch in April.

"(CNN) -- Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland on Tuesday gave a death-row inmate a one-week reprieve after authorities tried for hours to find a vein to administer his lethal injection. Romell Broom was convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old girl in Cleveland, Ohio. ""Difficulties in administering the execution protocol necessitate a temporary reprieve,"" said Strickland's Warrant of Reprieve, filed in court Tuesday afternoon in the case of inmate Romell Broom. Broom's defense attorney, Tim Sweeney, wrote Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Moyer on Tuesday that, ""I am advised by my co-counsel, Adele Shank, who is at the prison in Lucasville, that the execution team has been attempting since approximately 1 p.m. this afternoon to obtain IV access to a site in Mr. Broom's body in order for the lethal injections to be administered, but without any success. ""It appears ... that these efforts have been going on now for almost two hours, and that the execution team members have evidently now taken a 'break,' "" Sweeney wrote. Broom's execution was initially scheduled for 10 a.m. ET, but was delayed for legal reasons and rescheduled for Tuesday afternoon, Sweeney told CNN. ""When such allegedly skilled professionals have taken this much time without successfully achieving IV access, there comes a point of diminishing returns, and a point when further attempts are cruel and counterproductive,"" Sweeney wrote to Moyer. ""I believe we have reached that point here."" Sweeney had earlier said he was in the process of filing an appeal to halt the execution for Tuesday, claiming it was not being carried out according to the state constitution. Calls by CNN to state officials were not immediately returned. Strickland's document directs the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction to carry out Broom's execution on September 22, ""unless further reprieve or clemency is granted."" Broom, 52, was convicted of murdering a 14-year-old girl in Cleveland in 1984, according to a death clemency report. In May 2006, Ohio officials took nearly 90 minutes to carry out the execution of Joseph Clark because of problems finding a vein. Once they did find one, it collapsed, according to the Toledo Blade. Clark repeatedly shook his head, according to the newspaper, and told officials, ""It don't work.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The rocket launched earlier this month by North Korea had the capability to travel more than 6,000 miles, meaning this type of rocket could strike the United States, South Korean defense officials said. In remarks to reporters Friday, which were embargoed until Sunday, three officials with South Korea's defense ministry offered their observations about the December 12 launch based on a recovered oxidizer tank that had been part of one of the rocket's boosters. According to NASA, an oxidizer tank contains oxygen compounds that allow rocket fuel to burn in the atmosphere and outside of it, in space. North Korean officials cheered what they hailed as a successful launch of a long-range rocket, which they said put a satellite in orbit. But the mission drew international condemnation, with many viewing it as cover for testing of ballistic missile technology, which the United Nations has forbidden Pyongyang from using. Timeline: North Korea's rocket-fueled obsession . The South Korean military officials said the evidence they found helps show their nuclear-equipped rival's intent and progress in developing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Based on a simulation, the officials estimated the rocket can travel more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles), meaning it could reach the U.S. mainland from North Korea. It can carry a payload of about 500 to 600 kilograms (about 1,100 to 1,320 pounds). The oxidizer tank used red fuming nitric acid, based on technology the officials said originated in the former Soviet Union and can now be found in Iran. They said an Internet analysis suggests a technological connection between North Korea and Iran, though there is no firm evidence that any of the parts discovered thus far were imported from another country. Read more: North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch . The South Korean officials said the oxidizer tank appeared to be produced using rudimentary technology, suggesting it may have been made by hand. The rocket launch's success, after years of failed attempts, triggered worries among world leaders about nuclear weapons, Iran and the balance of power in the Pacific. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called it a ""clear provocation."" Experts do not believe North Korea has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that Pyongyang has now proved it can send long distance. But the launch did allow the regime to flex its military and technological muscle on the world stage. Read more: North Korea holds little sway in South Korea's election . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ""stressed the need to continue to launch satellites in the future,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency said in a report this month, raising the prospect of more controversial moves to come.

Kerry is in Seoul meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se amid heightened tensions spurred by North Korea's recent nuclear threats and provocations. He landed in Seoul, about 30 miles from the demilitarized zone separating the two countries. The Korean peninsula is rife with tensions over the belligerent threats issued by Pyongyang. The United States will defend itself and its allies if needed, Kerry said. ""North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" he said at a news conference with Yun. ""The rhetoric that we are hearing is simply unacceptable."" Pentagon intelligence assessment suggesting North Korea may have the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon on a missile has set off a flurry in Washington, with top officials trying to play down concerns about the capabilities of the Pyongyang regime. The Pentagon's intelligence arm has assessed with ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea has the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile, though the reliability is believed to be ""low."" First disclosed by a congressman at a hearing Thursday and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department, the assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program. Will Kim Jong Un listen to China? The United States calculates that a test launch of mobile ballistic missiles could come at any time. But a senior administration official said there is no indication that missiles that North Korea is believed to be readying for tests have been armed with any nuclear material. The surprising development comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks, including that of a possible nuclear strike. Kerry's Asia trip will include visits to China and Japan. The tour comes at a time when all three countries have new leaders. The North Korea we rearely see . It's the first time the Obama administration is engaging with all three countries in the same trip, the State Department said. The top U.S. diplomat's trip comes days after he warned the North on what he calls leader Kim Jong Un's ""provocative ... dangerous, reckless"" rhetoric and actions. China, U.S. officials say, is growing more concerned about the North's provocations, but it also is closely watching Washington's latest military moves in the region. Report sparks intel controversy . Kerry will try to convince leaders in Beijing that Pyongyang is ""putting China's own interests at risk,"" a senior administration official said. Pyongyang's provocations are the immediate threat, but the Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"" has broader strategic implications for Beijing. Throughout his Asia swing, Kerry will have to balance his short-term and long-term diplomatic objectives. ""Secretary Kerry can reassure regional states that, as a Pacific century dawns, the United States will continue to be right in the middle of it and will not allow any power to edge the United States out of a region where nearly every country welcomes its leadership,"" said Daniel Twining, the German Marshall Fund's senior fellow for Asia. ""He should also make clear that the United States will not countenance aggression against any territory covered by the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and commit to working closely with Japan to meet security challenges across Asia, starting with North Korea.""","NEW: The United States will defend itself and its allies if needed, Kerry says .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Former hostage Ingrid Betancourt hugged the children she hadn't seen for six years Thursday, and marveled at how they'd grown. Ingrid Betancourt, center, hugs her daughter Melanie and son Lorenzo in Bogota, Colombia, on Thursday. Betancourt, 46, was reunited with her daughter, Melanie Delloye, and son, Lorenzo Delloye-Betancourt, a day after she and 14 others were rescued from leftist rebels in the jungles of Colombia. The three tearfully clung together on the steps of a plane that had just arrived from France at a Colombian airport, hugging and kissing each other fervently before disappearing inside the plane. Betancourt told reporters at the airport that her children looked ""beautiful"" and she was proud of them.  Watch Betancourt describe her joy at reunion » . ""They look so different, but they look so much the same at the same time,"" Betancourt said. ""I have so many dreams that I want to share with them. I have so many things that I want to say to them,"" she said. Betancourt's son, Lorenzo, said it was hard to describe his feelings when he found out his mother had been freed. ""I can't give it a name,"" he said.  ""It was too much happiness to know that after six years that I had not been able to see my mother, to know that I was going to be able to hold her, tell her that I love her."" Betancourt and both children called for action to free other hostages still held by the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC for its initials in Spanish. ""We need to keep fighting so this moment [of reunion] will come for everyone,"" Melanie said. The FARC, which has battled Colombia's government and right-wing paramilitary groups for years, is believed to hold roughly 750 prisoners in the nation's remote jungles.  Background: A closer look at FARC » . The children, now adults, were accompanied on the plane by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. Kouchner called the reunion ""a magical moment."" ""The incredible force behind Betancourt's family is going to serve to free other people in captivity,"" he said. Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said Betancourt will travel to Paris on Thursday night. Hours after the military operation that freed 15 hostages, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe urged peace by calling on FARC to release all hostages. The Colombian military infiltrated the group and deceived its members into giving up the hostages, including Betancourt, according to the country's defense ministry. Uribe called the daring operation ""an unbelievable military achievement and an honor to humanity."" No shots were fired in the operation. The security forces who deceived the rebels ""are entering the page of the heroes of humanity,"" Uribe said. Along with Betancourt, three American contractors and 11 Colombian police and military personnel were rescued. The Americans -- Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves and Thomas Howes -- arrived in the United States Wednesday night. The Colombians were with their families and friends in Bogota.  Biographies: Who are the hostages? » . Betancourt was abducted February 23, 2002, after venturing into rebel territory in the south while campaigning for the Colombian presidency. Betancourt described later Thursday aspects of her captivity, saying that the hostages lived with death daily, both in the sense that the FARC members could kill them, and in the desire to cut short one's captivity. ""The temptation of suicide ... was constant in all of us,"" she said. She has called the rescue operation ""a miracle."" She recalled how her day began on Wednesday, waking up at 4:30 a.m. and saying the rosary before being told by her guards that she and the other hostages were to be transferred to another location, where their detention was to continue. ""My heart broke because I did not want another transfer, another time, in captivity,"" she said.  Watch Betancourt describe feeling guilty for being kidnapped » . But her guard, a woman, was unmoved and ordered Betancourt to cross a river to the pickup spot -- ""very harsh, move, hurry up fast, as always,"" she said. Soon, two white helicopters approached and several men approached the FARC commanders who were overseeing their transfer, she said. ""They spoke with Commander Enrique and Cesar,"" she said of her captors. As she looked closer, she saw that the men from the helicopter were wearing shirts emblazoned with the likeness of Che Guevara, the Argentine hero of the Cuban revolution. ""I thought, this is FARC,"" she said. Placed in handcuffs, Betancourt got into the helicopter, still unaware of what was happening. ""They closed the helicopter doors, the helicopter started flying and suddenly there was something happening,"" she said. ""Suddenly I saw the commander who, during four years, had been at the head of our team, who so many times was so cruel and humiliated me, and I saw him on the floor naked with bound eyes."" It was only then that the reality of liberation hit home. ""The chief of operations said, 'We are the national army, and you are all free,' and the helicopter almost fell because we started jumping, we screamed, we cried, we hugged. We couldn't believe it.""  Watch Betancourt describe her feelings during the rescue » . Betancourt described the operation as ""a miracle"" and ""a moment of pride"" in Colombia. Betancourt added that she hopes that FARC commanders would not punish the guards who were fooled. It was not their fault, she said; the operation was too perfect for them to detect the deceit. Asked if she still wants to be president, Betancourt said, ""If I continue with the dream to serve Colombia, yes, from the presidency, only God knows. At this moment, I just want to feel like another soldier, another soldier for Colombia, in the service of the fatherland."" It is estimated that FARC, which has fought a long and complicated conflict with the Colombian government and right-wing paramilitary groups, still holds more than 700 hostages. The organization defends its taking of captives as a legitimate act of war. The U.S. government considers the group a terrorist organization and refused to negotiate with it while publicly urging the group to release the three Americans also freed in Wednesday's rescue operation. Eleven FARC leaders, including the two commanders taken in Wednesday's operation -- Gerardo Antonio Aguilar Ramirez, known as ""Cesar,"" and Alexander Farfan Suarez, known as ""Gafas""-- have been federally indicted in Washington on charges of supporting a foreign terrorist organization and hostage taking. The two commanders appeared at a news conference in Colombia later Thursday with Gen. Mario Montoya. Gafas appeared to have a black eye. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who brokered earlier this year the release of six FARC hostages, characterized on Thursday the FARC practice of hostage-taking as ""an intolerable behavior."" Although the leftist president had once called for diplomatic recognition of FARC as legitimate combatants, he has recently changed his stance, saying they should lay down their arms. A Colombian military strike earlier this year on a FARC camp inside Ecuador led to the seizure of computers that held a wealth of intelligence about the group, including alleged links between Chavez and the rebels. The Venezuelan president denies the accusation.

"(CNN) -- The death rate from cancer in the United States has dropped dramatically in the last two decades, according to a new report from the American Cancer Society. American cancer death rates have risen consistently since the 1900s; they peaked in 1991 at 215.1 deaths per 100,000 in the population. The 2009 death rate, which just became available, is 173.1 per 100,000. That's a 20% decline in cancer death rates from 1991. The report also includes grim news. The ACS estimates 1.6 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer and more than 580,000 will die of cancer in 2013. As has been the case for decades, only cardiovascular disease will kill more Americans. The report, released Thursday, compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality and survival. It is based on data gathered by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. The decline in deaths from 1991 to 2009 is clear evidence of progress in the fight against cancer. It is far more powerful than other statistics such as increasing survival rates or declining incidence rates. The 20% decrease translates into the prevention of 1.18 million cancer deaths. In 2009 alone, nearly 153,000 cancer deaths were prevented. Cancer now No. 1 killer of U.S. Hispanics . There were declines in the death rates for a number of major cancers. Lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer make up nearly half of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. All four had greater than 30% decreases in mortality rates. The single biggest reason for this good news is reduction in smoking rates. Improvements in early detection and cancer treatment also contributed to the decline. Analysis of the data tells us that we can do better. Substantially more lives could be saved if existing methods of cancer prevention and treatment were practiced more widely. This is incredibly important as the U.S. population increases in size and the proportion of older Americans grows. The leading cause of cancer in the United States is smoking. More than one in five Americans still smoke. In some states, such as Kentucky and Missouri, nearly 30% of residents smoke. These states have the highest cancer death rates. In other states, such as California and Utah, smoking rates are as low as 10%. These states have the lowest cancer death rates. The obesity epidemic is also affecting cancer rates in a very negative way. Indeed, obesity is the second leading cause of cancer. More than a dozen cancers -- from breast and prostate cancer to pancreatic and colon cancer -- have been linked to America's epidemic of high caloric intake and lack of physical activity. While 15% of adults were obese in 1970, more than 35% were obese in 2010. Even more concerning, 4% of children aged 6 to 11 were obese in 1970; 20% of that group were obese in 2010. While overall there is a significant decline in cancer mortality, the obesity epidemic is continuing to push the cancer mortality rate upward. A substantial proportion of Americans do not receive the high-quality preventive and treatment services that experts agree people should get. More than a third of women over 50 are not getting routine breast cancer screening. Nearly half of Americans over 50 are not getting colon cancer screening. These are interventions about which there is no controversy. Value of mass prostate cancer screenings questioned . Even more unsettling, a substantial number of Americans diagnosed with cancer are unable to get adequate treatment. If we simply get adequate medical care to those who need it, more lives could be saved.

"(CNN) -- There is an old African proverb: ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together."" That was the guiding principle behind the International Roundtable on China-Africa Health Cooperation this week in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. This is the fourth such annual conference -- and the first to be held on African soil. The roundtable brought together Chinese and African health ministry officials, academics, members of the private sector, and representatives of such international organizations as the World Health Organization, Global Fund, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI Alliance and United Nations entities. Over two days, we tackled such topics as malaria, AIDS, reproductive health, and schistosomiasis â€” health issues that China has largely brought under control but remain major health challenges in Africa. China and the countries of Africa have much to unite them. We fought to free ourselves from colonialism; we view health as a key building block for economic development; and we are learning to build upon traditional economic development models that have allowed our societies to make progress. Sharing these values and history, we are pioneering a new South-to-South model based on mutual interests and respect. To be sure, there is a long history of China and Africa collaboration on health. In the 1960s, China began sending medical teams to the continent. More recently, China has built hospitals and medical centers in many African countries. China has also provided medical training to African health professionals and is building capacity in other ways, such as providing scholarships to train health experts. Going forward, we all foresee a stronger collaboration. Many African countries could benefit from low-cost, high-quality Chinese-made health products. China has made enormous strides in the manufacture of drugs, vaccines and other health products. It is the world's largest producer of the active ingredients for malaria treatments and antiretroviral drugs against HIV/AIDS. China also makes implantable contraceptive devices that provide women with birth control for several years. China also makes simple and inexpensive rings allowing men to be circumcised, which can greatly reduce the risk of contracting HIV, without undergoing surgery. China can also provide refrigeration equipment and logistical support for the ""cold chains"" needed to safely deliver many vaccines to remote communities. All these have great relevance to Africa. But collaboration is a two-way street. Participants at the meeting shared lessons learned in delivering health services to their people. Many countries, including Botswana and Zambia, have made enormous gains in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, even in rural areas. China can learn much from this progress as it provides services to its remote communities. The relationship between China and Africa has of course been long and complex, and not without misunderstandings. Chinese investment in Africa has gained global attention because of its scale. Chinese-built roads, buildings, dams, airports, hospitals and railways are visible across the continent. So, too, are the tensions that have on occasion emerged due to different styles of management and communication. This is why these face-to-face meetings are so valuable. They pave the way for our long walk together. We are also grateful so many international organizations are joining us for this journey. They bring a wealth of experience working in both Africa and China and can help bridge many technical gaps that South-to-South collaboration cannot address. The results of this partnership will be sustainable, African-owned solutions to many of the continent's greatest health challenges. Of course, we still have far to walk before all people with AIDS, malaria and TB receive the treatments and dignity they deserve; before all children are immunized; before all women have access to safe and effective contraception; and before neglected tropical diseases are eradicated forever. But, I am encouraged that we are walking together, and in the right direction. It's only fair, since I opened with an African proverb, to close with a Chinese saying: ""Numerous grains of earth make a mountain; numerous drops of water form an ocean."" As long as we keep advancing China-Africa cooperation, we will build those mountains, fill those oceans and provide all of our people with the sustainable health solutions they deserve.","4th International Roundtable on China-Africa Health Cooperation held in Botswana .

"London (CNN) -- Several major advertisers in the United Kingdom are pulling advertising from the UK's News of the World newspaper amid a wave of public outrage over a phone hacking scandal. Carmakers Ford and Vauxhall, Virgin Holidays, Halifax and the Co-operative Group are among those to say they are withdrawing adverts that were scheduled to run in the newspaper. Other big firms, including cell phone providers T-Mobile and Orange and utility firm Npower, say they are reviewing their position with regard to advertising in light of the turmoil over the allegations against media baron Rupert Murdoch's flagship British Sunday paper. The scandal around the News of the World widened Wednesday, with the father of a victim of the 2005 London terror attacks saying his phone may have been hacked. That followed claims Tuesday that its journalists also hacked into the phone messages of missing teenager Milly Dowler, who was later found to have been murdered. Prime Minister David Cameron called the allegations ""absolutely disgusting."" Ford was among the first to act to distance itself from News of the World, saying Tuesday that it was ""concerned by the serious nature of the allegations of past activities against the News of the World, and the high level of public concern."" ""While we are not prejudging the outcome of the ongoing investigations, we believe it is appropriate to suspend advertising in the News of the World pending the outcome. In the interim, we will advertise in alternative media within and outside the News International Group."" Vauxhall said it had suspended advertising in the News of the World and would ""reconsider its position pending the outcome of investigations into the allegations of phone hacking."" The Halifax bank said in a statement its action was in response to public anger over the story. ""In recognising and responding to consumer reaction, Halifax has cancelled an advertisement in this Sunday's News of the World. This was a tactical decision in the short term whilst we carefully consider our longer term position and its implications."" Carmaker Renault said it had no advertising planned with News of the World and would not commit to any future advertising pending the outcome of formal investigations, ""as a result of the seriousness of the continued allegations."" The scandal has prompted calls for a public boycott of the paper -- and its parent company News International -- on social media sites including Facebook and Twitter. A message at the top of the Boycott News of the World Facebook group, which had more than 5,100 members as of Wednesday, said: ""By boycotting this newspaper we can send a message that they are not above the law and their behaviour is heinous and despicable."" Parenting website Mumsnet also said Wednesday it would pull the current advertising campaign for Sky, which is part of Murdoch's media empire, from its website -- at a cost of some £20,000 to £30,000 to itself -- ""as members who are pretty much unanimously shocked and disgusted by the News of the World's actions in hacking Milly Dowler's phone thought it incongruous that Mumsnet was carrying advertising for Sky at the present time."" However, analyst Douglas McCabe, of media research firm Enders Analysis, told CNN the cost of the advertisers' actions and any public boycott to News of the World and News International was likely to be limited in the long term. ""There's not a mass of material revenue impact on the business short term,"" he said. ""Reputation going forward will be tricky for them to manage and there could be longer term implications if more advertisers pull and they pull for a longer period of time -- but at this point, there's very little impact,"" he said. The loss of revenue for News of the World as a result of advertising being withdrawn this weekend would be in the realm of tens of thousands of dollars, he said. ""The question is, do more businesses jump on the band wagon effect, and suddenly does it extend through the inquiry for a significant period?"" He estimates that 40% of total revenue for the News of the World and its daily sister paper, The Sun, comes from advertising, putting its value at about £260 million ($418 million) a year. Responding to the phone hacking allegations, Murdoch's News Corp. said Wednesday: ""We are committed to addressing these issues fully and have taken a number of important steps to prevent them from happening again."" CNN's Kendra Petersen contributed to this report.","Ford says it will suspend advertising in News of the World pending the investigation .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal ensured that top spot in the Premier League changed hands for the third time in as many days when winning 2-1 at Aston Villa on Monday. Leaders on Saturday morning, the Gunners first saw Chelsea move into pole position as Jose Mourinho's side won 2-0 at Hull. By Sunday afternoon, the team sitting on top of an enthralling Premier League was Manchester City after Manuel Pellegrini's side survived a scare at Newcastle to also win 2-0. Chelsea have 46 points, Manchester City boast 47 but Arsenal, who sat third prior to kick-off, are now back in front with 48 - thanks to a magical minute that took the tie away from the hosts. Just after the half hour, Jack Wilshere gave Arsenal the lead and within a minute Oliver Giroud had doubled that advantage. ""It's a massive three points -- especially because we dropped a bit in the second half,"" Wilshere told Sky Sports television. ""In the past we used to feel the nerves when we were up against it. But this season we haven't."" Villa produced little until Christian Benteke's first goal since September provided a rousing finish, with the visitors holding on for a crucial victory. The win avenged Arsenal's defeat at home to Aston Villa on the opening day of the season, which prompted many Gunners fans to call for the head of coach Arsene Wenger. The Frenchman must have felt a degree of satisfaction at the health of his team come the return fixture, with Arsenal having topped the table for much of the season. Without a trophy since 2005, Arsenal are bidding to win their first Premier League title in ten years. In Italy, struggling Inter Milan failed to use home advantage to beat Verona, the team lying immediately below them in the table, and the 1-1 draw ended with the hosts being booed off by their own fans. Victory at the San Siro would have closed the gap on fourth-placed Fiorentina to three points, but the draw still leaves Walter Mazzarri's side five points adrift. Inter have won just one of their last seven league games, with the solitary success coming in the derby against Milan just prior to Christmas. Earlier on Monday, Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri was sacked following the seven-time European champions' dismal start to the season, trailing leaders Juventus by 30 points.","Arsenal win 2-1 at Aston Villa to regain control of the English Premier League .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- When trouble strikes in our personal lives and we are searching for a source, it usually makes sense to take a look in a familiar place -- the mirror. And so it should be in our troubled politics today. Many of us are deeply angry at politicians in Washington and the broken government they have created. We tend to look down upon them as jackasses and ideologues who are incapable of organizing a two-car funeral. We blame special interests for capturing them, a 24/7 media for encouraging them, and power for corrupting them. Indeed, a list of reasons for broken government could -- and will -- fill a week of columns. But perhaps we give too little attention to the basic notion that our politicians are also a reflection of the public they represent. As the old saying goes, we get the president we deserve -- and usually the Congress, too. In truth, our fractured politics are due in no small part to a fractured country -- one in which consensus and moderation are disappearing. With apologies to President Truman: the buck stops here. Those of us who are older -- born somewhere close to midcentury -- grew up in an America where there was a general consensus that the United States was a great nation, that you could be a success if you worked hard and played by the rules, that government had a positive role to play when trouble hit, and that politics must stop at the water's edge as we united against dangerous enemies. But with Vietnam, the tumult of the '60s and '70s, Watergate and more, our sense of common purpose began collapsing. Listen for a moment to three of the smartest observers in the country who have weighed in this week on the collapse. In this week's New York Magazine, columnist Frank Rich argues that by the late 1960s, ""the bipartisan national consensus over the central role of government -- which had held firm through the Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations -- was kaput. The Reagan revolution was in the wings."" We also began to lose faith in ourselves and our values. In an interview with the Financial Times early this week, Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School chimed in with pained observations about what is happening to American competitiveness: ""This is shocking for the U.S. If you go back 100 years, you find that the U.S. was a huge pioneer in public education. ... The U.S. was a real pioneer in creating a national, very deep university system. ... The U.S. was a pioneer in the interstate highway system. ... We stepped to the plate in the past and made very, very bold investments in the fundamental environment for competitiveness. But right now, we can't seem to agree on any of these things."" Or listen to William Galston, who was instrumental in helping President Clinton bridge the divides in politics. In the New Republic, he argues that the middle is shrinking in politics. In 1992, he points out, Gallup found that 43% of respondents identified themselves as moderates, 37% as conservatives, and 17% as liberals. In 2009, conservatives and liberals were each up 4% and moderates were down by 7%. Similarly, a study of national election data by Alan Abramovitz found that in 1984, some 41% identified themselves at the midpoint of an ideological scale versus 10% who placed themselves at liberal or conservative extremes. By 2005, the number who identified themselves at the center had dropped to only 28%, while the number at the endpoints had risen to 23%. We continue to hear that even so, independents have the whip hand in electoral politics and we tend to assume that they are middling in their views, open to argument, and rather homogeneous. But even these assumptions seem doubtful. Frank Rich, for example, highlights a recent Pew survey that suggests that nearly half of independents are actually Democrats (21%) or Republicans (26%) who just shy away from the label, while another 20% are more populist, skeptical Democrats (""Doubting Dems""), 16% are ""disaffected"" voters with a highly negative view of government, and 17% are ""disengaged"" altogether. Not exactly a portrait of moderate unity. Surely there are many sources of the fractures in today's electorate, just as there are many social scientists more qualified to take a crack at explaining them. But one potential contributing factor comes from a fascinating piece in National Affairs by Marc Dunkelman, who fears the winnowing out of so-called ""middle-tier relationships"" for the American citizen. These relationships have long been, as Dunkelman puts it, ""at the root of American community life,"" and encompass such different-minded acquaintances as ""bridge partners, brothers in the Elks club, fellow members of the PTA."" But these connections have withered in recent years, even as we stay close to those like-minded folks who inhabit our inner circles of friends and family, and are connected on an unprecedented scale by technology and social media to those farther away. Without these vibrant, heterogeneous ""middle-tier"" relationships, Dunkelman argues, it may simply be much harder to build the sense of public trust and unity that allows people to stand up to big challenges together. The good news is that, as with any self-inflicted wound, the power is in our hands to change course. And indeed there is a growing sense in the country that people are finally getting tired of this particularly rancid level of divisiveness. There is a generation rising -- singled out in a recent TIME Magazine cover story as ""The Next Greatest Generation"" -- that, led by its young military veterans, is eager to put aside partisan squabbles to get things done. The bipartisan group No Labels recently convened a conference call with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz that they reported drew more than 100,000 participants. And even in Washington itself, Lamar Alexander, a senior Republican senator, recently quit his leadership post so he could devote more time to forging consensus and working across the aisle. So there is cause for hope. In the meantime, it is up to us to continue to hold those in the halls of power accountable for results and not just party orthodoxy, and to expose ourselves to people outside our handpicked inner sanctums, ideas and opinions outside our own ideologies, and even news sources different from our favorites (unless you're a regular CNN viewer, of course). Politics in this country has always been rough-and-tumble, and so it should be.

"(CNN) -- Anna Nicole Smith's estate is not entitled to $300 million the deceased actress had claimed was intended as a gift from her oil tycoon husband, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. Smith, a former Playboy pinup and stripper, fought for more than a decade with a son of J. Howard Marshall over a fortune estimated as much as $1.6 billion. It was a court battle that outlived the chief combatants. Marshall's son, E. Pierce Marshall, died in 2006, and Smith died in 2007 from what a Florida medical examiner ruled was ""acute combined drug intoxication."" Her 3-year-old daughter is her sole heir. In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a federal appeals panel in California to reconsider its ruling against Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall. The judges' newest decision pointed to a Texas jury's verdict that the money was not a gift as the chief reason for denying Smith's claim. ""The district court should have afforded preclusive effect to the Texas probate court's factual findings and relevant legal conclusions,"" Friday's ruling said. Smith's attorneys claim that apart from the will and trust, Howard Marshall promised his young wife a share of assets earned while they were married. The Yale-educated businessman was 89 in 1994, when he married the 26-year-old Texan. They had met a few years earlier at a strip club where she worked. Marshall died a year after the wedding, but Smith, according to legal briefs filed with the court, was not given a share of the estate in the will or separate trust. Smith claimed that Marshall's son ""used fraud and undue influence"" in his father's last months to have him leave Smith out of his will. State and federal courts have disagreed over whether Smith should receive any part of the estate. ""The lies that were told about told about E. Pierce Marshall have finally been put to rest,"" Marshall's family said in a written statment. ""Pierce Marshall was never intimidated by Anna Nicole and her bevy of contingency fee lawyers' use of her celebrity and the legal system to try to loot J. Howard's estate."" A U.S. bankruptcy judge initially awarded Smith $474 million, which later was reduced to about $90 million. A federal appeals court eventually dismissed the entire award. A Texas probate court also dismissed her claims.","NEW: ""Lies ... have finally been put to rest,"" Marshall family says .

"(CNN) -- Chilean football legend Elias Figueroa will not be challenging Sepp Blatter for the presidency of world football's governing body FIFA this year. The 64-year-old had stated his intention to challenge for soccer's top job in elections on June 1 but has now pulled out of the race saying there wasn't enough time to put together a credible bid. As things stand currently that leaves Qatar's Mohammed Bin Hammam -- leader of the Asian Football Confederation -- as the only challenger to Blatter. Figueroa said in a statement: ""I have decided not to accept...for the sole reason that I'm sure with such a short time in which to state a case I could not prepare one worthy of the magnitude and importance of such a distinguished job."" The three-time South American player of the year had revealed he was the preferred candidate for an organization called Change FIFA but was struggling to attract support from any of the 208 member countries. Change FIFA is a campaign that has been courting federations for a presidency nomination, although it is believed they will need to raise funds of $500,000 for a two-month campaign. Blatter has already confirmed that he will seek re-election for one more four-year term before retiring in 2015. Meanwhile, Blatter has revealed he believes goalline technology will be in place in time for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil. The Swiss made the claims in an exclusive interview with French television channel TF1.","Chilean legend Elias Figueroa has pulled out of the race to become FIFA president .

"(CNN) -- Italian Simone Bertazzo climbs into the cockpit of his Ferrari. He straps on his helmet and slides his hands into his gloves. In his mind he prepares to go fast -- very fast. Over the next two minutes he will navigate a hair-raising track, grappling for control of his ""Prancing Horse"" at speeds in excess of 90 mph as his body strains and contorts. But Bertazzo is not behind the wheel of a Formula One car and perhaps even more disconcertingly there's no safety belt to restrain him should things go awry. Instead he is at the front end of a bobsled and the driver for the Italian team heading to the 2014 Winter Games. The bobsled Bertazzo and compatriots will pilot is the latest product of collaboration between the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) and the country's legendary automotive manufacturer, who are providing design input to hopefully deliver medal success in Sochi in next year's Winter Olympics. ""The idea was to share the knowledge between our institute and Ferrari to try to improve all the sports where technology plays a big part in the results,"" CONI deputy general secretary Carlo Mornati told CNN. ""The first option was to start with something that was very similar to the cars, to F1 and I think, in the world of sport, the bobsled was the first option."" Ferrari is synonymous with high performance, from its sleek, stylish road cars to the F1 machines which have made it the most the most successful constructor in the sport's history. CONI's partnership with Ferrari dates back to 2006, with a Maranello-designed sled taking to the track at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. Two years later at the Youth Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, Ferrari's two-man sled was piloted to gold by Patrick Baumgartner and Alessandro Grande. Now Bertazzo will bid to replicate his younger countrymen's success by guiding his sled to the top of the podium in February. ""Ferrari has listened to our advice to the letter, studying every little detail and CONI has played a crucial role in coordination,"" Bertazzo said in a statement released by the CONI earlier this month. F1 and bobsled are sports where thousandths of a second can be the difference between success and failure, small margins within which Ferrari's team of engineers are used to operating. ""We have selected from our F1 team and our road cars department some engineers who have achieved some brilliant results in F1 and were looking for new opportunities within the company,"" explained Ferrari engineer Ferdinando Cannizzo. ""After that we set up a brand new team, defined a new area and put this team to work on this new program. ""Clearly a new team is a new challenge, but it seems that results are coming, so we succeed."" CONI is not the only Olympic committee looking to motorsport for a competitive edge. The British team will be riding a sled developed in conjunction with McLaren, while the Americans will be piloting a BMW-crafted sled at the newly-built Sanki sliding center. But Ferrari's involvement with CONI doesn't end with bobsled. Other winter disciplines such as skiing have benefited from wind tunnel testing and Ferrari's knowledge of aerodynamics, as well as Summer Games sports such as archery, rowing, canoeing and kayaking. Ferrari's work in all of those events involves helping an object move through the air, water or snow with minimal drag, which is where aerodynamics engineer Luciano Mariella comes in. ""At the moment our aerodynamic approach is based on wind tunnel tests and numerical simulation based on commutation of fluid dynamics,"" explained Mariella. ""This is the most important approach because every tool has its strengths and weaknesses and the integrated approach is telling us how to achieve the best possible results."" If Mariella and his team get in right, then there should be nothing but clear air between the Italian team and Olympic gold in Sochi.","Italy will ride a Ferrari-designed bobsled at the 2012 Winter Games .

"(CNN) -- It was once a game of luck using misshapen stones from Scotland's riverbeds first thought to be played out on frozen waters in the mid-16th Century. In the four-and-a-half centuries since, a sport often referred to as ""chess on ice"" has become increasingly high tech, more reliant on the science behind the friction element of stone on ice that affects the outcome of every match. For the most puzzling sport at the Winter Olympics, no stone is being is being left unturned in the pursuit of gold at Sochi in 2014. In recent years, top scientists have been brought in to get a better understanding and investigate the subtle nuances of the game -- from how and why the curling stones turn to how the sweeping action of players with brooms in hand affects the distance it can travel. Part of the Olympic program since 1998, curling is played out between two teams of four that slide 16 stones down a 30-metre stretch of ice. The dominant forces of the sport have been in North America, Scandinavia and Scotland. And as each powerhouse of the sport tries to gain an advantage, it is not surprising where the research has tended to emanate from. The most recent data comes from Sweden, whose women's team has won gold at the last two Olympics in Vancouver and previously Turin. Harald Nyberg, a researcher at Uppsala University, was part of a team looking at 'The asymmetrical friction mechanism that puts the curl in the curling stone' after being approached by the Swedish Curling Federation. ""They wanted more information, they wanted to know more about how they should treat the stone to behave consistently over time,"" explains Nyberg, who published his paper earlier this year. Nyberg and his team more typically work on friction and wear in more industrial and technical applications but used the same approach to working out how the stone curls. They studied the surface to a high resolution to see its specific machinations and discovered the outcome was that the curved path was due to the microscopic roughness of the stone producing microscopic scratches in the ice . As the stone slides over the ice, its roughness leaves small scratches and, when the rear of the stone passes that area, it passes those original scratches in a different direction, leading them to follow those scratches, hence changing direction. It is this scratch guiding that generates the sideway force necessary to cause the curl. Nyberg is the first to admit: ""It does seem quite simple doesn't it? We tried much more complex things first before coming up with this."" The research was handed to the Swedish Curling Federation, and has warranted interest from Britain but Nyberg admits that, while it gives players a better understanding of the science behind the sport, it is unlikely to revolutionize the sport. ""They know quite well how it behaves despite not understanding the science - that's how instinctive they are,"" he said. ""I'm not sure it will change their approach, it doesn't necessarily change the way they play."" Sweepergometer . So what about the sweeping motion done by team members, which also affects the direction and distance a stone can travel, again through the use of friction? John Bradley was brought in by the Scottish Institute of Sport in the wake of Britain's success at the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, when Scottish housewife Rhona Martin captained her team to gold. The SIS wanted to look into ways to build on that success and improve the team's chances still further. Bradley looked at two major aspects. One was the physical demands of the game bearing in mind teams can be competing on the ice for 25 to 35 hours in the Olympics en route to a podium position. But, from a scientific sense, the other area -- the area of sweeping -- is more interesting when it comes down to the pure workings of the sport. Using what is known as a Sweepergometer, which is effectively a normal curling broom with all manner of wires attached to it to measure movements of the sweeping strokes on the ice, Bradley sought to uncover what difference sweepers made to the direction of the stone. Explaining the basis to the research, he said: ""Curling is the only sport where you can do something with the projectile to affect its trajectory once you get rid of it. ""You can extend the path of the stone by half a meter in a straight line -- and that's quite a difference in a sport of fractions and centimeters in deciding matches despite it being a 30 meter rink."" He added: ""It's been a case of is it better to sweep faster or sweep harder? We found it's better to sweep harder at certain points and sweep faster at others. Also, if you brush an area of ice more than you'll obviously get a much greater transfer of heat."" The research found a number of factors -- that players suffered fatigue, as a result meaning the downwards force of their sweeping onto the ice and their sweep rate declined considerably. Among the other finds, said Bradley were: ""Fast and hard sweeping is physically demanding but can be effective at influencing a stone's trajectory, and the heat transfer to the ice from the brush head is key to this. ""Also, depending on what side of the stone the sweeper stands and the handle of the stone, sweeping can help a stone stay straighter or curl more. ""Sweeping in pairs with each person sweeping vigorously next to the stone for 10 seconds then swapping will maintain the intensity of sweeping and can help steer the stone to some extent."" But how much difference can this research have had? ""There's the finest margins between success and failure so it will help if you get a better understanding of it,"" he said. ""So it's great if this gives them a bit more control and adds additional strategy to the game of curling. ""In a way it wasn't anything they didn't realise but it was putting a bit more logic behind it, it makes them smart with it. They can be more practical with their strategies for controlling the stone, and you can bring a higher level of sweeping coordination about."" Eve Muirhead is skip of the Great Britain team, among the favorites to win gold in the event in Sochi next year, for what will be her second Games as team leader at the tender age of 23. Muirhead and her Scottish-based team work closely with the SIS and, as such, are kept up-to-date with the science of curling. She explains: ""You do read of things when they come up but the science side of things, that's what the SIS is there for. They'll have a look at any science or research and it's up to us athletes to get on with the job. ""There's obviously a lot of science behind curling but, first and foremost, as a player you have to go out there and play. ""It's not like I sit down and learn the science of the sport but I certainly recognize what people are trying to do and the science behind it all. Of course, you want to use every inch that will help you.""","Research this year explains for the first time how and why a curling stone curls .

"(CNN) -- A federal jury convicted a California man Monday in a case in which prosecutors say he convinced a woman to bomb a federal courthouse so he could turn her and others involved the scheme in to authorities, and collect reward money. Donny Love was found guilty on 10 charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, for the role he played in the May 4, 2008, attack on San Diego's Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse. No one was injured in the blast that damaged the building's front  lobby, shattered a glass door and broke a window in a building across  the street. Love could face between 30 years and life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Sheppard. During the two-week trial, prosecutors painted Love as the mastermind behind the blast. He directed two others, Rachelle Lynette Carlock and Ella Louise Sanders to purchase explosive powder and to steal bomb-making materials, they said. Carlock was an on-again, off-again girlfriend to Love, said Sheppard. According to testimony, Carlock and Eric Reginald Robinson then drove from Love's house to San Diego with a backpack, containing three pipe bombs. Carlock detonated the bombs at the front doors of the courthouse, prosecutors said. Carlock, Sanders and Robinson were charged and each previously pleaded guilty for their parts in the plan. At the time of the bombing, Love was in ""dire financial straits,"" prosecutors said, and faced jail time stemming from two pending criminal cases. ""The evidence showed that he directed the May 4, 2008, bombing for the purpose of obtaining reward money and a break on his state charges by providing information about the bombing to law enforcement,"" prosecutors said in a statement. ""The success of this fraudulent scheme required that he provide false and misleading information about the bombing and induce others to do the same in order to conceal his own involvement and collect a reward and other benefits from the government,"" they continued. Love's attorney, Robert Boyce, said it was too early to know whether his client would appeal. ""The jury made a decision and they disagreed with us,"" he said.","Donny Love was found guilty of the use of a weapon of mass destruction .

"(CNN) -- Massimiliano Allegri paid the price for AC Milan's lowly position in the Italian Serie A table Monday when the club announced he had been sacked as coach. Milan has finished first, second and third under Allegri in the last three seasons, but the seven-time European champions sit in 11th place after 19 games of the 2013-14 season. Crucially, the Rossoneri lies 20 points adrift of Napoli in the third and final qualifying position for the lucrative European Champions League. Sunday's 4-3 defeat to lowly Sassuolo, a match which saw Allegri's charges go 2-0 up early in the first half, proved to be the final straw for Milan, which is owned by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. As Allegri acknowledged on the club's official website after the defeat: ""The only objective set since I've been here has been a top three finish and we're far away from that now."" An official club statement read: ""AC Milan wishes to communicate that Massimiliano Allegri and his staff have been relieved of their duties with immediate effect. ""AC Milan would like to thank Mr. Allegri and his staff for their time with the club and wish them the best for the future. ""Coach Mauro Tassotti will take charge in the meantime of the team."" Although qualification for next season's competition looks unlikely, Milan still has a Champions League last 16 tie with Spanish high-fliers Atletico Madrid to look forward to. Whoever replaces Allegri will be able to call on the services of Keisuke Honda, the Japanese playmaker who made his debut for Milan on Sunday after completing his transfer from CSKA Moscow.","Massimiliano Allegri sacked as coach of AC Milan .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Regular programming has just been interrupted by a news conference. A slender black man in a suit steps up to a podium, flanked by American flags and a White House logo. Michael Lamar, pictured after a Democratic fundraiser, has been in ad campaigns in Turkey and the Netherlands. ""I wish I could announce such an economic package,"" he says, ""but there is a bank in Turkey that did it. It is Garanti. I wish we had Garanti in America."" Don't be fooled. This is a commercial on Turkish TV. The actor is a 44-year-old Barack Obama look-alike from Whitehall, Pennsylvania, named Michael Lamar. And he is shilling for a Turkish bank. In the month before the real Barack Obama is to visit Turkey, this ad campaign went out all across the country on television and on billboards, using the iconic image of the American president to sell low-interest loans. The men behind the concept say their Obama look-alike was the perfect guy to sell what they described as Garanti Bank's own economic stimulus package.  Watch Lamar as Obama » . ""We probably wouldn't be doing this commercial if it was the previous president,"" said Can Celikbilek, a copy writer at the advertising company, Alametifarika. ""But in the case of Obama, he does represent hope, not only for the States but for the whole world."" For Obama look-alike actor Lamar, there was some irony about getting flown to Turkey to star in a commercial for a bank. He is a recent casualty of the global economic crisis. ""I was laid off in January of this year from JP Morgan Chase Bank in the U.S.,"" Lamar said, in a telephone interview from Pennsylvania. ""After 18 years in the company, I was just laid off. One of the cutbacks. I'm currently unemployed."" Or, was unemployed. Lamar's striking resemblance to the American president has suddenly offered the former software analyst a possible new career for supporting his wife and child. ""I'm available full-time now,"" Lamar said. ""I'm going to see where this leads me."" Lamar is now being represented by a casting agency in Los Angeles that specializes in celebrity look-alikes. Since he discovered his new ""talent,"" he has traveled to the Netherlands to appear in a commercial for a liquor chain and to Paris, where an activist organization brought him in to meet lawmakers at the National Assembly, as part of a campaign to raise awareness about racism and racial profiling in France. ""This was very exciting for me, a true privilege!"" Lamar said. During his brief visit to Turkey, locals did double-takes when they saw Lamar walk past. ""Even in the studio, the crew [members] were like, 'Oh! Is that Obama?"" said Celikbilek of Alametifarika advertising. Using the image of an American president to promote anything in Turkey is a remarkable reversal. U.S. approval ratings in Turkey plunged to 9 percent, according to a 2007 Pew Research poll, making America less popular in Turkey then almost anywhere else in the world, even though the two countries are NATO allies. There was widespread anger among Turks at the war in neighboring Iraq. But the election of Barack Obama appears to have dramatically improved perceptions of America. ""Bush was a dictator who attacked other countries,"" said Abdurrahman Ozdemir, who sells cigarettes from a small stall on the street. ""But we love Obama ... because he does not want to go to war with other countries."" ""We started to love and like America because of Obama,"" said a 33-year-old woman named Begum Arinc. ""I don't want to see people dying. I don't want to see any war. That's why I want to believe in Obama.""","Michael Lamar strikes an Obama-like figure in ads for a bank in Turkey .

"(CNN) -- A convicted child pornographer in Pennsylvania was sentenced Tuesday to 12 years in federal prison, thanks in part to three girls featured in CNN's Freedom Project who provided information to U.S. authorities. Jeffrey Herschell, 54, of Washington, Pennsylvania, visited an Internet site that showed live sex shows that forced young girls in the Philippines to act out customers' fantasies, U.S. investigators said. ""Whatever the American client wants us to do, we must do it,"" ""Gen"" told CNN in May 2011 for the documentary ""The Fighters."" ""Gen"" and her friends were schoolmates and just 8 years old when the abuse occurred. An investigator from Homeland Security Investigations, part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CNN the information the three girls provided him was integral to the case against Herschell. Their information launched an investigation that uncovered a ring operating live-streaming shows of children engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Customers from around the globe, including an estimated 10 to 15 from the United States, paid to view the shows and direct them, in some cases. When HSI agents executed a search warrant on Herschell's home in 2011, they found computers, cell phones and hard drives containing dozens of explicit videos and images of children. The inquiry involved several U.S. agencies, the Philippines national police and the non-profit group Visayan Forum Foundation, which fights modern-day slavery.

"(CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy met with Sudan's wanted President Omar al-Bashir in Cairo on Sunday as the Egyptian government dismissed calls for the visiting leader's arrest. The International Criminal Court has demanded al-Bashir's arrest on charges of war crimes. The human rights group Amnesty International urged Egypt before the visit to either cancel the Sudanese leader or arrest him. But Morsy spokesman Yasser Ali told the state-run Middle East News Agency that Egypt isn't a member of the ICC, the permanent U.N. war-crimes tribunal. And he said Egypt is following the lead of the African Union, which has urged its members not to cooperate with the tribunal in seeking al-Bashir's arrest. Al-Bashir landed in Cairo on Sunday for a two-day visit. His talks with Morsy included regional concerns as well as bread-and-butter issues like livestock imports, industrial development and water rights in the Nile River basin, Ali said. The ICC has called for al-Bashir's arrest on 10 counts of genocide and crimes against humanity, accusing him of masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the Sudanese territory of Darfur in a campaign of murder, rape and deportation. In a statement issued Friday, Amnesty warned Egypt would become ""a safe haven for alleged perpetrators of genocide"" unless it took the Sudanese leader into custody. ""In his first address, President Morsy said that Egypt's values and identity would uphold humanitarian values, especially in freedom and human rights. How can he now shake hands with a man wanted for genocide?"" asked Marek Marczynski, Amnesty's campaign manager for international justice. In June, Malawi dropped plans to host an African Union summit because the organization wanted al-Bashir to attend. Malawi signed the Rome Statute that created the ICC, and President Joyce Banda said her country couldn't welcome al-Bashir because of the warrant.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic is on course for a ""fab four"" of Australian Open titles when the tournament begins in Melbourne next week -- and the defending champion says all he needs is love. The Serbian second seed could become the first man to win four straight titles at the opening grand slam of the season and he says he has been in unstoppable form since popping the question to his girlfriend Jelena Risti. ""I got engaged in September,"" Djokovic told the media assembled under Melbourne's sunny skies Friday. ""But since we got engaged I haven't lost a match so I guess the wedding should come very soon!"" The 26-year-old says the couple have yet to set a date for the big day so for now he is able to focus on beginning his on-court campaign in Australia. Djokovic may be engaged but he is also exploring an on-court relationship with new coach Boris Becker, himself a two-time Australian Open champion. ""It's great to see Boris as elegant as ever he's a legend of our sport,"" said Djokovic, nodding to Becker, who was watching in the crowd wearing a smart beige blazer. ""He's not been in Australia for 15 years so he's surprised to see how much has been done since then and for me it's an honor to have him alongside other team members. ""We're going to try and make a success of our partnership, it's just the beginning."" Djokovic, who won his first grand slam in Australia in 2008, faces Slovakia's World No.90 Lukas Lacko in the first round. ""The Australian Open is definitely my most successful grand slam and my favorite,"" Djokovic said. ""Most of the players share the same opinion that we love the atmosphere, we love the easy energy that goes around and the tennis fever in Australia."" Roger Federer, also a four-time winner in Australia, opens his tournament against Australian James Duckworth. The Swiss, who last won the tournament in 2010, is seeded eighth for the event and is on course for a quarterfinal match with Britain's Andy Murray in his half of the draw. Murray, a three-time finalist in Melbourne, takes on Japan's Go Soeda in the first round. Rafael Nadal missed last year's tournament because of a stomach virus but the Spanish star is back after winning a warm-up tournament in Qatar. The World No. 1 and top seed opens his Australian Open in an intriguing match against Australian firecracker Bernard Tomic and faces a potential semifinal clash with Murray or Federer. Fellow Aussie Lleyton Hewitt meets Italian Andreas Seppi in the first round fresh from beating Federer in the Brisbane International -- a victory which saw him win his first title in three years. Victoria Azarenka lined up alongside Djokovic to meet the media and fans as the defending women's champion is looking for her third straight title on the hardcourts of Melbourne Park. ""I'm happy to be back here at the Australian Open again,"" said Azarenka. ""Last year was really successful for me, winning a grand slam here and having a great final at the U.S. Open."" There was no mention of American rival Serena Williams, who beat Azarenka in Brisbane to once again go into the Australian Open as the one to watch. Williams, a three-time Australian Open winner and top seed for the women's tournament, meets Australian teenager Ashleigh Barty in the first round. Azarenka kicks off her campaign against Sweden's Johanna Larsson while in the same half of the draw Russian third seed Maria Sharapova faces American Bethanie Mattek-Sands. Djokovic and Azarenka were happy to pose for the cameras with their trophies as defending champions but at the Australian Open it is not about defense -- it's all about attack. ""We are getting used to these pre-tournament photos together for two years in a row as defending champions,"" said Djokovic.

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters enjoyed a tennis career that would be the envy of most women on the WTA Tour, but it is not a path she would like for her four-year-old daughter. The Belgian has topped the world rankings, celebrated four grand slam triumphs and earned over $24 million in prize money before calling time on her glittering career at this year's U.S. Open, but she hopes daughter Jada can find a profession away from the court. ""I'm not the kind of person where I want her to be like me and want her to have a career like me,"" the 29-year-old told CNN's Open Court in her homeland, where she was staging an event to thank her compatriots for their support over the last 15 years. ""She plays a bit, she's at the club that I own with a friend every Wednesday, she goes there just for the social side of things. There's so many kids she plays with -- when the tennis is over they go to the playground or the cafeteria. ""It's just fun to see her have a social life and be among friends while playing sports. Whether it's swimming, track and field or tennis, I'll support her whatever she wants to do. ""But I'm not going to be the mother that's like, 'We're going to play tennis, we're going to practice this and this shot' -- I'm not like that at all."" Clijsters' ""Thank You Games"" in Antwerp, an exhibition tournament also featuring fellow former world No. 1s Amelie Mauresmo and Venus Williams, were a way for her to thank the Belgian public for 15 years of goodwill. ""It was a way for me to give back for all the support I got from the people here,"" she said. ""The last 15 years I've had so many letters and presents and people who travel all over the world to watch me play, so I needed to say goodbye to the people here in Belgium."" She chose Williams and Mauresmo because they were two of her best friends on tour. ""Venus, what she's done for women's tennis has been incredible. I've always admired her for who she is as a person,"" Clijsters said. ""Amelie as well, besides the fact she was a great player I appreciate the person she was on tour for her whole career -- she stayed normal. There was no difference seeing Amelie the next day if you beat her or lost to her. That's something I really appreciated. ""She was one of the people I got closer to -- I reached out to her when her dad passed away and she reached out to me when my dad passed away."" The Bilzen native initially retired in 2007, taking two years out of the sport to have her child before returning in 2009. She won that year's U.S. Open as a wildcard, becoming the first mother to clinch a major championship since Australia's Evonne Goolagong in 1980. ""I enjoyed spending time with my husband and our daughter on the road, seeing her at my last U.S. Open -- she was in the stands and she watched and she would clap. I would hear her yell and I really enjoyed it,"" Clijsters said. That win has become famous for the on-court celebration between mother and daughter, and Clijsters ranks the victory as the most emotional of her career -- coming less than a year after the death of her father. ""One of my biggest highlights is the U.S. Open victory when I came back,"" she explained. ""Nine months before my dad passed away and the surprise to have won ... it was like an emotional rollercoaster."" She went to New York this year determined to savor the occasion, playing in the singles, doubles and mixed doubles competitions while also watching as a fan as Andy Roddick ended his career during the grand slam event. ""I felt so excited about it, like a 14-year-old again playing my first tour event and going to Disneyland for the first time,"" Clijsters said. ""I was so excited knowing it could be one of my last matches but at the same time I was taking it all in. I told myself leading up to the Open that you're gonna step back once in a while and look at the situation from another kind of angle. ""Now that I think back, those 15 years have flown by. It's sad in a way that you don't think about it when you're 16 or 17 -- which in a way is normal, but in the last year I was on tour I learned more than in the last 15 in total."" That 2009 triumph was one of three she achieved at Flushing Meadows, while she also won the 2011 Australian Open. Her exploits raised the profile of tennis in Belgium, and her rivalry with Justine Henin was keenly fought, with Clijsters winning 13 of their 25 meetings -- although Henin won all three of their grand slam final matches. Henin retired from the sport in 2011, also for the second time, and this year announced she is expecting her first child -- due to be born next March. Clijsters said that only since retiring has she been able to see what their achievements meant to Belgian tennis fans. ""Now that I'm older I'm able to realize what we did for our country, especially in the last few months since I retired, I've been in situations where people have come up to me and thanked me,"" she said. ""When world leaders and politicians I've met say what you've done for Belgium, that's when it really hits you."" She was also touched that the Belgian media made a special presentation to her after that final match in September -- a second-round defeat to one of the women's game's rising stars, British 18-year-old Laura Robson. ""It's such a small country, we're very approachable. We don't have paparazzi, so we're among the people,"" Clijsters said. ""They said I have to come in for another interview and I thought 'Oh no, not another one.' They were all standing there ... it really got to me. The thought they put into it was very nice."" One lingering regret is that she never reached the final at Wimbledon, losing in the semis in 2006 and the quarters in 2010. ""The match that hurt me the most was that loss to Vera Zvonareva (in 2010). At the time it took me a few weeks to get myself together and focus on what was next,"" said Clijsters, who bounced back to win the U.S. Open for the third time later that year, beating the Russian in the final. One of Clijsters' trademarks was her athletic stretches across the court, flexibility which could perhaps be explained by the fact her mother was a gymnast. Clijsters, whose father was a professional footballer, enjoys the attention her quirky trademark brings. ""It does make me laugh,"" she said. ""I have people send me pictures of splits they do to show me they can do it, so it is funny. ""I think it started because I practiced on clay all of the time in Belgium and then I just tried it one time on hard court and won the point and slowly started to feel more comfortable with it. Now more players do it, so it's not only me anymore."" So is there any chance of a third comeback? Clijsters takes her time, then shakes her head. ""No, I'm done!""","Kim Clijsters would prefer her daughter not to play professional tennis .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A 29-year-old man was arrested Thursday after screeners at the Philadelphia airport found flash powder and fireworks in his backpack, the Transportation Security Administration said. A federal criminal complaint accused Joseph Picklo of Dallas, Pennsylvania, of ""attempting to carry on an explosive device on a plane,"" according to the U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia. A bomb squad was dispatched to the scene, said Philadelphia police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien. But there was ""no early indication of terrorism,"" a federal law enforcement official said. Picklo was being screened for a United Airlines flight to San Francisco ""when a plastic bottle filled with an explosive substance was found in his luggage,"" the release from the U.S. attorney said. He was stopped by TSA screeners after ""it was determined that (his) carry-on bag contained several prohibited items including a water bottle filled with flash powder and M-80 fireworks,"" according to a TSA statement. Joe Sullivan, Philadelphia police counterterrorism inspector, said the plastic bottle was wrapped in black tape. The bomb squad responded in minutes and removed the material, which was being tested, Sullivan said. ""He said he was experimenting with the materials for a business he was starting. He said he forgot they were in his backpack. He told us he's self-employed in sales,"" Sullivan said. Philadelphia police took Picklo into custody and he was later transferred to federal custody, the U.S. attorney's office said. A federal defender was appointed to represent him at an initial court appearance Thursday afternoon. Picklo, who must still be formally charged by indictment or information, is scheduled to return to court Friday afternoon. The incident occurred before 6 a.m. at a TSA checkpoint serving terminals D and E, said Victoria Lupica, spokeswoman for Philadelphia International Airport. The checkpoint was closed immediately after the item was detected, and passengers were diverted to terminal C, she said. The checkpoint reopened at 6:18 a.m., and normal airport operations resumed, she said. Aircraft operations were not affected, Lupica said. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Chris Dignam contributed to this report.","NEW: Joseph Picklo allegedly tried to carry ""an explosive device on a plane""

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's new ministers were sworn in Thursday, the first Cabinet under President Mohamed Morsy. Prime Minister Hesham Kandil's meetings with candidates continued Thursday afternoon, just before the 35-minister Cabinet headed to the presidential palace in the eastern Cairo district of Heliopolis. These include four new portfolios. Seven ministers from former Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri's outgoing Cabinet will continue their jobs under Kandil's leadership, including the ministers of foreign affairs and finance. Timeline: Mubarak's ascent to power and dramatic fall . The Ministry of Defense will also remain unchanged under the leadership of Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has ruled the country since February 2011. Ganzouri was appointed as a consultant to Morsy. The presidential team, which is expected to include the vice president, is yet to be announced. Analysts say the new Cabinet reflects continuity rather than change. It lacks diversity, especially in gender and religion. Only two women were named, and one of them is a Coptic Christian, a member of a religion that has been persecuted in Egypt. At a news conference Thursday, Kandil said the only criterion for selection was competence. At least four ministers are affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, which Morsy headed before his election. These include Salah Abdel-Maqsoud, who will head the Ministry of Information, which controls state media and regulates private media. At least two ministers are considered from the pro-change camp, the most prominent of which is the minister of justice, Ahmed Mekki, who was part of the judicial independence movement in 2006. The Ministry of Interior will witness minimum change with the appointment of Ahmed Gamal Eddin, described as a hardliner. Kandil said that despite the challenges, the Cabinet's main objective is to achieve ""the goals of the revolution: Bread, freedom and social justice."" He urged Egyptians to support Morsy.","Seven ministers from former PM's Cabinet will continue jobs under new leadership .

"(CNN) -- The whole world is watching how Barack Obama picks his cabinet, but he and his wife Michelle have a much more personal choice to make at home -- and it's very political too. Sasha Obama, left, and Malia Obama will make the White House home come January 20. When they move to Washington, will their daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, go to public or private school? For many US parents, that decision is more revealing than the ones they make at the ballot box. What do you think the Obama family should do? Americans of a certain income who choose public school are demonstrating that they trust the government to educate their children. Americans who send their children to private school are saying that the government hasn't earned that trust. In some areas, it's also been a way for white families to avoid sending their children to school with black children. Republicans tend to favor giving poor families subsidies so they can afford private schools too. Most Democrats, including Barack Obama, are opposed to the idea, because they think it undermines the public school system. It's not an issue every president faces. George Bush's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, were both college students by the time he took office. The Obamas' two Democratic predecessors made contrasting choices. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter's daughter Amy went to public school. The Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, went to a private school. In Chicago, the Obama girls have been going to a private school. But now their father is preparing to be president. All around the country, the media are reporting on the story and taking sides too. Some of them have already noted that the president-elect who opposes ""school choice"" for the poor has been able to afford it for his own children. This week, Mrs. Obama took the girls to visit some of Washington's elite private schools, with tuition of about $28,000. In an interview with CBS News, she resorted to the kind of careful phrasing that practiced politicians use to avoid controversy. ""What we have asked people to understand is that the decision that we make will be based on the best interests of the girls. We haven't made that decision yet. We want that to be a personal process, and people have been really good about respecting that."" They can't avoid the decision for long.

"(CNN) -- Calling him ""one of the most violent and despicable criminals in Boston history,"" prosecutors argued Thursday that convicted mob boss Whitey Bulger should never set foot on the streets of that city -- or any city -- again. ""Having now been convicted of 31 felonies, including ... counts involving multiple murders, Bulger richly deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a sentencing memorandum filed Thursday. Bulger embarked on what prosecutors called ""a decades-long crime spree"" and then went into hiding. He was finally found, after 16 years on the run, with his girlfriend, Catherine Greig, in Santa Monica, California, in 2011. A two-month trial culminated in his conviction last August on various counts such as racketeering, extortion, and money laundering. The federal jury linked him to 11 murders; the government had alleged he had a role in 19 such killings between 1973 and 1985; the jury said it had failed to prove his involvement in seven of those and had ""no finding"" in the other. The 84-year-old's sentencing hearing is set to begin Wednesday. The prosecutor noted that convictions on many of the counts mandate a life sentence. ""There are no mitigating factors, and defendant Bulger has no redeeming qualities, which would justify any sentence below the one called for by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the applicable case law and statutes,"" Ortiz wrote. The prosecutor also asked the court to take steps ""to prevent any money -- where earned from his crimes or obtained in the future -- from finding its way into Bulger's pocket."" She also asked that restitution be paid to the murder victims. Paperwork filed earlier in federal court indicated Bulger generated well over $25 million in racketeering proceeds between 1972 and around 2000, five years after he went on the lam after being tipped off by his rogue FBI informant to a pending indictment. The sentencing memorandum also summarized what the government describes as ""Bulger's horrific crimes and sadistic behavior"" as further proof ""that he deserves no mercy at the time of sentencing."" ""Presiding over a massive criminal enterprise, Bulger extorted dozens of individuals, flooded South Boston with cocaine, shot innocent people, strangled women, murdered his competitors, corrupted FBI agents, and then ran away and hid for 16 years,"" the prosecutor said. Their judgment didn't improve during this summer's trial, with Ortiz accusing Bulger of playing ""an elaborate game of 'Let's Pretend'"" by denying being an FBI informant while at the same time insisting the federal government ""had given him full immunity."" CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","The sentencing for Whitey Bulger is set for November 13 .

"(CNN) -- Andrew Enderez says he grows more anxious and hopeless as each day passes. ""I can't fathom that such a tragedy I see only in the movies could happen to me,"" he told CNN's iReport. Enderez, an engineer who works in the United Arab Emirates, doesn't know what happened to his wife, his four children and their nanny, who live in the hard-hit central Philippines city of Tacloban, near the airport. He posted a photo of his family online, hoping someone will recognize them. Images of their faces smiling at him when he goes home to the Philippines during breaks are stuck on his mind, Enderez said. ""As I am writing this request,"" he said, ""I can't help but break down and cry."" Enderez is one of many people thousands of miles from the Philippines who felt their hearts stop and their bearings spin as Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the island nation on Friday. Dealing with the anguish of uncertainty as phone and Internet communications fail, Enderez and other CNN iReporters shared their feelings as they wait for news of missing loved ones. Enderez has already lost a couple of other relatives in the storm, but remains hopeful that his immediate family has survived. Typhoon Haiyan: Faces of the storm . Desperation . Aisa Aigbe last spoke with her mother before the storm. Even then, she heard the fear in her mother's voice. ""She was crying and very scared, because our ceilings were giving up, and (flooding) is getting serious,"" Aigbe said. Now Aigbe is terrified as she watches television news footage of the storm from her home in Maryland. On the streets of her beloved childhood hometown, she sees bodies in the streets where neighborhoods once stood. She hasn't heard from her mother, brothers or nephew since the storm hit. ""I feel so miserable here and have been asking for help from everyone, but I still have not been able to locate my mom and the rest of my family,"" she said. ""I'm desperate for answers."" Projected Typhoon Haiyan death toll falls . Fear . David Armstrong's wife survived the typhoon, but her safety is still not assured, he said. Armstrong lives in the United Kingdom, while his wife, Ruby, whom he married in August, works as a teacher in Ormoc City, in Leyte province. After a 24-hour communications blackout, he was able to reach his wife. The good news of her survival was tempered by the state of the surrounding area. Ruby Armstrong's family owns six houses on a piece of land in Ormoc City. The typhoon destroyed three of them and tore the roof off a fourth, forcing the extended family to live inside the two small remaining houses, her husband said. ""Not only have they lost homes, but they have no food, water, or electric,"" he said. They have become sick from drinking unclean water. Some 90% of the buildings in Ormoc City were damaged, he said. There is only one supermarket and one pharmacy operating, and both are running out of supplies, Ruby told David. The family also has no way to retrieve money, because banks and ATMs have suffered damage. ""They have had no relief aid whatsoever,"" David Armstrong said. Gratitude . The damage in another Leyte province city, Baybay, was also severe. But Indiana residents Ron Johnston and his wife, Charity, whose parents live in Baybay, were overjoyed after receiving good news from the devastated region. Charity's parents survived the storm. She last talked to her father on Thursday as Typhoon Haiyan was bearing down on the Philippines. A cousin located Charity's parents, who were alive, but who suffered losses. ""Their house is completely gone (and) all their animals are dead,"" Johnston said. ""My father-in-law's rice fields are wiped out. They lost everything but the clothes on their backs."" ""But they didn't lose the precious thing,"" Johnston said. ""Life."" CNN's Daphne Sashin, Cydney Fisher and Catherine E.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. intelligence now believes Edward Snowden did not gain access to the ""crown jewels"" of National Security Agency programs that secretly intercept and monitor conversations around the world, CNN has learned. The Obama administration is reviewing what the admitted leaker of classified information actually got his hands on and what damage he may have caused. The ongoing damage assessment indicates he did not gain access to what is called ECI or ""extremely compartmentalized information,"" according to a U.S. official familiar with the review. Snowden fled to Moscow after his leaks in June and has been stranded at the Moscow airport awaiting a response to his request for temporary asylum. He faces espionage charges in the United States. With Snowden still at large and the publication of agency surveillance secrets publicized, the intelligence community may have good reason to downplay the impact of what he has revealed. However, the official said the intelligence community remains adamant that Snowden caused serious damage. The administration believes it knows the extent of the material that was downloaded. ""We are not downplaying it,"" the official said, explaining that assessing the matter over weeks has enabled authorities to focus more directly on the impact of Snowden's actions. Court renews secret U.S. surveillance program . The official spoke to CNN on background because the assessment is not fully completed. CNN cannot independently verify the statements made either by the administration or Snowden. Officials do not dispute that Snowden had critical information about how NSA programs worked. ""But just because you have the blueprints doesn't mean you have the manual,"" the official said. A key question is whether Snowden, a former NSA contractor, really knows how the programs work at a detailed technical level. Snowden did leak sensitive documents about anti-terror programs, detailing secret telephone metadata and e-mail surveillance. U.S. officials have said that terror groups are aware of the Snowden leaks and are responding internally, like adjusting communications and security. NSA Director Keith Alexander said last week the United States has concrete proof terrorists are making changes and taking actions that are going to ""make our job harder."" Other officials are less resolute about the extent of the exposure. The top lawyer for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it is not clear how much U.S. adversaries will adjust based on what is known already. Ex-CIA chief: What Snowden did . ""It's too early to tell yet whether it is going to have an impact, but there's no question that they have sat up and taken notice of specifically what has been released here and the impact it has on their communications,"" Robert Litt, general counsel for the national intelligence office said last Friday. The assessment also has concluded that Snowden took advantage of knowing that a good deal of information was concentrated in one portion of the NSA's computer system. ""What he had was information that was centralized so it could be shared broadly,"" the official said. This is similar to the assessment reached in the case of Army Pvt. Bradley Manning where information was stored in ways that large numbers of personnel could access it under certain circumstances. Manning is accused of leaking documents to WikiLeaks in the largest case of its kind in U.S. history. He is currently on trial before a military court. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said last week that Snowden exploited a weakness that came from a desire to make the information more accessible to those in the intelligence community. ""In an effort for those in the intelligence community to be able to share information with one another, there was an enormous amount of information concentrated in one place,"" Carter said during a panel at the Aspen Security Forum. ""It creates too much information in one place."" As such, the government has accelerated efforts to better secure classified information, improvements that had begun even before Snowden went public. The government believes Snowden was aware that upgrades were being made to NSA systems tagging data and users so that downloads were recorded, but Snowden accessed portions where that work had not been completed. In addition, system administrators like Snowden and others will be subject to more stringent rules. Downloads will require a second more senior employee to ""watch, log and observe"" what material is being accessed the official said. Access codes and passwords also have been changed.","Edward Snowden admittedly leaked classified information on surveillance programs to media .

"(CNN) -- As reports of swine flu continue to rise in the United States and around the world, the average American is probably asking, ""How should I protect myself?"" U.S. health officials stress the importance of frequent hand washing during outbreaks of illness. Health officials' advice is to follow common-sense precautions: Wash your hands, stay home if you're sick and listen to your local health authorities. ""Very frequent hand-washing is something that we talk about time and time again and that is an effective way to reduce transmission of disease,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""If you're sick, it's very important that people stay at home. If your children are sick, have a fever and flu-like illness, they shouldn't go to school. And if you're ill, you shouldn't get on an airplane or another public transport to travel. Those things are part of personal responsibility in trying to reduce the impact. "" So far, Mexico has been hardest hit by swine flu. Cases have been confirmed in the United States, as well as countries including Canada, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and Israel. ""In areas with no disease yet, a lot of what we can do sounds simple and repetitive but helps,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director of the CDC's Science and Public Health Program. In addition to washing hands often, she recommends covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing and avoiding touching your eyes and nose in case the virus is on your hands. The World Health Organization calls the situation a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" and the United States has declared a ""public health emergency,"" likened by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to preparations for a potential hurricane. No authorities are calling the outbreak a pandemic. The CDC expects U.S. numbers will grow and recommendations will change depending on what happens in individual communities, said the CDC's Schuchat. The public should pay attention to what is happening nearby and heed the guidance of local health officials regarding school, work and public events. Because so much is still unknown at this point, the main risk factor is people traveling to areas where cases have already been identified. ""However this virus may already be in other places in the United States,"" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN. ""With enhanced surveillance, we will see more cases and that is why it makes good sense to be proactive, by doing things we know are effective in reducing exposure.""  Explainer: Swine flu facts » . Schuchat noted swine flu symptoms are relatively general and nonspecific. ""So many different things can cause these symptoms. it is a dilemma,"" she said. ""It is a challenge that we are wrestling with. There is not a perfect test right now to let a person or doctor know exactly what this is."" But Schuchat specifically advised anyone who feels ill after returning from Mexico to see a doctor. Unfortunately, since this is a new strain of influenza, the flu vaccine for this past flu season offers no protection. ""However, we do have anti-virals that work against this swine flu,"" said Skinner, referring to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). ""Someone who has [swine flu], if they are treated early, the anti-flu medicines work against this."" According to Skinner, health officials are still trying to figure out where exactly the virus originated, how transmissible it is and why it is mild in some cases and deadlier in others. CNN's Mary Carter contributed to this report.","Take standard flu season precautions to avoid infection, CDC advises .
Chief risk factor is traveling to areas where swine flu has been identified .

"(CNN) -- Last Tuesday Google unveiled its attempt to rival Facebook, a social-networking product called Google+. I received an invitation from a friend and have been putting this nascent service through its paces -- especially on my Android phone. Here's my experience so far: . (Do you want a Google+ invitation? Sorry, you may have to wait.) First, a caveat: Absolutely everything about Google+, including its mobile experience, is in a state of flux. So at least some of what I write here will definitely change in the coming days and weeks. Google+ is very much a ""beta"" service, sporting plenty of glitches, mysteries and oddities. Therefore it's just as well that the vast majority of people using it so far seem to be serious social media geeks. Yes, that does make for a lot of redundant, tiresome conversations probing the arcane nuances of Google+ and comparing it to Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare. But it's probably best to let the geeks kick the tires on Google+ first. Later on, when the service becomes more widely available, less-geeky users will definitely benefit from this process. So be a little patient. There are main components to the Google+ mobile experience are the free Google+ Android app (of course), and the mobile web app (accessible via the mobile browser on most Web-enabled phones). To get Google+ Android app working you must first install the app, then log into Google+ via the Web to set up a link to your phone. Then you should be able to use the app. This Google+ Android app video explains how the app is supposed to work, after you've done this setup. I was able to easily install the Google+ app and link my account to my first-generation HTC Droid Incredible. So far this app is running fine for me -- no freezes or crashes. However, I've noticed some other Google+ mobile users have complained of problems: the app installed slowly or not at all, or it crashed, or they're having problems getting their phone linked to their Google+ account. Given the vast diversity of Android devices, versions of the Android operating system running on them, and manufacturer-specific interfaces (like HTC Sense), this isn't surprising. But for now, Android users have the best shot of enjoying a satisfactory mobile Google+ experience. That's because, so far there are no Google+ native smartphone apps for platforms other than Android. Google says the iPhone app is coming soon, and others are probably in the works. Google+ users on non-Android phones -- or who can't or don't want to install the app -- currently can use the mobile Web app. Here, functionality varies: Android and iPhone users of the Web app enjoy substantially more functionality than people on BlackBerry, Nokia, or WebOS devices, at least so far. The Android app is really important, since ArsTechnica rightly observes: ""The success of Google+ will partly depend on the quality of the user experience the service offers on mobile devices. Because Google isn't just a Web developer but also major mobile platform vendor through Android, the company has an opportunity to offer deep integration between its new social networking service and the popular smartphone operating system."" What I like . Mostly, I like the Google+ Android app. I am able to use all the other core functionality of Google+ via the Android app without difficulty. For instance, I can add people to my ""circles"" (contact groups that I define), read my ""stream"" (the Google+ equivalent of a Facebook news feed, or a tweetstream), and take and upload photos. So generally, I'm pretty satisfied with the app. If you're uploading mobile photos or video to Google+ (and you can only do this via the Android app so far, which puts iPhone shutterbugs out of luck), you might want to peruse your instant upload settings. By default, Google+ uploads everything you shoot as soon as you shoot it, to a private album, from which you can selectively share photos. Personally I only want to upload images I wish to share, so I've turned this option off. Having the Google+ app installed on my phone offers one key advantage over the computer-based browser experience of Google+: sharing links. With the app installed and activated on my Android phone, now when I'm using any of the Web browser I have installed on my phone (even Opera Mini), when I find a page I want to share, Google+ is listed as one of the many ""share page"" options (along with Evernote, Gmail, Messages, etc.) This is actually easier than sharing links to Google+ on my computer. So far as I've been able to find there's no Google+ bookmarklet or browser toolbar button that's the equivalent of share on Facebook. I use these kinds of tools all the time for other services in my Web browser. I'm sure Google+ will have one eventually, but right now on my Android phone at least I don't have to cut-and-paste the link. I'll like it even better when Google releases an application programming interface for Google+, so other services I like and use frequently,such as PicPlz, for posting photos selectively to several services at once, can connect to my Google+ presence. What's not working . One of the main glitches I've noticed with mobile Google+ involves the ""huddle"" feature -- a prominent part app, featured on its home screen. As far as I understand it, a ""huddle"" is supposed to be the Google+ alternative to group texting services. It allows self-defined groups of mobile users to convene on-the-fly private discussions -- such friends deciding where to meet at the beach, or journalists in the field coordinating coverage of a breaking news event. I was able to use the Android app to initiate a huddle and invite several friends. However, the only person who could actually join the huddle was also using the Android app. All other invitees, who were accessing Google+ via a their Web browser (desktop or mobile), would click to accept my invitation -- but then they were inexplicably routed to the main Google mobile info page. Rather frustrating. Theoretically, Google+ users should be able to participate in a huddle via the mobile Web (although that didn't work for my friends), and even non-users should be able to participate via SMS, though that seems sketchy. I searched Google+ Help for Huddle info -- but as of this writing the only result that yields is how to delete your account. Since Huddle is strictly a mobile service, info about it can be found in Google Mobile Help. This isn't exactly intuitive from the user's perspective, and I hope Google fixes that soon. Help should always be where users expect to find it. Despite how Google has organized this project, users don't perceive the Google+ Android app as a separate service from Google+. Another glitch: I noticed that my mobile notifications usually lag. I just accessed Google+ on my laptops Web browser and saw five new notifications of interaction from other users, similar to Facebook notifications. But I'm not seeing these on my Android app. That's been happening a lot. Like I said: Google+ is really, really beta. But so far it's sufficiently functional, interesting, and engaging for me to want to keep using it. Even better, in my opinion the Google+ user interface -- standard and mobile -- is cleaner, more intuitive, more attractive, more user friendly, and less potentially misleading than Facebook's. Plus, it offers huge potential to connect with all the other Google services I'm already using: Google calendar, Gmail, Google docs, and more. Will Google+ catch on? Influential tech blogger Robert Scoble doubts that Google+ stands much chance of getting adopted by the average Facebook user, and instead will only appeal to the geekier types initially invited. He thinks that would be just great, by the way. I disagree -- and mobile is a big part of why I disagree. Consider this combination of factors: . • The opportunity to deeply, even inherently, integrate Google+ with Android . • Google's existing array of hugely popular consumer services (mail, docs, calendar, etc.) • Google+ doesn't think too far outside the box -- which was the downfall of Google Wave. It emulates the best functionality from existing popular social media services, but offers in many ways, I think a more user-friendly experience. • Mobile devices are fast becoming the most common way that people access the Internet, worldwide and in the U.S. • At least 200 million people already have Google accounts, based on estimates of active Gmail users -- but the total number of Google account holders is probably much higher .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods doesn't have a great record in team events, especially in light of his stellar solo achievements, but the world No. 1 helped the United States win the Presidents Cup for the fifth successive time Sunday. Bouncing back from his first defeat of a week marred by bad weather at Muirfield Village, Woods clinched the decisive point against the visiting International team by defeating South African Richard Sterne. The Americans have now held the title since 2000, with Fred Couples unbeaten as captain on the last three stagings -- though he will stand down ahead of the 2015 event in South Korea. ""A three-peat's good enough for me,"" said the 54-year-old after the 18½-15½ triumph against a team featuring major champions such as Adam Scott, Ernie Els, Charl Schwartzel, Louis Oosthuizen and Angel Cabrera. Woods has won just 13 of 29 Ryder Cup matches for the U.S. but has earned the clinching point in the last three matches against the Internationals. The U.S. dominated the match, and went into the closing singles with a 14-8 lead after the final foursomes results were finally completed Sunday morning. Woods and playing partner Matt Kuchar suffered their first defeat, losing 1-down to South African Els and Zimbabwe's Els Brendon de Jonge. However, the 14-time major winner overcame a niggling back problem to beat 41st-ranked debutant Sterne 1-up with a half at the 18th hole. ""It feels good. It was a team effort this whole week. We played well and had a nice lead going into the singles,"" said Woods, who earned just one point in fourballs and foursomes at the last Presidents Cup. ""I wasn't feeling my best coming down the stretch. I had a 1-up lead and I tried to keep hold of that. I knew I wasn't feeling well and I really didn't want to play any more, so I really just wanted to get that half on the final hole and get it over with."" Woods has been a winner five times at the PGA Tour's Memorial Tournament at Muirfield, though rarely has the Ohio course been this waterlogged. ""It was a tough day, tough conditions -- rain, wind all around. It was a long week, but it was worth it,"" he said. ""A few of us are a little bit dinged up -- I'm one of them -- and our physios did a great job of getting us out there. I've never played three matches in a day before. ""I'm a little bit sore and I'm looking forward to not picking up a club for a while."" Meanwhile, Europe won the Seve Trophy for the first time in more than a decade Sunday, beating Great Britain and Ireland 15-13 in France. In a match missing many of the European team which shocked the U.S. on the last day of the Ryder Cup at Medinah, Italian Francesco Molinari sealed the result when he defeated England's Chris Wood 3 and 2 in the decider. ""Everything went to the last match. The boys played really well today and I'm really happy to have won the Seve Trophy this time,"" said European captain Jose Maria Olazabal, who led the 2012 Ryder team. The competition is named after Olazabal's great friend and Ryder Cup teammate, the late Severiano Ballesteros.","Tiger Woods scores decisive points as U.S. retains Presidents Cup title .

"(EW.com) -- The official numbers are in and the winner is ... NBC, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler! The 70th Annual Golden Globe Awards last night gave NBC its biggest ratings for the program in six years. Sunday's awards delivered 19.7 million viewers and a 6.4 rating among adults 18-49 â€” up 28% in the demo from 2012. That makes last night's telecast the most successful Globes since 2007 among total viewers and the valuable adult demo. Last night's Globes is also the season's top awards program to date, eclipsing ABC's CMA Awards, the Emmys and the American Music Awards. The ratings also mean Fey and Poehler's hosting stint beat the last few years of snark-master Ricky Gervais leading the show. Yet credit for the ratings spike probably deserves to be spread around.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- A Malaysian court Monday found opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim not guilty of sodomizing a former male political aide, bringing an end to a politically charged trial and shaking up expectations for elections this year. Anwar's supporters erupted into cheers in the court room as the judge announced the verdict, as his wife and six children tearfully hugged one another other. ""Justice has been done,"" Anwar said as he left the court building, walking into a crowd of camera-wielding journalists and supporters. ""I feel I have been vindicated."" He said the ruling had reinvigorated the opposition's efforts to mount a strong challenge to the current Malaysian government in the elections. Anwar repeatedly said he was innocent, saying the trial was an attempt by the government to end his political career -- an assertion it has consistently denied. He had expressed doubt that he would receive a fair trial. ""Malaysia has an independent judiciary and this verdict proves that the government does not hold sway over judges' decisions,"" said Rais Yatim, the information minister. Investigators arrested Anwar in July 2008 -- four months after a loose coalition of opposition parties that he led won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections. It was the second time in the country's history that the ruling party had failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. With the government expected to call elections in the coming months, Anwar said he was ready to start campaigning again. ""We're working and I'm very optimistic,"" he said, reiterating his view that Malaysia is in need of political reform. ""The system is still blatantly authoritarian,"" he said. Thousands of supporters gathered outside the court building Monday ahead of the announcement of the verdict. They started arriving in a nearby parking lot before sunrise, accompanied by a heavy police presence. Adding to the tense atmosphere, three small explosions went off in the vicinity of the court complex after the verdict, a police spokesman said, adding that the cause was still being investigated. Two people suffered minor injuries and were taken to hospital, the spokesman said. Anwar had been on trial for nearly two years in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on allegations that he sodomized the former aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, in June 2008. Sodomy, even if consensual, is an offense punishable by up to 20 years of prison in Malaysia. In delivering the decision, Justice Mohamad Zabidin Diah said it was not safe to rely on DNA evidence that had been cited in the trial -- semen taken from the aide's body that the prosecutor alleged was Anwar's -- since it could have been contaminated. The court was not willing to give a guilty verdict based on uncorroborated evidence, the judge said. Before the verdict, Anwar and his supporters had been pessimistic about how the trial would turn out. Before the decision was announced, he said he had already got his belongings together in anticipation of a prison sentence. The trial that ended Monday was the second time he faced sodomy charges. He was the heir apparent to former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until 1998, when he was sacked and charged with corruption and sodomy. Anwar spent six years in prison after being convicted on corruption charges in 1999 and on sodomy charges involving his wife's former driver in 2000. Malaysia's highest court overturned the sodomy conviction and ordered him released from prison in 2004. However, the corruption verdict was never lifted, barring him from running for political posts until 2008.","NEW: Anwar Ibrahim says he is 'very optimistic' about the opposition's election hopes .

"(CNN) -- What was old is new again - at least that's the way it is for early voting. Before the second Tuesday after the first Monday in November was declared Election Day by federal law in 1845, states voted on different days and over different periods of time. It wasn't until the last decade that early voting began to pick up steam again. In 2004, 22% of Americans voted early and that rate rose to more than 30% in 2008, according to Paul Gronke, professor of Political Science who founded and runs the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Oregon. Gronke estimates that as much as 40% of eligible voters will cast an early ballot during the 2012 election. With the trend changing the way Americans vote and campaigns campaign, we decided to take a look, by the numbers, at early voting in the United States: . 35: States (including the District of Columbia) that allow early voting. 2: States with all mail-in voting. Washington and Oregon don't have traditional polling places. Early voting surge suggests Democratic push pays off in Iowa . 28: Percent of Florida voters who said in 2004 they preferred early voting because of the convenience. 30: Percent who said they didn't feel like standing in a long line to vote.

"(CNN) -- A Libyan minister was shot dead in the first assassination of a transitional government official since dictator Moammar Gadhafi was ousted from power nearly three years ago. Gunmen driving a car opened fire on Deputy Industry Minister Hassan al-Darouei, killing him instantly while he was visiting his hometown of Sirte, a Libyan defense ministry official said. The unknown men fired on the minister near a market on Saturday evening in the Mediterranean city some 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the coastal capital Tripoli. His body has since been moved to a morgue, the defense official said on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the media. State news agency LANA said al-Darouei was shot several times. Nearly three years after the start of the popular uprising that ended Gadhafi's 42-year rule, Libya is still plagued by violence and targeted killings as a myriad of armed groups often do as they please. Country awash with weapons . With plentiful weapons left over from the 2011 war, militias, former rebel fighters and militants often resort to force to impose their demands on the weak central authorities. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's government, weakened by political infighting and fragile state security forces, is struggling to impose law and order. For nearly six months, the North African country has seen crude oil production and exports slump due to protests and blockades of oil fields and ports, hurting state coffers. In the eastern city of Benghazi, cradle of the 2011 uprising, there has been a string of killings targeting security officials. Sirte was the last bastion Gadhafi's fight to hold onto power after the capital fell to rebel fighters. He was found hiding in a drain pipe and was killed on October 20, 2011. Al-Darouei was a member of the National Transitional Council, the political wing of the 2011 rebellion against Gadhafi's rule. He held the office deputy minister for industry since the transitional government was set up.

"(CNN) -- Two women in veils and voluminous white gowns kneel in front of a statue of the Buddha, exchanging vows and prayer beads to the languorous intonations of Buddhist chants. This unconventional ceremony on Saturday was the first same-sex Buddhist wedding held in Taiwan, where a landmark bill to legalize same-sex marriage has been pending since 2003. No countries in Asia have legalized same-sex marriages so far, although there have been signs of progress in some -- most recently in Vietnam and Nepal. Germany's high court expands gay rights . Huang Mei-yu said she and her partner of seven years, Yu Ya-ting, decided to hold a Buddhist wedding to acknowledge their own faith, as well the predominant religion of the nation, according to the Taipei Times newspaper. They hoped the ceremony, which was performed by a renowned Buddhist master, would encourage Taiwanese society to accept same-sex marriage. ""Of course it helps (promote same-sex marriage), said Wu Hsiao-wen, Secretary of the Taiwan LGBT Family Rights Advocacy, saying that the ceremony set a strong example for the Buddhist community. She added that its legitimacy was bolstered in the public's eyes by its blessing from Shih Chao-hwei, a highly-respected Buddhist social activist, who presided over the ceremony. Shih founded the Hong-Shih Buddhist College and the Research Centre for Applied Ethics at Hsuan Chuang University. The Buddhist ceremony followed a mass same-sex wedding extravaganza last August, where 80 lesbian couples participated in a ""Barbie and Barbie's wedding"" in the capital city of Taipei, attracting over 1,000 guests and curious onlookers. Taiwan was the first nation in Asia to introduce a bill to legalize same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. Drafted in 2003 under former president Chen Shui-bian, it has made little headway in Taiwan's legislature, however. Wu said the issue of same-sex marriage is often given lip service during electoral campaigns, but there is little effort to push the bill forward once the winning candidate takes office. At a gay rights awareness event in 2006, when the current president, Ma Ying-Jeou, was the mayor of Taipei, he said homosexuality was a ""natural phenomenon"" and ""gay rights are part of human rights."" Since taking office in 2008, he has been mostly silent on the issue. Gay men, straight women: enduring bonds . The government is also under pressure from Christian groups -- who comprise a small but vocal religious minority in Taiwan â€” Wu said. Given the little political will at present, she said the pressure to push the bill through needs to come from the grassroots level. She is optimistic that same-sex marriage legislation will be passed in the next few years, saying the ""gay and lesbian community is getting stronger and stronger."" Taipei's annual gay pride parade has become Asia's largest since its inception in 2003, according to organizers, attracting 50,000 people last October. Wu said this year's parade will focus for the first time on same-sex marriage rights. Elsewhere in the region, Vietnam held its first gay pride parade on August 5, attended by around 100 people in the capital of Hanoi. It followed inaugural gay pride parades in Myanmar and Laos in May and June, respectively. In July, Vietnam's Justice Ministry announced it would consider including a provision for same-sex marriage rights in a proposal to the National Assembly next year, as part of an amendment to the country's marriage laws. While LGBT activists are unsure how far the government will truly take the matter, it appears the decision may stem from practicality. ""It's time for us to look at the reality,"" Justice Minister Ha Hung Cuong said in an online debate. ""The number of homosexuals has mounted to hundreds of thousands. It's not a small figure. ... They may own property. We, of course, have to handle these issues legally."" In May, Nepal's Home Ministry announced it would include an ""others"" category to recognize the alternative gender identities of LGBT people on citizenship certificates and other official government and business documents. Woman who had gay slurs carved in her body speaks out . Nepal's Supreme Court ruled in favour of granting full rights to LGBT people in 2008, including the right to marry. But the Nepalese LGBT community is still waiting for these rights to be written into the country's new permanent constitution, which has been dogged by repeated delays and protracted negotiations. ""I remember when I told my parents that we would get married, their first question was, 'Is this legal?'"" Huang told reporters at her wedding. ""I could only say to them that it would (become legal) soon, but I didn't know when would be considered soon. So we hope it will become legal. For us and for our families, it is very important.""","Taiwan's first same-sex Buddhist wedding ceremony held Saturday .

"(CNN) -- England's Tommy Fleetwood leads the Golf Champions event in Durban, South Africa by one stroke after posting a three-under par round 69 on Saturday. The 22-year-old, who sealed a maiden European Tour victory in the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles last August, finished his round with a birdie to edge ahead of France's Victor Dubuisson (69) and Dutchman Joost Luiten who shot a round of 70.

Three under around this golf course, when you're not on your game is an absolutely brilliant score, and so I think it's showing that I'm maturing as a golfer and I can actually score when I'm playing bad, which is one of the most important parts of being a professional golfer."" Home favorites Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace are fourth and fifth respectively. Oosthuizen, the 2010 Open champion, fired a one-under par 71 to finish on eight under par, while Grace is one shot further back after carding a 68. England' Paul Casey recorded the lowest score of the day -- a seven-under 65 lifting him up into a five-way tie for 10th place on four-under par. Meanwhile at the Sony Open in Hawaii, Brain Stuard completed a second successive round of 65 to lead by one from Australia's Marc Leishman and Hideto Tanihara from Japan at the halfway stage. Journeyman Stuard, 31, will have to fend off some stiff competition in the final two rounds at the Waialae Country Club if he is to secure his first PGA Tour victory. ""This was my first PGA TOUR event and I finished 25th,"" Stuard said, PGATour.com reported. ""It's kind of an old style golf course and for whatever reason, I enjoy playing those,"" he added. Compatriot Harris English is two shots back on eight under after firing his second round of 66, while Australia's Adam Scott is one shot further back. The reigning Masters champion finished 2013 in brilliant form capturing the Australian PGA Championship and Masters titles last November and is well placed for a weekend charge after a round of 66 took him into a six-way tie for fifth.

"(CNN) -- Suspected militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades killed at least 25 Egyptian soldiers in the border city of Rafah, state-run Nile TV reported Monday. Rafah, on the border between Egypt and Gaza, is the site of a key border crossing. In response to the attack, Egypt closed the crossing. The assailants struck two buses carrying security forces in the Sinai Peninsula. At least two other soldiers were injured, Nile TV said. The Sinai Peninsula is a lawless area that was the site of frequent attacks even before Egypt's latest round of turmoil. In the past week, about 900 people have been killed -- mostly in Cairo -- after supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy clashed with the military-backed interim government. Both sides blame each other for starting the violence. Many of the Morsy loyalists are supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Islamist group condemned the attack on Egyptian soldiers. ""Our peaceful protests (are) stronger than any weapon, and we don't accept any violence,"" said Murad Mohamad Ali, media adviser to the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. In May, seven Egyptian solders were kidnapped and held for six days in the Sinai Peninsula, a spokesman for Egypt's armed forces said.

"(CNN) -- For the first time, Apple has launched not one, but two iPhones at its now-annual iPhone launch event. As the rumors predicted, Apple has split its phone line into a premium all singing, all dancing flagship phone for the early tech adopters and one that will play to the so-called ""budget"" crowd looking for an iPhone with a more colourful, youthful approach. The expected result? A successful one. The iPhone 5C gives Apple an affordable phone for those that it has yet to lure into buying an iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. At the same time it has helped create a greater gulf between the two devices that was never really there with the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5. Now, early tech adopters who opt for the iPhone 5S -- compared to their parents or kids that will more than likely opt for the iPhone 5C -- can claim a faster, more powerful phone. It has greater connectivity, an abundance of sensors, including the new addition of fingerprint scanner called TouchID, and more premium materials. WATCH MORE: Will Apple get its mojo back? It's a clever move from Apple as it protects its justification for higher prices. It has, at the same time, created a phone for ""the people,"" that in reality is just as powerful as the previous flagship, the iPhone 5, at a knocked-down price. Not that the competition will be saying that. SIM-free, the new iPhone 5C is still expensive compared to the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4. It might be budget, but Apple believes even this ""cheaper"" phone is the best on the market. Even though it comes with an ""unashamedly plastic shell,"" in the words of Jony Ive at Apple, you are still going to pay for it. That shouldn't be a problem. In the hand, it feels great and very much akin to the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS we all raved about over five years ago. READ MORE: Hands-on impressions . New hardware combined with new software is certainly enough for Apple at the moment. The naysayers will say that it's not, that Apple has failed to innovate here and that there isn't much to woo you from Android with its treats and tricks offered by Samsung, Sony, and HTC. Apple's approach has always been about simplicity, about delivering a device that is easy to use, a device that is the best it can make. If you look at that remit, Apple's done it again. It hasn't allowed itself to be sidetracked with gimmicks that sound impressive but are never used. Android users will most likely tell you that they've never used face recognition to unlock their phone, although they've probably tried it. There is no eye-scrolling tech, movie modes that automatically make films from your footage, or ways to determine what wine you are drinking by snapping the label. READ MORE: How your finger can become a password . That, from a marketing message, could make the playability of the two devices sound limiting. But Apple prefers the tried and tested solid approach. The phone just works. These two phones might sway some Android users across and probably sweep up most of the former BlackBerry users. More importantly, they will open the iPhone to a global audience that is looking for its first smartphone, especially in the new markets like China and Japan.","Apple has launched two new iPhones, one for early adopters and one for budget crowd .

"(CNN) -- A wind-fueled wildfire of epic proportions breached fire lines Tuesday and entered Colorado Springs, Colorado, bringing to at least 32,000 the number of people evacuated in the area and at the U.S. Air Force Academy, authorities said. ""The fire conditions could not be worse,"" said Anne Rys-Sikora, spokeswoman for a multiagency fire response team. ""It is like a convection oven out there."" Residents of the North Mountain Shadows and Peregrine communities in Colorado Springs were ordered to leave their homes, authorities said. Multiple structures in North Mountain Shadows were being affected by the Waldo Canyon Fire, officials said Tuesday night. Colorado Springs set a record high of 101 on Tuesday as firefighters contended with brutal conditions, including ash falling on highways and neighborhoods. Officials rushed in crews and aerial equipment in a bid to slow the fire. The 6,200-acre fire remained only 5% contained. Officials labeled it as exhibiting ""extreme fire behavior."" A grim weather forecast for the rest of the week left residents concerned. ""The fire is moving,"" said Rys-Sikora. The U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs issued an evacuation order for about 700 residents in its Pine Valley Housing and 1,400 in Douglass Valley Housing, said public affairs officer John Van Winkle. The academy's powered flight, glider and parachuting operations were called off Saturday so that the U.S. Forest Service could use runways for helicopters used to fight fires along Colorado's Front Range, Van Winkle said. The academy's Class of 2016, all 1,045 cadets, will arrive Thursday. Town hall meetings about the Waldo Canyon Fire have drawn hundreds of concerned Colorado Springs residents. ""It's one thing to hear of wildfires,"" said Van Winkle. ""it's another to see it from a stop sign and from the back yard."" Dave Barjenbruch, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Boulder, said the past week has been hellish across Colorado. ""Even in the foothills, where most of the fires are going on, most days have been in the single-digit humidity,"" he told CNN. Thunderstorms such as the one that fed the Waldo Canyon Fire on Tuesday are heavy on fire-feeding gusty winds and low on much-needed rainfall, Barjenbruch said. The forecast for Colorado Springs and much of the state doesn't look encouraging, said Barjenbruch. ""Things don't look like they are in a hurry to change here,"" he said. Meanwhile, a new fire in Boulder, northwest of Denver, prompted pre-evacuation notices to 2,300 phone numbers. Six other wildfires were active in the state, according to the Colorado Division of Emergency Management. The largest of the fires was the High Park Fire, which began June 9 and has now consumed 87,250 acres, the U.S. Forest Service said. It was 65% contained Tuesday. The total number of homes lost rose to 257. The Federal Emergency Management Agency authorized the use of federal funds to help fight the Waldo Canyon Fire after Colorado Springs and surrounding El Paso County declared an emergency, which allows them to receive state and federal aid. The mandatory evacuation for Crystal Park was changed to voluntary, Rys-Sikora told CNN. Almost all of Utah was under a red-flag warning, with at least three wildfires burning Tuesday. Authorities said they found the body of one person after they entered the evacuated areas of the Wood Hollow Fire. The victim had not been identified, according to the Sanpete County Sheriff's Office . FEMA is providing funds to help fight the Wood Hollow Fire, which has grown to 39,000 acres since starting Saturday afternoon. Containment was 15%. Tuesday, the east side of U.S. 89 had its evacuations lifted and residents in Fairview Ranchos were also let in. Sanpete County is leaving the evacuation orders in effect for the west side of Hwy 89. West of Provo, Utah, the Dump Fire stood at 5,007 acres and was 100% contained, officials said.","At least 32,000 people are forced out of their homes .

"(CNN) -- She suffers from an autoimmune disease, but seven-time grand slam winner Venus Williams refused to blame her health for an early exit at the Australian Open. The former world No. 1 came into the year's first grand slam in good form after reaching the final of a warm-up event in Auckland in New Zealand, but despite winning the first set against Russia's Ekaterina Makarov, Williams slipped to a 2-6 6-4 6-4 defeat. Williams, ranked 37th in the world, was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome -- which causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels -- in 2011. She hasn't won a grand slam since Wimbledon in 2008. But the American, who will compete in the doubles event alongside her sister and top seed Serena Williams, refused to look for excuses after her defeat by the 22nd seed Makarova, who will face U.S. world No. 141 Irina Falconi in the second round. ""I think that's a factor for any professional athlete, so I don't think I'm any different from anyone else,"" Williams, who made 56 errors during the match, told reporters when asked if her health was the reason for her defeat. ""The last 12 months I have had issues, but this year I definitely am looking forward to having a good run and feeling well."" Williams will now focus her energies on supporting Serena, who wasted no time in wrapping up a 6-2 6-1 win over Australian 17-year-old Ashleigh Barty. The biggest upset of the opening day saw sixth seed Petra Kvitova slip to a 6-2 1-6 6-4 reverse against Thailand's world No. 87 Luksika Kumkhum. It was Kumkhum's first ever match with a top 10 player and her victory means she will at least equal her best grand slam performance to date -- reaching the second round in Melbourne last year. ""I didn't play well,"" conceded Kvitova, a Wimbledon winner in 2011. ""I didn't play my game that I really tried all off season to work on. It was a great off season. I was really excited to be here, feeling good. ""But I think that probably I wanted too much, and then everything just fell down."" Australian Sam Stosur delighted the crowd by chalking up a 6-3 6-4 win over Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic. Seventeenth seed Stosur won the U.S. Open in 2011 but has never been beyond the fourth round of her home grand slam. The weather looks set to play a major part in the tournament, with temperatures expected to top 100 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday after relatively mild conditions on Monday. Organizers are reportedly preparing ice vests and ice towels to keep players cool, but Stosur felt perfectly at home in the heat. ""It was pretty hot out on court,"" said the 29-year-old Australian. ""You get that response from the court and balls when it's hot and the sun is shining. ""I was jumping and using my spin and all that whenever I was able to, so that was nice."" Fourth seed Li Na, beaten by Victoria Azarenka in last year's final, admitted she knew nothing of her Croatian opponent Ana Konjuh before registering a comfortable 6-2 6-0 success. Li's reward for beating the world No. 239 is a second round meeting with Switzerland's Belinda Bencic. Fresh from picking up her first title in two years in Auckland, 14th seed Ana Ivanovic beat Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens 6-4 6-4. There was also joy for Germany as both world No. 15 Sabine Lisicki and Angelique Kerber, seeded ninth, advanced courtesy of wins against Mirjana Lucic-Baroni and Jarmila Gajdosova respectively.","Venus Williams loses in the first round of the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Juan Martin del Potro suffered a shock second-round defeat at the Australian Open in the early hours of Friday morning crashing out to world no. 62 Roberto Bautista Agut. The no. 5 seed arrived in Melbourne in good form after demolishing Bernard Tomic in straight sets in the final of the Sydney International tournament last Sunday. But on a day of extreme heat followed by storms, the Argentine wilted in the face of some excellent serving by the Spaniard losing 4-6 6-3 5-7 6-4 7-5 in three hours 53 minutes. ""I feel comfortable on these courts. These courts are good for my game,"" Bautista Agut said following his epic win which finished at 1.20 am local time. ""I'm serving and returning very well. That helps me a lot. Today I could return a lot of serves from del Potro. This was the key to win the fourth and fifth sets,"" he added. Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, was gracious in defeat but will have to wait another year to better his modest record in Melbourne -- he has reached the quarterfinals twice (2009 and 2012). ""I know him very well. I think he play a great match during the four hours,"" del Potro said. ""It's tough (to lose) when you have played at a very high level during four hours. ""But in every moment, he played unbelievable shots. During break point down, he served well. He made winners with forehands and backhands, and he played close to the lines very often during the match."" Bautista Agut's reward is a third round match against world no. 28 Benoit Paire from France. Elsewhere in the men's draw there were no alarms for the top seeds with Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Roger Federer all coming through in straight sets. World no. 1 Nadal dispatched Australian teenager Thanasi Kokkinakis 6-2 6-4 6-2 under the roof of the Rod Laver Arena while Murray overcame French qualifier Vincent Millot 6-2 6-2 7-5. Federer, who is hunting down a fifth Australian Open title, beat Blaz Kavcic of Slovenia 6-2 6-1 7-6 to claim his 70th win in Melbourne. ""I'm happy on a hot day like this,"" Federer said. ""It was a good first two sets I thought. I played really aggressive and it worked out. Third set I think he was more consistent. He served better. In the process, it got closer. I'm happy I got it done in three,"" he added. World no. 10 and 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is also safely through to the third round after beating Thomaz Bellucci from Brazil 7-6 6-4 6-4. Japan's Kei Nishikori is also safely through after seeing off Serbia's Dusan Lajovic in straight sets 6-1 6-1 7-6. In the women's draw, defending champion Victoria Azarenka made light work of her second round opponent Barbora Zahlavova Strycova from the Czech Republic. The Belarusian, who is looking to clinch a third straight title in Melbourne, won through 6-1 6-4 in just under 90 minutes to set up a meeting with Yvonne Meusburger from Austria. The 2008 champion, Maria Sharapova had a far more punishing match, taking three hours to beat Italy's Karin Knapp 6-3 4-6 10-8. ""I'm really happy to get through today. I really am,"" a relieved Sharapova said after a energy-sapping match in the searing heat. ""I worked really hard in the last few months and I wanted this match. I didn't play my best tennis. I didn't do many things well. But I got through it, and sometimes that's what's important."" she added. France's Alize Comet is up next for the 26-year-old Russian. Tenth seed Caroline Wozniacki is also through after a three-set win (6-0 1-6 6-3) against Christina McHale from the U.S. while fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska booked a third round spot after a straight sets 6-0 7-5 victory against Olga Govortsova from Belarus. Former semi-finalist Jelena Jankovic from Serbia was also a winner on Thursday. The eighth seed steamrollered Japan's Ayumi Morita 6-2 6-0. Thirteenth seed and last year's semi-finalist Sloane Stephens dropped the first set against her second round opponent Croatia's Ajla Tomljanovic, but bounced back to win 3-6 6-2 7-5. The American will face Elina Svitolina from the Ukraine in the third round.","Argentine crashes out in five sets to world no. 62 Roberto Bautista Agut .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Standing in his food shack under posters of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in a Caracas slum, 70-year-old Miguel Bigello relays his backhanded support for Barack Obama. ""For all the deaths he's caused, he's not touched Latin America,"" he said. ""The other guy [Mitt Romney] is too radical. He will fight here for the oil."" The elderly man is an avid supporter of Chavez, his ""Comandante,"" and in the small wooden hut sits a carving of the face of Che Guevara as well as a poster depicting Latin American independence hero Símon Bolívar. Postcard: Why 'Obamagic' has worn off in Nigeria . Bigello shares the view of his president. ""If I was from the U.S., I'd vote for Obama,"" Chavez said buoyantly on state television just a week before he won his third six-year term two weeks ago, potentially extending his tenure to two decades. ""Obama is a good guy."" Venezuela is still hungover from its own presidential election and in this fervently political country — mostly thanks to Chavez's ubiquity, strength of personality and polarizing policies — the U.S. election campaign offers some light relief after a trying few months. Map: The world weighs in on the U.S. election . The contest between Chavez and Henrique Capriles, the Venezuelan opposition's first real hope in 14 years, made the Romney-Obama matchup look like child's play. Chavez welcomed his opponent to the ring in February by calling him a ""low-life pig"" who would be ""pulverized."" There were no debates here as Chavez felt Capriles was below him. ""The eagle does not chase flies,"" said a defiant Chavez. Postcard: Why Berliners, U.S. are kindred spirits . The self-styled socialist leader's supporters see Obama taking a leaf out of Chavez's book. ""Obama is working for the people just like Chavez,"" said Gomez Darwin, 42, stood under a huge Che Guevara mural in a primarily Chavez-supporting Caracas barrio. However, it is the contenders' world views which really matter here. Gloria Torres helped organize prayer vigils for Chavez as he suffered cancer last year. ""Obama's policies towards Latin America haven't been aggressive,"" she said, offering her support for the U.S. incumbent before adding: ""The other guy doesn't seem to have any friendly intentions towards us!"" Venezuela has come up a number of times in Republican rhetoric during the U.S. race. Mitt Romney branded the Venezuelan government a ""threat to national security"" earlier this year, adding that Chavez had spread ""dictatorships and tyranny throughout Latin America."" Postcard: Obama's 'hope' a mirage for hostile Pakistanis . Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, added: ""In a Mitt Romney administration, we will not keep practicing this policy of appeasement ... We will be tough on [Cuban President Raúl] Castro, tough on Chavez. It's because we know that's the right policy for our country."" This antagonism from the Romney camp towards Chavez — compared to Obama's softer approach — has attracted some of Venezuela's more wealthy hard-line opposition. ""Romney named Chavez in his manifesto; Obama didn't,"" said Aixa Armas, eating breakfast at one of Caracas' high-end hotels. ""Obama has closed his eyes to the problem, a regional problem, and he is too friendly with Chavez."" Postcard: War-scarred Baghdad has little faith in election . The lubricant between Caracas and Washington is the world's highest oil reserves on which Chavez sits. It is that wealth that has kept Venezuela's economy from collapsing -- despite epic mismanagement which has led to the region's highest inflation rate and a severe shortage of U.S. dollars. America is Venezuela's biggest oil market and the Latin American country is among the top five exporters to the U.S.. ""The U.S. remains the only actual customer paying cash and at full-price,"" said Russ Dallen, head trader at Caracas' BBO Financial Services. ""Romney may want to use that leverage to stop subsidizing a thorn in America's side."" Dallen adds that Venezuela, or at least the Chavez government, needs oil prices to stay high, and Obama may be a safer bet for that. ""Obama is more willing to tolerate high gasoline prices because gas at $4 a gallon makes people more willing to invest in alternative technologies and for those technologies to be more cost effective."" Postcard: Obama, Romney ignore Afghans at own peril . Chavez is unlikely to be thinking in such depth. His support for Obama recently marks the apex of the 58-year-old strongman's relations with Washington since coming to power in 1999. The infamous nadir came in 2006 when Chavez stood at the United Nations lectern, theatrically sniffing the air. ""The devil came here yesterday,"" he said, a day after former President George W Bush's speech. ""It smells of sulfur still."" He then went onto describe Bush's ""domination, exploitation, and pillage of the peoples of the world."" Chavez quipped two weeks ago that Obama would support him too, had he been born in Venezuela's slums. After some shaky relations, Chavez is prepared to start again. ""With the likely triumph of Obama, and the extreme right defeated both here and there [in the U.S.], I hope we can start a new period of normal relations.""","Hugo Chavez endorsed Obama, calling him a 'good guy'

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- We live in a three-speed economic world, according to the International Monetary Fund. Nations that enjoy the fastest growth include China, India and other emerging countries. Moving at a moderate pace are the United States, finally seeing the light at the end of the 2008 financial crisis tunnel, and Japan, riding a resurgence thanks to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vow for a 2% inflation target. But economic growth across most of Europe is still growing at a crawl. Earlier this month, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, said this current three-speed world is setting up financial imbalances that could pave the way for future crises. And just this week, against this backdrop of divergent growth rates, the IMF cut world economic growth for 2013 from 3.5% to 3.3%. But Olivier Blanchard, IMF chief economist, told CNN's Richard Quest that there is reason to be hopeful. ""The reason to be optimistic is to look at what has happened in the U.S. For a while, the question was 'Where is growth going to come from?'. And what you see is nearly 100 flowers blooming,"" Blanchard said. ""People are becoming more optimistic. The fact that there was no housing construction means that we don't have enough houses, so housing is doing well. Monetary policy is aggressive. People believe it. Banks are improving."" A recent report by Case-Shiller says U.S. home prices are slowly returning to normal, with a prediction that average home prices will rise an average of 3.3% through September 2017. U.S unemployment fell to 7.6% in March, its lowest since December 2008, although much of the fall that month was attributed to attrition in the number of people looking for jobs. The question, adds Blanchard, is how Europe can stage a U.S.-style recovery despite a crisis in confidence across much of the Continent. Record unemployment in the eurozone -- at 12% in February -- means about 19 million people are jobless. Nearly one in four of those unemployed are under 25. ""If you look in Europe -- in particular core Europe -- what you see is people don't have any hope and so what they do is they don't spend, and firms don't invest and banks don't lend,"" said Blanchard. ""And it just feeds on itself. Now if they had confidence, they would spend more, firms would invest more, banks would do more and we could have growth. It can happen but the point is how do we make it happen?"" Blanchard says the only tool that remains is monetary policy -- a cut to interest rates. Yet, despite warnings from IMF chief Christine Lagarde and prominent American economist Nouriel Roubini, the European Central Bank has left rates unchanged since July 2012, with the benchmark rate standing pat at 0.75%. ""We have to use all the tools we have,"" said Blanchard. ""The tool which remains is monetary policy. Has it gone too far? I don't think it's too far. There are some risks associated...but my sense is the benefits far exceed the risks or the cost.""","IMF says world economies are separating into three different speeds .
China, India growing fastest, U.S. and Japan have moderate growth, Europe slowest .

"Boston (CNN) -- Outside the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Boston on a recent winter day are the regulars -- a small, devoted team of anti-abortion activists, handing out fliers and urging patrons to hear their message: . ""Save that child."" ""Every life is precious, protect that life within you."" ""Please change your mind."" Several people pray silently nearby. Clearly marked on the sidewalk, nearly 12 yards from the front doors, is a painted boundary, a line the protesters cannot cross. By state law, their First Amendment rights stop there. A metaphoric line -- testing the competing limits of what has become a constitutional fight between free speech and public safety -- will now be surveyed by the nation's highest court. The justices on Wednesday will step back into the larger national debate on abortion, when it holds oral arguments on a challenge to a Massachusetts law that established tighter buffer zones around facilities that perform the procedure. A ruling is expected by June. The state's ""selective exclusion law"" makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic ""employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment"" to ""enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk"" within 35 feet of ""a reproductive health care facility."" Anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from effectively talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances. But a federal appeals court a year ago said ""the right of the state to take reasonable steps to ensure the safe passage of persons wishing to enter health care facilities cannot seriously be questioned."" Supporters said the law was established to protect clinic staff and patients from what they said was harassment and intimidation from protesters. Some anti-abortion protests have turned violent in the United States. ""Massachusetts' buffer zone statute strikes the right balance between ensuring safe access to medical facilities and preserving freedom of expression,"" said state Attorney General Martha Coakley. ""This law has enhanced public safety in a fair and constitutional manner."" Her office will defend the 2007 law before the justices. Its defenders said most clinic workers believe the current buffer zones have eased concerns of clinic staff, and created a more welcoming, calming environment for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies. Demonstrators have appeared regularly at clinics in Boston, Springfield, and Worcester and say they are unfairly singled out for exclusions on public property. Reasonable restrictions, or unfair treatment? ""The prohibition applies even to speakers who are entirely peaceful, do not engage in any obstructive or intimidating conduct,"" said Mark Rienzi, a Catholic University law professor representing the group, ""and seek only to proffer leaflets, engage in consensual conversations, or even just stand and display a sign or pray."" Lead plaintiff Eleanor McCullen is a lifelong Catholic who generally spends mornings two days a week peacefully spreading her anti-abortion message at the Greater Boston Health Center. With a large cross around her neck, the 77-year-old grandmother often uses a baby stroller as a prop, along with a portable DVD player with images of a fetal ultrasound. On a recent day, she was seen standing at the edge of the yellow semicircle ringing the Boston clinic on Commonwealth Avenue. The current state law strengthened earlier restrictions that had created a 6-foot protective bubble around clinic patrons approaching the facility. Abortion rights supporters said it was ineffective, since they claimed it led to blocked entrances, and a gauntlet of protesters surrounding patients and staff. The last time the high court took a close look at the issue was in 2000, upholding Colorado's broad ""no approach zone"" regulations. Similar to the earlier Massachusetts law, protesters were kept at least eight feet from anyone within 100 feet of any health care facility. ""Private citizens have always retained the power to decide for themselves what they wish to read, and within limits, what oral messages they want to consider,"" said Justice John Paul Stevens for the 6-3 majority. ""This statute simply empowers private citizens entering a health care facility with the ability to prevent a speaker, who is within eight feet and advancing, from communicating a message they do not wish to hear."" But, in dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said anti-abortion protesters were singled out for special, unfair treatment. ""Does the deck seem stacked? You bet. As I have suggested throughout this opinion, today's decision is not an isolated distortion of our traditional constitutional principles, but is one of many aggressively pro-abortion novelties announced by the Court in recent years,"" he said. ""Uninhibited, robust, and wide open debate is replaced by the power of the state to protect an unheard-of 'right to be let alone' on the public streets."" Ruling could affect other types of protest . Municipalities in Montana, Colorado, Florida, California and elsewhere have since enacted similar ""fixed"" and ""floating"" buffer zone laws for clinics. What the high court decides could also affect a broader range of free speech arenas, over issues such as war, taxes, corporate bailouts and elections. The justices last month heard arguments in a separate appeal involving a longtime anti-war protester kept from spreading his message along a public right-of-way at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The sidewalk outside the U.S. Supreme Court itself is the scene of daily anti-abortion protests sponsored by Bound4Life, where mostly young Christian adults stand silent wearing red tape across their mouths with the handwritten word ""LIFE."" And next week's 41st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade high court ruling legalizing abortion will attract thousands of marchers on both sides of the issue outside the court, just across the street from the Capitol. The Massachusetts case is McCullen v. Coakley (12-1168).","Supreme Court will hear First Amendment case Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- If austerity had been a clinical trial, it would have been stopped. As public health experts, we have watched aghast as a slow motion disaster arose from austerity policies in Europe, while politicians continue to ignore the evidence of their disastrous effects. Austerity was designed to shrink debts. Now, three years after Europe's budget-cutting began, the evidence is in: severe, indiscriminate austerity is not part of the solution, but part of the problem -- and its human costs are devastating. In the U.S., Greece, Italy, Spain, the UK and elsewhere in Europe there were more than 10,000 additional suicides from 2007-2010, a figure that is over and above historical trends, with the largest rises concentrated in the worst performing economies. But suicides and depression are not unavoidable consequences of economic downturns: countries that slashed health and social protection budgets have seen starkly worse health outcomes than nations which opted for stimulus over austerity. Greece, for example, is in the middle of a public health disaster. To meet budget-deficit reduction targets set by the European Central Bank, European Commission, and International Monetary Fund (the so-called troika), Greece's public health budget has been cut by more than 40%. As Greece's health minister observed, ""these aren't cuts with a scalpel, they're cuts with a butcher's knife."" The spending was reduced to 6% of GDP, a figure lower than the UK, at 8%, and Germany, at 9%. As a result, HIV infections have jumped by more than 200% since 2010, concentrated in injection drug users, as needle-exchange program budgets were cut in half. There was a malaria epidemic in Greece -- the largest in 40 years -- after mosquito-spraying budgets were slashed. More than 200 essential medicines have been de-stocked from some pharmacies as the state's drug budget was reduced and pharmaceuticals companies exited the country in arrears. Since 2008 there has been a rise of more than 40% of people who report being unable to access healthcare that they believe to be medically necessary, the majority concentrated in pensioners. As patients cannot afford private care and forego preventive care, public sector hospitals have experienced a 24% rise in hospital admissions. Doctors and clinics are therefore overstrained. Infant mortality rates have risen 40% between 2008 and 2010. Over 35,000 public health workers, nurses, and doctors have lost jobs. Unemployment rates have hit 27% and youth unemployment has jumped to near 75% in some areas. With little hope for the future, desperate people are turning to cheap, synthetic drugs. Use of anti-depressants has skyrocketed, adding costs to the healthcare system. Suicide rates, previously among the lowest in Europe, have soared. Were these all inevitable consequences of recession, rather than consequences of austerity? Of course the Greek financial and political elites have made mistakes. And of course Greece's fiscal and monetary options were severely restricted as part of the bailout deals. But the suffering of the Greeks was not inevitable. The timing of many of these health effects coincided not with the onset of recession in 2008 and 2009, but with the implementation of deep budget cuts starting in 2010. Several prevailing myths are commonly offered as alternative explanations for Greece's devastating health outcomes, including these three: . The first myth: ""Greece's healthcare system is excessive and inefficient."" But there are just five hospital beds in Greece per 1,000 people, versus more than eight beds per 1,000 people in Germany. The second myth: ""Greeks are lazy."" But in 2011 the average Greek citizen worked 2,038 hours per year -- 600 hours more than the average German, according to the OECD. The third myth: ""Europe's bailout money is being squandered."" But bailout money is not flowing in to support Greece's healthcare system -- it is instead circulating back to large international banks in Germany, France and the UK. What we learned from analyzing past crises is that people do not inevitably get sick or die because the economy has faltered. Fiscal policy can be a matter of life and death. During the Great Depression in the U.S. in the 1930s, mortality rates actually fell by about 10%. Even though suicide rates increased among the unemployed between 1929 and 1933, this increase was outweighed by short-term drops in road traffic deaths, as people drove less to save on fuel costs. Then, at a time when total debt was over 200% of GDP, President Franklin Roosevelt implemented the New Deal, which created the U.S. social safety net. New Deal programs to re-house people who lost their homes, help people return to work, and build a public health infrastructure were highly effective -- and each additional $100 per capita in New Deal spending reduced suicides by 4 per 100,000 and infant deaths by about 18 per 100,000. Tuberculosis rates also fell, but disease rates were substantially reduced in those states that aggressively implemented the New Deal rather than those avoiding its implementation -- a ""natural experiment."" 1934, the year after the New Deal started becoming effective, marked the beginning of the U.S. economic recovery. Another ""natural experiment"" occurred in the aftermath of the East Asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998. Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia all had large market crashes: their currencies plummeted, GDP collapsed, and unemployment soared. But their politicians responded differently to the crisis, creating a rare laboratory in which we can identify the health effects of economic policy. Indonesia and Thailand turned to the IMF for help, implementing deep cuts to its HIV prevention, whereas Malaysia charted a different path, investing in preventive measures during the crisis. Indonesia and Thailand suffered large pneumonia and tuberculosis outbreaks, but Malaysia avoided these effects. Turning to the current recession in Europe, Iceland is another case study revealing that there is an alternative to austerity. Five years ago its three largest banks failed, and their total debt rocketed to over 800% of GDP. It was the largest banking crisis in history relative to the size of an economy and it forced Iceland to turn to the IMF for help. The troika's bailout plan called for reductions in spending equivalent to 50% of the budget in order to finance bank bailouts. The health minister resigned in protest at plans to cut the healthcare budget by 30%, as detailed in our book. Then the president of Iceland took a radical step: asking the people what they wanted to do. In March 2010, 93% of the Icelandic people voted against financing a bailout for foreign savers of Icesave Bank through draconian budget cuts. Instead, Iceland stabilized healthcare spending. Thanks to this boost to the nation's universal healthcare system, no one lost access to healthcare even as the cost of imported medicines rose as an effect of the devaluation of the Icelandic Krona. There was no significant rise in suicides or depression. Nor were there any significant infectious disease outbreaks. Indeed, last year GDP growth was 2.7%, and unemployment rates have fallen below 5%. Having seen the results, the IMF turned tail, praising Iceland's successful approach. Each of these crises -- America's Great Depression, the Asian financial crisis, and Iceland's bank meltdown -- had different origins, but they led to potentially similar health threats. But their contrasting outcomes support our conclusion that an economic crisis does not inevitably increase in death and disability. The real danger is austerity. But if austerity is not working, and indeed is part of the problem (as the IMF has recently admitted), why are European leaders continuing its pursuit? British economist John Maynard Keynes indirectly outlined the dangers of austerity in 1919. Germany's unpayable debt from World War I, he argued, exacted by European nations in the Treaty of Versailles, would cause economic collapse and, ultimately, social instability in Germany. Tragically, his premonition was borne out: Germany's deep austerity under ""hunger chancellor"" Heinrich Bruning as it struggled to repay debts to France, Belgium, and the U.S. fueled the rise of the Nazi party and, as some historians argue, ultimately World War II in Europe. In the aftermath of that war, West Germany benefited from the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan, whereby America injected $1.45 billion in funds to invest in German industry and rebuild vital infrastructure. The Marshall Plan's stimulus package helped spur recovery, paving the way for decades of prosperity and peace in Western Europe. Collectively we seem to be losing sight of the lessons from our past. In Greece, austerity packages in Europe are sparking the rising popularity of neo-Nazi parties, such as Golden Dawn. But there is an alternative. In 2009, the German parliament approved a 50 billion euros stimulus package to spur growth. Across Europe we have found that economies that introduced greater stimulus investment have charted faster economic recoveries. Thanks to smart investments in ""active labor market programs""â€”programs that help people access job retraining and return to work quickly-- Germany, Sweden and Iceland have mitigated rises in depression and suicides from unemployment. Our research has found that each euro invested in public health can yield up to a three euros return if invested wisely in data-supported government programs. New York City officials learned this lesson in the early 1990s -- after restricting its TB prevention budget, the city suffered a drug-resistant TB outbreak that ultimately cost $1.2 billion to control, about 10 times greater than the estimated price of prevention. Greece's HIV, TB, and malaria epidemics will now cost more to control than they would have been to prevent, our research indicates. What we have learned is that severe, indiscriminate cuts to vital social protection programs are not only economically self-defeating, but fatal.","Health experts David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu say that if austerity had been a clinical trial, it would have been stopped .

"(CNN) -- The search is on for a new team to join the elite racing ranks of the Formula One grid. The sport's governing body, the FIA, has put out a call for ""an expression of interest"" for a 12th team to join the world championship for the start of the 2015 or 2016 season. Any interested parties have until January 3 2014 to register their interest. But before you start saving up your Christmas money, the FIA has already laid down detailed criteria, including an ability to stay in the championship until the flag falls on the 2020 season. The organization is asking for the identity of prospective teams' shareholders, potential strategies and information about the candidate's experience in motor racing. If a potential competitor gets through the first round then the FIA will assess its technical ability, resources, funding, experience and the value it would bring to the F1 championship. To underline how much money matters, teams must pay $5,000 to express their interest and a total of $130,000 to formally apply. F1 last expanded the grid in 2010 when three new teams joined. Of the trio, two are still racing in their current guises -- Caterham and Marussia. The Spanish Hispania (HRT) team withdrew from the sport at the end of 2012 because of financial difficulties. New teams entering F1 often find it hard to close the gap on the midfield and front running teams. Four time world champion team Red Bull Racing had two significant advantages when it was formed in 2005. The financial Austrian energy drink company took over the established Jaguar team rather than starting from scratch and also arrived with significant independent funding. Lawsuit looms . Meanwhile, Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone could face another lawsuit despite already defending cases on both sides of the Atlantic. German media group Constantin Medien and U.S. company Bluewaters Communication Holdings are pursuing cases against Ecclestone surrounding the sale of F1 to private equity firm CVC in 2006. German bank BayernLB confirmed Thursday that it also plans to start action against the British billionaire also in relation to the sale of his F1 business. ""We can confirm that BayernLB is working at high speed on civil charges against Mr Ecclestone and expects to file suit against him in High Court in London in January 2014,"" BayernLB told CNN in a statement. Ecclestone was contacted by CNN but his spokeswoman did not wish to comment at this time.","Formula One is looking for a new team to join the grid .

"(CNN) -- Like most teens, I had a lot of questions about sex growing up, but I really didn't want to ask my parents any of them. I didn't want to ask anyone any of them. I tried to piece things together for myself from what I'd read in books, seen in movies, seen in plays. It wasn't that my parents wouldn't have frankly answered my questions. They had always let me know they were quite ready to discuss the topic, anytime I wanted to. Even though it was a little difficult for me, I eventually became more comfortable. In fact, when I lost my virginity, I felt I should honor my dad's forthrightness by telling him. (My mom and I had already discussed it before the fact.) He said, ""OK. And are you using birth control?"" I told him I was. ""Great,"" he said. ""I don't really need to know much more. Thank you so much for telling me."" He was proud, I think, that I had shared the news with him but could only handle so much at that moment. And though my dad clearly had a line where he got squeamish, I'm always grateful that both of my parents were so clear with me that sex was a normal, wonderful part of life and nothing to feel ashamed about. As a parent, I think about that often now. Our daughter is in high school, and our older son is in middle school. Like my parents, we try to do everything possible to make sure we are communicating with them in a clear, frank way so that they actually hear what we have to say. That can be difficult. They have access to information about sex in ways we never did. We are competing with many different sources: Twitter, texting, the Internet, and television all influence how they think and act. That's why Let's Talk Month in October -- an annual awareness-raising effort that emphasizes the importance of conversations about sex and relationships between parents and their teens -- is extremely important. It's a great opportunity for parents and young people to start (or even better, continue) a meaningful conversation about sex and relationships. A new study from Planned Parenthood, Family Circle magazine and the Center for Latino Adolescent and Family Health at New York University shows that parents are significantly more comfortable talking to their teens than teens are talking to their parents -- just the way I was! Opinion: Oops, I left my sexual orientation at home . But even though it may be hard to get started, it's so worthwhile to talk with kids, answer their questions about sex, and help them make smart decisions about their relationships and behavior. And the more you talk, the easier it gets. In my household, we started talking with our kids when they were young, when their curiosity about their bodies and about differences between boys and girls created natural opportunities for starting a dialogue. We always emphasized that their bodies were private and their own. And while every family has its own opinions on this, from our earliest conversations about sex I felt it was important to emphasize to both my daughter and my son that birth control is a must, not a maybe. Age-appropriate school programs also help reinforce the conversations we are having at home and can help increase teens' comfort level when talking with their parents. My daughter's sex education class in middle school was really terrific. Every student was required to anonymously write down a question on a piece of paper and put it in a hat at every meeting. Nothing was off limits. There were questions like, ""Can you get pregnant if you have sex when you have your period?"" That kind of anonymity -- when posing a question a teen really wants to ask, but is maybe too embarrassed to ask a teacher or a parent directly -- is so important for a young person. And that class sparked endless conversations and made our daughter feel more comfortable talking about these issues with us at home. It is never too early or too late to start having these conversations. October is as good as time as any. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Nixon.","Cynthia Nixon says when she was young, she dreaded talking about sex with her parents .

"(CNN) -- ""Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son,"" Ronan Farrow tweeted last week. The lighthearted message masterfully sidestepped gossip and scandal: His mother, actress Mia Farrow, divulged to Vanity Fair magazine that ex-husband Frank Sinatra could ""possibly"" be the 25-year-old's father. It was long believed that the biological father of the Rhodes Scholar-turned-diplomat-turned-lawyer was filmmaker Woody Allen, who had a relationship with Farrow for 12 years. Ronan Farrow fell out with Allen when it came to light that the prolifically quirky director was having an affair with one of Mia Farrow's adopted daughters, Soon-Yi Previn. Allen and Previn later married in 1997. On Father's Day last year, Ronan memorably tweeted: ""Happy Father's day -- or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law's day."" While this most recent questioning about paternity made headlines because of the famous parents, the circumstance can shake any family, according to psychology experts. Families shaped by divorce and remarriage, traditional adoption, second-parent adoption, surrogacy and in vitro fertilization might mean the conversation happens more often than ever before. 'The world opened up' For Brian Hansen, 32, of New Jersey, his life changed over a drink with a cousin in 2010. Hansen and his wife were expecting their first child, and he told his cousin he was scared of the type of parent he would be because of the angry father he had known. ""My cousin saw that I was very worried and in a distressed place,"" Hansen said. His cousin, sensing his angst, figured it was time to come clean: The man who had raised Hansen was not his biological father. Hansen's mother had used a sperm donor to conceive both him and his younger sister. ""I just sat there and stared at him for nine or 10 seconds,"" Hansen said. ""... My life literally re-defined by fermented oats served cold by a waitress with nose jewelry named Miranda,"" he wrote on his blog less than 24 hours later in a post titled ""And Now For Something Completely F***ed."" For Hansen, there was an immediate sense of relief. From about age 7, Hansen said he and his sister would look at each other and ask: ""Where did we come from?"" He had a rocky relationship with his father growing up, and in 2008, he severed ties once and for all. His parents, now divorced, were together for 32 years. ""Once I found out I wasn't beholden to his gene, the world opened up,"" Hansen said. While Hansen's and Ronan Farrow's paternal relationships fell into the ""strained"" camp, experts such as Jennifer Hogan say the news can rock a family whether the parent-child relationship is good, bad or downright ugly. This type of news will raise issues of identity and trust, especially if other family members were in on the secret. ""It shakes your self-awareness and sense of self to its core,"" said Hogan, a licensed clinical social worker. ""For parents, the important thing to understand is that we get a lot of identity from who our immediate family is."" Think about it: Recreational hobbies, personality traits, even career paths often follow the suit of a parent. ""The child starts to feel like an outsider to their family,"" Hogan said. Hogan said Hansen's sense that he ""wasn't destined to become the same as this person"" can be freeing: ""You get a clean slate for half of your biology."" But there will also be some uncertainty about what traits might come from a newly discovered parent. ""It will shake your foundation,"" Dr. Gabriela Cora agrees. ""Even if you suspected it before, confirming it can still be a shocker."" 'Secrets are inherently destructive' For parents, of course, the million-dollar question is when to deliver the news. ""Secrets are inherently destructive to families,"" Hogan said. ""Eventually they come out, and they cause a lot of havoc."" The debate over disclosure versus secrecy is one that adoption support groups advise should be ongoing within families -- and that the child's age and inquisitiveness are cues for how much to make known. There's no easy answer. ""Adult adoptees who grew up with secrecy talk about feeling that something wasn't 'right' about them, about feeling both betrayed and relieved when they learned the truth. Others interpreted their parents' reluctance to talk to mean that adoption was taboo,"" Lois Melina wrote in Adoptive Families magazine. Cora, a psychiatrist, encourages the same process for all parents who aren't biologically linked to their child. ""Err on being truthful,"" she said. A big factor in the ""when"" is if the children are old enough to comprehend the implications or if they start raising questions about their identity, Cora said. If the child is really young and determined to seek out a biological tie that isn't part of his or her current life, the parents who raised the child might encourage him or her to wait a couple of years to seek out roots -- and agree to help when the time comes. Hogan said innately understanding where you come from is something children begin to want to understand. But the age at which it's discussed should be when they can steel themselves for rejection. ""It is the ultimate rejection if your biological parent doesn't have interest in you,"" she said. Hogan suggests parents be honest in their explanations, acknowledging their own fears and doubts about telling the truth. This is especially pertinent if a child could have been abused, mistreated or neglected in the care of a biological parent. ""People think that they really want to know the truth (about their biological parents), but they've idealized that truth,"" Cora said. The child, even as an adult, will discover and decide for him or herself what comes from nature and what's nurtured. For Hansen, who had a rough relationship with his dad, he said he felt a release of issues he thought were innate. But he was upset that his mother didn't tell him the truth while he dealt with his own anger issues, or when he and his wife asked about medical history before trying to have a baby. With a lot of processing -- therapy, that is -- his relationship with his mother is at a peaceful point, he said. ""She thought she was doing the right thing by not telling us, and in her view, he loved us, she loved us, they were our parents -- and none of the other stuff mattered,"" he said. ""Because of the way that I was raised, he's always going to be a part of who I am -- biological or not.""","Actress Mia Farrow revealed her son's father might ""possibly"" be Frank Sinatra .

"(CNN) -- A French magazine has been fined for publishing topless photographs of Britain's likely future queen, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and ordered not to distribute the magazine in print or online, a French court ruled Tuesday. The court ordered Closer magazine to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling and to pay them 2,000 euros (about $2,600). The magazine must pay a further 10,000 euros a day if it is late in handing over the photos. And a French prosecutor opened a preliminary criminal investigation into the incident, the Nanterre prosecutor's office said Tuesday. Catherine and her husband, Prince William, the second in line to the throne, ""welcome the injunction that's been granted. They always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy,"" the palace said. French law provides for ""draconian sanctions"" to protect against invasions of privacy, British lawyer Charlotte Harris said, including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines. Separately, the board of a newspaper that published the topless photos is conducting an internal investigation. The board of the Irish Daily Star was considering shutting down the newspaper but decided to await the investigation results, which are expected in ""a few weeks."" After the Irish Daily Star published the photos Saturday, one of the newspaper's editors was suspended, pending the investigation. The royal family filed a criminal complaint seeking invasion of privacy charges against Closer and possibly the photographer, a palace spokeswoman said. The photos of Catherine sunbathing are more about invasion of privacy rather than nudity, royal biographer Christopher Andersen said. Prince William and his brother, Prince Harry, still blame the media for the 1997 death of their mother, Princess Diana, in a Paris traffic accident as her driver fled paparazzi, Andersen said. French investigators concluded the driver of the car Diana was traveling in lost control while he was intoxicated. The royal family is concerned about similar invasions, particularly if William and Catherine have a child, Andersen said. In a civil court proceeding Monday in Paris, attorneys for the royals asked for damages and a court order to prevent the photos from being published again. William and Kate: Keeping calm and carrying on . They also want existing photos taken offline, a palace spokesman said. The court ruled in their favor on both counts Tuesday. Lawyer Aurelien Hamelle denounced the published photos in court Monday, calling them an infringement of privacy, CNN affiliates reported. ""It is a scene of married life, intimate, personal, that has nothing to do on a magazine,"" Hamelle said. Chi, an Italian magazine owned by the same company as Closer, put out a special edition Monday with 26 pages of photos of William and Catherine on vacation. As editors at Closer did last week, Chi executives defended publishing the photos despite the furor from London. ""It is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love,"" Editor-in-Chief Alfonso Signorini said in a statement. Chi and Closer are owned by the Mondadori publishing company, which is headed by Marina Berlusconi, daughter of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Opinion: Wake up, Kate; photogs are always watching .

"(CNN)  -- Rafael Nadal and Venus Williams are set to receive big pay rises if they successfully defend their Wimbledon singles titles this year. Rafael Nadal and Venus Williams parade their winning trophies from Wimbledon last year. This year's men's and women's champions will walk away with £850,000 ($1.24 million), an increase of 13.3 percent, although in dollar teams a decrease because of the weakened British pound. All England Club chairman Tim Phillips said the increase was necessary to offset exchange rate implications and to help maintain the tournament's standing among players. ""Most of the players here don't bank in sterling,"" Phillips told Press Association. ""We have to be mindful of the fact that a year ago it was two dollars to the pound and now it's less than one pound fifty."" Overall prize money on a sterling basis is going up by 6.2 percent from £11.8 million to £12.55 million ($18.38 million). The money is distributed equally for the men's and women's events with Wimbledon adopting this policy in 2007 following criticism from officials and players. New developments for 2009 are highlighted by the Centre Court sliding roof with capacity on the ground increased by 3,500 to 40,000. The cash-rich All England Club also announced a five-year extension of its contract with sponsors IBM. In other tennis news, Gael Monfils could miss next month's French Open because of a left knee injury. The Frenchman reached the semifinals at Roland Garros last year, but was quoted in sports daily L'Equipe on Tuesday saying that the results of an MRI scan on his knee were ""not good."" .","All England Club say weakened pound forced them into big prize money increases .

"(CNN) -- Swimming superstar Michael Phelps once claimed he scoffed up to 12,000 calories a day. Usain Bolt's big sprint rival Yohan Blake says he chomps 16 ripe bananas every 24 hours. A tiny Japanese athlete easily tucked away 50 pieces of sushi after training, while another marathon runner gobbled plates of raw mince. Or how about the weightlifter who drinks the first milk of a cow that has just given birth? With extreme eating habits like these, it may be some surprise to learn that within the Olympic Village there lurks a culinary trap that can potentially tip athletes over the fine line between success and failure at London 2012. Competitors spend years honing their bodies to perfection, scrupulously eating the right foods, avoiding the wrong ones ... and then? They encounter the Olympic Dining Hall. With a McDonald's at one end and machines dispensing other sponsors' soft drinks and confectionery, the giant eating area provides mountains of fodder from around the world -- a full gamut of gluttony from one extreme of the health spectrum to the other. Cooking for an Olympic champ: A recipe for success . It's a 5,000-capacity, 24-hour facility where organizers expect 25,000 loaves of bread, 232 tons of potatoes, 75,000 liters of milk and more than 330 tons of fruit and vegetables to be consumed by the time the Games finish on August 12. Some 1.2 million meals will be served -- 60,000 a day. ""For the younger athletes it's an exciting new experience,"" says sports scientist Jess Corones, who works with the Australian Olympic swim team. ""It's all free. There's thousands of athletes and there's pretty much every kind of cuisine that you could possibly want. There's a stand that gives you unlimited McDonald's, there's machines that pump out unlimited amounts of soft drinks for you. ""That's exciting and it can be a distraction for them. They think, 'Oh this is so cool,' and they just run to it -- but you have to remind them that it'll still be there when they've finished competing and that until they've finished competing they've got to stay on their normal routine."" What passes for ""normal"" can vary wildly. Phelps, after winning a record eight gold medals at Beijing 2008, told NBC that he gorged on carbohydrate-heavy pasta and pizza at the height of his extreme training. Jamaica's 100-meter world champion Blake says he eats so many bananas to keep up his potassium levels. British weightlifter Jake Oliver says that every morning he drinks a shake containing colostrum -- a protein-rich form of milk produced during the late stages of cows' pregnancy. ""I've tried to get people to try it, but they won't. Just the smell of it is enough to put people off,"" he told UK newspaper The Guardian. Or even Japan's former Olympic marathon champion Naoko Takahashi, a diminutive runner who told CNN she could consume about 2 kg of fish after a big session. ""I only ate twice a day. But I ate a lot,"" said Takahashi, who won gold at Sydney 2000 and now works in television. British Olympian explains her ideal meals . However, it's rare for athletes to eat quite that much, says Corones, who first worked with Australia's track and field team at the 2004 Athens Games. Phelps actually admitted this year that the report of his gargantuan appetite was a myth, saying such intake would be impossible. ""I find it hard to believe,"" Corones said. ""I tell you what, if he is eating that he's got a pretty exceptional metabolism! The only people that I've seen eat close to that are the hammer throwers, and they all weigh in at 120 kilos."" Corones has had some experience of quirky diets though, citing Australia's Ethiopia-born marathon runner Sisay Bezabeh from the 2004 team. ""We had our camp in Italy and all he used to eat every dinner was a bowl of raw mince. I found it quite disgusting but he needed iron for his running, and that's what he did. You wouldn't get many athletes doing that these days."" Good nutrition from a young age can be vital if you want to be an elite athlete. Becky Stevenson, a British dietitian based in the Netherlands, has researched the importance of vitamin D for improving performance and avoiding injury. She cites reports that showed Chinese adolescent girls with adequate vitamin D had ""significant higher bone mass and muscle strength."" Questions have been raised about teenage swimmer Ye Shiwen's incredible performances at London 2012, but such research has yet to prove that high levels of vitamin D could be a contributing factor to her success. ""We know low levels may impact muscle strength and bone turnover, but if an athlete has adequate levels there is no evidence of an enhanced benefit to performance, so natural talent and athletic ability is more likely,"" Stevenson told CNN. Meanwhile, studies have shown that young athletes in northern European countries such as Britain, Finland and Germany often suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Proper levels can reduce the risk of stress fractures, inflammatory injuries and upper respiratory tract infections. ""You can get vitamin D in food sources (such as eggs, dairy and fish) but it's not as effective as sunshine production,"" Stevenson said. ""Those at risk are athletes training at 35 degrees or above latitude -- northern Europe, north China, North America -- as UVB rays are inadequate during the winter months from November to April. ""When we measured our elite tennis players we only found one athlete who was marginal with vitamin D, as he had been injured and was rehabbing indoors. ""There needs to be more research evidence looking at vitamin D and injury prevention -- most of the work is retrospective."" Most athletes use supplements to bolster their dietary intake, everything from everyday vitamins such as magnesium and iron plus products such as whey protein, creatine, carnitine and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) specifically aimed at improving performance and recovery. But, with drug-testing standards improving year by year and the list of banned substances also increasing, there is a strong onus for athletes to be acutely aware of everything they put in their mouth. ""Most athletes are using quite a few supplements. They live an extreme life, the amount of training they do is extreme, they exercise way outside what the normal person would do, so it is important to supplement their diet,"" Corones says. ""There is a very fine line and it's something that athletes need to stay on top of. The onus is 100% on the athlete and we make that very clear to them from a young age that they are responsible for what goes in their mouth. No matter if it comes from their coach or their parents or their brother or their friend, they have to know what they're putting in their body. ""You might trust your coach 100% but if he gives you a bottle of tablets and tells you it's iron, it's still your responsibility to get that checked. We have hotlines where the athletes can call up and check anything, so it's pretty easy to find out if it's okay to take."" At this stage, with the Games underway and many athletes still waiting to begin their competitions, the emphasis is on refinement as opposed to strength building. ""It varies depending on where we are in the year,"" says Corones, who works for the New South Wales Institute of Sport in Sydney. ""Earlier on we want them to be carrying a bit of extra weight to reduce the chances of injury and illness, but then when it gets down to racing it's stripped down to the bare minimum,"" she says. ""We don't really get them to count calories, we more look at what areas of food groups they're eating from. You're looking at getting quality fats, making sure you get enough carbohydrates, and also the timing of the meal -- if you're swimming or doing gym. ""If you're doing gym there's a greater mechanical breakdown of the muscle so we need to eat more protein post the session, with a little bit pre the session."" A big part of Corones' job is making sure athletes learn the right food habits -- and this generally means breaking eating patterns formed at a young age. ""It's a pretty big education process for the athletes. There are still some that struggle with that concept that the less processed it is, the better it is for them,"" she says. ""Often early on in their careers, in their young teens, they do a lot of training and they want to grab the first thing that's quickest available because they're always hungry after training. So they get in the habit of having a bucket of hot chips after every training session. Obviously that's not great so we try to break those habits. ""We often find that the processed foods -- with the high salt and the high sugar content in them -- that the body can crave them. It's about trying to break those cycles and get them eating as well as they can.""","Athletes face big food temptations in the Olympic Village dining hall .

"Washington (CNN) -- Pro-gun activist Adam Kokesh, recently seen in an Internet video loading and cocking a shotgun, is being held in a Washington jail for three days pending a detention hearing on Monday, a judge ruled. He is charged with carrying a rifle or shotgun outside a home or place of business, an offense that carries a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. Kokesh, an Iraq veteran, made headlines with a July Fourth video posted to YouTube in which he loaded a shotgun in the middle of the national capital's Freedom Plaza. He also used Facebook to call for an armed march in Washington for the same day but called off the event in May. It is illegal to carry firearms in the District of Columbia. District of Columbia Magistrate Judge Lori Parker said Kokesh ""poses a danger"" and went ""out of his way"" to violate the district's laws. Kokesh's attorney, Peter Cooper, said after the appearance in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that his client is making a ""political statement,"" but argued the government is doing the same thing. ""Their allegation about danger, I believe, is unwarranted,"" Cooper said. Kokesh was originally arrested July 9 after a police search of his suburban Washington home in Herndon, Virginia, found a firearm and an illicit drug, an illegal combination in the state of Virginia. He posted bond on Thursday for that charge, but ""never saw the light of day"" as police picked him up soon afterward, Cooper said. Kokesh has a history of publicly airing his opinions. He was discharged from the Marines in 2007 for wearing his uniform during an anti-war protest. In his now infamous YouTube video, Kokesh states: ""We will not be silent. We will not obey. We will not allow our government to destroy our humanity."" Then, loading shells into the shotgun, he looks into a camera, saying, ""We are the final American revolution. See you next Independence Day."" CNN's Leslie Bentz and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","Kokesh faces charges related to video made in District of Columbia .

"(CNN) -- Just imagine. What if the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s spirit could appear and whisper his counsel to President Obama? The visit's timing could not be more opportune. Today, we face the country's worst economic crisis since the Depression, poverty continues to grow at home and abroad, and wars across the globe are leaving a wake of death and destruction for generations to come. Notwithstanding America's racial progress -- most viscerally witnessed by Obama himself -- King's dream remains far from realized. King spoke some of the most mellifluous speeches of his era. So does Obama. But King could advise Obama on transforming that uplifting rhetoric into a long-term grassroots effort. Beyond King's great speeches was a decades-long movement that was complex, sophisticated, forward-looking and greater than the man himself. When we forget King's coalition -- both in the breadth of change it demanded and in the thousands of faces and hearts dedicated to the cause -- we reduce the civil rights movement, from which we still have much to learn, into a warm and fuzzy version of the King mythology. King's spirit, no doubt, would advise Obama to press for the public option in the health care bill. ""Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane,"" King declared in 1966. The public option sharply reduces injustices in health care by offering millions of the beleaguered and the downtrodden a more transparent, accountable and affordable coverage option than the abusive, helter-skelter and often monopolistic practices rampant in the private market. Two years after King's remarks, the year he was assassinated, he launched his Poor People's Campaign, ""a multiracial army of the poor,"" that marched on Washington to demand an Economic Bill of Rights from Congress. King's Economic Bill of Rights called for effective government jobs programs to rebuild America's cities. He saw a crying need to confront a Congress that had demonstrated its ""hostility to the poor,"" appropriating ""military funds with alacrity and generosity"" but providing ""poverty funds with miserliness."" His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: a ""reconstruction of society itself"" to redress the deep-rooted problems of racism, poverty and military conflict. This is the moment to realize that vision. Americans are at a crucial juncture when we are fundamentally redefining our country's future at home and abroad. King would counsel Obama on how to minimize economic inequality, to boost the employment prospects of those living in marginalized communities, to increase citizens' savings, to encourage asset building and even to resolve peacefully our two wars. The enormity and uncertainty haunting this recession raises important questions that King's spirit could address. What is the impact on unemployed and low-income Americans? Will the fear of projected budget deficits force government spending choices that worsen poverty or that are racially loaded, in their stinginess toward cities? Like King, Obama recognizes that government isn't the principal solution to unemployment and poverty, but rather a buffer from hardship and a catalyst for opportunity. Here, the spirit and his pupil would evidently agree. But they could further discuss what role private business must play to help rectify this mess. The failures of Enron, Lehman Brothers, AIG and Merrill Lynch -- in addition to the Wall Street bailout -- illustrate the devastation that a culture of greed, corruption and governmental negligence can exact on ordinary Americans. What specific incentives and penalties can force the private sector to act more responsibly? Unchecked free market capitalism, King maintained, cannot guarantee the basic conditions necessary for ordinary people to earn a living, to acquire health care or to build wealth. Although private industry has a forceful influence on the underpinnings of American life, that power should not dictate our political and economic well-being. In other words, King to Obama: Society should lead capital, not vice versa. This week, America gets to pat itself on the back for living on the right side of history, racially speaking. Obama's presidency is a glorious manifestation of King's spirit.  We are not in a post-racial era, but Obama's cool judgment smoothly blunts the pessimism and ill will -- from those on the left and right -- who thrive on racial conflict. To his credit, our brilliant, cunning president truly understands that multiracial America needs more unflinching self-examination and less empty racial bickering. This week's special school lesson plans, newscasts and public ceremonies honoring the slain civil rights hero, and the 44th president's first anniversary in office, will be full of praise and rhetoric. But if only the ghost of King could glide into the Oval Office and urge Obama to take decisive, bold action, and to dodge the status quo behavior favored by power brokers in Washington and on Wall Street. If only the ghost of King could coax Obama to join the ranks of historically transformative leaders, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, who galvanized movements, who put pressure on themselves, Congress and the public to improve our politics and economy profoundly for decades to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rich Benjamin.","Rich Benjamin: King would urge President Obama to transform rhetoric into grassroots action .

"(CNN) -- One summer day back in 2008, fisherman Ali Omar went to see Daniela Bleattler, a Swiss photographer living in Lamu, the beautiful island off the Kenyan coast. Struggling to make a living, Omar asked Bleattler if she had a job for him. Bleattler didn't, but asked him instead whether he could help her find any ""tanga,"" the old sails from the traditional dhows that she loved. A couple of days later, the local fisherman returned with a magnificent brownish old sail, weathered by years of salt and storms from navigating the Indian Ocean waters. ""It had a big hole in the center created by the wind and the old age of the material,"" remembers Bleattler, who at the time had just come out of a relationship. ""I just laughed and said to him, 'if I do a big red heart around it, this will look just like my broken heart at the moment.'"" So Omar left again to return this time with tins of red and black paint he used for his dhow. Together, they started painting a big red heart around the hole; once done, Bleattler dipped the brush into the black paint and added the words ""Love Again Forever Whatever."" Read this: Fishing craft to foosball tables, furniture to float your boat . ""We looked at it and we just loved it so much,"" says Bleattler. ""I said I think we should frame it and put in the shop of a friend of mine."" Less than two hours later, an American couple walked into the art store and stood in front of the broken heart holding hands. ""They said 'that is beautiful, how much is it?'"" recalls Bleattler. ""I had no idea and I just kind of said a (very expensive) price but they said 'well, we want it"" -- it started exactly like this."" Ali Lamu . What started was Ali Lamu, a business launched by Omar and Bleattler producing anything from whimsical paintings and high-end handbags to beautiful bed covers and cushions. Six years after their first sale, they have sold several broken hearts -- as well as other designs -- to customers from all over the world. Everything is handmade, created from old fishing material and whatever washes up on the shores of Lamu. ""We are making more and more,"" says Bleattler. ""We are actually in the process of thinking wider and bigger."" Read this: Artist's spectacular glasses 'give trash a second chance' Ali Lamu, which is also the name some locals use for Omar, has 34 permanent staff and sometimes employs as many as 70 people. The business has a couple of workshops on the island but most of the craftsmanship is done in the artisans' homes. These are people who are usually Omar's family members, friends and other local fishermen. ""Ali's family is happy because of this business because they all have a job from this company."" says Juma Kilonzo, a friend and artisan. ""We are the friends so we are close now like brothers,"" he adds. ""So we also depend on this company."" ""Wake Up And Love"" The artisans also paint thoughtful and uplifting messages on many of their designs, promoting love, peace and care for the environment -- slogans like ""Wake Up And Love,"" ""The Only Way to Save The World Is With My Heart"" and ""Heart That Loves Never Gets Old."" ""I just close my eyes and see what the day brings,"" says Bleattler, describing where she draws inspiration for the messages adorning Ali Lamu's one-of-a-kind creations. ""Depending on the mood of the day,"" she continues, ""what is going on around the world and the people around me -- the fishermen, the people I'm working with are my big inspiration, so it's from them I find all these sayings."" The company sells its designs from a small boutique on Lamu, mostly to tourists. But one of the main challenges for the business has been a drop in the number of people visiting the stunning island recently. Lamu, which is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, is very close to Somalia and has previously been targeted in terror attacks. Watch this: Lamu deals with the tourism blues . ""We do survive because of exports, otherwise we wouldn't make it,"" says Bleattler. In hopes of attracting a bigger clientele, they've put themselves online so that people from all over the world can see their works and make custom orders. ""In 10 years I hope Ali Lamu can be all over the world,"" says Omar. ""So my company has a really good life.""","Ali Lamu turns old fishing material and recycled items into artwork and handicrafts .

"MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (CNN)  -- Discussions about proposals on the economy and health care were overshadowed by heated exchanges between rivals Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during Monday night's Democratic debate. Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama started arguing almost as soon as the debate began. The two Democratic front-runners took shots at each others' economic plans and criticized the accuracy of recent accusations the two campaigns have traded. Obama said Clinton's charge that fiscal responsibility isn't a priority for him ""isn't true."" ""This is one of the things that has happened in the course of this campaign. There are a set of assertions made by Sen. Clinton as well as her husband that are not factually accurate,"" Obama said, raising the criticisms the Clintons made about him in recent days. ""Part of what the people are looking for right now is somebody who is going to solve problems and not resort to the same typical politics that we've seen in Washington,"" he said. Clinton replied she was referring to differences in Obama's position toward the Iraq war. ""It was more about the distinction between words and action. And I think that is a fair assessment for voters to make,"" she said.  Watch Clinton, Obama trade jabs » . Clinton said it is ""sometimes difficult to understand what Sen. Obama has said because as soon as he is confronted on it he says that's not what he meant."" Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards jumped in, saying ""Are there three people in this debate, not two?"" ""This kind of squabbling -- how many children is this going to get health care? How many people are going to get education because of this? How many kids are going to get to go to college because of this?"" Edwards said to cheers from the crowd. ""I respect both of my fellow candidates, but we have got to understand this is not about us personally."" CNN I-Reporters, providing their reaction to the debate, responded negatively to the bickering tone between Clinton and Obama. ""I am proud that Sen. Edwards is taking the high road and making himself stand out from the bickering senators, Clinton and Obama. We don't need blame for our troubles, we need solutions,"" wrote David Parker of San Jose, California. ""The two leading candidates are getting closer to nothing -- they will lose the election to Republican Party if they keep talking in such a way,"" Duop Chak of Colorado Springs, Colorado, wrote on CNN.com's Political Ticker. The candidates are facing off in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, five days before the state's Democratic primary. The debate was put together by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.  See what the candidates said on the issues » . CNN political analyst Bill Schneider said this could be a debate ""where John Edwards gets back in the game."" ""He's effectively making his points, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are in silly squabbles. Voters have too many concerns to care about Obama and Clinton's political potshots,"" Schneider said.Edwards said ending poverty is ""the cause of my life.""  See what CNN's political team thought about the attacks » . ""Now, fiscal responsibility, which I think was the question. It was a little hard to tell there at the end of that. But I think the question was about fiscal responsibility,"" he said. ""I have proposed, I think, the most aggressive, most progressive agenda of the three of us up here,"" he said. On the issue of Iraq, Clinton was asked if she is looking to end the war or win it. ""I'm looking to bring our troops home, starting within 60 days of my becoming president,"" she said. ""There is no military solution, and our young men and women should not remain as the referees of their conflict."" Edwards said within his first year as president he would have all combat troops out of Iraq and there would be no permanent military bases in Iraq. ""I have not heard either of them say that definitively,"" he said. Obama responded saying, ""I want to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in, but I want to make sure that we get all of our combat troops out as quickly as we can safely.""  Watch Edwards, Obama debate Iraq » . CNN's Wolf Blitzer is moderating and CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Joe Johns are asking questions.  Watch the crew get ready for Monday's debate » . Clinton and Obama directed some of their responses at each other instead of the panel of moderators. ""It is very difficult having a standup debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote,"" Clinton said after attacking Obama for not supporting a Senate amendment that would have capped the interest rate on credit cards at 30 percent. ""It's just very difficult to get a straight answer."" The comment drew boos from Obama supporters. At one point, Clinton said that Obama had represented a ""slum landlord business"" in Chicago when he was practicing law, which brought some boos from the audience. When given an opportunity to respond, Obama explained the law firm he used to work for represented a church group that had partnered with an individual to do a project ""and I did about five hours worth of work on this joint project. That's what she's referring to."" Then he turned the explanation into a shot at Clinton. ""Now, it's fine for her to throw that out, but the larger reason that I think this debate is important is because we do have to trust our leaders and what they say,"" he said. ""...Truthfulness during campaigns makes a difference."" Edwards said it's being coming ""increasingly likely"" that the GOP presidential nominee will be Sen. John McCain of Arizona.  Watch what McCain says about Edwards » . ""Here's what we have to be thinking about. Who will be tough enough and strong enough and who can compete against John McCain in every place in America?"" Edwards said. ""I think I can go everywhere and compete head-to-head with McCain."" So far in the Democratic contests, Clinton, a senator from New York, has won New Hampshire, Nevada and Michigan. In Michigan, she was the only major candidate on the ballot. Obama, a senator from Illinois, won in Iowa. Edwards finished second in Iowa, but he has yet to win any states. Edwards would like to rebound in South Carolina, his native state. He won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for the White House. Each of the candidates is trying to gain the support of the state's African-Americans, who make up almost half of the Democratic primary voters. The majority of South Carolina black Democrats are leaning toward Obama, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Friday. The poll suggests nearly 60 percent of black registered Democrats were backing Obama as the presidential nominee, with 31 percent supporting Clinton. That's a major shift from October, when African-Americans backed Clinton over Obama, 57 percent to 33 percent. E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy, who is battling brain cancer, is urging Massachusetts officials to change a law to allow for an immediate temporary replacement should a vacancy occur for one of his state's two Senate seats. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, has championed universal health care for years. Under a 2004 Massachusetts law, a special election must be held 145 to 160 days after a Senate seat becomes vacant. The winner of that election would serve the remainder of a senator's unexpired term. Kennedy, a Democratic senator who has represented Massachusetts for nearly 47 years, was re-elected in November 2006. His six-year term ends in January 2013. In a letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and other state leaders, Kennedy said he supports the current law, ""[b]ut I also believe it is vital for this Commonwealth to have two voices speaking for the needs of its citizens and two votes in the Senate during the approximately five months between a vacancy and an election."" Kennedy, 77, asked the governor and state leaders to ""amend the law through the normal legislative process to provide for a temporary gubernatorial appointment until the special election occurs,"" according to the letter, dated July 2. Read the letter (PDF) The letter was not sent until Wednesday, however, in part because Kennedy has been dealing with the recent illness and death of his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver, according to a source close to the senator. Kennedy, who had been having conversations with top state Democrats about a potential succession, also was concerned that releasing the letter would disrupt Senate health care negotiations, another source close to the senator said. ""He's talking about his potential vacancy here, and the threat of Kennedy's vote on health care is a powerful incentive to get it done,"" the source said in reference to the senator's thinking over the past few weeks. ""If the letter gets out, it could have a negative impact."" The reason Kennedy sent the letter this week was because The Boston Globe learned about the discussions and was prepared to print what he thought was an inaccurate account of his efforts, both sources said. He therefore decided to make his desires clear by delivering the letter, knowing it would go public. One of the sources described how ""tough"" the letter was for Kennedy to write, acknowledging it is likely he soon will no longer be in the Senate. The senator's wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, has no interest in filling the seat, one of the sources said. Kennedy has held it since his first election in 1962. His brother, the late John F. Kennedy, had a Massachusetts Senate seat for almost eight years before being elected to the presidency in 1960. Democrats, in collaboration with independents Sens. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, control 60 votes in the Senate and face a tough battle this fall to overhaul health care. They have been trying to calculate votes without Kennedy, who has been unable to attend many sessions for months due to his illness. Kennedy has championed universal health care for years and wants to make sure Democrats have the votes they may need for passage of a comprehensive bill. He has called the issue ""the cause of his life."" At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, he said he wants legislation that will ""guarantee that every American ... will have decent, quality health care as a fundamental right."" In a statement, the governor, also a Democrat, said, ""It's typical of Ted Kennedy to be thinking ahead, and about the people of Massachusetts, when the rest of us are thinking about him."" Before 2004, state law allowed the governor to appoint an immediate replacement in the event of a U.S. Senate vacancy. The heavily Democratic Legislature changed the law, however, after Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts was expected to become the Democratic presidential nominee. Critics said the Legislature changed the statute to prevent then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, from picking a replacement for Kerry in the event he defeated President Bush later that fall. ""When this was an issue five years ago, Republicans pushed for an interim appointment, but it was overwhelmingly rejected,"" Massachusetts House GOP Leader Bradley Jones said in a statement Thursday. ""Out of political expediency and convenience, the Democrats are again considering showing a complete disregard of the democratic process and the laws of the Commonwealth by contemplating a change to the law to serve their partisan interests, as opposed to simply what is the best and most appropriate policy."" Kennedy is the second longest-serving member of the Senate, surpassed only by Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia. Calculations on Senate votes this fall also have included Byrd, who is 91. CNN's Dana Bash and Martina Stewart contributed to this report.","Massachusetts requires special election 145 to 160 days after Senate seat vacancy .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer has endured a 2013 which has seen him slip out of the world's top four for the first time in a decade. But the 17-time grand slam champion will have a chance to end his season on a high after qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals in London, a city where he has enjoyed a multitude of triumphs. The Swiss maestro has won a record equaling seven singles titles at Wimbledon, staged in the British capital, while he has also won the season-ending championships twice since it was moved to London's O2 Arena in 2009. A second round win over South Africa's Kevin Anderson at the Paris Masters ensured current world No. 7 Federer would line up at the showpiece World Tour Finals, which he has won on a record six occasions. On Thursday, Federer's fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka and Frenchman Richard Gasquet completed the eight-man field in London. ""[It's] the absolute pinnacle of our sport,"" Federer, who will equal Ivan Lendl's record of 12 consecutive Tour Finals appearances, told the ATP website before booking his place in London. ""You want to be able to showcase your talents against the best, with the biggest rivalries, in one of the coolest arenas in the world in front of amazing fans. ""For me it's always been an honor to play there and I look forward to returning this year."" The news of Federer's qualification will delight his British fans, who have grown accustomed to seeing him dominate the grass courts of the All England Club and the electric blue surface at the O2 Arena. ""As a six-time champion Roger stands alone as the most decorated player in the history of the ATP World Tour Finals,"" said tournament director Andre Silva. ""He is enormously popular here in London, where he has also won seven Wimbledon titles, and we're delighted to welcome him back to the O2."" World No. 1 Rafael Nadal heads the list of players set to feature in the competition, with six-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic also London bound. Reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray misses out after failing to recover from a back injury in time to play, but David Ferrer, Juan Martin del Potro and Tomas Berdych will take part. Wawrinka and Gasquet advanced when Milos Raonic lost to Tomas Berdych, ending the Canadian's slim hopes.

"(CNN) -- Pain, pain and more pain. Amy Williams is an expert in discomfort. Plagued by a chronic knee complaint, the 31-year-old has had numerous epidural injections to soothe three swollen vertebrae and she suffers almost constant sciatica. Not to mention the degenerative disc in her neck. These injuries are legacy of a death-defying decade in skeleton racing -- 10 years of hurling herself headfirst down an icy track in pursuit of golden glory has come at a cost. ""I'm pretty much broken between my back and my knees,"" says the Briton, who won gold at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games. ""I got to the point where I was so blinkered and obsessed by winning a medal that I put all of the physical pain to one side. ""After winning gold suddenly that pain that had been with me for years and years became too much. ""I thought, 'That's enough now.' "" Images: Olympic torch leaves Earth . Nearly four years after that career-defining success, and despite physical complaints which would halt even the most relentless athlete, Williams is back in search of a new adrenaline rush as she pushes against the pain barrier. Instead of being in a final buildup to February's Winter Olympics in Sochi, she's now in the passenger seat of a Mitsubishi rally car, preparing for a new white-knuckle ride. Williams will co-drive for veteran compatriot Tony Jardine at this weekend's final round of the World Rally Championships in Wales. ""I've enjoyed getting in the car and the thrill you get from it, it's definitely replaced something I've lost since retiring from skeleton,"" she told CNN. ""It's physically not the same demands on your body, so that suits me."" Rallying is a discipline in which competitors traverse public and private roads at breakneck speeds. While the driver is straining to keep the car on course, the co-driver navigates from point-to-point along a route littered with twists and turns. There are spectators in close proximity and the threat of a high-speed collision is never far away. ""I've surprised myself not being more nervous,"" confessed Williams. ""Certainly the skills I had in skeleton and being a world-class athlete has definitely transferred into the rallying."" Jardine is a rally veteran who has enjoyed a career as a respected motorsport broadcaster and television pundit. It was TV which prompted him to contact Williams when the 61-year-old saw her co-driving during an appearance on a British comedy show. Not that her new role is one to be taken lightly. The co-driver, as well as being an unofficial team manager and timekeeper, is responsible for memorizing the route and relaying exact instructions. The driver must trust his partner implicitly. ""I've been thrown in at the deep end,"" continued Williams, who only obtained her license to compete this weekend after completing a series of minor rallies across the UK. ""It's quite a mind-boggling amount of information I'm being given each rally. So it's been really tough, a lot tougher than I thought, physical and mentally. ""I've been very lucky that I've not been anxious or worried or put off by the speed of the car, whereas I guess most people would be. ""Tony has put a lot into me and you feel a pressure to perform. We've given ourselves a big challenge to complete in Wales."" Compared to other divisions of motorsport such as Formula One and MotoGP, rallying can appear lacking in glamor. Think muddy puddles rather than perfectly preened pit girls. And while the likes of F1 champion Sebastian Vettel and MotoGP prodigy Marc Marquez bask in the limelight, rallying's stars rarely occupy back-page column inches. This disparity irks Williams, especially when WRC boasts a champion as dominant as Sebastian Loeb -- the French master who has won the title in each of the last nine years. ""Rallying is not a sport you see on the back pages all of the time but they're such skilled drivers,"" she said. ""The teamwork between the co-driver and the driver is incredible. I really admire that and I think it's a shame it's not out there as something everyone knows of."" Skeleton is another sport which rarely commands media attention, but, between 2002 and 2010, it demanded Williams' complete concentration. And eight years after first attempting the event at a push-start facility in Bath, England, Williams was stood at the top of the podium. Not that her journey was all smooth sliding. Williams missed out on a spot at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin to compatriot Shelley Rudman, who went on to clinch a silver medal. Four years of fierce dedication followed and the result was a gold medal for which her body is still paying the price. While she is pleased to be heading to Russia's first Winter Games as a broadcaster, Williams fully expects to feel pangs of regret once the Olympic cauldron is officially lit. ""Emotionally I might find going to Sochi very tough,"" she said. ""There is still a big part of me that would love to compete. I still feel that I could definitely get another Olympic medal, but I had to listen to what my body was telling me. ""I listened to the sports doctors and they were telling me to retire years ago. So that's why I've stopped."" So for now, rallying has sated Williams' competitive appetite. In the future, however, she might have to take to the high seas to quench her thirst for adventure. ""I've agreed to try to break the record for going around the world in a RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat),"" said Williams. RIBs are most commonly used a rescue vessels and military boats. ""We've got a lot of money to raise by the end of this year. If we get the correct amount of money, we'll be setting sail in spring 2015."" After conquering ice and land, mastering the world's oceans would complete an impressive hat-trick for Williams.","Amy Williams has swapped skeleton racing for rally driving .

"(CNN) -- Oscar wants to take you back in time. The nominees for the 84th annual Academy Awards were announced Tuesday morning, and if there's a theme, it's how many nominations hearken back to previous eras in film history. Among the best picture nominees alone, there's a silent film (""The Artist""), an Old Hollywood throwback (""War Horse""), a film that pays tribute to film's early days (""Hugo"") and even that most distinctive of comedy types, a Woody Allen film (""Midnight in Paris""). If either ""Hugo"" or ""The Artist"" -- two films-about-films -- wins, it would be a groundbreaker, says longtime Oscar watcher Tom O'Neil of GoldDerby.com. ""No film about Hollywood has ever won best picture,"" he says, observing that classics such as ""A Star is Born"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" couldn't pull off the trick. (""Sunset Boulevard,"" in fact, lost to a film about Broadway -- ""All About Eve."") ""Hugo,"" the story of a young boy and his adventures among clocks, trains and interesting people, led all nominees with 11 nods. ""The Artist,"" a silent film that borrows a plot from ""A Star is Born"" and images from a host of movie classics, was second with 10. Complete list of Oscar nominees . The sheer number of nominations makes the pair front-runners for best picture: In the last 20 years, the film with the most nominations has won 15 times, observes O'Neil. But neither has created much heat with audiences -- or the Academy, says Los Angeles Times Awards Tracker reporter Nicole Sperling. ""Everyone's been waiting for the one film to really catch them and they can all get behind, and that never seemed to happen,"" she says. ""You see that reflected in the nominations. It feels diluted in a sense. Even though 'The Artist' and 'Hugo' are leading the pack, I don't think anyone would call 'Hugo' a front-runner."" Old hands and snubs . The Academy also paid tribute to its own past. Some of the names behind the best picture nominees -- Allen, ""Hugo's"" Martin Scorsese, ""War Horse's"" Steven Spielberg, ""The Tree of Life's"" Terrence Malick -- evoke the 1970s, when Hollywood was energized by the arrival of a new breed of filmmaker, one raised on genre classics and foreign films. Except for Malick, who's been nominated only twice before, the rest have become Academy veterans. Other nominees are also old hands at the game. George Clooney added a couple more nominations -- one for acting (""The Descendants"") and one for writing (""The Ides of March"") -- to his haul. Meryl Streep (""The Iron Lady"") and Allen are well into double digits for Oscar nominations. On the other hand, one of the most renowned filmmakers of recent years -- the music-video-and-TV-commercial bred David Fincher -- was overlooked for both best picture (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") and best director. Indeed, Oscar didn't smile on everyone. Albert Brooks -- another 1970s-era name -- was widely touted for a supporting actor pick for his performance as a brutal mobster in ""Drive,"" but came up empty, no doubt providing more material for his neurotic comedy. Michael Fassbender, who gave two of the best-reviewed performances of the year in ""Shame"" and ""A Dangerous Method,"" was also overlooked, as was Ryan Gosling (""Drive,"" ""The Ides of March""). Steve Kloves, who has adapted all but one of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels for the screen -- and been widely hailed for capturing the books' detail and humor -- didn't get a nomination, either. To date, Kloves' only nomination has been for his adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel ""Wonder Boys."" And perhaps most shockingly, Pixar was shut out of best animated feature for ""Cars 2"" -- the first time the famed animation studio has been snubbed in the category. ""That sends a powerful message that they need to up their creativity in their movies,"" says O'Neil. ""They're rubber-stamping their past successes with things like 'Cars 2,' and they're being punished at the Oscars today."" Audiences felt the same way: Of Pixar's 12 features, ""Cars 2"" is 11th in total box office, and dead last if the take is adjusted for inflation. In recent years the Academy hasn't cared about box office as much, anyway. ""The Hurt Locker,"" which won best picture two years ago, topped out at $17 million domestically. Of this year's best picture nominees, only ""The Help"" was a blockbuster, topping $100 million; ""The Artist,"" despite its reviews and honors, has yet to make $15 million domestically. The wide net indicates the power of the ""screener,"" says O'Neil. Once upon a time Academy members had to catch all the movies in theaters. Now they receive DVDs -- or screeners -- at their homes and can see a broader range of possibilities. ""There's a very noticeable trend,"" says O'Neil. ""Lately they've been paying attention to these screeners, and the box office doesn't matter. They're trying to send another statement."" Such nominees as Demian Bishir, who picked up a best actor nomination for ""A Better Life,"" probably owe their slots to these marketing efforts. The Oscar glow . Which is one reason the Oscars still matter. Audiences at home might ask, ""Who is Demian Bichir?"" But to agents, casting directors and promotion execs, the words ""Oscar nominee"" can make a difference. There's a reason you now see Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") and Christoph Waltz (""Inglorious Basterds"") in bigger roles. This year, the talents to watch include Rooney Mara (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo""), Octavia Spencer (""The Help"") and the two stars of ""The Artist,"" Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. And Melissa McCarthy, who nabbed a best supporting actress nomination for ""Bridesmaids,"" has certainly gotten a career boost. The actress already has an Emmy for ""Mike and Molly."" The Oscar nomination was a ""pleasant surprise,"" says Sperling. Still, the major nominees' low box office could hurt the ratings for the Academy Awards broadcast, scheduled for February 26. Traditionally, audiences like to have a rooting interest, and it's hard to root for films that most people haven't seen. In the last five years, the Academy Awards' best rating came in 2010, when box office champ ""Avatar"" was up for best picture. (Host Billy Crystal, always a popular figure, could help.) Will the nominations boost the box office? If ""Hugo"" and ""The Artist"" can't build on their grosses now, they probably never will, says Sperling. Her Times TV critic colleague, Mary McNamara, finds Oscar bait wanting. ""Film is suffering from 'who cares syndrome,' "" she said last week. "" 'The Artist' -- the seven people who saw it liked it. Yet the Academy rejects 'Harry Potter.' That should win best picture, I think."" Unless the Boy Who Lived can pull the ultimate wizard's trick, that's not going to happen.","Oscar nominations reference old films, old names .

"(CNN) -- If ever there was a David versus Goliath clash in international football this was it. Spain, the reigning world and European champions taking on Tahiti, ranked 138th by the game's governing body FIFA, one place below Syria. Almost all of Tahiti's squad are amateur players -- nine are unemployed -- and their coach Eddy Etaeta even admitted before the tournament began: ""We are not here to win."" After a heavy defeat in their opening Confederations Cup game against Nigeria, Etaeta declared their dream had come true -- solely because they found the net in a 6-1 reverse. There was to be no goal this time round as they were put to the sword by Spain who completed a 10-0 victory to all-but secure a semifinal berth. That represented the biggest in the history of the competition that pits the champions of each FIFA confederation against each other and acts as a precursor to next year's World Cup in Brazil. But Tahiti's squad were afforded a standing ovation from the 71,000 crowd, who backed them throughout the match. Before the game there was a heavy police presence outside the ground in Rio in response to the ongoing protests in Brazil. ""Tahiti set an example in terms of fair play and went forward whenever they had the opportunity,"" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said. ""We didn't score more goals because they didn't let us. This game hasn't damaged football in any way. In some ways it's made it even stronger."" After handing over pendants to their opponents prior to kickoff, Tahiti maintained parity for less than five minutes as Chelsea striker Fernando Torres beat goalkeeper Mikael Roche at his near post to put the ""La Roja"" ahead. Any Tahiti foray into Spain's half was roared by the crowd but Del Bosque's side soon fired two goals in the space of two minutes as David Silva and Torres found the net. David Villa grabbed a goal either side of the break before Torres sealed his hat-trick just before the hour mark -- making him the first player to do it twice in the tournament following his three against New Zealand in 2009. Villa's treble followed soon after, and Juan Mata then got number eight. Torres missed the chance to claim his fourth, sending a penalty over the crossbar after Ricky Aitamai was adjudged to have handled the ball. But he made amends a minute later as he rounded Roche to slot into an empty net. Silva then got his second, firing home from inside the area. The crowd were willing Tahiti forward but the closest they came to scoring was when Lorenzo Tehau narrowly failed to latch onto Marama Vahirua's pass, but the offside flag had gone up. Upon the final whistle, Tahiti gave Spain a guard of honor as the world champions left the pitch before the minnows took the applause of the crowd. However, the battle for semifinal places will go to the last round of Group B matches, following Uruguay's 2-1 victory over Uruguay in Thursday's late match. Veteran striker Diego Forlan celebrated his landmark 100th international appearance -- becoming the first Uruguayan to do so -- by scoring the winner six minutes after halftime. The 34-year-old finished off a fine move involving strike partners Edison Cavani and Luis Suarez, ending his run of 12 games without a goal for the South American champions. It was his 34th goal for his country, putting him ahead of Suarez in the all-time list. Captain Diego Lugano gave Uruguay the lead in the 19th minute but Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel equalized eight minutes before the break. If Uruguay beat Tahiti on Sunday, then Nigeria's Super Eagles would have to inflict Spain's first defeat of the tournament in order to qualify.","World champions Spain beat Tahiti 10-0 in their Confederations Cup game in Rio .

"(CNN) -- It's a royal first. Britain's Zara Phillips, Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter, will become the first member of the royal family to appear in a video game. An electronic version of the 32-year-old royal will be featured in an online game for horse lovers, 'Howrse,' in which the Olympic equestrian will mentor and guide players in the UK. Some of her own horses, including her Olympic mount High Kingdom, will be included in the game for players to ""own"" themselves, game maker Ubisoft said in a statement. The horse breeding game, which has 50 million players worldwide, allows players to raise horses and ponies, take care of them, train them and enhance their skills and abilities. Players can also set up their own stables. Philips, who won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics, will guide players through the opening phases of the game and help them complete tutorials through interactive prompts and feedback. ""It's great to be involved with a game that lets children and adults alike interact with horses, horse breeding and stable management on a daily basis, meeting like-minded enthusiasts through the game's social features and sharing experiences,"" Phillips said in a statement. ""Not everyone has access to ride or care for horses regularly and Howrse provides a great opportunity to really understand more about how horses are raised and bred in an easy-to-access and fun way.""

"(CNN) -- The FBI will examine evidence and testimony from the trial of two California police officers acquitted this week in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man to see whether his civil rights were violated, the agency said Tuesday. The FBI began its civil right investigation shortly after Kelly Thomas, 27, died after a police beating in Fullerton, California, in July 2011. The violent confrontation drew national attention because a surveillance camera showed a wailing Thomas being beaten, clubbed and stunned with a police Taser. He died five days later. ""In 2011, the FBI opened an investigation to determine if Mr. Thomas' civil rights were violated during the altercation with Fullerton police officers,"" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a prepared statement. ""With the conclusion of the state court trial, investigators will examine the evidence and testimony to determine if further investigation is warranted at the federal level."" On Monday, a jury in Santa Ana, California, acquitted former officer Manuel Ramos of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter and former officer Jay Cicinelli of involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force. The victim's father, Ron Thomas has filed a wrongful death suit against the city and the six police officers involved in the fatal incident. After the verdict, he said the jury's decision was ""carte blanche for police officers everywhere to beat us, kill us, whatever they want."" In a CNN interview Tuesday, Thomas called his son's suffering ""unfathomable"" and said he was outraged that the officers will ""get away with it completely."" ""In a matter of minutes, he was dying in a pool of his own blood, and yet they're not guilty of even excessive force? That's unbelievable, unacceptable,"" Thomas said. But John Barnett, the attorney for Ramos, said the officers ""had no malice in their heart"" and the video was ""not the entire case."" ""They did as they were told. They did as they were taught,"" he said. ""When we send these guys out into the night not knowing if they're going to go home, we send them with instructions. When they follow those instructions and they do go home, they're not guilty of murder."" Thomas called that ""garbage."" ""They should have been responsible for their own actions as police officers,"" he said. In closing arguments at the trial, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told jurors that Ramos bore responsibility for Thomas' death because he threatened the uncooperative homeless man. Ramos can be seen on the surveillance video putting on gloves and shaking his fist in Thomas' face. Thomas, a lifelong resident of Fullerton, was shirtless, carrying a backpack and wearing long pants and slippers when Fullerton police were called to investigate a ""homeless"" man looking into car windows and pulling door handles of parked cars at the city's bus depot on July 5, 2011, according to the father's lawsuit. A security camera at the downtown bus depot provided 16 minutes of video of the officers questioning and then beating Thomas, who was schizophrenic. Thomas' mother, Cathy, who's divorced from Thomas' father, received $1 million in 2012 from the city of Fullerton's insurance reserves in an agreement to settle her claim against the city in her son's death, city officials said. Cathy Thomas released the city and its police officers from all potential claims, officials said. Ron Thomas said that since his son's death, police must have special training to work with the mentally ill -- a move he said could ""correct all these things that could allow this to happen to Kelly.""

"(CNN) -- Cuban authorities detained dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez along with two others as she traveled to cover the trial of a Spanish politician accused of killing a prominent dissident, a human rights activist told CNN on Friday. A family member of the well-known blogger said that Sanchez, her husband, Reinaldo Escobar, and another blogger, Agustin Diaz, were arrested in the eastern Cuban city of Bayamo on Thursday, activist and dissident Elizardo Sanchez told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Yoani Sanchez and her two companions were destined for Bayamo, where the trial of Spanish politician Angel Carromero was scheduled to begin Friday. She was covering the trial for Spain's leading newspaper, El Pais, which also reported on its website that she had been detained. Spanish politician charged in dissident's death . But Sanchez never arrived at her destination, and her cell phone was disconnected, Elizardo Sanchez said. CNN has not independently confirmed the arrests. Cuban officials declined to comment on reports of her arrest. A pro-government blogger known as Yohandry Fontana, who is considered a counterbalance to Yoani Sanchez, said that Sanchez intended to put on a ""media show"" in Bayamo and disrupt Carromero's trial. The U.S. State Department called the arrest the ""latest crackdown"" on journalists. ""We are deeply disturbed by the Cuban government's repeated use of arbitrary detention to silence critics, disrupt peaceful assembly, and impede independent journalism,"" State Department spokesman William Ostick said. Carromero is facing a vehicular homicide charge for a car crash that killed prominent Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya. He could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. He is accused of speeding and then losing control of a car that he, Paya, Swedish politician Jans Aron Modig and Cuban dissident Harold Cepero were traveling in. Paya and Cepero were killed when the car struck a tree near Las Gavinas, Cuba, in July. After Paya's death, his family immediately accused Cuban authorities of foul play and said they had received information that another vehicle had forced the car Paya was in off the road. The Cuban government has denied any involvement in Paya's death. El Pais said that it had lost contact with Yoani Sanchez and that a Cuban photographer, Orlando Luis Pardo, said he had spoken with her son, who had received a call from her confirming her detention. Sanchez gained international attention for her blog ""Generation Y,"" which gets about 1 million hits a month. Freedom of speech is limited on the communist island nation, whose media is controlled by the government. ""The arrest of these journalists clearly indicates that the Cuban government continues its practice of punishing independent reporting,"" said Carlos Lauria, senior Americas program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""Cuban authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Sanchez, Escobar and DÃ­az and allow all Cuban reporters to report without fear of intimidation."" In 2008, Time magazine named Sanchez one of the world's 100 most influential people. CNN's Carlos Montero contributed to this report.","NEW: The United States is ""deeply disturbed"" by reports of the arrest .

"(CNN) -- So, you're leaving your job. Maybe you're finally going to start that Kafka-themed coffee shop/art space/bowling alley you keep talking about. Or maybe this is the year your indie Latin jazz rock band will finally make it big. Perhaps you freaked out on some hapless JetBlue airline passenger and are gonna be grounded for a bit. Or maybe -- drag, dude -- the employment gods decided that you (along with 131,000 workers in July alone) are gonna have a liiitle extra free time to enjoy the end of summer. Either way, when it comes time to kiss your cubicle goodbye, you can scamper away, firmly ensconced in your Own Little World like a gerbil in a clear plastic ball, or you can tie up digital loose ends and depart with dignity. We recommend the latter. First things first: You need to tell the world--and especially your officemates--that you're leaving. It's tempting to walk out of that awkward meeting with your boss, the sight of her crumpled frustration and disappointment at losing one of her best employees (right) still fresh in your mind, and tap out the tweet or Facebook status update you've been dreaming about for years: ""F*** YEAH, I'M OUTTA THAT HELLHOLE!"" A classier step: Tell the important people (the ones who'd want to hear it from the horse's mouth) in person or via personalized calls or e-mails, then compose a Facebook status asking your friends and colleagues to celebrate with you at a local watering hole. Post it on your wall and let the congrats roll in. A mass e-mail to relatives and networking contacts is fine, too -- just keep it brief, say nothing but classy things about your former employer, and be prepared to write a battery of ""Thanks, yeah, I'm excited!"" responses when your e-mail hits peeps' inboxes. (If your exit was less, er, voluntary, the same principles apply: ""celebratory"" drinks become ""commiseration"" cocktails, and the mass e-mail becomes more of a polite plea for networking leads.) After you've gotten woefully drunk with friends and colleagues, it comes time to bid your co-workers adieu. Yeah, you have 4 million things to think about after you give (or are given) your two weeks' notice (like how to steal as many office supplies as possible before the final punch-out). But saying your goodbyes, handing out your contact information and digitally setting up a few easy streams of continued connection mean you won't turn into that ""Hey, whatever happened to that guy?"" guy. So do not go gentle into that good night. You already know to write your boss a handwritten card (even though up to 40 percent of men want to punch their bosses in the face, according to a lovely new survey from Mint.com and AskMen.com), right? But how to handle the rest of the herd? Definitely walk around and shake hands with everyone you can on your last day. (You may wish to avoid interrupting everyone's menial-labor stupor to let them know you're heading out, but do it anyway. The murmurs of ""That bee-yotch didn't even say goodbye"" are ultimately much more damaging). In addition, in most offices it's cool to send a mass e-mail (to the entire staff, if you worked with everyone, or at least to everyone who knows who you are) as your very last missive from your soon-to-be-defunct work e-mail address. Thank them all for being wonderful and encourage them to keep in touch. Finishing on a warm note makes it that much more likely that they'll think of you when a new position's open and you're miserably toiling away at your new job -- you know, instead of just recalling the time you came to work early to print out the 200-page application for ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" and broke the printer. Also in said e-mail, provide your personal e-mail address and phone number as a separate vCard, (no, not that kinda V-card, interneteur -- electronic business cards.) Instructions vary by e-mail client, but usually involve making a new contact for yourself and forwarding that out from your address book. Then recipients can just open up your e-business card to permanently have all your info. You can also exchange info via apps like Bump, which allows you to trade contacts, pictures, etc and connect via social networks by tapping your phones together. And now that PayPal has integrated Bump, you can finally get all that poker money back from Joe in finance. Lastly, don't let your onetime colleagues forget you. We're not suggesting an epic, last-day, one-man show involving blowhorns and a mariachi band. Or an email to the entire office gleefully revealing how your FarmVille-playing boss wiled away his days -- as in the viral hit from earlier this week which, sadly,turned out to be a hoax. (Although that would be a pretty epic note on which to leave). Rather, our point is: Most people don't burn bridges, but they do let them rot. So keep the bridge strong (to continue the hoary cliché) by sending occasional check-in e-mails and, if appropriate, following colleagues on Twitter in the hope they'll follow you back. That way they pretty much can't forget you, as your smart retweets and interesting links will flick you into their consciousness a few times a day. Just don't drunk-tweet about how your five-month dry spell is making you wonder why you went back on the pill in the first place. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- You may think Santa's grotto is hidden in a snow-covered Arctic cabin, but those in the know say its real location is Hong Kong's cavernous harbor-front convention center. Each January for the past 40 years, the world's toy makers have converged on the city for the international toy fair -- the world's second largest. Eyes peeled for next Christmas's must-have toy, buyers scour some 2,000 stalls that tout everything from classical wooden blocks to high-tech remote control gadgets. ""It's like Santa's paradise, there's absolutely everything that you can dream of here,"" said one Russian buyer who identified himself as Sergey. The fair, which finished on Thursday, featured everything from virtual pet rabbits to an area that showed how toys have therapeutic benefits for both children and the elderly. Hong Kong's toy industry, which has struggled in recent years, may be slowly returning to its glory days, according to the fair's organizer. Although the factory floors that were once dotted across the city are now in mainland China, Hong Kong still maintains its status as a hub for the toy industry. ""Hong Kong is the world's toy town,"" said C.K. Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) Toys Advisory Committee. ""The designs, engineering, support services and also sales and marketing platforms, these are all in Hong Kong, so buyers are coming here to shop."" Alex Wong, sales manager of Wange Industrial Co based in China, which sells toy blocks, says the city is the ideal place to showcase his wares to the international market. ""Hong Kong is a financial center, we can introduce our products there,"" he said. Safety concerns . China's reputation as a toy manufacturer took a hit in the last decade over safety concerns. In the largest scandal in 2007, millions of Chinese-made toys were recalled due to lead contamination. But Yeung said that standards were improving and were now equivalent to those found in the United States or Europe. Among the new standards is a ban introduced last year on six kinds of phthalates -- substances that can be absorbed through the skin and are believed to cause hormone malfunctions and deformations. The move was widely praised by numerous activist groups such as Greenpeace. Remi Leclerc, a professor who teaches toy design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, says while the city remains an industry hub, Hong Kong has struggled to develop its own toy brands, instead specializing in manufacturing for big, multinational players. ""Hong Kong is trying to move away from that model, the revenue is developing a brand and being able to strategically manage it,"" he said. ""Breaking that glass ceiling has been difficult here."" Leclerc also said Hong Kong must think carefully how it can stay ahead of mainland China, which has been making strides in both quality and marketing. ""Hong Kong at this point has no competitors in terms of training and developing that know-how, not only on that production level but also in the future in terms of value creation,"" he said.","Hong Kong hosted the second largest toy fair in the world this week .

"(CNN) -- Two dogs set on fire in the past two weeks make for three canines burned and left to die in the Philadelphia area since June, according to animal welfare groups. The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal reported a male pit bull puppy was brought to the city's animal care center Thursday after the dog was discovered in the city's West Oak Lane section. According to the PSPCA, the dog suffered extreme burns on his legs and back and possible smoke inhalation. After undergoing emergency surgery, the approximately 4-month-old puppy -- nicknamed Hercules by the staff -- is expected to survive, but the PSPCA said he was still in serious condition late Thursday. On June 25, a female pit bull named Chloe was found in the city after she had been set on fire. She had burns all over her body, and later died of her injuries, the PSPCA said. ""This is an extremely troubling trend,"" said Marc Peralta, chief operating officer of the Pennsylvania SPCA. ""This is a sick and deplorable act, and something that won't be tolerated. Our humane law enforcement team will be investigating and will prosecute the person(s) responsible to the full extent of the law."" In the city of Coatesville, about 40 miles outside of Philadelphia, firefighters responded to a trash fire early in the morning on June 9. When they arrived, they discovered that the fire had engulfed a a 4-1/2 year old ""Yorkie-Poo"" mixed breed dog according to the Chester County SPCA. Investigators say the dog was asphyxiated and died before being set on fire. There is no direct evidence linking the three cases of animal cruelty, but authorities continue to investigate. The PSPCA will hold a rally against animal abuse on July 12, and has established a $1,000 reward for information about Chloe's case.

"(EW.com) -- ""Sleepy Hollow"" wrapped up its freshman season Monday night with a finale packed full of major twists and a whopper of a cliffhanger that left pretty much every major character in a terrible, life-threatening position. (Head thee to EW's ""Sleepy Hollow"" recap for all the details.) With Ichabod (Tom Mison) buried six feet under (while still alive), Abbie (Nicole Beharie) trapped in Purgatory, and Katrina (Katia Winter) kidnapped by the headless horseman, executive producer Mark Goffman had a lot to answer for when we called him up after viewing the heart-stopping episode. Luckily Goffman, who penned the extraordinary second hour with fellow EP Alex Kurtzman, was more than happy to break it all down for us — and give us some early scoop on season 2! Read on for his take on all the twists. Entertainment Weekly: I have to start with the Henry Parrish/Jeremy twist. How long was this the plan and how long did John [Noble] know this was the plan? Mark Goffman: We knew from the beginning. We had told John Noble about it, and I actually gave him the bible for the season when we first brought him on. So it's been something he's been sort of building into his performance from episode 5. And we really thought it was important to establish the Sin Eater as a character before we even heard of Crane's son. And then to try to put to bed the idea of his son in a couple of episodes later in the back half of the season. So it's kind of brought up, then dismissed and we move on with the story and the mythology. Hopefully we buried the ball pretty well in terms of the reveal. 'Sleepy Hollow': Tom Mison, Orlando Jones reveal first celeb crushes . EW: You did! How long did Tom and the rest of the cast know? Goffman: You know, at the very beginning of the season, we told Tom he had a son who we were going to play as somebody — before we had been looking to cast John Noble — who was older than him because we thought that would be a really interesting way to play it. And we knew this reveal, really, at the beginning of the season. It was part of our initial pitch to [network president] Kevin Reilly. So we shared as much of the details as we had with the cast. And there are some actors who don't like to know where you're going; they just want to play it in the moment. Others like feeling where the season is going. So, Tom and Nicole ,we brought them into the writers room, and they've been incredibly generous with sharing the things they love about the show and their characters with us. And that helps us. EW: One of the biggest moments of the episode was learning that the prophecy was, indeed, going to come true, with Abbie sort of being hand-delivered to Moloch. Was there ever a moment where you considered having Ichabod stay in Purgatory so that the prophecy wouldn't have to come true? I understand that it sort of had to unravel the way it did in order to have all the pieces together for that final moment. But was that ever discussed in the writer's room? Goffman: I feel like we had shown Ichabod a few times over the course of the season in Purgatory, and it seemed like just a much more exciting way to leave, if we were back in our world and that's where Crane was in jeopardy, at the end of the season cliffhanger. So it just felt like a much more exciting way to go. And also, having each of them isolated felt like a much stronger cliffhanger. EW: Yeah, I honestly don't know how you're going to get yourself out of this. How far are you into planning a way out of this huge pickle? Goffman: We definitely have ideas. Part of the fun of this show is taking these really big swings. So we'll have to take some more to get them out. EW: Is there going to be a time jump when we come back for the next season? Or do we pick up right in the moment of this chaos? 'Sleepy Hollow' stars talk Ichabod's skinny jeans encounter . Goffman: I don't want to say yet. But the great thing about the way this show is crafted is that we don't have to start in real time. We can begin in dream sequences, we can begin with a flashback to parts of the past and tell some of these stories. But I think it's pretty important to me that we get them both out pretty quickly. We know that Crane is in the coffin, so the clock is ticking quickly. He's in a lot of jeopardy so we have to face that very quickly and not take too long before addressing it. EW: Since we're talking about next season, what's the theme? And how are you going to play with this War reveal? Goffman: Well, the idea of war, when you read it in the Bible, it's not only bombs and troops. War is really man against man and turning against himself. So, really, what we're going to be looking at in season 2 is how does having the horseman of War here in the Sleepy Hollow influence our town. EW: Are y'all looking to introduce any new characters next season? Goffman: We actually do plan to introduce some new characters. One of the big goals, which goes along with the idea of war in Sleepy Hollow, is that we need to populate the town more. So we expect to build out and get to know more of the town of Sleepy Hollow and that will definitely mean bringing in some more characters. And some of them, I think, will be supernatural. EW: Let's talk about Capt. Irving. We all love Orlando [Jones]. Can you talk to me about what's coming up for his character? Goffman: He's innocent of the charges he confessed to, so I think we're going to have to play out how he is able to get himself out of this situation because he's confessed to two murders that he didn't do. And he has very special knowledge that only a small handful of people do about what's happening in Sleepy Hollow. He's very critical to our group, but he's trapped in this situation with his family. But I think he's very clever and he's going to figure a way out. I hope. [Laughs] . How 'Sleepy Hollow' dreamed up Ichabod's talk with the OnStar lady . EW: You all had promised some deaths. Is it safe to say we've seen the last of John Cho? Goffman: Well, dead is not always gone on Sleepy Hollow. He's so beloved and such a fantastic character. I really hope that he's able to return. I think there's still more to tell both in the past about his story with Abbie and I think there's still some more that he can do as a character looking for reception but stuck because he sold his soul. I think there's still some really fun stuff we can do with him. EW: Does Jenny count as a death? I didn't see X's on her eyes or anything. Goffman: We'll have to find out. I certainly hope not. I've loved the relationship that she and Abbie have developed over the season, and I think they still have some reconciliation. She's also a critical part of the show. I'm curious to find out what happens with her as well. EW: Last, I have to point this out — but poor Ichabod went through a lot of trouble to get new clothes from those re-enactment people and he ended up getting buried in his brand new clothes. Goffman: [Laughs] That's true. Maybe he should have stayed in the old one. EW: He should have worn the old one for traveling to Purgatory, of course! But are you going to have more fun with his clothes next season? Goffman: I think the re-enactment he went to, we didn't get to show it, but he actually bought a lot of clothes. They're all still from the 18th century — or at least costumes from the 18th century. But he'll have a larger wardrobe to choose from next season, and now he knows where to shop.

"(CNN) -- How do you get a teenager to volunteer to quit Facebook? Apparently, with cold, hard cash. A Boston father is paying his 14-year-old daughter $200 to quit using the social site for almost five months, according to a post on his blog.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies are investigating not only what went wrong, but also what went right Thursday when a US Airways flight ended in the Hudson River without any deaths or major injuries. The aircraft remains in the Hudson River on Friday. Workers hope to lift it out Saturday morning. ""Having a successful ditching is a very rare event,"" Kitty Higgins of the NTSB said Friday. ""We'll not only celebrate what worked here, but also learn what worked. So many times you're only focused on what went wrong. A lot of things went right yesterday."" Divers struggled against strong currents and frigid water temperatures to retrieve critical pieces of the puzzle from the Hudson River, where US Airways flight 1549 ended up less than three minutes after it took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport Thursday afternoon. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- both critical to determining exactly what happened -- remained attached to the tail section of the aircraft, which was still partially submerged but secured to moorings.  Watch a former pilot tell how to water-land a plane » . Workers will be at the site until midnight, rigging the aircraft so it can be lifted out Saturday morning, attached to a barge and moved to a secure location for investigation, Higgins said. Both engines from the Airbus A320 double-engine jet were on the river bottom, after the water landing's impact apparently detached them from the plane. Authorities are using side-scan sonar to locate the engines, Higgins said. iReport.com: Were you there? Send images . The engines also will be brought in as part of the investigation into what happened, including the possibility of bird strikes. ""I don't want to characterize anything at this point about this particular accident because we are just at the beginning stages,"" Higgins said, adding that this accident would be the first ""in a very long time"" where possible bird strikes may have been a factor.

""Sully"" Sullenberger and his crew, as well as first responders who acted quickly to minimize passengers' injuries in below-freezing temperatures and frigid water. The White House said President Bush called Sullenberger to praise him for ""his heroic efforts to ensure the safety of his passengers and the people in the area."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sullenberger executed an ""incredibly skillful emergency landing."" The pilot and crew of the flight will receive the key to the city, he told reporters Friday. ""We typically like you to land at our airports,"" he joked, but said the water landing worked out with the best possible outcome.  Watch Bloomberg honor heroism » . ""We saw a lot of heroism in the Hudson yesterday,"" Bloomberg said. The mayor also gave certificates of appreciation to first responders who scrambled to help passengers to safety. Shortly after the flight, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, took off at 3:26 p.m. Thursday, passengers noticed quickly that something was awry.  See a map of the plane's flight path » . A source familiar with the situation told CNN that Sullenberger reported a double bird strike, which was taken to mean that birds were sucked into both the jet's engines. The FAA said witnesses reported seeing the plane hit a flock of birds. Sullenberger was given clearance to return to LaGuardia for an emergency landing, a source said, but instead, he was forced to find someplace else to ditch the plane.

After the plane came to a stop, passengers quickly got out, standing on the partially submerged wings or on the emergency exit chutes, which also serve as life rafts. New York Waterway Capt. Vince Lombardi, operating a ferry in the Hudson, said he noticed something in the water as the boat pulled out of Pier 70. ""I said to my deck hand, 'That's an odd-looking boat,' "" he told reporters Friday. ""He said, 'I think that's an airplane.' "" The ferry headed straight for the plane, he said. ""I was a little overwhelmed and scared for the people. The water is about 32 degrees. The outside air temp was in the 20s. We were worried if we didn't get them out right away, there would be casualties."" As he arrived, he said, most passengers were calm, but some were cheering and crying. Some said, ""Get me out of the water, please, I'm cold.""  Watch a Coast Guard lieutenant talk about rescuing passengers » . Detective Michael Delaney, an NYPD diver, recalled seeing a woman in the water clinging to the side of a ferry ""in obvious distress"" when he arrived. ""We pretty much saw the distress that was in her face,"" he said. He and other divers pulled her off the side of the boat and swam her over to another boat and to safety, he said. The New York Waterway ferry reached the scene in less than four minutes, city officials said at a news conference on Friday. The first ambulance reached the shore in a minute and 12 seconds. Other boats arrived at the plane within seven minutes. About 25 people were treated at hospitals after the incident, but Bloomberg said Thursday there were no serious injures. Only a few people remained hospitalized Friday, according to the hospitals. They included a flight attendant with a deep laceration to her leg and a Coast Guard rescuer with a minor hematoma -- a localized swelling filled with blood. The flight attendant was in stable condition and the rescuer was in good condition. Most patients were treated and released, the hospitals said. With the air and water temperatures at the time of the incident, people could remain in the water only two to three minutes before the onset of hypothermia, said John Peruggia, chief of emergency medical services for FDNY. NTSB  investigators planned to speak with Sullenberger and his co-pilot on Saturday, Higgins said. The agency wants to speak with Sullenberger before the media, so he has not been made available to reporters. NTSB investigators were interviewing other members of the flight crew Friday, Higgins said.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's been five years since the banking and credit crisis rocked the U.S. economy, causing markets to plunge, unemployment to spike, housing values to crumble and placing more Americans in financial peril than at any time since the Great Depression. On Monday, President Barack Obama touted his administration's successes in helping to turn things around even though national economic growth remains sluggish and millions of people have given up looking for work. Obama said government's response ""put a floor under the fall"" and his policies set the stage for an end to economic contraction and created an environment for the economy to grow again. The president specifically pointed to the impact of the economic stimulus, creation of seven million jobs, the resurgence of the bailed out Detroit automakers, higher taxes on the wealthiest earners and an increase in exports. ""We've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we've begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity,"" Obama said. Although Obama paints a rosy scenario, there are still key questions on the economy. Larry Summers, a leading name to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, withdrew his name from consideration on Sunday, clearing the way for Janet Yellen, who serves as vice chairwoman at the Fed, to become the leading candidate. Also, the White House announced last week that top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, will step down as head of the National Economic Council and be replaced by Jeffrey Zients, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. There is also the looming showdown with Congress on funding the government, raising the ability of the nation to borrow money to pay its bills, and continuation of the drastic budget cuts that took effect earlier this year absent a deal in Washington to reduce the deficit. There is also the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care law backed by Obama that is taking effect this year and remains a political flashpoint with Republicans. It's the economy, stupid . That motto was made famous by political strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, and rang true for Obama's first presidential campaign as well. And the American public agrees. In poll after poll, fixing the economy is a stubborn No. 1 when it comes to the issues the voters most care about. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month indicates that 41% of the public says the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now, with health care at 16% and the crisis in Syria at 15%. Soon after taking office, Obama signed a massive economic stimulus bill, led the charge for Wall Street reform and accelerated the bailout of the U.S. auto industry, which threatened to collapse and take more than 1 million jobs with it. Some began to compare Obama to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who transformed the fabric of American society in the face of the Depression with aggressive government intervention. 'Poor marks' But since his first two years in office, some experts say, the president has struggled to keep focused on the economy. Liberal economist Dean Baker has been highly critical of his record. ""I give him very poor marks. Five years later, the economy is still very far from recovering,"" said Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, pointing to an unemployment rate that he says would hover around 9% instead of 7.3% if so many people hadn't given up and dropped out of the work force. And it shows in Obama's approval ratings. Through much of last year, he had a 30% approval rating on the economy. That number is up this year -- to 43% -- but most still disapprove of his handling of the issue. A screeching halt . In 2010, many conservatives, led by the tea party movement, sought to stop the president's agenda. They voted out the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and replaced them with conservative Republicans. Then, those Republicans did what they were sent to Washington to do. The president has struggled to pass any major economic legislation since 2010. Instead, he's been jumping from one political crisis to the next. Fights over federal budget and spending levels locked Congress in multiple battles in 2011 and 2012 that nearly led to the shutdown of the government. The narrative didn't always fall in Obama's favor; nor did the policies that ensued. Republicans shifted the conversation from economic stimulus to deficit reduction. The president jumped on the deficit-reduction bandwagon and made that a priority. Through protracted political battles over the size of the government, forced spending cuts, which sliced up to 10% of most of the federal budget, went into effect. It wasn't the president's favorite idea, however, for how to revive the economy. He still had hopes of repairing old bridges and building new windmills. So did his supporters, who grew frustrated with the president. ""We're getting tired. ... The unemployment is unconscionable. We don't know what the (president's) strategy is,"" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, said in 2012. But in the frame of deficit reduction, Obama was able to obtain a few concessions. He won a series of tax increases, including an increase on the top tax earners: those making more than $400,000 per year. And the needle moved. The budget cuts, tax increases and a recovering economy will reduce the deficit by about $4 trillion over 10 years, according to the White House. The nation's debt ratio to size of the gross domestic product is expected to stabilize in the next decade, which economists hail as good for the economy. The foreign affairs president . While the president came into office with little experience in foreign affairs and hopes to implement an expansive domestic agenda, overseas conflict has kept his plate full. He expanded the war in Afghanistan and ended the war in Iraq. He kept his attention on the citizen-led revolts that swept the Arab world and expanded the use of drones. Under his administration, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed and the U.S. joined a NATO campaign to overthrow Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and Obama is now working on an intense campaign to respond to the use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war. Although presidents are forced to walk and chew gum at the same time, world events have created challenges for Obama's ability to implement his domestic agenda. ""When you look at issues like military strikes in Syria ... it takes the full time and attention of the leaders,"" Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said recently. As the president decided to hold off on a military strike in Syria while Secretary of State John Kerry works with his counterpart in Russia to devise a plan to rid the regime of its chemical weapons, the president attempted to revitalize discussion of his domestic agenda. ""Even as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue ... it is still important to recognize that we've got a lot more stuff to do here in this government,"" Obama said during a meeting with his Cabinet on Thursday. Economist Mark Zandi said that, all things considered, the president has been fairly successful on the domestic front. ""It has been a tough road, but I think he did a pretty good job,"" said Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. But economist Baker offered a more critical perspective, saying the president hasn't shown a willingness to push an economic agenda. ""Let's say Syria didn't happen. What would he be doing right now? I am not sure he has some agenda that is being obstructed by events in the world,"" he said. Syria aside, much of the White House's attention this fall will be spent on getting Americans to sign up for the health insurance exchanges, the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Open enrollment begins October 1, and the administration is expected to spend $8.7 million on a media blitz to promote the exchanges. Super Bowl champs to promote Obamacare . Second term, second chance . After his re-election, the president hoped to reset his economic agenda. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama said he will work to ""reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class."" This summer, he launched a campaign to revive his focus on the economy. In a series of speeches this year, he acknowledged the troubling economic indicators that are keeping the economy from a full recovery, including income inequality and employment disparities. Americans' real median household income fell from $63,000 to $55,600 between 2000 and 2011, and as of December, 9.1 million jobs were necessary to restore the job market to pre-recession levels, according to the Economic Policy Institute. ""Reversing these trends has to be Washington's highest priority. It has to be Washington's highest priority. It's certainly my highest priority,"" Obama said in Galesburg, Illinois, in July. Job creation, affordable education and home ownership were central to his proposals. Those initiatives included expanding development of renewable energy, creating new power grids and expanding access to early childhood education. But what has the president done since that July speech? Some say, not much. ""Nothing has happened on any front,"" economist Zandi said. White House press secretary Jay Carney pushed back, arguing that the president is still focused on those economic priorities. ""The president remains committed to pushing forward on an economic agenda that creates a better bargain for the middle class,"" Carney said Wednesday. As new threats of a government shutdown over government funding and the debt ceiling loom, the president confronted the issue Monday. ""I can''t remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it doesn't get 100% of what it wants,"" the president said, blaming the Republicans for potential ""massive economic turmoil."" With ongoing political stalemates and a protracted fight over the budget and debt ceiling, Zandi said immigration reform, which would be a major catalyst for economic growth, appears to be heading nowhere in the House. And tax and entitlement reform, which would also help to stimulate the economy, have no chance of happening this year. There's always next year. But 2014 is an election year, which creates an even more difficult environment for passing legislation. After that, the president is in his final two years of office, and the political machine begins shaping the next occupant of the Oval Office. Then, by definition, it can be hard for a lame duck president to get much done.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Hundreds of people gathered Saturday in Tripoli's Martyrs Square to mourn the victims of fighting in the capital a day earlier. At least 43 people were killed and 460 others wounded on Friday in the bloodiest day of fighting here since the fall of Tripoli in 2011, the state run Libya News Agency LANA reported. The fighting broke out after protesters arrived at the Tripoli headquarters of militias from the coastal city of Misrata. Protesters and witnesses said militiamen opened fire on the protesters who marched on Gharghour, a southern district of the capital where Misrata militia are based, in an effort to evict the armed groups. TV footage aired on the privately owned al-Nabaa channel showed militiamen, in a truck equipped with what appeared to be an antiaircraft mounted on the back, opening fire directly at protesters. The armed confrontation lasted for hours as protesters returned with weapons and militiamen from different parts of the capital. The sound of heavy gunfire, artillery and explosions echoed across Tripoli on Friday night and clashes erupted Saturday east of the city. Libyan officials said fresh fighting broke out in the district of Tajoura, an eastern entrance to the capital, where heavily armed militiamen from Misrata were trying to enter Tripoli. At least one person was killed and eight other were wounded in the early morning fighting, LANA reported. More fighting was reported in the area in the afternoon. Prime Minister Ali Zaidan warned Saturday in a news conference that the arrival of any forces from outside Tripoli would lead to a serious escalation. ""The coming hours and days will be decisive for the future of Libya,"" Justice Minister Salah Marghani told reporters. Tensions were running high Saturday on the streets of Tripoli as militiamen fortified parts of the city, setting up roadblocks and closing off some roads leading into the capital. The scene at Martyrs Square was an emotional one as people gathered for the funerals. Hours earlier, the government announced a three-day, nationwide period of mourning. Some families marched through the square carrying pictures of the dead and coffins covered by the Libyan flag. A local official read a statement to the crowd blaming the prime minister and the government for the situation. ""We will continue on this path to liberate Tripoli from these militias,"" the official said. Meanwhile, much of the international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, condemned the violence and called for restraint and calm. ""The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) strongly condemns the violence which took place in Tripoli on Friday 15 November, resulting in the tragic loss of life among civilians, and calls for its immediate cessation as well as supporting the efforts by authorities to restore calm, stop the bloodshed and ensure security and stability for all Libyans"" UNSMIL said in a statement on Saturday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for restraint. ""Libyans did not risk their lives in their 2011 revolution for this violence to continue,"" he said in a statement. ""If a free people are going to succeed in forging a peaceful, secure, and prosperous country with a government based on the rule of law and respect for human rights, then there can be no place for this kind of violence in the new Libya."" Anger against the various militias has been mounting for months in Tripoli and other parts of the country, including in the eastern city of Benghazi, which has been gripped by increasing violence, including political assassinations. Friday's protest, which was organized in part by the Tripoli Local Council, occurred after heavy fighting in the heart of the capital last week between the Misrata militiamen and other groups from Tripoli. Militiamen from Misrata and a number of other Libyan cities entered Tripoli during the fight for the capital in August 2011 and have stayed, establishing bases in different parts of the capital. On Saturday, Zaidan renewed the government's calls for armed groups to leave the capital, reiterating a decision passed by lawmakers months ago, one that has yet to be implemented. ""The government has decided to contact all armed groups in Tripoli and inform them about the (General) National Congress's decision for them to leave Tripoli and it should be implemented as soon as possible"" Zaidan told reporters. But many observers were skeptical about the ability of the weak central government to enforce this decision. The government has not been able to rein in militia groups with various regional, tribal and political loyalties. Last month, Zaidan was kidnapped by a militia in Tripoli group and released a few hours later by another militia group. The government has also been struggling with its plans to build an army and police. Many militia members are on the state's payroll, but continue to operate freely with no government control or accountability. ""As long as militias and armed groups are not held to account for crimes they commit, innocent people will continue to die"" Said Hanan Salah, a Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch ""The government has a responsibility here to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice and hold them accountable for their acts."" CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Nana Karikari-apau and Brian Walker in Atlanta contributed to this report.","At least 43 people were killed in fighting, health minister says .

"(CNN) -- Record-breaking cold across the Midwest. Record-breaking heat in California. Makes you wonder what's up with Ol' Man Winter. For example, West Coast heat made news all week -- for better or worse. California saw a record-setting winter heat wave, but on Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown delivered the bad news: He declared a drought emergency, after seeing little rain since 2012. That announcement came two days after Monterey, California, reached 83 degrees Wednesday, smashing a record for the date by 8 degrees. At the other extreme, it was just last week that a polar vortex delivered some of the coldest temperatures in two decades to the Midwest and Northeast. Have Mother Nature and Ol' Man Winter gone Jekyl-and-Hyde on us? As it turns out, there's nothing sinister at work. It's natural variability, meteorologists say. ""It happens every year, it just varies in intensity,"" said Taylor Ward, a CNN weather producer. Last year in mid-January, many Americans were wondering why it was so warm compared to most years. But now it's the opposite -- well, for much of the country. It depends on where you live in relation to the jet stream. The jet stream is a ribbon of wind that flows west to east high across the globe, typically at 110 mph, although its speed can often top 200 mph. Think of it as an aerial highway along which storms travel along. But the jet stream fluctuates north and south. It's always wobbling. It drives our temperature variability daily. One day you might be below a ridge in the jet stream and its warmth, and days later, a trough or dip will send brrrrr-utality your way. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says climatologists in recent years observe a more wavy pattern to the jet stream, bringing outbreaks of colder weather to the areas of the Northern Hemisphere -- including the United States and Europe. ""Whether this is normal randomness or related to the significant climate changes occurring in the Arctic is not entirely clear, especially when considering individual events,"" NOAA says on its climate.gov website. It's something CNN Senior Meteorologist Brandon Miller talked about last week when asked to explain the polar vortex that was leading to the coldest temperatures in many states in decades. When asked if it was a side effect of global warming, his response was, it's under review. ""This is a hotly researched topic. In short, yes, it could be,"" he said. ""It seems counter-intuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one, but some research shows that it could. ""We know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet, melting of the Arctic Sea ice, etc. This includes extreme distortions of the jet stream, which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter,"" he said. J. Marshall Shepherd, the president of the American Meteorological Society, says more study is needed on whether Arctic warming will have a big effect on northern climates. In nature, air north of the jet stream is cold, and to the south it is warmer. But the Arctic is getting warmer. ""We're relaxing or loosening that difference in temperature and that changes the jet stream and loosens it some,"" he told viewers of a White House video chat last week. ""I think this is an area we have to look (at)...closely in the science. I think it is quite plausible."" He agreed it's too early to say with certainty. But a study by Elizabeth Barnes of Colorado State University's department of atmospheric science found no support for the increased temperatures in the Arctic leading to additional slow-moving weather patterns. She described the relationship between the Arctic and the weather to its south as ""complex."" In the study, published last August, she said there are likely influences from other parts of the world and internal variability. As scientists press ahead in their research, this month's jet stream reached far down to the Gulf Coast, bringing such frigidity that Midwesterners resorted to outlandish experiments, such as tossing a cup of boiled water into the outdoor air and watching it turn to snow. Finally this week, a weather ridge in the West Coast pushed the jet stream back into Canada, to the relief of many Americans. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Scientists can't for certainty whether global warming is behind wacky weather .

"(CNN) -- Remember when 50 seemed old? Ad agencies and TV networks won't freely admit to catering to the AARP set. Fashion designers don't typically pander to the grown-up in us. It's tough to find someone 50+ on the cover of Vogue. And yet, for many women, 50 is the age when we reach our stride. It's when we begin to love our maturing bodies. When we claim our personal style. When we step into our own power. So, what does the new 50 look like? Two words: Michelle Obama. When you go through the endless scroll of photos of the first lady -- from Inauguration Day, when she first was cloaked in edgy designer Isabel Toledo, to a recent state dinner honoring the British Prime Minister where she was wearing a sleek, off-the-shoulder dress from American design house Marchesa -- you see a fabulous and undeniable evolution. First lady at 50: Has big day changed? Obama has the nerve to look younger, fitter, and more comfortable in her skin than she did seven years ago. How she does it is an inspiration to all of us over 50. If a picture tells anything, it says she is poised to take on whatever comes her way with grace, dignity, humor, warmth and level-headedness. While she has come to be known both for her cut arms and her healthy manifesto to young people, ""Let's Move,"" what remains curious about this 5-foot-11 brown-skinned woman with decidedly black features (who could easily have been considered awkward) is that she has become a fashion icon. A trendsetter, even. Think about it: How many women in television news and in corporate offices across the country had what the President affectionately called ""the right to bare arms"" before Michelle Obama started sporting her long, lean limbs? Those sleeveless dresses got women pumping iron, too, urging them on with the dream that they, too, could look as good as she one day. Vanity has surely driven people to better health! Michelle O -- much like her predecessor Jackie O -- has taken the global stage by storm, choosing to define a style for herself that defies tradition. The cut arms? Check. The return of the bangs? Check. The popularizing of affordable American fashion? Check. 10 reasons to welcome turning 50 . And why not? All eyes were on Michelle Obama from the moment she walked into the White House. What would the first black first lady do to make her mark? How would she present herself? What would be her defining moments? Michelle Obama has introduced the country and beyond to a woman who is unafraid to be herself, who embraces her uniqueness, and who strategically says what she thinks. Saying it through her attire was a clever way to open many doors. She sold out a Donna Ricco dress from White House/Black Market when she made an early appearance on ""The View,"" showing you don't have to break the bank to look good. She dazzled viewers in British-Nigerian designer Duro Olowu's crazy mixed-up patterns while exercising with children on ""Sesame Street."" When she took off a shiny black leather jacket to do 25 pushups (three more than Ellen DeGeneres on her own show), folks stopped checking so much for who she was wearing and instead took a good look at what she was saying. Had Michelle Obama come out on the national stage wearing a frown, pounding her fists, saying we have to get healthy and move our bodies or we are going to die, it's unlikely that her cause would have been met with as much success. Instead, she has made looking and feeling good hip, even fashionable. For her, 50 isn't about Spanx or any other fat-cloaking accessory. When you are at your fighting weight and probably look amazing in a two-piece, why would you? For this first lady—whose agenda secretly looks more like that of Eleanor Roosevelt, who stood up for women and intelligence in the face of hostility and scorn—engaging in the art of adornment to expand the lens of how people look at each other and their world has been nothing short of brilliant. In 2008, America took a bet on a president and first lady who didn't remotely resemble their predecessors. Thank goodness, Michelle Obama didn't choose a predictable, cookie-cutter approach once she moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. She took a fashion road less traveled, walking away from heavyweights like Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren and Carolina Herrera and choosing to give some newbies and/or smaller houses a chance. She gave Jason Wu a meteoric jump-start with her first inaugural gown, broadened black female designer Tracy Reese's reach with a sunny People magazine cover and has championed a whole host of other creators—Maria Pinto, Narciso Rodriguez, Thakoon, Tracy Feith, Rachel Roy—many who got the kind of shine they hadn't dared dream about before her reign. Why does this matter? Michelle Obama has artfully navigated her time in office to elevate the collective consciousness about diversity, health and fitness. She's faced the wrath of critics, who have picked on her for everything from her passion to get the nation's youth into exercise to her amazing posterior to the sneakers she wore while volunteering at a food bank. Still, at 50, she stands poised (often in Jimmy Choos) as a perfect example of what being grown and vital looks like. Who wouldn't want to look as good as Michelle Obama when crossing the halfway mark of life? To the haters out there, take a look in the mirror and ask yourself if you'd stand up in her shoes? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harriette Cole.","Cole: What does the new 50 look like? Two words: Michelle Obama .

"(CNN) -- Last month, the Polish city of Krakow joined the likes of Dublin and Edinburgh to become the latest Unesco City of Literature. Most people could probably name a Scottish or Irish author, but how about a Polish one? Readers who are not Polish or of Polish descent face a few obstacles to opening the rich and different world of Polish literature. Firstly, Poland is not a world player, and we tend to become interested in a country's culture only when it is a global power or a real or possible threat to us. Secondly there is the spelling and pronouncing of names. We can handle the Russian transliteration of Gregory as Grigory. But the Polish for Gregory, alas, is Grzegorz. All those z's. (I played Scrabble with a friend in Warsaw: a player gets one point for a Z.) Obstacle three is that the jewel in the crown of Polish literature is its poetry, and unfortunately poetry is what usually gets lost in translation (though the translations have been improving). However it's worth facing and overcoming these obstacles, because the Polish way of looking at the world has plenty to teach us. If Polish literature began in the Renaissance it blossomed in mid-19th century Romanticism. The Shakespeare of Polish Romanticism was the poet Adam Mickiewicz. His ""Pan Tadeusz,"" a novel in verse, restores a lost world through the magic of art. There is dalliance, swordplay, music, a hunt -- but even a humble vegetable patch delights. Fast forward to the 20th century and Polish poetry and drama took a turn towards the avant-garde. The poetry had been remarkable from the beginning, but Cyprian Norwid, a contemporary of Emily Dickinson (his verse is strikingly similar to her quiet, difficult lyricism), showed the way to modern understatement. Check out Zbigniew Herbert and Poland's Nobel laureate Wisława Szymborska. Absurdism and dark humor are Polish specialties and appear in the playful stories and novels of Witold Gombrowicz. Lovers of science fiction should know Stanisław Lem. A Kraków native, Lem became internationally known for ""Solaris,"" (which gave rise to two films, one by Andrei Tarkovsky and a Hollywood version by Steven Soderbergh), satirical fantasy ""The Cyberiad,"" and essays on humanity and future technology. His work is marked by fun, pain, and a probing intelligence. READ MORE: Poland's tangible heritage . All these poets, playwrights, novelists, and essayists write about the human condition, but there has always been a political element to most Polish literature; a consequence of growing up in a country with a history of partition and repeated defeat. Poland was a major European power during the 17th and 18th centuries. However weak kings and lack of organization led to a political vacuum and the country ceased to exist without a fight in 1795 when Prussia, Austria, and Russia divided it up among themselves. Poland did not exist again as a state until after World War I. During that long period of nationlessness, poets and novelists strove to preserve Polish identity at home and abroad. Soldiers fought in other lands, hoping to make a future Poland possible; and young men periodically sacrificed themselves in uprisings that were crushed (1830, 1848, 1863). Poles became known for their idealism, their valor in the face of overwhelming odds, their splendid if suicidal recklessness, their patriotism, and -- understandably, given that over and over again this patriotism proved futile -- for their cynicism. The 20th century added another shadow to the Polish mind: the Holocaust; before World War II, Poland had the largest Jewish community in Europe. Poland fought with the Allies but ""in reward"" (a Polish smile of irony here) had to spend the next fifty years behind the Iron Curtain. Irony is not unique to Polish writers but they are masters of it. It's telling that an American writer much loved in Poland today is Philip K. Dick, who felt that the world was against him. I offer an emblematic moment in Polish literature. A much loved author to Poles is Henryk Sienkiewicz. In ""With Fire and Sword,"" a historical novel set in the mid-17th century, the soldier Longinus Podbipięta reminds us of Don Quixote. He has taken a vow of chastity and he may not pursue the object of his affections until he has cut off three enemy heads with a single blow of his enormous Crusader's sword. He manages that but then, without hesitation, offers himself up to martyrdom. The mix of humor, bitterness, and religious faith: very Polish. Michael Kandel received his PhD in Slavic at Indiana University. He works as an editor for the Modern Language Association. For Words without Borders he recently translated, from Polish, ""Balm of a Long Farewell,"" by Marek Huberath.","Get over the tricky spelling and Polish literature has plenty to offer, says editor and author Michael Kandel .

"(CNN)  -- Think about all the data -- photos, videos, text messages, calendar items, apps, call log, voice mail, and e-mail -- on your cell phone right now. If you're arrested, could the police search your cell phone? And would they need a warrant? That depends on which state you're in. In California, it is legal for police to search an arrestee's cell phone without a warrant -- ever since a January decision by the California Supreme Court. California civil rights advocates are pushing back. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is supporting California Assembly Bill SB 914, which would require police in that state to get a warrant before searching an arrestee's cell phone. EFF also recently filed an amicus brief in the Oregon case of James Tyler Nix, a criminal suspect who was arrested and placed in a holding cell. According to EFF, ""Forty minutes after the arrest, without a warrant, an investigator fished through the suspect's cell phone looking for evidence related to his alleged crime. Law enforcement officials claim they didn't need a warrant because the search was 'incident to arrest' -- an exception to the warrant requirement intended to allow officers to perform a search for weapons or to prevent evidence from being destroyed in exigent circumstances."" EFF senior staff attorney Marcia Hofmann contended: ""This is an empty excuse from the police -- the suspect was in custody and unable to destroy evidence on his cell phone."" Meanwhile, in Florida, an appellate court decision upheld warrantless cell phone searches, defining the phone as a kind of ""container."" This case may be considered by the Florida Supreme Court. A similar Georgia appellate court decision upheld a warrantless search of a cell phone found in an arrestee's car (not on her person). In contrast, the Ohio Supreme Court has barred warrantless cell phone searches. The Michigan State Police (MSP) use data extraction devices to pull data off arrestee's smartphones. This is done only with a warrant, according to a state police press release. But when the Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain details about how these devices are being used, they encountered serious obstacles. ""MSP claimed that the cost of retrieving and assembling the documents that disclose how five of the devices are being used is $544,680. The ACLU was then asked to pay a $272,340 deposit before the organization could receive a single document,"" said a Michigan ACLU statement. ""In order to reduce the cost, the ACLU of Michigan narrowed the scope of its request. However, each time the ACLU submitted more narrow requests, MSP claimed that no documents exist for that time period and then it refused to reveal when the devices were used so a proper request could be made."" The pattern appears to be that around the U.S., some state and local police officers are taking the initiative to search arrestees' cell phones. In some cases this yields information relevant to the alleged crime, which has contributed to indictments and convictions. Only then do some of these cases wind up in appellate or state supreme courts in a process that often takes years. If you're concerned about police or anyone else getting into your cell phone, a basic precaution is to configure your phone's security settings to always require a passcode or pattern to access any of the phone's data or functions. According to Catherine Crump of the American Civil Liberties Union, ""The police can ask you to unlock the phone -- which many people will do -- but they almost certainly cannot compel you to unlock your phone without the involvement of a judge."" Data extraction devices used for cell phone forensics can bypass passcode security in some cases, but so far there appears to be little evidence that police are using these devices without warrants.  The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","In California it is legal for police to search an arrestee's cell phone with out a warrant .

"(CNN) -- The government's open. Washington is back at work. House Republicans, licking their wounds, are asking themselves what's next. And President Barack Obama has thrown down the gauntlet: The top item on his agenda is immigration reform. What are the chances that the House will now move ahead on immigration? The answer will have less to do with immigration than with how the budget battle has changed the larger political dynamic in Washington. House Republicans' views on immigration are untested, and many advocates for reform believe they are implacably hostile. But the truth is Republican opinion has been evolving since the 2012 election. More and more House Republicans, perhaps the majority, know that reform is overdue and that the GOP must be part of the solution -- to remain competitive with Latino voters and because it's the right thing to do. Individual lawmakers and essential staff continued to work on the issue even through the dark days of the shutdown. And members are coalescing around answers to the hardest of the hard questions: what to do about immigrants living in the United States illegally? House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is working on a bill that would create a path to citizenship for ""Dreamers"" brought to the U.S. illegally as children. And one recent informal count found 84 House Republicans -- more than one third of the total -- in favor of legal status for the Dreamers' parents. Bottom line: If it weren't for the rancor of the budget brawl, the House might be in a good place on immigration, with Republicans ready to move forward and pass a package of measures they could send to a conference with the Senate bill. Opinion: Key to immigration reform -- worker visas . So what exactly is the fallout from the budget battle? Surprisingly, it appears to cut both ways -- both for and against the prospect of an immigration overhaul. Even before the government reopened, two different factions were making their voices heard. Some, such as Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho -- an opponent of the budget deal but a strong proponent of immigration reform -- argued that the budget battle had made it hard, if not impossible, for House Republicans to reach a deal with Obama. Others, such as Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois, who voted for the budget package, said it's time to get back to the give and take of governing -- time to sit down with Democrats and compromise, including on immigration. Opinion: It's not Syria holding up immigration reform . Which of these two sentiments will prove stronger in the House? GOP lawmakers are reeling from their recent drubbing. Skepticism and negativity are at an all-time high. And it will take both kinds of champions -- tough-minded and accommodating -- to negotiate a deal. But if enough other Republicans agree with Schock and make their views known, that could empower leadership to open the way to consideration of some immigration bills. A handful of hard-line conservatives -- the group that opposed the budget deal -- still hold enormous sway in the House. And just because Speaker John Boehner waived the so-called Hastert rule once -- bringing the legislation that ended the shutdown up for a vote when he knew it lacked support from the majority of the Republican majority -- doesn't mean he'll do that again anytime soon. The House Republican conference is only as strong as it is cohesive, and the majority-of-the-majority rule has proved a good way to maintain that power and cohesion. Still, the complex dynamic that drives Republicans in the House may have shifted somewhat in the shutdown. Certainly you hear a lot more grumbling, in private and in public, about the power of the hard-line naysayers. Other members are tired of being held hostage. Many want to get on with governing, making deals on a wide range of issues. And a few, such as Schock, are starting to say so, even on TV. Opinion: How Obama can clinch immigration deal . That's a ray of hope. But there's still another danger looming. The one thing House Republicans are not going to do in the wake of the budget battle -- not on any issue, in any circumstances -- is a favor for Obama. And to the degree that immigration reform is seen as Obama's issue, it will be dead on arrival in the House. The question for House Republicans, leadership and rank and file: Do they want to cede the issue to Obama? Can they afford to let him own it? More and more of the GOP grasps that that's a mistake. It's a disaster politically for the party and a mistake for the nation, which needs reform, urgently, for the sake of the economy and the rule of law. What's needed in the House now is not a favor for Obama, but a strong conservative answer on one of the most vexing issues facing the nation. Will House Republicans see it that way? Can they take ownership and move forward? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby.","Tamar Jacoby: After budget battle, GOP may be in no mood for immigration overhaul .
But many in GOP favor legal status and have been working on reforms, she says .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Seven former Merrill Lynch executives have been subpoenaed by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo over $3.6 billion in bonuses paid out just before the company was acquired by federally bailed-out Bank of America last year, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Seven former Merrill Lynch executives have been subpoenaed to testify about bonuses. Among the subpoenaed executives are Andrea Orcel, Thomas Montag and Peter Kraus, according to the source. The source did not know the names of the other four former executives who received subpoenas. Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis spent four hours last Thursday testifying at the attorney general's office about the $3.6 billion in bonuses that Merrill Lynch paid out just before it was acquired by the bank last year. Lewis declined to give out details of those payments. The New York Attorney General's office served an earlier subpoena on Bank of America during Lewis' testimony last week, seeking the full list of individual bonus recipients at Merrill Lynch, according to Benjamin M. Lawsky, a special assistant to Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. ""We obviously wanted to question Mr. Lewis about this list and are very disappointed that Bank of America has chosen not to produce it,"" Lawsky said in a written statement. ""As a result, during the testimony ... we served a subpoena on Bank of America for the list, which we intend to obtain."" Lewis, speaking to reporters as he left the attorney general's office after his testimony last Thursday, said that he had come to ""deliver clarity"" and that he answered the questions that were asked to the best of his knowledge. Lewis had been criticized for using a corporate jet to travel to the session. But Bank of America spokesman Timothy Gillis said on Thursday that Lewis did so ""because of the high importance"" of the meeting. Bank of America has been allocated $45 billion in federal bailout funds, and the Treasury has guaranteed to protect Bank of America against potentially billions of dollars in losses from investments Merrill Lynch made in real estate loans. Former Merrill Lynch chief executive John Thain told investigators two weeks ago that Lewis was aware Merrill employees would be awarded billions of dollars in bonuses before Bank of America's takeover of Merrill became effective January 1, according to sources familiar with the investigation. In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on February 11, Lewis said he had little involvement in the Merrill bonus plan. ""They were a public company until the first of the year, they had a separate board, separate compensation committee and we had no authority to tell them what to do, just urged them what to do,"" Lewis said. But Cuomo's staff obtained a document, negotiated between Bank of America and Merrill during their takeover negotiations, that set a cap for Merrill Lynch's bonus pool at about $5 billion, said sources with knowledge of the investigation. Bank of America confirmed there was a cap set. Cuomo has accused Merrill Lynch of trying to hide lavish bonus payments. ""Merrill Lynch secretly moved up the planned date to allocate bonuses and then richly rewarded their failed executives,"" Cuomo wrote in a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts. Cuomo found Merrill paid its four top bonus recipients $121 million and doled out bonuses of $1 million or more to 696 employees, as the firm lost $15 billion in the fourth quarter. It is not clear how much each of the subpoenaed Merrill executives received in bonus payments. ""I don't want to see the taxpayers being taken advantage of. And I don't want to see the taxpayers paying performance bonuses that shouldn't be paid,"" Cuomo said. Cuomo is investigating to see whether failure to disclose the bonus payments to investors violated New York's Martin Act, a powerful securities law that empowers the attorney general to bring not only civil but also criminal charges. CNN's Allan Chernoff and Amy Sahba contributed to this report .","Source: N.Y. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo subpoenas seven former executives .

"(CNN) -- What has Jay Leno done lately for NBC in late night? Well, even the network's official Wednesday announcement of his ouster (in spring 2014) acknowledges that ""The Tonight Show"" under Leno's reign continues to rank No. 1 in both total viewers and advertiser-prized 18-to-49-year-olds. That's against ABC's recently relocated ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" as well as CBS' longstanding ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" according to Nielsen Media Research. Nonetheless, NBC will be pushing him out for a second time, with ""Late Night"" host Jimmy Fallon taking over ""in conjunction"" with the network's coverage of next year's Winter Olympic Games from Sochi, Russia (scheduled to run from February 7-23). NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke says in a statement that ""we are purposefully making this change when Jay is No. 1, just as Jay replaced Johnny Carson (in 1992) when he was No. 1. Jimmy Fallon is a unique talent and this is his time."" Carson retired under his own power, though, surprising NBC in the process. Leno is unwillingly walking the plank, as he's made clear in recent monologues with barbed jokes at NBC's expense. But if this indeed is Fallon's time, it may be in large part because we live in very different times. The Internet-driven ""social media"" didn't exist during Carson's storied 30-year reign. He simply had to deliver a conventional TV audience. He did so year after year against a variety of competitors in a much less crowded late-night field. Fallon averages 1.7 million viewers compared to 3.5 million viewers for Leno, according to the NBC release. He also draws fewer 18-to-49-year-olds, although a later time slot certainly is a factor in both cases. But Fallon, as well as Kimmel and TBS' late night standard-bearer, Conan O'Brien, all excel in a social media arena that remains of little if any interest to either Leno or Letterman. Networks increasingly see this as a key ingredient in times when conventional TV ratings continue to sag amid myriad channel choices. Let's look at their respective number of Twitter followers. As of this writing, Fallon's personal page has 8.33 million and O'Brien is right behind with 8.09 million. Kimmel weighs in with 2.42 million followers, meaning he still has some work to do on this front. But Leno, via the official Tonight Show site, has just 525,000 followers. And Letterman's Late Show page has 234,000 followers. The host doesn't have a personal Twitter page, although some are tweeting in his name and using his picture, according to a Late Show representative. Fallon and Kimmel also boast a number of ""viral videos"" with star supporting players ranging from first lady Michelle Obama to actor Ben Affleck. Fallon's recent ""Evolution of Mom Dancing"" performance with Obama became an immediate YouTube sensation that to date has more than 15 million views. In announcing Fallon's promotion, NBC noted that his show ""has continued to garner attention for its viral videos,"" with the host also winning an Emmy in the ""Interactive Media Category"" after being named 2009's ""Webby Person of the Year."" This week's TBS press release on extending ""Conan"" through November 2015 touches only briefly on O'Brien's conventional Nielsen ratings performance among young adults. But the network says a mouthful about his social media prowess. It bears repeating because it's so illustrative of the value networks place on out-of-the-box moxie. O'Brien's show ""leads the late-night crowd when it comes to online activity and engagement,"" says TBS, ""with the show and its host drawing more than 8.3 million followers on Twitter, 2 million fans on Facebook, 2 million unique users each month on TeamCoco.com and 15 million video views each month on TeamCoco.com and YouTube."" Not only that, but the Team Coco app won the 2012 Emmy for ""Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media Enhancement."" The great unknown, at least from a financial standpoint, is whether all these accolades and millions of off-network fans will lead to appreciable sums of money in the bank. We'll likely never know with Leno and Letterman, though. Their skill sets basically begin and end with putting on a show each night. In the now vast multimedia universe, that may be akin to sending a message via telegraph instead of e-mail. After all, these really aren't just the late-night wars anymore. They're the anytime, anywhere wars, with Fallon, Kimmel and O'Brien arming themselves to the hilt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Bark.","Ed Bark: Jay Leno still No. 1 in late night for NBC, but network replacing him with Jimmy Fallon .

"LONDON, England -- A military-grade laser that blinds temporarily is the latest security technology available to wealthy superyacht owners afraid of pirate attacks. The SeaLase laser temporarily blinds pirates -- preventing them from attacking the yacht. The ""SeaLase"" laser, similar to weapons used for crowd control in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military, has a range of  four kilometers and becomes harder to look at the closer an attacker comes. At a distance of one kilometer, attackers develop strong nausea and can no longer see, according to Lasersec Systems, the Finnish company that developed the lasers for commercial use. ""We don't have guns, so we need non-lethal systems to defend yachts,"" Lasersec CEO Scott Buchter told CNN. Buchter, who recently launched the $104,000 multi-colored laser at Monaco Yacht Show, says the loss of eyesight the laser inflicts is only temporary and that no permanent damage is inflicted. Hi-tech military-grade security systems like SeaLase have become increasingly popular with superyacht owners looking to protect multi-millon dollar yachts on the open seas. Pirate attacks on oil tankers and other boats in dangerous waters like the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia -- a maritime link between Europe and Asia --have fueled the growing worry that superyachts may be the next target. Because law regarding the use of deadly force on ships is ambiguous in some countries and the transport of guns is illegal in most international waters -- yacht crews favor the use of non-lethal weapons for security. This has fueled the recent market boom for weapons like SeaLase, according to Buchter. SeaLase is the latest of these kinds of weapons, which include ""L-Rad,"" a long-range acoustic device that temporarily deafens enemies and the $450,000 ""SeaOwl"" tracking system, which combines radar and infrared or thermal cameras to detect incoming threats as far as five kilometers away. BAE Systems, the world's second largest global defense company, is thinking even bigger with plans for a sophisticated electronic early warning system for supertankers that some experts say could cost several million dollars. ""Piracy is on the rise,"" said Nick Stoppard of BAE systems. ""Attacks in 2008 were double those of the previous year and there is a clear need for better methods to help commercial ships identify and evade pirates before an attack occurs."" The early warning system would use extremely advanced radars that could see over the horizon, as far as 25 km away. But pirates are not the only enemies of affluent yacht owners. For some, the paparazzi, using long range lens to take pictures of them on their yachts, can pose a privacy headache. According to reports in UK newspaper,  The Times, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has installed an ""anti-pap system"" that would fire light beams at a camera, disrupting its ability to take images. Aside from the anti-pap system, it has been widely reported that Abramovitch's yacht ""Eclipse"" carries an anti-missile defense system and an escape submarine. The yacht is also said to have doubled in price to $1.2 billion since its commissioning three years ago. Michael Howorth, former super-yacht captain and technical editor at SuperYachtWorld magazine, told CNN for a previous article: As a yacht owner, ""you would be an absolute fool if you didn't have this sort of advanced defense technology.","Lasers that blind pirates are now available to wealthy super-yacht owners .
The lasers only temporarily impair eye-sight and make the assailant nauseous .
Systems such as SeaLase are on the increase with growing piracy figures ."
"(CNN) -- When the lights went out during the magic show, the Costa Concordia passengers watching thought it was part of the act. Then there was a scraping sound, the ship began to list to one side and a panicked evacuation began. One year ago, on January 13, 2012, the Costa Concordia struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio, killing 32 people and shaking an industry that prefers to be known for fun in the sun and endless entertainment. Capt. Francesco Schettino may be indicted in the next few weeks on charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship before his passengers, and other Concordia executives and crewmembers may also face trial. The ship is still in the water. Salvage experts hope to float the ship by the end of summer 2013 and eventually tow it to an undetermined port for salvage. Since the disaster, safety policies have been reviewed and changes made to make cruise travel safer. To find out what changes passengers can see aboard ship, CNN.com interviewed Cruise Critic editor-in-chief Carolyn Spencer Brown, a veteran of more than 200 cruises. Spencer Brown has sailed with all of the world's top cruise lines and many lesser-known lines. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity: . How has the cruise industry changed in the wake of the Costa Concordia disaster? The primary change, and the most important change, that we've seen in the wake of the tragic capsizing of Costa Concordia is a renewed commitment to safety on a global level. It's not that cruising was unsafe before. But the idea that something this disastrous actually did happen has made the cruise industry determined never to suffer a repeat. The other big change? This accident was sobering for cruise travelers, many of whom in the past might have tried to skip the muster drill or chat away during the safety instructions. Cruise Critic readers understand, better than before, that while the cruise lines are responsible for safety, they too have a role to play in cruising safely. Post-Concordia, I've been to 14 muster drills -- on a variety of ships and cruise lines -- and have noticed that people take them much, much more seriously now. They listen. And on one ship passengers even asked questions. I have never seen that before! What changes do passengers see? The most important change, and the first improvement to come out of the tragedy, was a new muster rule. Before, cruise ships could hold the muster, also known as the safety drill, up until 24 hours after sailing (though to be honest, most did do musters before the ship left port). Now, the drills must be completed before sailing. This is important because several hundred passengers who'd boarded Costa Concordia the day it ran aground had not yet attended a muster -- and so didn't have the information on what to do in case of an emergency when they needed it most. Is cruising safer now than before the Concordia incident on January 13, 2012? Absolutely. There have been 10 initiatives put into place by the industry since the accident that address a range of issues, from limiting bridge access to carrying significantly more life jackets than needed to standardizing, to some extent, the muster drill. What should passengers do when they board a ship -- and when they're at sea? First and foremost, they need to listen to the ship's crew members. From officers to bartenders and from spa massage therapists to kids' club counselors, every one of them is required to undergo consistent training via numerous drills, covering issues like evacuation, serious health emergencies and fire. If you've ever stayed onboard while a ship's in port, you've probably heard the drills being conducted over the loudspeaker. So it's crucial that passengers know they should follow directions issued by crew. Also, when passengers first start their cruise, they may not feel like hearing about safety instructions when there's a holiday waiting to start, but they need to focus and listen at the muster drill. Beyond that? Relax and have a good time. How should passengers go about choosing a safe ship? Is there a Good Housekeeping-type seal of approval from various associations or travel agents? There isn't one specific place to go for information. At the end of 2012, all of the disparate cruise industry policy- and marketing-related organizations all over the world banded together to issue global safety recommendations and ultimately merged into one cohesive organization under the umbrella of the Cruise Lines International Association. CLIA has been actively working with the cruise industry and safety regulators to come up with a series of new regulations and guidelines, all in response to the tragic Costa Concordia event. Separate from CLIA are government bodies in the U.S. like the CDC, which operates the Vessel Sanitation Program, and the U.S. Coast Guard, which oversees safety inspections and ensures compliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Travelers can reference CDC reports by visiting the CDC website, and we also have a quick reference guide on Cruise Critic.  Coast Guard incident reports can be found on the U.S. Coast Guard website. How can passengers stay healthy aboard ship? Our top tip for staying healthy on board is always to wash your hands frequently, as you would anywhere where there are a large number of people interacting with one another. In addition to hand washing, also be sure to take advantage of hand sanitizer stations throughout the ship. For travelers who know they are susceptible to seasickness or worry that they may be, they should come prepared with ginger candies, acupressure wristbands or over-the-counter medicines like Dramamine. It's also important to answer health forms honestly prior to boarding the ship. If a passenger shares that they've been feeling ill prior to debarkation, the cruise line can take the appropriate precautions to ensure that the illness is not spread to other passengers -- a benefit to the sick passenger, as well as their fellow passengers.","January 13 marks one year since the Costa Concordia wrecked off the coast of Italy .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen abducted a South Korean trade official in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, South Korea's semiofficial Yonhap News Agency reported Monday, in the latest violent incident highlighting the turmoil in the North African country. Quoting South Korean officials, Yonhap said four unidentified, armed men abducted Han Seok-woo, 39, when he was heading home from work in the coastal city on Sunday. Han is the head of the Libya unit of the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. The gunmen stopped Han's car, took him and drove westward, Yonhap quoted a South Korean foreign ministry official as saying. It said there had been no word from the kidnappers yet. Their identities and the reason for the abduction were unknown. Han is understood to be unharmed so far, Yonhap reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified South Korean government official. South Korea's foreign ministry, which has launched an emergency task force to deal with the abduction, issued a warning against traveling to Libya. It asked the 551 South Korean nationals living in the North African country to leave. Libya's government and fragile state security forces are struggling to impose law and order in a country awash with weapons left over from the 2011 war that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Militias, former rebel fighters and militants have refused to lay down their arms and often resort to force to impose their demands on the weak central authorities. This month, gunmen shot dead Libya's deputy industry minister in the first assassination of a transitional government official since Gadhafi's ouster in October 2011.","South Korean taken from his car in Tripoli, Yonhap News Agency reports .

"(CNN) -- It was one of the worst passenger ship disasters since the sinking of the Titanic a century ago. On January 13, the Costa Concordia was sailing a few hundred meters off the rocky Tuscan coastline of the island of Giglio. The ship, nearly the length of three football fields, rammed into a bed of rocks around 9:45 p.m. Within minutes, the massive vessel began to tilt, as water rushed into the engine rooms through a gash some 50 meters long. The crippled ship, without power or propulsion, drifted onward a few miles before turning toward the small harbor on the island and coming to rest on rocks nearby. Thirty-two people from eight countries -- both crew and passengers -- died. Many more barely escaped in the hours after the Concordia came to rest on its side, tilting ever closer to the sea. Countless survivors told CNN the same story -- they had received little or no safety training after boarding the ship, whether in Barcelona several days earlier or at a port near Rome just hours before the disaster. International guidelines at the time recommended a safety drill within 24 hours of embarkation, but the disaster came well before that period had elapsed for the 600 who stepped on board in Rome. Multiple passengers who spoke to CNN and other media said they didn't know where to gather during the emergency. The common refrain: It was chaos, every passenger for him or herself. Some said that when they asked crew members for help, they got blank stares. Covering a cruise ship disaster . Nearly six months later, lessons learned that night have brought changes to safety and evacuation procedures in the cruise industry. Carnival, the parent line of Costa, and several other cruise lines now require safety instruction, referred to as muster drills, before leaving port. The new muster policy consists of 12 specific emergency instructions, which include providing information on when and how to don a life jacket, where to muster and what to expect if there is an evacuation of the ship. Last year, nearly 16 million cruise bookings were made worldwide. About three-quarters of them were from the United States, according to the industry group Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 26 cruise lines, including the world's largest, Carnival and Royal Caribbean. But the Concordia disaster cast a shadow on a rapidly expanding industry that maintains it is one of the safest modes of transportation. It has also focused attention on how some international cruise companies operate, registering their ships in countries where there may be weak regulations or where international rules are poorly enforced, but at the same time headquartering their companies in the United States and Europe. At a U.S. Senate hearing in the aftermath of the Concordia disaster, there was tough questioning about the practice. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, one of the strongest voices at the congressional hearing, spoke to CNN about the cruise lines. ""They just know how to work the system and they work it very well and always to their advantage,"" he said. Rockefeller and other critics of the industry say that cruise lines that are headquartered in the United States but have their ships registered elsewhere are getting a free ride on the backs of U.S. taxpayers, placing demands on federal agencies such as Immigration, Customs and the Coast Guard, which are charged with oversight when those ships enter and leave U.S. ports. ""They don't reimburse the Coast Guard, they don't pay taxes that will help with these 20 federal agencies that are watching over them in various ways and whose services they use, or might use,"" Rockefeller told CNN. In the five years before 2010, Carnival, the company that owns Costa, paid 1.1% tax on $11.3 billion in profits. Leading U.S.-based companies like Carnival often register their ships in foreign countries under what the industry calls ""flags of convenience."" For example, Carnival registers the majority of its ships in Panama and is incorporated there. Its headquarters is in the United States. Despite repeated requests, Carnival did not grant CNN an interview. However, Bud Darr, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association, the industry group that represents Carnival and other major cruise lines, told CNN, ""There's a variety of components that go into that decision [about where to register a ship] and it's individualized to a ship's owner. It's individualized across maritime sectors."" Budd added, ""Are there some fees and taxation considerations that go into that? Certainly."" The International Transport Workers Federation, which represents mariners around the world, is highly critical of ""foreign flagging,"" saying on its website, ""Cheap registration fees, low or no taxes and freedom to employ cheap labor are the motivating factors behind a ship owner's decision to 'flag out.'"" However, the Cruise Lines International Association maintains its members pay plenty of port and other fees in the United States. ""We pay a wide array of fees, duties and we pay all of the taxes we are required to pay,"" Darr told CNN. Rockefeller said that while more regulation of the industry is needed, achieving that will be difficult because of the industry's lobbying in Washington. According to Darr, the Cruise Lines International Association spent nearly $10 million on lobbying between 2004 and 2011. The International Maritime Organization, which is tasked with the international supervision of passenger ships, has also been under fire in the wake of the disaster. Under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, known as SOLAS, there are many mandated standards for ship operators, but critics -- including U.S. lawmakers -- point to the fact that there are also many codes, guidelines and recommendations that are voluntary. Additionally, there are no unified standards for reporting incidents at sea. The International Maritime Organization does keep records of incidents reported voluntarily by ship operators, but does not maintain a public database of that information. The International Maritime Organization has promised to address the issues raised by critics once the Italian authorities' accident report is published. So far, its Maritime Safety Committee, which met five months after the sinking of the Costa Concordia, has issued only voluntary guidance. That new guidance includes the introduction of onboard stability computers, new free-fall lifeboats and the establishment of appropriate minimum levels for staffing qualified mariners on board each passenger ship. Bloggers and industry observers, meanwhile, have tried to fill any gaps left by the International Maritime Organization by archiving incidents, relying on information from media reports and passengers. Ross Klein, a Newfoundland professor, has written four books on the cruise industry and maintains a database online. At the congressional hearings in March, he told the Senate committee there were more than a dozen incidents of passenger ships sinking and 99 ships running aground between 1973 and 2011. Klein also testified that 79 ships experienced fires between 1990 and 2011. Even so, given the rapid expansion of the industry, the number of fatalities has been low. And cruising remains popular. The industry is now worth $25 billion a year. Most of its customers are Americans, with 13 million U.S. bookings in 2011. The industry also is tapping into new markets, especially in Asia. In the spring, a few months after the Concordia disaster, Costa released a statement that said bookings were robust. Meanwhile, the Cruise Lines International Association maintains the industry is committed to ensuring the safety of passengers. But industry insiders and regulators say another serious accident could do irreparable damage to the cruise lines' reputation -- and reinforce existing calls for more rigorous international regulation.","Lessons learned in Concordia disaster have brought changes to cruise industry safety .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- A boat's horn bellowed 32 times off the coast of Italy on Sunday, honoring each of the victims who died a year ago when a luxury cruise liner ran aground. Family members of those who perished tossed wreaths, lilies and notes into icy waters at a ceremony marking the anniversary of the Costa Concordia crash. And a large boulder bearing a plaque with victims' names was lowered into the same sea that claimed their lives. The somber memorial was a sharp contrast to the chaos of a year ago, when the massive ship ran aground with 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members on board. According to passengers' accounts, pandemonium erupted as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard; remaining members seemed helpless to handle the melee. The night of the accident, many survivors sought shelter in churches and other buildings on the tiny Tuscan island of Giglio. At one of the churches on Sunday, many survivors and family members of victims gathered for a two-hour Mass to remember the victims and honor divers and rescue workers. ""I came to pray for my colleagues and the passengers who lost their lives,"" said Santosh Velhal, a Costa Concordia crew member from Mumbai who worked in the ship's security department. The children of Gerald and Barbara Heil -- an American couple from Minnesota who died in the accident -- were also among those who traveled to Italy for Sunday's ceremony. The day's events also included the dedication of a plaque with the victims' names on a wall in Giglio's harbor and a violin concert held in a local church. At 9:45 p.m., the exact one-year anniversary of the moment of impact, survivors planned to light 32 lanterns -- one for each of the victims. Meanwhile, the Costa Concordia, now a half-submerged carcass, still sits in the harbor where it ran aground. Hundreds of people are working 24-7 to secure it, but salvage efforts are taking longer than expected. Officials now hope to have the ship upright by late June or early July and to tow it to some port by September. During Sunday's ceremony, the skies were overcast and a fierce wind blew. The seas were rough, and the waves washed up against the wreckage and salvage barges with such force that crews had to reinforce their equipment. ""Thank God the weather wasn't like this last year,"" Karin Fogazzi told reporters as she stared at the wreckage. The weather was more temperate last year, when she and her husband Roberto escaped the ship carrying their 10-month-old son Daniel down a rope ladder. The family came on Sunday to mark the occasion, she said, and to try to help deal with the post-traumatic stress disorder they've been battling over the past year. The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, could face charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship. Other crew members and Concordia executives also could face trial. Schettino has said that managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area. In an interview with Italy's ""Domenica In"" television show on Sunday, Schettino blamed the ship's helmsman for misunderstanding orders to avoid the rocks. The captain said he'd felt pain over the victims' deaths every day for the past year. The day was a somber reminder of the lives lost in the shipwreck, but it was also important for the 900 residents of Giglio to commemorate an event that changed their island forever. ""This is not a celebration,"" Mayor Sergio Ortelli said. ""This year has been dramatic for the people of this island who have had their whole lives turned upside down by this event. We hope our island returns to a place of tranquility once the steel monster out there is towed away."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: In a television interview, the ship's captain says he was not responsible for the wreck .

"(CNN) -- The Tunisian presidency announced on Sunday it would extend the country's state of emergency through June, the official Tunisian news agency TAP reported. This is the second time the North African country's presidency extended the state of emergency this year. Protests in Tunisia against rising unemployment rates, poverty levels, inflation and government repression in late 2010 and early 2011 were the beginning of and inspiration for the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring is the popular name used to describe the wave of protests across the Arabic-speaking world in recent years against autocratic regimes. Demonstrations led to the ouster of the country's leader, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in early 2011. There have been longstanding political tensions since. In October 2012, the once-banned moderate Islamist party Ennahda won Tunisia's elections. The winning party formed Tunisia's Islamist-led government.","Tunisia was the inspiration for the Arab Spring .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Twice-convicted killer Warren Lee Hill was granted final-hour stays of execution on Tuesday, his attorney said. The stays came from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Georgia Court of Appeals. ""I think we were within about a half hour of the execution,"" said Brian Kammer, an attorney for Hill, whose supporters say is mentally disabled. The Georgia Court of Appeals acted on a appeal of a challenge to the way the prison handles the lethal injection drugs used in executions, while the federal appeals court issued a stay ""ordering a further briefing on the issue of mental retardation,"" Kammer said. Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution, as did the state Supreme Court, while the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles similarly denied a request for clemency. Listen: Asking for mercy in the end . The execution had been scheduled for 7 p.m. ET at a state prison in Jackson, about 45 miles south of Atlanta. Hill was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of Joseph Handspike, another inmate in a Georgia state prison. He was convicted of beating Handspike to death with a nail-studded board while serving a life sentence in the 1985 killing of his girlfriend, Myra Wright. His lawyers have argued that Hill's IQ of 70 means he should be spared under a 2002 decision that barred the execution of the mentally disabled. But a string of state courts has said Hill doesn't qualify under Georgia law, which requires inmates to prove mental impairment ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""This is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation. Even Warren Hill, a man with an IQ of 70 who is diagnosed as mentally retarded by every doctor who has examined him, found it impossible to meet this standard of proof,"" Kammer said. Handspike's family has called for the execution to be called off. The Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities also weighed in against the execution, stating, ""No other state risks the lives of those with developmental disabilities to this extreme."" Three doctors who examined Hill for the state ""have now revised their opinions and find that Mr. Hill does meet the criteria for mental retardation,"" his lawyers argued in court papers. But lawyers for the state have said that Hill served in the Navy, held a job and managed his money before Wright's killing -- signs that he didn't necessarily meet the legal standard for retardation, even though he has a low IQ. Hill had previously been scheduled for execution in July, but the state Supreme Court halted the execution on procedural grounds. Georgia has executed 52 men since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1973, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections. There are currently 94 men and one woman under death sentence in the state.

"(CNN) -- The sobbing woman pleads for help in a 911 call. ""There's a guy breaking in my front door,"" she says. The dispatcher repeats: ""There's a guy breaking in your front door?"" The caller comes back quickly: ""He's trying to kick it down."" She cries as she tells the dispatcher that the man is yelling. She describes what he's wearing -- a green shirt and khakis or jeans. As she anxiously awaits police, she repeatedly asks, ""Oh my God, are they almost here?"" The frantic 911 call, released by authorities Tuesday, brought officers to the North Carolina home on Saturday. Minutes later, 12 bullets from one officer's gun flew toward the 24-year-old unarmed man outside, who authorities now believe had been looking for help after a car accident. Police say the officer hit him 10 times. Now Jonathon Ferrell is dead. And Randall Kerrick, the police officer who shot him, faces a felony charge of voluntary manslaughter. The release of the 911 tape Tuesday is the latest twist in a case that has drawn national attention and calls from some activists to charge the police officer with murder. Police have said Kerrick and two other officers responded to what they believed was a ""breaking and entering"" call. When they got to the scene, police say, a man matching the 911 caller's description ran toward them. Attorney for man's family: Killing was cold-blooded . Attorney Chris Chestnut says that's when something went terribly wrong. And he says Ferrell's family members watched a police video on Monday that shows it. Chestnut says the video, filmed from the dashboard of one of the police cruisers on scene, shows a clearly unarmed Ferrell moving forward toward police with his hands out, then panicking as two laser beams hit the center of his chest. ""Then he gets excited, and he's like -- 'wait, wait, wait' -- and he's coming forward saying, 'stop,' and he goes off camera, and you just hear shots. One, two, three, four...pause...one, two, three, four, five, six...pause. One, two."" Police declined CNN's request to review the dash-cam video, saying it was sealed as part of the ongoing investigation into the shooting. They have said one of the officers fired his stun gun as Ferrell came toward them. When that was ""unsuccessful,"" police said, another officer opened fire. Now police say Kerrick used excessive force and had no cause to shoot Ferrell. ""Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter,"" police said in a statement Monday. They've charged Kerrick with voluntary manslaughter, a felony. He was released Sunday on $50,000 bond. But Chestnut, who watched the video with Ferrell's family in a meeting with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police chief on Monday, said there's only one way to interpret it. ""Cold blooded,"" he said. ""Badge or no badge, that's murder."" Attorney for officer: His actions were justified . Michael Green, a defense attorney representing Kerrick, declined to comment on evidence in the case. ""We're not going to make any general statements about the evidence at this time, as the case is still pending. We're going to allow this case to be tried in a court of law,"" he said. ""However, we're confident that the resolution of this case will be found that Officer Kerrick's actions were justified on the night in question."" In a statement to investigators regarding the shooting, Kerrick said he suffered injuries and was assaulted. A probable cause hearing has been set for October 7. At a news conference Monday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe said the department's hearts go out to Ferrell's family and to members of the police force. ""This is never something easy,"" he said. The police department said in a written statement Monday that the shooting ""has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization. ""However we must always strive to bring forth all facts and evidence in every case to determine when it is appropriate to place criminal charges against a member of the department,"" the news released added.

"(CNN) -- When Zac Vawter put his mind to climbing the 103 floors of Chicago's iconic Willis Tower, his legs did the rest. Even the one that isn't human. The Seattle resident scaled the skyscraper's stairway heights on Sunday thanks to what the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago calls the ""world's first neural-controlled bionic leg."" In other words, when Vawter thinks about going somewhere, it sends a signal to his prosthetic right leg that spurs it to move. This kind of technology has been implemented before in arms and fingers, but never before in a leg. While Vawter, 31, has been part of the Illinois rehab center's trial for about a year, this weekend's fourth annual SkyRise Chicago fundraiser was the first public test of the technology. There was no guarantee he'd successfully climb the entire skyscraper formerly known as the Sears Tower, but he'd certainly give it a shot. Yet there he was -- 53 minutes, 9 seconds after he set off -- in the tower's SkyDeck Chicago, and seemingly on top of the world. 'Bionic blonde' uses triathlon to take control . ""It was a good goal for the team to shoot for, and we hit it,"" he said immediately afterward. This perch was a far cry from where Vawter found himself three years earlier, in a hospital room after his leg was amputated following a motorcycle accident. He'd long been a runner, competing for St. Martin's University in Lacey, Washington, in races like the 800, 3,000 and 5,000 meters as well as in cross-country events. And now, all of a sudden, he was a patient with just one leg. But Vawter took a positive turn when he teamed up with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, which U.S. News and World Report ranks as the nation's top rehab hospital. He became a willing human guinea pig for researchers testing the one-of-a-kind prosthetic. In an interview with CNN affiliate WLS prior to Sunday's climb, Vawter called the new leg ""a dramatic improvement over my normal prosthetic."" ""It's something exciting and fun, and I hope that we push the boundaries of what the research and the leg is capable of,"" he said. Levi Hargrove, from the Chicago rehab center, told WLS that ""really advanced hardware"" makes the device work. ""We record all of the data on the computer, and then teach this small microcomputer what it looks like"" as the leg moves, Hargrove adds. Vawter was met with cheers as he entered the skyscraper's front door on Sunday morning, then again after he trekked up the final steps. He had plenty of company and fellow inspiration as he went skyward, as one of about 3,000 people making the climb and raising roughly $1 million for the rehab center. Among them was U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, who has worked tirelessly with the Rehabilitation Institute since suffering a stroke last January. In his first public appearance since then, he climbed 37 flights in about an hour. ""However bad it looks, if you or a loved one has suffered a debilitating stroke, you could be climbing the tower one day with us,"" Kirk said afterward, in comments provided by RIC. ""Don't give up!"" That is Vawter's mindset as well. He's happy to help the cause, and to move forward in his own life with his new prosthetic's help. ""It feels awesome,"" he said of the leg.","A collegiate runner, Zac Vawter had his right leg amputated after a motorcycle accident .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- A bill that places new restrictions on abortion passed the Texas Senate on Friday after days of debate that galvanized activists nationwide. It was the second attempt by the measure's supporters to pass the bill in the Senate -- it originally failed to gain approval because of a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis. The Senate voted 19 to 11 to approve the restrictions. Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who supports the new abortion laws, called the state Legislature back into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill, which passed the Texas House on Wednesday. The measure bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandates abortion clinics become ambulatory surgical centers, tightens usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing such services. Opinion: It's the real Texans who count . Critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas -- denying access to many in rural communities -- and force women to seek dangerous back-alley abortions. The Republican legislators who support it say the bill isn't about banning abortions, but rather about protecting women's health. The special session was marked by loud protests and high-profile voices from both sides of the abortion debate. Taking a swipe at former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, who came to Austin to support the bill, Democratic Sen. Kirk Watson made a final appeal to the Republicans to vote no, asking them to: ""Take this chance to stop, take this chance to think, take this chance to stop listening to the partisans and failed presidential candidates."" Cowboy Rick Perry will ride again - in 2016 . However, for supporters of the bill such as Sen. Jane Nelson, the bill's measures are long overdue. ""There is a clear choice in this vote tonight,"" she said. ""Do we keep the lax standards, do we forgo safeguards, do we ignore the evidence that at 20 weeks we have a child who can feel? Or do we choose life?"" The roars of the crowd in the rotunda were audible throughout the Senate debate and at one point, abortion rights protesters disrupted the proceedings in the Senate gallery. One protester, singing quietly to the chamber, chained herself to a railing in the gallery and brought the session to a brief halt. The bill makes its way to Perry, who will sign it into law. ""Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life,"" Perry said after the bill's passage. ""This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women's health. I am proud of our lawmakers and citizens who tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable Texans and future Texans."" Planned Parenthood, a leading reproductive health provider, decried the passage and called on voters to throw out the politicians who voted for it. ""If you are angry about what happened in Texas tonight -- and what's happening in other states all around the country -- there is something you can do about it,"" spokeswoman Dawn Laguens said. ""Register to vote, and vote for candidates who will protect women's access to health care."" Read more: North Carolina House passes restrictive abortion bill .

"(CNN) -- There's no such thing as an off-duty cop. At least if it's Justin Rogers, there's not. The police corporal from Pinole, California, was just capping off a family vacation in Hawaii. He was going through security at the Honolulu airport last Saturday, when he felt compelled to spring into action to stop a rowdy security breach. He had just taken his shoes off to go through the body scanner when he heard a ""loud crash"" off to his side, he told CNN affiliate KTVU. ""When I turned around, I saw a woman with her arms flailing, screaming at this TSA agent."" He turned back around, thinking security officers would handle the ruckus. They didn't at first. The disturbance turned into fisticuffs, TSA surveillance camera video revealed. The woman, who was trying to force her way through the security section for flight personnel, lit into the female TSA agent who was blocking her path. ""The next thing I know, I heard what I thought was skin to skin contact, like somebody getting punched,"" Rogers said. ""Sure enough, she was punching her."" Time for action . He saw that the agent's colleagues were far away from her, so he thought he'd better help out. He bounded over a waist-high security barrier and with a quick swoop and a professional takedown separated the assailant from the agent and immobilized her on the floor. Other TSA agents came running. In comfy shorts, T-shirt and ankle socks, Rogers didn't look much like an officer of the law. ""I was in relaxed mode."" His wallet and presumably his ID had already gone through the X-ray machine. But his immobilization posture over the suspect looked professional, and he quickly told agents who he was. ""I held up my hand and said, 'I'm a police officer; I'm a police officer,' because I was worried maybe they'd think I was assaulting somebody."" They believed him. In fact, TSA later issued a statement lauding Rogers for his ""swift actions"" in ""immediately"" subduing the individual and preventing the TSA officer from being hurt any more. An airport policeman pulled out a pair of cuffs, and Rogers helped him secure the suspect's wrists. The woman was arrested and charged with assault, CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now reported. She was homeless and had been wandering the airport. ""That was pretty much the end of story,"" Rogers said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Marine Corps knew of the threat posed by roadside bombs before the start of the Iraq war, yet did nothing to buy protective vehicles for troops, according to a report to be released by the Pentagon. Marines' armored Humvees are parked at a miltary camp in Fallujah, Iraq, in May 2007. Additionally, Marine leaders in 2005 decided to buy up-armored, or reinforced, Humvees instead of Mine Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles to shield troops in Iraq from mines and other explosives -- a decision that could have cost lives, according to the report obtained Tuesday by CNN. The report by the Department of Defense inspector general was requested by the Marine Corps in early 2008 after a civilian employee with the service complained that bureaucratic delays undermined the program to develop the armored vehicles. Inspectors found that the decision not to buy MRAP vehicles in 2005 stopped the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, the agency in charge of finding the best protective vehicle from troops in Iraq, from ""developing a course of action ... to attempt to obtain funding for [MRAPs],"" according to the report. The report found that the Department of Defense knew before the war started in 2003 of the threats of mines and roadside bombs in Iraq but did nothing to acquire ""MRAP-type"" vehicles ahead of the invasion. ""As a result, the department entered into operations in Iraq without having taken available steps to acquire technology to mitigate the known mine and IED risk to soldiers and Marines,"" the report said. In response to the report, Marine Corps spokesman Maj. David Nevers pointed out the inspector general found no ""evidence of criminal negligence"" in the Corps' actions. The decision to buy the up-armored Humvee model, he said, was made ""consciously by the Marine Corps leadership because of its proven capability to protect and its tactical utility; the survivability and mobility demanded by the Marines in theater; and its availability, based on an active, responsive production line."" ""The Marine Corps fully cooperated with [inspector general] during this audit,"" Nevers said. ""We are reviewing the report to ensure that our processes best support the war fighter in theater."" A civilian whistle-blower working with the Marine Corps on the MRAP program wrote a scathing report about delays in the procurement process in early 2008. ""If the mass procurement and fielding of MRAPs had begun in 2005 in response to the known and acknowledged threats at that time, as the USMC is doing today, hundreds of deaths and injuries could have been prevented,"" Franz Gayl wrote in his January report. He said bureaucratic delays plagued the program at the height of the insurgency, when U.S. troops were regularly being attacked and killed by roadside bombs. Gayl's report prompted the Marine Corps to request the inspector general's audit in 2008. The Gayl report drew attention just months after MRAPs had been pushed into Iraq by Defense Secretary Robert Gates in an effort to protect troops from roadside bombs -- the leading killer of troops at the time.","Report: Buying reinforced Humvees, not MRAPs, possibly cost lives .

"(CNN) -- Hanny van Arkel was poring over photos of galaxies on the Internet in August 2007 when she stumbled across a strange object in the night sky: a bright, gaseous mass with a gaping hole in its middle. Hanny van Arkel made her discovery by poring over images of galaxies on an astronomy Web site. ""It looked a bit like an irregular galaxy, but I wasn't sure what it was,"" Van Arkel said. So she posted a query on the Web site of the Galaxy Zoo project, which encourages members of the public to join in astronomy research online. Van Arkel is a 25-year-old schoolteacher in Heerlen, The Netherlands, not an astrophysicist. But her startling find -- a mysterious and unique object some observers are calling a ""cosmic ghost"" -- has captivated astronomers and even caught the attention of the people who run the Hubble Space Telescope, who have agreed to take a closer look next year. ""This discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the Internet world,"" said Bill Keel, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Alabama and a Galaxy Zoo team member. ""There was a time when I spoke pejoratively of armchair astronomers. And I've gotten up at a star party and publicly apologized for that."" Not so long ago, the term ""amateur astronomer"" conjured images of stargazers peering through backyard telescopes. But today's are as likely to be analyzing reams of sophisticated data collected by observatories and posted on space-related Web sites. Armchair observers like van Arkel increasingly are making significant contributions to science, said Steve Maran, spokesman for the American Astronomical Society, a group of 6,500 professionals. Amateurs have been invited to present papers at recent AAS conferences, ""which wouldn't have happened years ago,"" he said. A successful example of amateur-professional collaboration, the Galaxy Zoo project was launched last year by Yale University astrophysicist Kevin Schawinski and Chris Lintott at the University of Oxford in England. The pair were looking for help in cataloging archived photographs of galaxies -- one million images -- taken by the robotic Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope in remote southern New Mexico. Knowing that the human eye is sometimes more sensitive than a computer at picking out unusual patterns -- and that they didn't have time to do all the work themselves -- Schawinski and Lintott posted the images on the Galaxy Zoo Web site last summer. The professors then invited amateur astronomers, with the help of a brief online tutorial, to classify the galaxies as spiral, elliptical or something else. Online galaxy-sorting might not sound as fun as, say, surfing YouTube, but it was an immediate hit. ""We were overwhelmed by the response. It completely melted the server,"" Schawinski said. ""People tell us it's addictive. Some of [the volunteers] are professional astronomers, but most of them are not. They're just regular people who got excited about the project."" During the past year, more than 150,000 armchair astronomers from all over the world volunteered their time, submitting more than 50 million classifications. The public's collective wisdom -- the same principle that guides jury trials or Wikipedia -- proved remarkably astute, Schawinski said. For example, if 33 of 36 volunteers thought a galaxy appeared elliptical, then astronomers could be confident the classification was correct, he said. Van Arkel had been classifying photos on Galaxy Zoo for about a week when she came across the image that quickly became known as ""Hanny's Voorwerp,"" Dutch for ""object."" The primary school teacher does not own a telescope -- ""my [astronomy] background doesn't really go further than looking at the stars when walking outside in the evening,"" she said -- but when she posted her finding August 13 on the Galaxy Zoo forum, the astronomers who run the site began to investigate. They soon realized van Arkel might have found a new class of astronomical object. The Galaxy Zoo team asked scientists working at telescopes around the world to take a look at the mysterious Voorwerp. Their best guess: The Voorwerp is probably a cloud of hot gas punctured by a central hole 16,000 light years across and illuminated by the ""dying embers"" of a nearby quasar, Schawinski said. Quasars are distant, highly luminous astronomical objects powered by black holes; scientists suspect that light from the quasar still illuminates the Voorwerp even though the quasar itself burned out in the past 100,000 years. ""It's this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe,"" said Lintott, the Oxford scientist. ""It's rather like examining the scene of a crime where, although we can't see them, we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows."" Galaxy Zoo leaders are eagerly awaiting images from NASA's orbiting Hubble, which is scheduled to train its powerful instruments on the Voorwerp in 2009. In the meantime, van Arkel is enjoying the fuss over her contribution to astronomy. ""It's amazing to think that ... amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online,"" she said. ""What excites me the most is that all of this leads to more interest in science.""","Using the Web, a Dutch schoolteacher has discovered a strange astronomical object .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A federal judge sentenced an Illinois man to two and a half years in prison Monday for taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude. The taping took place through a hotel-room peephole, and the video was posted on the Internet. Michael David Barrett, 49, pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in December after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of Andrews while she was nude. According to a plea deal, prosecutors and Barrett had agreed to a 27-month prison sentence. But Andrews called him a sexual predator and  argued in court for him to be sentenced for as long as the law allowed, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. ""I would have liked longer time, but I know that the judge obviously did the best he could with the parameters that are set,"" Andrews told reporters outside the courthouse after the sentencing. ""But I'm glad he'll be away from anyone that he could harm for the next 30 months."" In court papers, prosecutors stated that Barrett -- an insurance company employee from Westmont, Illinois -- posted as many as 10 videos of Andrews to the Internet. Also in court papers, prosecutors said Barrett had posted videos of another 16 as-yet-unidentified victims to the Internet. Barrett has been free on bail and has been ordered to report to prison May 3, said Tom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. In a statement issued through his attorney when the plea agreement was announced, Barrett expressed ""deep regret"" to Andrews ""for his conduct that caused her so much pain."" Authorities believe that most of the videos were made at a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, in September 2008. The peephole into Andrews' room was altered with a hacksaw, and the images appeared to have been taken with a cell phone camera, according to the charges against Barrett. Andrews travels across the country covering college football games for ESPN. According to charges prosecutors filed against Barrett in October, she said that she became aware of the videos in July and that their posting caused her distress, anxiety and trouble sleeping. Barrett came under scrutiny after attempting to sell the videos to the celebrity gossip site TMZ in January 2009. TMZ did not purchase the images, but employees of the Web site assisted in the investigation by providing information to Andrews' attorneys, authorities said. TMZ, like CNN, is a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. CNN's Lynn Lamanivong contributed to this report.","Michael David Barrett, 49, was sentenced to prison Monday .

"(CNN) -- Asafa Powell, the last man to hold the 100m world record prior to his compatriot Usain Bolt, admitted to a Jamaican disciplinary hearing on Tuesday that he had a hazy knowledge of the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned products . The 31-year-old was testifying to the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) after testing positive for the prohibited stimulant oxilofrone during last June's national championships. The oxilofrone is said to have come from a supplement called Epiphany D1, which Powell said he had been taking on the recommendation of his physical therapist Christopher Xuereb. ""I don't know the list but I knew of the list,"" Powell said at the hearing in the Jamaican capital Kingston. ""I know there is a list we are supposed to check."" When asked whether he was acquainted with the rules of doping control, the once fastest man on the planet wistfully replied: ""I am now."" Powell, whose 100m world record mark of 9.74 seconds was beaten by Bolt in 2008, also said that he failed to list all the supplements he was taking during the Jamaican trials because he could not recall the relevant names. ""All the supplements were new to me, so I could not remember all of them,"" he explained, adding that he started taking them roughly a month before the Jamaican championships began on June 20. Among the absentees from the list was Epiphany D1. ""I could not remember after all the excitement at the trials,"" the Jamaican said. Powell also told the hearing that he doubled the dosage of his supplements on the morning of his positive drugs test, saying he had been told by Xuereb to take two capsules of Epiphany D1 each morning for seven days before doubling the dosage the following week. ""I didn't remember to do that,"" said Powell, whose hearing is expected to last at least two days. ""Chris (Xuereb) came to my room the morning of the trials and said I must remember to take four."" Powell says he was advised to take the supplements after Xuereb, who the sprinter described as a good friend, told him he should be using them ahead of his early morning training. Prior to that, the Jamaican had regularly trained without consuming anything - not even breakfast, he explained. Powell's hearing before a three-member panel comes after his training partner Sherone Simpson, a three-time Olympic medalist, was also forced to explain her positive test for the same stimulant. Like Powell, she denies knowingly taking the banned stimulant and her case earlier this month was adjourned until February 4. The athletes have been provisionally suspended since their failed tests, with both missing out on last year's World Championships in Moscow. A total of five Jamaican athletes failed drugs tests at the national championships in June, prompting the entire JADCO board to resign five months later -- with criticism over a lack of testing by the body's former executive director Renee Anne Shirley ringing in their ears. The hearing will resume on Wednesday, with agent Paul Doyle - who represents both Powell and Simpson - set to testify.","Former 100m world record holder testifies about failed test to Jamaican doping commission .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Mickey was sure of several things. She knew she was going to marry Jon Balajthy. She knew she wanted to be a nurse. And she knew she and Balajthy were seriously overweight. Mickey, 22, and Balajthy, 23, met in middle school band class. She played the clarinet, he the tenor saxophone. ""He got pretty overweight in the fourth grade, and I got chubby in the seventh,"" Mickey recalled. But the real weight gain began after high school. The couple started a long-distance relationship when Mickey went to Lock Haven University in their home state of Pennsylvania and Balajthy attended the University of Maryland. ""It sucked,"" Mickey said. ""I was lonely in college, and I missed him. So there was a lot of emotional eating."" Having a college meal plan also didn't help. Mickey feasted on buffet-style meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. ""It was very much a serve-yourself pasta bar, make-your-own pizza dining hall, and breakfasts were always make-your-own waffles, topped off with everything terrible."" At his campus, Balajthy also developed bad eating habits such as finishing off a box of Entenmann's pastries in one sitting. He periodically ate calorie-dense dishes such as his favorite meal: pasta with vodka sauce. ""I was on track to some serious health issues,"" Balajthy said. ""First, being heavy takes a toll on your body. My back always hurt, and I couldn't do much because I was always hurting. It doesn't take much to get diabetes and heart disease."" From freshman year to the end of college, Mickey's pant size stretched from a size 12 to 18, her largest fit. At graduation, she weighed 235 pounds, standing at 5 feet 7 inches; Balajthy was 325 pounds at 5 feet 8 inches. The couple got a place together shortly after graduation. They didn't fully acknowledge how big they had gotten, but their families started giving them subtle hints to lose weight. ""Weight is a touchy subject to address,"" Mickey said. ""Jon's mom sent him a care package with an exercise ball in it. She didn't tell me to lose weight because I am not her daughter, but I know she wanted me to be healthy."" Once Mickey enrolled in nursing school at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, she couldn't ignore their weight any longer, especially after learning about diabetes, heart disease and obesity the first semester. She practiced measuring blood pressure at home and tested Balajthy, only to discover he had hypertension. That's when the eating out, snack foods and indulgent meals stopped, and the couple of eight years seriously looked into getting fit. Mickey dumped all the calorie-rich food in their kitchen in a trash bag. ""I threw out the full-fat ice cream, chips, cookies, just everything in the house. Even the old Halloween candy,"" she said. Deciding to work out together, the two went jogging for one mile around a lake near their home. ""We were so out of shape at first that we usually had to walk around it,"" Mickey recalled. But the exhaustion only inspired them to stick with their goals. They enrolled at Planet Fitness, a gym near home. For the first three months, all they did was cardio, exercising on machines such as the elliptical and treadmill for half an hour. They also started calorie counting. In the first month, Mickey dropped 10 pounds -- an instant boost of confidence. ""I never tried to run or go to the gym until we started losing weight together,"" she said. Balajthy agreed. ""It's amazing how easy it was after we started. I realized I liked going to the gym, and there was never a time that I thought, 'I'm having a miserable time.' "" Within three months, the duo had lost enough weight to make a big impression at a family reunion in Pennsylvania. Some relatives hadn't seen them since college graduation. ""We didn't tell anyone that we started to work out,"" Mickey said. ""So the reactions were intense and funny because we saw our family with 50 pounds less on us."" For the first time, Mickey dared to wear a bikini. ""Even when I was little I had to wear tankinis,"" she said. Now people called her the ""ever-shrinking woman."" After eight months, Mickey and Balajthy are down to 145 and 195 pounds, respectively. Their workouts have changed, too; they do 30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of weight training four to five times a week. They're working on toning up and being active, which means fitness doesn't stop at the gym. Balajthy bikes to the University of Maryland, where he is a doctoral candidate in physics. The couple take their dog on runs or play tennis in the evenings. On the weekends, they go on hiking trips, excursions Mickey always dreamed of doing when she was heavier. Now they're hiking 20 miles while carrying 40-pound packs. Staying active has been a plus for Balajthy, who said he's always been a boredom eater. ""I would watch TV with a bag of chips and finish it off."" There are no chips at home anymore. Besides counting calories, the pair started cooking more. Their dinners usually consist of skinless chicken breasts or fish with a veggie side such as broccoli or green beans and a salad. ""We even use yogurt dressing and don't have a lot of carbohydrates for dinner,"" Mickey said. ""Jon's mother used to serve dinner rolls, but we don't eat bread and butter anymore because there are a million little things you can do to keep the weight off."" They enjoy eating out though and occasionally treat themselves to Thai, a favorite for Balajthy. In the end, the couple said there were no hidden secrets to losing weight. ""If you just go outside and do little things, like exercise and eating healthy, it works,"" Mickey said. But they said the key was working out together. ""Working out with Caroline has kept me on track. I wasn't driven to lose weight and didn't think I could,"" Balajthy said. Now they are happy with their weight, Mickey said she is looking forward to trying on wedding dresses and starting their life together as a married couple. Have you lost weight?

"A South Carolina judge has ordered the state attorney general's office to stop pursuing criminal charges against Craigslist.com while a lawsuit related to prostitution ads on the popular classifieds site makes its way through the courts. South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster has threatened criminal action against Craigslist. In statements to the media and on his Web site, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster has accused Craigslist's operators of not doing enough to eliminate ads soliciting prostitution in accordance with an agreement struck last November with 40 states attorney generals. Earlier this month, McMaster sent a letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster accusing the site of failing to ""install sufficient safeguards"" to prevent it from being used ""as a vehicle to advertise or solicit prostitution."" McMaster set a deadline of 5 p.m.May 15 to permanently remove portions of the site ""allowing for the solicitation of prostitution and the dissemination and posting of graphic pornographic material"" or face criminal prosecution. In response, Craigslist filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking to prevent McMaster and his employees from charging the site with crimes related to the ads, claiming that to do so violates Craigslist's First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. The site also alleges that McMaster's threats of prosecution violate the Communications Decency Act, which states that no ""provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" On Friday, Judge Weston Houck granted Craigslist's request for a temporary restraining order preventing McMaster and his employees from ""initiating or pursuing and prosecution against craigslist or its officers and employees in relation to content posted by third parties on Craigslist's Web site"" until the court rules on the merits of the site's lawsuit. Craigslist's lawsuit cites an interview McMaster gave to Fox News on Monday, in which he likened the site ""to a hotel or motel owner that knows prostitution is going on on their premises and fails to do anything about it especially after having been told."" The lawsuit contends that, because the site relies on posters for content, McMaster's threats leave Craigslist with no choice other than to shut down its South Carolina section or face criminal prosecution. Craigslist's says that since November, the San Francisco, California-based company has undertaken significant good faith measures to cut back on prostitution-related ads, accounting for an 80 percent reduction in ads in its erotic services subcategory in U.S. cities. Some of the measures included asking posters for credit card number and telephone verification, implementing keyword filtering, and shuttering the erotic services section altogether, the Web site claims. In its place, the site established an adult section, where, in addition to the previous measures employed, the ads are also manually reviewed to ensure compliance with the site's Terms of Use, resulting in just 40 ads in the section as of May 18, the lawsuit claims. ""The defensive legal action Craigslist has taken against the solicitors and my office is good news. It shows that Craigslist is taking the matter seriously for the first time,"" McMaster said in a post on his Web site on May 20, the day the lawsuit was filed. ""Unfortunately, we had to inform them of possible state criminal violations concerning their past practices to produce a serious response. We trust they will now adhere to the higher standards they have promised.""","Judge orders AG to refrain from pressing charges pending lawsuit's outcome .

"(CNN) -- The Bachelor sounds like a bigot. According to TheTVPage.com, Juan Pablo Galavis -- the former Venezuelan soccer player, who is now romancing 27 young ladies on ABC's hit reality show, ""The Bachelor"" -- has some strong opinions about gays. In response to a question at a network party, on Friday Galavis told the website's editor, Sean Daly that he didn't think it would be good for the show to feature a bachelor who was gay or bisexual. The conversation was recorded. The problem isn't what he said about the show. He has an opinion, and he's entitled to it. The problem is what comes next: Where he explains his reasons for feeling this way. He starts off by saying, ""I don't think it is a good example for kids to watch that on TV."" A good example for kids? Has Galavis ever watched the show he's on? You have 27 young ladies backstabbing and preening and scheming to get close to a bachelor and get a red rose, and, they hope -- an engagement ring. Along the way, they proclaim that they've fallen madly in love with and want to spend the rest of their lives with this person they've known for all of 45 minutes, when what they want most is to beat out the other women and win the contest. Is this a good example for kids? To be fair, in his apology, which Galavis posted later on his Facebook page, he noted: ""The show is very racy as it is and I don't let my 5-year-old daughter watch it."" But in his conversation with Daly, Galavis' comments about gays got worse. He went on: . ""Obviously people have their husband and wife and kids and that is how we are brought up. Now there is fathers having kids and all that, and it is hard for me to understand that too in the sense of a household having peoples. ... Two parents sleeping in the same bed and the kid going into bed. ... It is confusing."" Finally, Galavis said, ""there's this thing about gay people ... it seems to me, and I don't know if I'm mistaken or not ... but they're more 'pervert' in a sense. And to me the show would be too strong ... too hard to watch."" Ick! This is too hard to listen to. What's more ""pervert"" -- romancing and smooth-talking a couple dozen women, in and out of hot tubs, or a loving and monogamous same-sex relationship? According to TVGuide.com, ABC said this in a statement: . ""Juan Pablo's comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show's producers or studio."" And here is some added irony. The first openly anti-gay ""Bachelor"" also happens to be the first Latino ""Bachelor."" What a shocker. Those of us who are part of this community know all too well that it is still infected with too much homophobia. It's hypocritical for anyone in a group that is forever insisting that the rest of society not only tolerate but celebrate that which makes them different (i.e., culture and language) would then attack another group for being different. Finally, Galavis' statement of contrition Saturday on Facebook also left something to be desired. He said this: . ""I want to apologize to all the people I may have offended because of my comments on having a Gay or Bisexual Bachelor. The comment was taken out of context. If you listen to the entire interview, there's nothing but respect for Gay people and their families. I have many gay friends and one of my closest friends who's like a brother has been a constant in my life especially during the past 5 months. The word pervert was not what I meant to say and I am very sorry about it. Everyone knows English is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as it is in Spanish and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself. What I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept. ... Once again, I'm sorry for how my words were taken. I would never disrespect anyone."" Sure, compadre. In the end what else is there to do but play the ""I-don't-speak-English-so-good"" card? Dear ABC: My English is good. So, as a U.S.-born Latino, let me be clear: This guy doesn't represent me, or reflect what I believe or what I'm about. Having him on your network isn't going to make me any more likely to tune in or buy stuff I don't need from advertisers. It just makes me embarrassed. By the way, if one of my three kids turns out to be gay, I'd love them and accept them all the same. On the other hand, if any of them ever goes on this dreadful show of yours, they are out of the will. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette says new Latino 'Bachelor' made anti-gay comments in interview .

"(CNN) -- The bizarre case of a North Korea-bound ship being seized and searched following a violent struggle on the Panama Canal sounds like a deleted scene from the Cold War. But officials fearing some sort of modern-day Cuban Missile Crisis could only have been relieved to find out that what Cuba describes as an assortment of antique Soviet weapons discovered aboard the ship -- buried under 255,000 sacks of brown sugar -- are more suited to a Cold War museum than they are to being used as weapons in the 21st century. The ship, which is still being searched by Panamanian officials, contained 240 tons of Russian-made defensive weapons including two anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles in parts and spares and two MiG-21 jets, according to Cuban officials. Panama hasn't yet detailed what has been seized. LATEST: Panama finds arms on N. Korean ship . Cuba says the weapons, which were en route to North Korea for repairs, are ""obsolete."" And experts who identified early Cold War relics like the Soviet-designed SA-2 air defense system among the ship's cargo say that's not far from the truth. ""We are talking about really old stuff -- that technology was designed in the 1940s and 50s,"" said James O'Halloran, editor of Jane's Land Based Air Defence and Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems. ""Very few countries still employ the SA-2 system as a frontline defensive weapon."" The SA-2, which consists of a single radar-guided missile mounted on a launcher, was developed years before the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1960 and was used by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, long before the advent of heat-seeking or satellite-guided missiles. Men sitting in radar trucks on the ground had to guide the rockets toward their targets. O'Halloran says the tactic, if you were an American pilot in Vietnam, was to ""watch this damn great thing coming toward you and at the last minute pull a heavy right or left, and the missile couldn't follow you, it just kept going."" ""Today there is no reason for any Western pilot to be hit by an SA-2 -- if you get caught by one of them, you've done something bloody stupid, or you've got very bad luck. No modern country wants to be seen with those."" But North Korea and Cuba, isolated communist allies and trading partners since the Cold War, aren't modern countries, to say the least -- and after years of sanctions and embargoes there are few places (and even less cash) at their disposal to obtain new weapons, according to experts. U.N.: North Korea continues banned weapons trade . ""If you buy a new weapons system, you also have to buy the hardware and the training, which can take a year or more if you buy some of the more modern air defense systems that the Russians sell,"" said Mike Elleman, Senior Fellow for Regional Security Cooperation at IISS. ""And the Cubans don't have the money."" Even if Cuba had the money, countries like Russia would be reluctant to sell the Castro regime advanced weapons systems for fear of infuriating the Americans. And even if Cuba obtained newer weapons, Elleman says the U.S. would still overwhelm them in short order. What's left for countries like Cuba is to seek repairs on systems like the SA-2, which went out of commission decades ago, and the MiG-21 jet, which was last produced in 1985 and is now mostly kept by long-time Russian allies for spare parts, according to O'Halloran at Jane's. As Panamanian authorities continue to search the Chong Chon Gang -- a freighter with its own checkered past -- they are asking the U.S. and United Kingdom to send teams to help them identify the weapons, and will invite a special commission from the United Nations to determine whether the shipment violates the organization's North Korea weapons ban. In the meantime, experts don't expect the episode will have a lasting effect diplomatically on either country -- North Korea is already ""sanctioned to the hilt,"" says Ellemann, and Cuba's relations with the U.S. are thawing after decades of tension. ""There are a good number of people who believe that the sanctions against Cuba are very outdated and that it's just a matter of time before they're lifted, and I don't see this changing that,"" Ellemann told CNN. The more lasting impression of the raid on ship could, in the end, be the 10,000 tons of brown sugar found on-board the ship. The crew attempted to sabotage the Chong Chon Gang by cutting the cables on its cargo cranes, meaning Panamanian authorities have had to remove the 255,000 bags of sugar by hand. Experts believe the sugar could be Cuban payment to cash-strapped North Korea in exchange for the weapons repairs. ""This will be much ado about nothing, except telling the world just how bad a shape Cuba and North Korea are in today -- bartering early Cold War materials for sugar, that speaks volumes,"" said Ellemann.","Panamanian authorities raid North Korean ship, find Cuban weapons .

"Kampong Speu, Cambodia (CNN) -- Two people died after a raised concrete walkway collapsed Thursday at a shoe factory warehouse in Cambodia, police said. Six other people were injured by the fallen walkway in a warehouse adjoining the factory, which is south of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, said National Police Spokesman Kirt Chantharith. More people could still be buried in the rubble, he said, but he added that it doesn't appear that dozens of people are trapped. Police are investigating the cause of the collapse. The deaths at the Cambodian facility come as safety conditions in the garment industry in Asia are under scrutiny following the devastating collapse of a nine-story building housing textile factories in Bangladesh last month. That disaster killed 1,127 people. At the scene of Thursday's accident at the Wing Star Shoe Co. factory, rescue workers hauled away chunks of concrete from the wreckage. Shoes made by the Japanese sports apparel company Asics were in evidence at the factory. Asics confirmed that its products were made there but said it was still trying to gather all the facts about the collapse. The company said it was sorry to hear about the loss of life in the accident. One of the people killed was a 22-year-old man named Reom Saroun, said his uncle, Reom Rorn. Eight members of the family all worked at the factory, Reom Rorn said. They live in the village where it is situated. He said had never occurred to him that such an accident could happen at the facility. ""But now I am concerned that it will happen again,"" he said. Nonetheless, he and other family members plan to return to work. ""It's a job,"" he said, noting that the part of the factory where he works doesn't have the upper level that collapsed in the warehouse and killed his nephew.

"Paris (CNN) -- The former chief of the International Monetary Fund who resigned after being charged two years ago with sexually assaulting a maid in a New York city hotel has lashed out at his treatment by police -- particularly his forced participation in ""the perp walk."" ""I think it's a terrible thing, frankly,"" Dominique Strauss-Kahn told CNN's Richard Quest in his first English- language television interview since he resigned as head of the IMF in 2011. ""The problem is, it's a moment where in all European, American society you're supposed to be innocent, you're supposed to be innocent until you're convicted."" The economist had been widely expected to become France's Socialist presidential candidate -- until his professional career imploded with his May 2011 arrest. Dominique Strauss-Kahn: Fast Facts . A New York hotel housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, told police that Strauss-Kahn emerged naked from a room in his luxury hotel suite as she was cleaning it and tried to force himself on her, dragging her into the bathroom and trying to remove her underwear. Strauss-Kahn's arraignment was televised and clips played on U.S. and international networks. ""Perp walks,"" in which defendants -- accompanied by police -- walk in front of photographers handcuffed, are standard fare in America. Underscoring the cultural differences between France and the United States, many French recoiled from images of Strauss-Kahn being paraded before the news media in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under French law to protect the presumption of innocence. ""The perp walk takes place at the moment where you (are) supposed to be innocent,"" said Strauss-Kahn, who calls himself DSK. ""You're just shown to everybody as if you were a criminal, at a moment where nobody knows if it's true or not -- maybe you're a criminal, maybe you're not. That's going to be proved later on, and so it is just unfair to put people in that way in front of the rest of the world when you just don't know what they have done."" Strauss-Kahn said he was angry at his treatment because he did not understand why he had been placed in custody. ""I was just understanding that something was going on that I didn't control,"" he said. Despite his insistence that the encounter was consensual, Strauss-Kahn stepped down from his $500,000 job at the IMF. Forensic evidence showed that a sexual encounter had occurred and a grand jury indicted him on seven counts, including sexual abuse and attempted rape, but prosecutors dropped the charges after concluding Diallo had lied about some details of the alleged attack. Diallo then sued Strauss-Kahn in civil court. The two sides settled late last year, though the details have not been disclosed. Strauss-Kahn: A reputation battered by sex allegations . Last October, a French prosecutor dropped an investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to a possible gang rape in Washington. The Belgian woman whose testimony was the basis for the inquiry withdrew a previous statement and said she would not press charges, leaving the investigation with no grounds to continue, officials said. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape in 2003 against a French writer, Tristane Banon. But prosecutors said the statute of limitations had passed and the case could not be pursued. The former IMF chief denied the allegations and has since filed a countersuit in France, alleging slander.","""I think it's a terrible thing, frankly,"" the former IMF chief tells CNN .

"San Diego, California (CNN)  -- The Christmas Day attempted attack by would-be ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab provoked the U.S. government to plan to spend $1 billion for full body scanners and other bomb-detecting devices at airports. That's a substantial cost, and it doesn't include the extra wait time passengers will spend in security lines, or the distasteful invasiveness of the scanners. Is the extra security worth it? Much of the cost of the horrendous attacks on 9/11 was indirect and, in a sense, self-inflicted. Adam Rose of the Department of Homeland Security's Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events at the University of Southern California directed a careful study. One of its most striking findings was that the standard economic costs of the 9/11 attacks, estimated at $25 billion, were exceeded by the costs of behavioral reactions far from the site of the attack. More specifically, the U.S. economy lost an additional $85 billion or so because Americans chose not to fly. The decrease in demand for air travel, and thus use of hotels and other tourism costs,  lasted for almost two years, triggering airline bankruptcies and eventually forcing the U.S. government to bail out airlines. A full accounting of the damage would include the losses at tourist destinations in other countries, lost vacations and lost visits with family and friends. So $85 billion is probably an underestimation. Those ""self-inflicted"" costs amounted to about three-quarters of a percent of U.S. GDP, the difference between a quick recovery and a prolonged recession. They were mostly because of what we now know was misplaced fear about the terrorism risk associated with air travel. Flying was actually much safer than the dissuaded passengers thought. In retrospect, nobody made themselves safer by not flying, since there was no successful second attack over the two years of low demand. The one attempted attack, by shoe bomber Richard Reid in December 2001, was easily foiled by passengers and crew members. The lesson here is clear. It is not enough for the Obama administration to make air travel safe, it must also control the tendency of the public to exaggerate the risk of terrorism. To put that risk in perspective: Traffic accidents in the U.S. annually account for about 150 times as many avoidable deaths as there were passengers on Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam. Avoidable deaths due to tobacco use and unhealthy diets annually account for 3,000 times as many. Yet the traveling public requires constant reassurance. Full body scanners are a very visible means of protection that help convince travelers that the danger is small. The public's exaggerated perception of the risk in flying provides terrorist organizations with disproportionate political leverage. This is a mechanism that terrorists exploit. Overreacting to fear over an extremely improbable, albeit horrific, event can severely amplify the damage. Keeping the true level of danger in perspective is therefore an important component of counterterrorism, especially in an economically critical sector such as air travel. An expensive defensive response is thus economically justifiable, even if it seems excessive and intrusive. President Obama was criticized in the press for not responding more forcefully to an egregious attempted attack carried out against civilians on a national holiday. Instead he seemed to focus on the security lapse and how to improve security coordination. That may not have been the populist choice -- it would have been far more satisfying to hear the president lash out at al Qaeda. Yet his measured response did seem to reassure the traveling public about the true risk associated with air travel: The AMEX index of airline stocks, which fell by 40.3 percent in September 2001, dropped by only 1.7 percent the day after Christmas, and had recovered completely by the first week in January, as had the stock of the airline itself. It must have been awfully disappointing for AbdulMutallab's handlers back in Yemen to see how American travelers brushed off the threat. The administration's handling of the Christmas attack may get a C in populist politics, but it gets an A in the economics of counterterrorism. Bring on the scanners. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eli Berman and Lindsay Heger.","Authors: U.S. economy lost $85 billion after 9/11 because Americans chose not to fly .
Berman, Heger: Fears of air travel are exaggerated, giving terrorists leverage .

"(CNN) -- The former Massachusetts state chemist who has admitted to wrongdoing during her nine-year employment with the Department of Public Health also misled her employers when applying for the job, the department said. Annie Dookhan, who lied and said she had a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts, was hired in 2003 as a Chemist I and was reclassified as a Chemist II in 2005, the health department said. ""While neither of the positions she held required a master's degree, it is now clear that she intentionally misled the department about her education during the course of her employment,"" the statement said. Massachusetts authorities will review of 1,140 people who are serving prison sentences after being convicted with evidence at least partly provided by Dookhan, whose work with criminal evidence is under investigation, according to the attorney appointed by the Massachusetts governor to lead the Department of Public Health drug lab review. Chemist in Boston lab scandal handled 50,000 drug samples . Dookhan has admitted to wrongdoing, but Gov. Deval Patick's office said it cannot reveal any more details about her confession during the ongoing investigation. She faces possible criminal charges pending an investigation by the Attorney General's Office. A preliminary investigation looked into every case Dookhan may have touched from 2003 until she left in March, Terrel Harris, communications director for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, said Tuesday. It is possible she touched 60,000 samples that were involved in 34,000 drug cases. State Police and the Attorney General's office are working together to investigate each case Dookhan was involved with during her nine years with the state lab, said Kim Haberlin, the governor's press secretary. Patrick appointed David Meier, a defense attorney and former prosecutor, to run the ""central office,"" which is a clearinghouse for all the information connected to the 34,000 cases touched by Dookhan, Haberlin said Tuesday. Meier will collect the information to give to prosecutors and defense attorneys involved with each case. ""That's not to say their convictions were improper or wrong,"" Haberlin said. On Monday, Meier presented a list of 690 people serving sentences in state prisons and 450 who are imprisoned in county jails whose trials were potentially tainted by the mishandling of drug evidence. According to a letter from Meier to Worcester County District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr., 22 of those individuals may also be facing deportation or related immigration proceedings as a result of the outcome of their trial. David Traub, spokesperson for the Norfolk District Attorney, compared the Massachusetts judicial system to a computer destroyed by a virus. In many cases, the drug charges were clustered with others. Each case will have to be deconstructed and sentences will have to be redefined according to the results of the investigation for those in prison first, and then those who have already served their time, he said. ""The layers of mess cannot be overstated."" The Norfolk District Attorney's Office supports those incarcerated who are trying to get out on bail until the investigation is finished, he said. ""We don't get to argue that someone should stay in jail if the evidence is tainted against them."" Those who are in jail on other charges, such as gun possession, will not be let out, though, he said. State police were tipped off in July by Dookhan's co-workers at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory in Jamaica Plain that Dookhan's work might be unreliable, Harris said. At the time, state police were taking over what had previously been a Department of Public Health drug laboratory, which certified random drug tests for the police departments in Norfolk, Suffolk, Middlesex and Bristol counties, as well as for Cape Cod and the islands. The takeover was part of the Fiscal Year 2013 budget. ""When they were getting ready to take over the lab, they learned through conversations with other employees who were afraid to verify the work of their colleague,"" Harris said. Dookhan was no longer an employee of the laboratory at the time, having left in March. Patrick ordered the lab to be shut on August 30 after the extent of Dookhan's mishandlings were realized, a representative from his office said. Dr. Linda Han, director of the Bureau of Laboratory Sciences, resigned as a result of the investigation, while Julie Nassif, director of the analytical chemistry division, was fired. Dookhan's immediate supervisor, who has not been identified, faces disciplinary proceedings, and the governor's office said it is seeking termination there as well.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis is being painted as a humble and simple man, but his past is tinged with controversy surrounding topics as sensitive as gay marriage and political atrocities. Questions linger about Francis' actions during the nation's dark days: the so-called Dirty War, when Argentina was ruled by dictators. The gay marriage issue came to the forefront during Francis' political fight with Argentina's president. The conservative pontiff may hold firm on some issues, experts say, but he may be flexible on others. ""If you think that (Francis) isn't going to change anything, you're wrong,"" said Gustavo Girard, a retired doctor who knew Francis during his early years in the priesthood. ""But is he going to approve of gay marriage tomorrow? No."" Five things to know about the new pope . Don't be surprised, Girard said, if the new pope shows flexibility on contraceptives, but don't expect him to budge on the Catholic Church's opposition to abortion. There's been no shortage of praise for Francis as a passionate preacher and pragmatic man who prefers public transportation to private cars. It goes to his reputation as an independent thinker. But look deeper into Francis' history to see a more complicated man who's been formed by the times he's lived in. Dark times . Possibly the darkest period during Francis' rise to power took place when he served as the nation's top Jesuit. In 1976, during Argentina's dictatorship, the navy kidnapped priests Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics. Some have accused Francis, then provincial superior for the Society of Jesus, of not doing enough to assert his influence and free them. They were found five months later. The incident led to rumors and allegations that Francis was complicit in the dictatorship's appalling atrocity -- that he didn't do enough to expose it and perhaps was even partly responsible for the priests' prolonged detention, said Jim Nicholson, a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See. Although the allegations against Francis have never been proved, they continue to haunt him, so much so that the human rights group Center for Legal and Social Studies in Argentina opposes Francis' selection as pope. Situations relating to the priests' kidnappings ""have not been clarified,"" said the group's director, Gaston Chillier. Many of the allegations against Francis were researched by Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky, who wrote a book about the church's role during the dictatorship. In a 2010 column, Verbitsky alleged that Francis had lied under oath during an investigation into the theft of babies from prisoners during the dictatorship. Francis testified that he never knew about the baby-stealing until after the dictatorship had fallen, Verbitsky wrote, but a victim Verbitsky interviewed claims that Francis knew about it at the time. She said she had written to Francis about it. Nicholson said there's no evidence to support the allegations. From public transport to Popemobile: Bergoglio's journey to top of the church . The Vatican pushed back Friday against the accusations. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, dismissed the claims as false and defamatory. ""The campaign against (Jorge Mario) Bergoglio is well known and goes back to many years ago. It was promoted by a defamatory publication,"" Lombardi said at a Vatican news conference, using the name that Francis used before he became pope. Argentine judicial authorities questioned Bergoglio once, but nothing was imputed against him, Lombardi said, adding that Bergoglio denied the allegations against him. ""His role is well noted on how he promoted reconciliation in Argentina,"" he said. The fight . Then there's the fight between the archbishop and the president. In 2010, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner led a battle to pass a bill to legalize gay marriage. Francis, then archbishop of Buenos Aires, put himself right in the middle of the fight, calling the proposed legislation ""a destructive attack on God's plan."" With a front-page counterpunch, the president said the church possessed ""attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the Inquisition."" The bill eventually became law, and Francis left the battlefield defeated. But some supporters hold it up as evidence of his traditionalist views. Perhaps it's no surprise Kirchner gave Francis a rather dry congratulations after his election, said Rosendo Fraga, an Argentine political analyst. The president failed to even mention that Francis is the first pope from Argentina or the Western Hemisphere, a signal that her government may feel at odds with the church. First Latin American pope 'very exciting,' faithful say . Was it a snub? Fraga said Francis ""was a critic of corruption, of social inequality, drugs, human trafficking, which in reality wasn't an agenda of confrontation, but that the government perceived as an agenda of confrontation."" Girard, the retired doctor who knew Francis during his early years in the priesthood, interpreted the war of words differently. Francis was not lashing out at just the bill but at what he saw as a larger effort by the government to divide the country along political lines. This is why the cardinals selected him, Girard said: Francis doesn't fit into a mold. ""They can be progressive or conservative,"" he said. ""But they're not dumb."" CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","NEW: Vatican says claims about Pope Francis during dictatorship are false, defamatory .
Francis has a long record as a church leader .
He is lauded by many as a humble man .
Others question his role during Argentina's dictatorship ."
"(CNN) -- Who's afraid of Grover Norquist? Fewer and fewer Republicans, thankfully. In recent days, the declarations of independence from Norquist's absolutist anti-tax pledge have been coming fast and furious. Add Southern Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Lindsey Graham to the growing list, along with Reps. Peter King, Steve LaTourette and Scott Rigell. Chambliss kicked off the most recent outbreak of common sense by telling a Georgia TV station, ""I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge."" He added, ""If we do it (Norquist's) way, then we'll continue in debt."" On ABC's ""This Week,"" Graham doubled down by saying, ""I agree with Grover, we shouldn't raise rates, but I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we can't cap deductions and buy down debt. ... I will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country, only if Democrats will do entitlement reform."" King agreed with Chambliss on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" saying, ""A pledge you signed 20 years ago, 18 years ago, is for that Congress. ... For instance, if I were in Congress in 1941, I would have signed a declaration of war against Japan. I'm not going to attack Japan today. The world has changed, and the economic situation is different."" And on CNN last weekend, LaTourette and Rigell told Ali Velshi that they thought the straitjacket pledge was an impediment to dealing with the deficit and the debt. This post-election outbreak of pragmatism is welcome and needed. These senators and congressmen are profiles in courage for speaking out against the stranglehold that one self-appointed activist and lobbyist has had on bipartisan governing. Norquist, who leads the conservative activist group Americans for Tax Reform, is both a colorful character and committed ideologue, infamous for sound bites like this: ""I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub."" The signature item for Americans for Tax Reform is a pledge that commits signers to oppose any tax increases at all, for all time -- not just tax rate increases, but any increases in tax revenue. News: Graham says he'd break no-tax 'pledge' This distinction makes a real difference in the current deficit and debt deal negotiations. Going back to the Bowles-Simpson Commission, the obvious common ground for negotiations has been for Democrats to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reform and Republicans to compromise on increased tax revenue. This can be done -- as the Bowles-Simpson Commission demonstrated -- by potentially even lowering some tax rates but closing loopholes to raise revenue. This is what's known as a win-win. The biggest stumbling block for tea party conservatives has been Norquist, who says any new revenue violates the pledge and promises to invite a primary challenge to any member of Congress who puts revenues on the table. Given the number of safe seats carved up in the rigged system of redistricting, a primary challenge from the wings is what most members of Congress fear most. The result is gridlock: an inability to reason together and make a long-term deal for the good of the country. It is an ironic problem in some ways: Tea party congressmen rose to power on a promise to deal with deficits and debt. Putting anti-tax absolutism ahead of that goal may play well with special interests, but it undercuts the ability to govern in the national interest. That's what is at stake. These pronouncements from Chambliss, Graham & Co. put them in the company of party leaders like John Boehner, John McCain and Jeb Bush, who have publicly dismissed the pledge as a distraction from the business of governing. ""I ran for office three times,"" said Bush, who is already being discussed as a 2016 candidate. ""The pledge was presented to me three times. I never signed the pledge. I cut taxes every year I was governor. I don't believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people."" This pragmatic statement in the summer of 2012 helped break the fever of groupthink. Norquist called Bush's comments an ""insult."" In July in an opinion column in the New York Times, respected fiscal conservative Sen. Tom Coburn put Norquist's pledge in perspective: ""What unifies Republicans is not Mr. Norquist's tortured definition of tax purity but the idea of a Reagan- or Kennedy-style tax reform that lowers rates and broadens the tax base by getting rid of loopholes and deductions."" Coburn's refusal to pay an oath of fealty to the pledge resulted in a sniping war by Norquist. Most recently, Norquist displayed his distorted perspective by tweeting: ""Barney Frank, Alger Hiss or Tom Coburn? who said this? 'I'm all for the very wealthy paying more taxes' "" Comparing Coburn to Hiss -- a convicted traitor and KGB agent -- was both ugly and revealing: This is what happens when partisan politics starts to look like a cult. The real fault line for Republicans is between Norquist-style radicals and Ronald Reagan, who presided over the bipartisan 1986 tax simplification deal by closing loopholes to raise revenues. As Reagan said at the time, ""We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share."" In addition, the ""sainted"" Reagan oversaw some 11 tax increases during his administration. To be sure, his overall goal was to slash rates and simplify the system -- but he was not nearly as absolutist as his activist acolytes who do not have to deal with actually governing. Norquist's hold on the GOP has been loosening as congressional leaders recognize that this extreme, unelected activist is helping to hold a balanced bipartisan deal hostage. The election is over. The time for hatred, ideological obstruction and overheated rhetoric has passed. Reasonable Republicans and Democrats need to take on their respective special interests to get a long-term deficit and debt deal done. It's foolish to be afraid of Norquist. The only pledge members of Congress should take is the Pledge of Allegiance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: A growing number of lawmakers are breaking with Grover Norquist's tax pledge .
He says they won't to pay fealty to anti-tax activist; he hems them in on dealing with debt .
He says if Dems are to deal on entitlements and GOP on raising tax revenue, pledge has to go .

"(CNN) -- Mrs. Obama is on the cover of People Magazine this week. Not to tout her new education initiative or lament the country's wage gap, but because she's 50. Don't get me wrong. I'm happy that Mrs. Obama is able to celebrate her special day with loved ones, but articles about women turning the big 5-0 often get under my skin. And not in a good way. Including this one. People not only asked Mrs. Obama if she had ""peaked at 50,"" but whether she would consider plastic surgery or Botox. The magazine also touched on how the extremely buff Mrs. Obama would change her exercise routine in light of her advancing age. Seriously? I don't recall anyone asking Mr. Obama, when he turned 50, whether he'd consider ""fillers"" to plump his thin cheeks or quit playing basketball. Honestly, I never think about being 50 until I read articles either informing me ""I can still be sexy at 50 if I do a little something, something, ..."" or ""become a proud cougar and date a younger man.""

Janet Roach, one of the ""Housewives,"" is pictured beside a hunky, younger man. The article reads, ""The blonde bombshell is remarkably youthful for her 55 years, and that may be well to a little help from the surgeon's knife."" I'm happy Janet is living her life the way she chooses, but I can't help but think of that Molly Shannon's Sally O'Malley character on Saturday Night Live when I look at her. Remember her? Sally wore tight, high-waisted pants and carried a leopard handbag. She took every opportunity to ""strut her stuff,"" proclaiming, ""My name is Sally O'Malley. I'm proud to say I'm 50 years old. I'm one of those gals who likes to tell her real age. And I like to kick! Stretch! And kick! I'm 50. Fifty years old!"" Funny, how attractive women spend their 20s trying to be taken seriously, only to wish not to be taken seriously when they hit 50. I'll end my rant by saying happy birthday, Mrs. Obama. And thank you for answering People's Botox question like this: ""Women should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two former New York Police Department detectives were sentenced to life in prison without parole Friday for operating as Mafia hit men while employed by the NYPD. Louis Eppolito, 60, and Stephen Caracappa, 67, who spent a combined 44 years on the force and once worked as partners, were found guilty in April 2006 of engaging in racketeering. According to prosecutors, they were paid $4,000 a month by the Mafia and were personally paid $65,000 by Luchese crime family underboss Anthony ""Gaspipe"" Casso for killing another mobster during a phony traffic stop. Authorities said Casso regarded the officers as his ""crystal ball,"" likely referring to their alleged involvement in relaying classified information to the Luchese family. Eppolito and Caracappa, who reiterated their innocence at Friday's sentencing, were found guilty of participating in or aiding eight murders, two attempted murders and one murder conspiracy, as well as witness tampering, witness retaliation, obstruction of justice, money laundering and drug charges. Eppolito was sentenced to life in prison plus 100 years, while Caracappa received life in prison plus 80 years. They were also fined a combined $4 million. ""The sentences imposed today bring some measure of closure for the families of the victims of these defendants' unspeakable crimes and for the citizens of the city whose trust these men betrayed,"" U.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell said in a news release. ""We are gratified that the defendants will spend the rest of their lives behind bars."" Eppolito, who grew up in a Mafia family, wrote the book ""Mafia Cop,"" in which he described how he turned away from the ""family business"" to become what he said was one of the police department's most decorated officers. He also had small roles in several films, including the role of Fat Andy in the 1990 mob film ""Goodfellas.""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi officials on Tuesday released security camera video of two weekend bombings that killed at least 155 people -- the deadliest attacks in the capital in more than two years. One video shows cars traveling around a traffic circle on Haifa Street in central Baghdad Sunday morning before a huge blast in front of the Justice Ministry. The impact shakes the camera and its view is obscured by clouds of smoke. Another camera shows the dozens of charred cars covered in debris from the other blast, as two fires burn nearby. Baghdad Gov. Salah Abdul Razzaq showed the videos at a news conference held under a blown-out ceiling at the second bombed building. He also announced that the Baghdad provincial council on Tuesday voted for the resignation of the interior minister and the Baghdad commander -- the two men in charge of Iraqi security forces in the capital. Razzaq said the attacks killed 155 people and wounded more than 500. Other officials had put the death toll at 160. The deaths include 20 children, two Interior Ministry officials said Tuesday. They said an earlier report that said 30 children packed on a minibus were among those killed was based on an erroneous police account. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group for al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement released Tuesday. The authenticity of the claim could not be immediately verified, but it appeared on a Web site frequently used by the group. Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abdul Aziz said he believes al Qaeda in Iraqwas behind the attack. ""In my personal estimate or assessment, what I can tell you, I can see the imprint of al Qaeda, which is the enemy of Iraq and the enemy of all humanity,"" Aziz said through a translator Tuesday. The Islamic State of Iraq also claimed responsibility for nearly identical truck bombings that struck the Foreign and Finance ministries on August 19, killing at least 100 and wounding hundreds more. One of the bombs Sunday exploded outside Baghdad's governorate building, the other outside the Justice Ministry. The bombs detonated in quick succession about 10:30 a.m., officials said. See photos from the deadly explosions . Plumes of smoke billowed from the sites as victims fled, some with blood streaming down their faces. The streets were strewed with debris, including charred cars and chunks of concrete. Other government buildings in the area were heavily damaged. The blasts sparked questions about Iraq's security and national elections planned for January. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who visited the scene shortly after the explosions, said holding the elections as scheduled would send a strong message to the attackers. ""The cowardly attack ... should not affect the determination of the Iraqi people from continuing their battle against the deposed regime and the gangs of criminal Baath party, and the terrorist al Qaeda organization,'"" al-Maliki said in a written statement. U.S. President Barack Obama called the attacks an attempt to derail progress in Iraq, and pledged to work closely with the country as it prepares for elections. Obama spoke with the prime minister and President Jalal Talabani to express his condolences and reiterate U.S. support. The August attacks led to tightened security in Baghdad, including the addition of blast walls and security checkpoints. Two years earlier, three truck bombings killed hundreds in Qahtaniya, in northern Iraq. Sunday's attacks were the deadliest on Iraqi civilians since those blasts in August 2007. Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls in January, but passage of an election law is needed first. Late Monday, Iraqi leaders reached tentative agreement on a draft of such a law. U.S. and Iraqi government officials say the election is a vital step in Iraqi efforts to solidify a democratic system in the post-Saddam Hussein era.

"(CNN) -- The trains that crashed on the Washington Metro depended on a 33-year-old automated control system widely used in cities across the United States, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Investigators work at the site where a D.C. Metro train crashed into the rear of another train. But public transit officials say a crash like the one in Washington is unlikely to happen in other cities that rely on a similar automated system, including Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Miami, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia. San Francisco, California's Bay Area Rapid Transit is the only other rail system that uses as much automation as Washington's, association officials said. Transit officials across the country are reassuring passengers who use the subway and light-rail systems in other major cities that the computerized system is safe and is less prone to human error. ""Public transportation is one of the safest ways to travel and what happened in Washington is rare,"" said Virginia Miller, a spokeswoman at the American Public Transportation Association. Investigators still don't know the cause of Monday's deadly Washington crash, but National Transportation Safety Board officials are looking into why the computerized emergency system failed to prevent the accident. About 5 p.m. Monday, two trains crashed on the packed Red Line near Tacoma Park, Maryland. The accident, the deadliest crash in the Metro's 33-year history, killed nine and injured at least 76 others. Washington's rapid transit system, known as the Metro, is the second-busiest urban rail system in the country following the New York City Transit's subway system, according to the transportation association. Both trains in the Metro crash were being operated on automatic mode, which meant the computerized system was supposed to determine if conditions on the track were safe for travel. Metro trains are operated on automatic mode during rush hour. The Washington Metro has used the automated system since its inception in 1976. Similar automated systems have existed in rapid-rail systems in various cities across the United States and abroad for more than 30 years. The idea of an automated train control system hasn't changed much, but the hardware and technology in the control rooms have been improved. ""It fundamentally works,"" said Louis Sanders, chief engineer at the transportation association. ""It's a very efficient system. Just because it was designed 30 years ago doesn't mean it's not a good system."" There is no federal agency that mandates technology standards for rapid transit systems. The standards are regulated by local jurisdictions. In an automated system, a control room houses electronics that regulate the movement of trains. The control rooms send electronic signals to sensor-like devices located between the train tracks. When a train crosses over one of these devices, the device relays critical information to the train's lead car, telling the train when to slow down, speed up and stop. When trains are running on automatic mode, the operator's main task is to open and close the train doors. ""The design of the system is set up to keep trains separated, to have positive separation between trains, to control speeds, to give them speed information. And so what we're trying to figure out is what happened in this accident,"" National Transportation Safety Board member Debbie Hersman told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday. The automated system includes safeguards for the train operator, including an emergency, or mushroom-shaped, brake which can be applied when the train is running both in manual and automatic mode. NTSB officials say the train operator appeared to hit the ""mushroom"" brake before the crash. On Wednesday, however, NTSB investigators discovered ""anomalies"" in an essential control circuit on a section of track where the accident occurred. Hersman said the circuits are ""vital providing information to the operators and the train itself when on automatic."" NTSB officials wouldn't elaborate on the ""anomalies."" A full NTSB report of the investigation won't be released until six to 18 months from now, but officials said they will simulate crash tests to determine what caused the accident. Until the report is released, transit authorities say they won't be likely to know what improvements or changes need to be made in other urban rail systems. Last year, a commuter rail crash in Los Angeles, California, that killed 25 people prompted federal and state officials to aggressively upgrade safety systems on inter-city railways and commuter rails across the country. Metro trains in Washington are being operated manually by train operators until further notice, according to the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority. In a manual system, the train operator has full control of the train's starts, stops and speed. The operator must drive within speed parameters set by the signals, or the train will shut down. The Metro's only other fatal crash occurred in January 1982 when three people died as a result of a derailment between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian stations, according to Metro officials. Data from the National Safety Council in 2008 shows drivers on roads are 14 times more likely to end up in a fatal accident than people who ride public transit. Officials in other cities that rely on automated rapid-transit systems similar to Washington's Metro say they believe their trains are safe. Noelle Gaffney, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Transit Authority, said the automated system has worked for passengers in that Illinois city, citing no major accidents in recent years. She said the Chicago system, which is the third busiest system in the United States, has operators on board each train. ""The automatic system we use works for us, so we're not going to look at new technology that doesn't prove to be cost effective,"" she said. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, officials at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority reassured passengers through the media that their automatic system, though similar to Washington's, is safe and has back-up emergency brakes. Jeffrey Knueppel, assistant general manager and chief engineer at the Pennsylvania authority, said the agency spent more than $200 million over the last decade to ensure the ""signal and control systems are as modern and safe as they can be."" Andrew Busch, a spokesman at the authority, said he hasn't heard any passenger concerns about safety or made any changes with how their trains operate since Monday's Metro crash. ""We're confident in our system as it is now,"" Busch said.","The Washington Metro has used an automated train control system since 1976 .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a country where no one can find a job and everyone is younger than 25. This country, which exists as a diaspora, threatens the economic vitality, social fabric and long-term stability of much of the world. It is a country of lost potential. In Europe, 24% of youth are unemployed. The numbers are particularly bad in Greece, Portugal and Italy. They are also bad in the Middle East and North Africa. Unemployment is a slow-burning yet acute crisis that needs continuous attention from the world's businesses and governments. The human cost is incalculable. Jobless young people struggle to become positive contributors to their families, communities and countries. Creating more job opportunities accelerates a virtuous cycle that boosts productivity and wages, reinforces a host of social virtues -- including greater stability, self-esteem, community commitment -- and decreases crime. For business, the opportunity is great. Research indicates that for every 1 percentage point of sustained improvement in global youth employment, worldwide economic consumption increases by an estimated $72 billion per year. We believe leaders in business, government and civil society should make a collaborative, concerted and cohesive effort to address unemployment with urgency in 2014. We've asked the 120 global CEOs who make up the World Economic Forum's International Business Council to join us in a new drive to reduce youth unemployment, starting this week at the Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos. One area with significant potential is education for and through employment, including developing function-specific and behavioral skills training programs that build experience, such as innovative internships and apprenticeships. It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a wide and growing gap between the kinds of jobs available to new workers and the ability of young people to fill them. According to a recent survey of employers in nine countries (Brazil, Germany, India, Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States), only 43% of employers say they are able to find enough skilled entry-level workers. Public-private cooperation in developing the work readiness of the young generation provides a clear opportunity to reduce youth unemployment. For example, automobile manufacturers and suppliers across more than a dozen U.S. states are now training new workers in collaboration with 30-plus community colleges. More employers are also turning to apprenticeships such as those that have long been successful in Germany, Austria and Switzerland -- three countries with traditionally low youth unemployment. In these countries, dual education systems combine study with work experience and their results are recognized by companies and governments alike. Such dual education systems provide a promising path forward to young people without university degrees, create a next-generation workforce for business trained by specialists. These systems generally cost taxpayers less than training efforts initiated and funded wholly by government. These efforts are also effective in developing countries. For instance, since 2009, the Coletivo (Collective) program -- a public-private partnership between companies, local government and NGOs -- has equipped thousands of young Brazilians with the skills needed to find jobs in retail, recycling, entrepreneurship and more, impacting more than 70,000 people in Brazilian communities. In addition, global corporations can work with government and civil society to build entrepreneurship cultures inside and outside their organizations, empowering youth through training in behaviors and attitudes that will help them get things done throughout their lives, and boost employment and innovation. The World Economic Forum's Global Shapers initiative is helping to create new ventures and jobs by connecting more than 3,000 of the world's brightest young entrepreneurs . With our International Business Council colleagues, we will be determining how to develop better data and local information on youth employment and replicate existing solutions more widely. With many parts of the world still struggling to reinvigorate growth, concerted efforts to help young people prepare for the workforce can help our global economy. We believe the time has come for international business leaders to act decisively to reduce youth unemployment and create a brighter future for all.

"(CNN) -- ""Lone Survivor,"" based on the true story of an ambushed Navy SEAL team in Afghanistan, was the No. 1 movie in America last weekend. If you haven't seen it, go see it. The movie reminded me of a phrase, ""citizenship on the cheap,"" which has haunted me since I heard retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal utter it last summer. He was launching the Franklin Project, an ambitious initiative to expand national service in America. But he was talking about something deeper -- the widening divide between civilians and those coming out of the military. Because the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have been fought by an all-volunteer force, the great majority of Americans have only passing acquaintance with the sacrifices of national defense. Most Americans have not been asked to do anything more for their country during wartime than to thank the troops. That's why McChrystal has called for a rapid expansion of voluntary civilian service programs like AmeriCorps, so more civilians join those who serve in uniform. I couldn't agree more. I'd go further, in fact, and mandate national service, whether military or civilian. That, however, is a pipe dream when our nation can't even fully tolerate mandatory health insurance coverage. How, then, can American society aspire to something greater than citizenship on the cheap? Perhaps the answer lies not in trying to make more Americans serve but in enabling more veterans to serve in new ways when they come home. There are more than 2.6 million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans today. As our country's longest wars wind down, a million more are expected to return. These are people with leadership skills, professionalism, experiences solving complex problems under high stress while keeping a larger mission in mind. Think America could use a few (million) good men and women like that? Meet two of them, Rodrigo Garcia of Student Veterans of America and Chris Marvin of Got Your 6. Got Your 6 is military parlance for ""got your back"" and Marvin, a former Army Blackhawk pilot, founded this national campaign to bridge the military-civilian divide. It activates celebrities, social media, political and cultural leaders, and every other resource available to advance a simple message: Veterans are assets. This may seem obvious. But consider the two dominant images of veterans in everyday culture, from movie screens to school assemblies to corporate advertising. One is the hero. The other is the victim. The hero narrative portrays veterans as Medal of Honor winners with superhuman courage, amputees undaunted by their disabilities, and, yes, lone survivors of hellish battles. The victim story portrays veterans as sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder, wounded warriors betrayed by bureaucracy, combat leaders now left homeless and jobless. To be clear, both narratives have a basis in reality. More veterans than can be counted have indeed been damaged by war, and more than can be counted are indeed heroes of war. They have earned every bit of support, care, honor and gratitude we offer them -- and often more. But the hero and victim portrayals emphasize two messages: that vets belong on a pedestal, and that vets need your compassion. The veterans I know are looking for a third message: Vets can be great citizens back home. Consider Garcia, from Student Veterans of America, a Marine veteran who in the crowded years since his deployments has gone to graduate school, started businesses, led Student Veterans of America's expansion to many hundreds of campuses nationwide, and helped run a state veterans affairs department. The question for civilians is how to create more channels for people like Garcia to continue being contributors and leaders in public service -- not as pilots or infantry commanders but as candidates for office or school principals or heads of nonprofits. How we do this is simple. We just do it. We foster relationships between veterans and civilians. We hire, connect, mentor and invest in veterans. We support organizations like The Mission Continues and Team Rubicon that plug veterans into community service. We learn from them about how to show up for others. It's often said that ""freedom isn't free."" That's true. Freedom is dear. So is great citizenship, and so is deep gratitude. If we truly want to thank veterans for their service, let's make sure each one who returns from war is empowered to be an integrated, vital part of their community's social fabric and civic life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","Eric Liu: The two dominant images of veterans in everyday culture are hero or victim .

Jett Travolta, right, joined his father weeks ago in Paris, where John Travolta has been filming a movie. ""Jett was the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask for and lit up the lives of everyone he encountered,"" Jett Travolta's parents said in a statement Sunday. ""We are heartbroken that our time with him was so brief. We will cherish the time we had with him for the rest of our lives."" An autopsy on Jett Travolta will be performed Monday, family attorney Michael Ossi said last week. The boy hit his head after the seizure, but the exact cause of death is not known, Ossi said Friday.

Watch CNN's Sunjay Gupta discuss Kawasaki disease » . In 2001, John Travolta told CNN's Larry King that his son had a near brush with death related to the condition. ""I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned. And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome,"" Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son.  Watch Travolta talk about his son's condition » . ""It was that the immune system overreacts, because they have almost the equivalent of metallic chemical,"" Travolta said. In 2003, Kelly Preston told Montel Williams that when Jett was 2, he became ill with flu symptoms, including fever, rashes and swollen lymph nodes, before a doctor diagnosed him with Kawasaki disease. Echoing her husband's comments, Preston blamed chemicals in household cleaners and pesticides for attacking her son's immune system, triggering the condition. A dedicated Scientologist, Preston told Williams that she credited a detoxification program from the writings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard with helping improve her son's health. Kawasaki disease is characterized by fevers and inflammation in the blood vessels that can be caused by a number of inciting factors, including virus, bacteria or infection, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on ""Larry King Live."" ""You get pretty sick for a few days. In the worst-case scenario, sometimes it can affect the blood vessels of the heart, called the coronary arteries,"" Gupta said. ""Sometimes they can develop aneurysms in it. That's probably the most dangerous thing. But again, this is typically a disease associated with young children. It's typically in Japan, and it's pretty rare."" Gupta said it was rare for teens to display symptoms of the disease. ""Most of the patients are usually between 2 and 5 years old. Sometimes they get up to age 8. But it's very rare in fact for someone to be in their teens and still have symptoms of Kawasaki. They may have had it earlier in life, but to still have any manifestations of it is unusual,"" he said. The causes of Kawasaki disease are unknown. Some scientists think it's caused by an infectious agent, such as a virus. Some studies have noted a link between the disease and carpet cleaning chemicals. John Travolta gained fame in the 1970s, starring in the television series ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and the movies ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease.""

"(CNN) -- The sculptures speak for themselves: Piñatas in the shape of decapitated heads bearing gunshot wounds adorn the walls of El Paso's Public Library in Texas. Artist Abel Saucedo says the exhibit, ""Ciudad Juarez es the .1"" has drawn mixed emotions from viewers. The exhibit, called ""Ciudad Juarez es the .1,"" is the work of local artist Abel Saucedo, 24, a recent arts graduate of the University of Texas in El Paso. Saucedo grew up in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez across the border in Mexico, and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border. ""Every time you have a conversation here violence is brought up. It's on the front page, it's part of everyone's life, it's a reality. I decided to use a piñata because it's a way to identify with my culture,"" Saucedo said in a phone interview. The collection, which Saucedo describes as post modern conceptualism, contains four individual piñata sculptures in the shape of cartoon heads a bit larger than life size. The heads look as if they have been severed at the bottom of the neck and they are adorned with red paint and shot wounds on the forehead. They are all men -- one has glasses, one a golden tooth, one is smiling, and one has a mustache. ""They don't represent anyone in particular, just the violence in the border,"" Saucedo said. ""I got a pressure gun and shot each piñata so it would look like a gunshot. I also filled the pressure gun with red paint so it would drip down the face,"" Saucedo said. The pieces, which took Saucedo six months to complete, were received with mixed emotions. ""I have had all kinds of responses. People like them, they think it's a great idea. People think its offensive, sad, it's humorous, but people say it's the truth. In art I've learned that everything everyone says, it's an opinion,"" said Saucedo. El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was ""very offended"" by the pieces. The library receives around 1,592 visitors per day. ""As a person living here in the community, as an artist, this is my opportunity to speak, and it's tragic. My family and friends have had to move, it's tragic. I feel it's my responsibility as an artist to represent those feelings,"" said Saucedo. Enrique Torres, spokesman for the Mexican state of Chihuahua's Joint Operation said the violence is as brutal as ever. ""We have anything from one dead a day to six or seven. Criminal groups have changed their strategy. They used to operate in high profile vehicles and large caliber weapons, now they use low caliber weapons and older model compact vehicles which are harder to detect,"" said Torres. Chihuahua's Joint Operation oversees 7,000 Mexican soldiers operating in Juarez working alongside 2,300 federal Police and local police forces. ""Ciudad Juarez es the .1"" will run until July 31.","Artist says piñatas in shape of decapitated heads represent border violence .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration on Wednesday proposed new tests and standards that would for the first time require child safety seats protect occupants from side-impact crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the rules, which are mandated by Congress and would apply to all car seats for children weighing up to 40 pounds, could save lives. ""We estimate that this proposal would save the lives of five children every single year, and prevent over 60 injuries each year,"" NHTSA Acting Administrator David Friedman told a Society of Automotive Engineers gathering in Washington. NHTSA said manufacturers in recent years have begun beefing up car seat structures and adding more padding to protect the head and torso, noting that those products are effective at protecting kids. But the government wants protocols in place for testing those products as well as formal performance standards for safety in side-impact crashes, which kill or seriously injure as many children as frontal-impact collisions, the agency said. There currently is a federal safety requirement car seats must meet for frontal crashes. Traffic fatalities involving young children have dropped sharply since the mid 1970s partly due to increasing use of car seats, NHTSA said. In data outlined by NHTSA in its proposal, more than 320 children four and younger were killed in all types of passenger vehicle crashes in 2009. Slightly more than half were in car seats. The new sled tests proposed by NHTSA would simulate a ""t-bone"" crash in which a small vehicle containing a child seat and traveling at 15 mph is struck broadside by another vehicle going twice that speed. Manufacturers would have to demonstrate that child seats can safely restrain an occupant and minimize force from the accident that is transmitted to the child's upper body. Crash-test dummies representing the characteristics of children at ages 1 and 3 will be used. NHTSA said in its proposal that real-world data indicate head injuries are most common in side-impact crashes. The public will have 90 days to comment once the rules are published in the Federal Register. Comments, especially by industry, could also result in changes and finalizing a rule could take several months at least. If new requirements are ultimately put in place, car seat manufacturers will likely have several years to comply with new standards. Small cars yield mixed results in crash test, but improving overall .","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposes first-ever side-impact tests for car seats .

"Boulder, Colorado (CNN) -- Heavy storms returned to northeastern Colorado on Saturday as rescuers scrambled to take advantage of breaks in the weather to continue reaching stranded residents. The rain Saturday extended eastward from southeast Denver, where the National Weather Service said 1.73 inches of rain fell in less than 30 minutes. The agency warned that El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, could endure more flooding because of heavy rain Saturday evening along a ""burn scar"" created by an earlier fire in Waldo Canyon. The rain Saturday evening spared Boulder County, scene of the most damage discovered so far. But officials said they received a forecast of up to 4 inches of rain for Sunday afternoon. Sheriff Joe Pelle said rain that heavy ""could be devastating."" Authorities are worried that any additional water on ground already soaked by up to 15 inches of rain will cause more flooding and dislodge mud and debris. At least four deaths have been blamed on the flooding. In addition, a 60-year-old woman was presumed dead after witnesses saw her being swept away by waters that demolished her home, said Nick Christensen, executive officer of the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. Neighbors tried unsuccessfully to rescue the woman, Christensen said. Her body had not been recovered. The sheriff's office said that about 350 people were unaccounted for in Larimer County. That number jumped sharply Saturday afternoon as rescuers reached more empty homes. The sheriff's office lists such residents as unaccounted for until they are located elsewhere. In neighboring Boulder County, 231 people were on the ""unaccounted for"" list as of 7 p.m. MT (9 p.m. ET), said Gabrielle Boerkircher, spokesperson for the county office of emergency management. She said that number was fluctuating as some people were found safe even as the county received new requests to locate people. A surveillance mission carrying Gov. John Hickenlooper and members of Colorado's congressional delegation was diverted twice to pick up people waving to be rescued. After the officials' delayed arrival at a Boulder airport, U.S. Sen. Mark Udall said, ""That dog and the cat and those seven people on those two helicopters didn't ask us whether we were Democrats or Republicans."" And he promised a bipartisan push in Congress for federal aid for flood recovery. Hickenlooper said he spoke by phone with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who ""was adamant that the $5 million that was released yesterday was just the beginning"" of federal assistance. Experts from Vermont will arrive next week to share lessons learned about improved road-building in the wake of Hurricane Irene, the governor said. Hickenlooper said he saw many damaged roads with ""not just the asphalt taken away, but the entire roadbed, and bridge after bridge missing."" But he promised, ""We're going to come back and rebuild better than it was before."" Boulder County alone will need an estimated $150 million to repair 100 to 150 miles of roadway and 20 to 30 bridges, county transportation director George Gerstle said. The repair bill will be ""10 to 15 times our annual budget,"" he said. Human toll . Evacuations continued Saturday, but were hindered by drainage issues and flooded roadways, he said. Many residents are isolated. ""It's a sinking feeling,"" Sheriff Pelle said of knowing that emergency responders may not be able to reach everyone who needs help. The National Guard had rescued more than 1,200 people in Boulder County by Saturday afternoon, Lt. Col Mitch Utterback said. In Larimer County, there were 46 medical rescues on Friday alone, the sheriff's office said. Pelle said authorities have to be ""realistic"" about the chances that the death toll will rise as rescuers penetrate further into isolated areas. The four confirmed deaths included a woman who was swept away when she got out of her car Thursday in Boulder County. A man jumped out of the car to save her. Both drowned. Authorities recovered both bodies, Pelle said. Another body was found in a collapsed home in Jamestown in the same county. Rescuers recovered another body on a roadway in Colorado Springs in El Paso County. In Denver, rushing waters swept a man into a drainage pipe with his dog. Both were saved after traveling two blocks in the water, police said. Impact Your World: How to help in Colorado . President Barack Obama declared an emergency for Boulder, Larimer and El Paso counties, FEMA announced Friday. The declaration allowed FEMA to bring in four rescue teams, the largest ever deployment in Colorado, officials said. The clear skies allowed for an uptick in evacuations Friday and earlier Saturday. National Guard troops using ""high-profile"" trucks to wade through water evacuated 550 people from the Boulder County town of Lyons, CNN affiliate KUSA reported. It had been cut off since the flooding began Wednesday night -- without water or sewer service, in many cases without electricity. Emotional rescues . Melinda Villa was stranded in her apartment with her 1-month-old baby in the inundated town. She had no phone service, no water and was running out of formula and food. Then the National Guard arrived. ""It just really felt like God came down and saved us,"" she said. Some had to rescue themselves. Catherine Smith and Mandy Stepanovsky lived in a part of Lyons that is accessible only by bridges. ""When those became compromised -- one bridge completely blew out and the other one was very much impassible -- we started looking at other options,"" Smith said. So the couple decided to hike for 2 miles to safety -- with their 8-month-old toddler in their arms. Walking was the only way out. They hiked to Smith's brother's house, where they showered and ate a meal before the weather caught up with them again. A mudslide suddenly brought mud, debris and water through the house, Smith said. They were forced to run to higher ground. ""It was terrifying,"" Smith said. Jonathan Linenberger described a Noah's Ark-style evacuation as he, his fiancee, four dogs and three cats greeted the National Guard truck. ""We had to go (through) knee-deep water, at least. We had to wade our animals across into the truck to get them there,"" said Linenberger. ""That was the first thing you can grab, your loved ones -- and that's what we have."" The National Guard also was evacuating the entire population -- 285 people -- from the town of Jamestown by helicopter, CNN affiliate KCNC-TV reported. In Larimer County, Sheriff Justin Smith surveyed the heavily damaged Big Thompson Canyon by air Friday. Some people remain stranded in homes there, he said, ""How we're going to get them out -- it's going to take a damn long time."" However, he said the break in the rain allowed school buses to begin evacuating students who had been stranded at a school. HLNTV.com: 8 stunning Colorado flooding Twitter photos .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On September 11, 2001, Kathryn Freed watched from two blocks away as a plane hit the World Trade Center's north tower. After September 11, most of lower Manhattan was covered in thick dust from the collapsed towers. ""Honestly, it was so surreal,"" Freed said. ""We heard the plane coming -- it was very low and very loud -- and we watched it go right over our heads; we just watched it hit dead center the north tower. I stood there and watched the skin of the building come off. It looked like tinsel from a Christmas tree falling down."" A short while later, Freed saw the second plane plow through the south tower in a giant fireball. And as she headed back toward her apartment, four blocks from what was soon to be known as ground zero, the south tower collapsed, sending a plume of debris into the air and straight down her street. Freed believes that the lingering cloud of dust -- caused by the towers' collapse and the digging out of ground zero -- caused some of her long- and short-term medical problems, such as her ""WTC cough"" and other respiratory issues. She's among the many residents of lower Manhattan, emergency responders, recovery workers, commuters and passers-by to have developed serious, sometimes chronic medical problems since the terrorist attack seven years ago. A commission charged with examining the scope and depth of the attack's health effects reviewed more than 100 scientific articles published since 2001 and found that new asthma levels among residents and rescue workers were two to three times higher than the national estimates. The report by the World Trade Center Medical Working Group, issued in advance of the September 11 anniversary, also found that  two to three years after the attack, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder remained elevated among rescue and recovery workers and residents of lower Manhattan.  Interactive: More on PTSD » . But the most reassuring finding was that in all the studies they looked at, there was consistency. ""The primary finding of the report, as you synthesize the main findings from more than 100 peer review articles on the health ramifications of 9/11, is that the findings are very similar across the studies,"" Lorna Thorpe said. Thorpe, the deputy commissioner in the Division of Epidemiology at New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, is a member of the Medical Working Group. ""That is a very important characteristic to us when we are trying to say how well we understand the short- and medium-term health ramifications,"" she said. The group, appointed last year by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is composed of 16 professionals with varied areas of expertise who include researchers, clinicians, psychiatrists, pulmonologists and environmental health experts. According to their report, there were also glimmers of good news: New diagnoses of the autoimmune disorder sarcoidosis, which were elevated among responding firefighters early on, are now back to pre-September 11 rates; early symptoms for PTSD resolved quickly for most people; and any impact on birth outcomes was small in magnitude. ""The review of existing services found that at the moment, the panoply of services that exist in New York City are sufficient for those who are stepping forward with potential 9/11 illnesses, but moving forward, additional federal support for sustaining those services is critical,"" Thorpe said, adding that the bigger the outreach effort, the greater the chance of demand to outstrip supply. According to the group, there are still many unanswered questions, including how extensively the disaster affected the health of residents, area workers and students; what kind of exposure increased risk; how persistent the mental and physical symptoms are; how prevalent depression and substance abuse are; whether there is a possibility of trade center-related cancer; and how effective is the treatment received by those who sought it. The medical working group also issued recommendations, including advocating for long-term federal funding to ensure that treatment and monitoring can continue; expanding the research into trade center-related conditions and evaluating the treatments involved; and expanding the education efforts to increase awareness of both the availability of medical resources for those affected and the clinical guidelines created to treat them. Freed believes that she was lucky in that she was ""too busy"" to develop PTSD; at the time, she was a New York council member and spent the months after the attack working to get her neighborhood back on its feet, bringing in supplies, medicine, information and services. She also continued to live in her apartment, where inches of dust had collected on the terrace, and didn't leave the neighborhood with its ever-present dust cloud for months. ""At that time, I had such a bad WTC cough -- I had gone to one of the doctors at Mount Sinai [hospital], and he basically told me to get out of the district because I was having such a hard time breathing,"" she said. ""Like everyone down there, I had a bad cough and what I thought was heartburn, but after the doctor's visit, I realized the air was so, so caustic that just breathing ended up burning your respiratory system."" To this day, Freed, who is now a civil court judge for Manhattan, suffers from the breathing problems and allergies that developed after the attack, and although she occasionally gets ""the cough,"" it doesn't bother her nearly as often. The WTC Medical Working Group is expected to issue an update every year. Freed is glad they are around, but she added, ""It might have been nice to have it seven years ago.""","Working group looked at more than 100 studies done since 2001 .

"(CNN) -- Rip it up and start again. As a 20-year-old, Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros' clay courts. All the portents suggested great things were ahead of the Serbian. Here was a tennis player with an impressive forehand and serve, with the added bonus of being incredibly marketable. But six years on, much like the characters Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett's play ""Waiting for Godot"" -- a drama about the passing of time -- the wait for a second grand slam shows no sign of ending. Since that win in Paris in 2008, Ivanovic has suffered from big-match nerves, serving woes and a series of injury problems. It is arguable she has also endured something of an identity crisis, chopping and changing coaching teams along the way. Her continuing search to help solve this problem and allow her to feel comfortable in her own skin has led her to appointing a support network who speak the same language. ""I've been working really hard,"" Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN's Open Court show. ""I have a new team with me since Wimbledon and it's a Serbian team for me for the first time."" Ivanovic's new team includes coach and hitting partner Nemanja Kontic -- who represented Montenegro in the Davis Cup -- fitness coach Zlatko Novkovic and physio Branko Penic. They have all been part of her entourage since her split with British coach Nigel Sears in July, following a second-round exit at Wimbledon. Her career is littered with coaches who have come and gone as she has searched for a winning formula to challenge consistently for grand slams. Since parting company with her early mentor Zoltan Kuharsky in 2006, she has employed David Taylor, Craig Kardon, Heinz Gunthardt, Antonio van Grichen and Sears. A number of others have also helped her temporarily as part of the Adidas Player Development program. It's not just coaches that have come and gone. It's also true of fitness trainers. Such constant chopping and changing suggests a player stuck in a rut, desperately searching for a way out of it. Her desire to follow up that 2008 French Open win has also led Ivanovic to ponder why she picked up a racket at the age of five in the first place -- for the enjoyment. ""We are also having more fun and a lot of laughs on the court as well to make it interesting, because the year gets very long,"" she said of her team. In Kontic, Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with Sears, yet the 32-year-old, ranked 1,635th in men's doubles, is able to offer her something that respect within the game cannot always buy -- a shared cultural identity. ""I'm really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you,"" Ivanovic said. Employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to Ivanovic performing consistently, according to a former grand slam champion turned coach. ""She's hooked up with someone she has trust in and she's finding herself,"" Jo Durie, who won mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, told CNN. ""It's about confidence with Ana. Her sense of trust in herself is what she needs. ""A lot of players on tour jump around with coaches, I can never understand that. You need to get to know someone."" Ivanovic's solitary grand slam win helped the baseliner become the world No. 1, for 12 weeks in total. Now ranked 14th, she has been outside of the top 10 since June 2009, partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that 2008 win over Dinara Safina in Paris. Wrist, shoulder, foot, abdominal and hip injuries all took their toll as Ivanovic fell to No. 65 in the rankings. Although she acknowledges that there have been improvements in the demands of the WTA Tour calendar, parts of the worldwide schedule are still difficult for the players. ""Especially at the end of the year when from America we mostly go back to Europe for a week and then we go to Asia for quite a few weeks, so that's kind of tiring and hard,"" she said. ""I know it's difficult to fit it all around it, but Asia at the end of the year really gets a lot of players."" While her playing fortunes might have fluctuated, Ivanovic's marketability has never been dented. According to Forbes, she was the ninth highest-paid female athlete in 2013 with total earnings of $7 million -- brought in largely thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals including Adidas, Yonex, Juice Plux and Dubai Duty Free. Ivanovic has had a number of high-profile boyfriends -- including Masters-winning golfer Adam Scott and fellow tennis player Fernando Verdasco -- but as Caroline Wozniacki has discovered, it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship. Her latest campaign, though, does not look like being clouded by such distraction or, just as importantly, injury. Kicking off the 2014 season in Auckland, New Zealand, she ground out a victory against fellow former No. 1 Venus Williams to end a more than two-year title drought. It was the ideal preparation for next week's Australian Open. Despite Ivanovic's obvious talent, Durie doubts whether her game has the consistency required to win a grand slam. ""I think she'll find it difficult,"" added Durie. ""She can beat the top players, but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches. ""She's capable of big wins, she can certainly beat players like Serena Williams. But can she beat Petra Kvitova and Serena in a row?"" Clijsters retired for a second time in 2012, having won four grand slams, as she decided to focus on her family -- and has since had a second child. Ivanovic, now 26, admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis. ""I still feel like there is so much I can achieve and so many tournaments I can win,"" she told the Belgian. ""I don't want to put a date to it because I think you feel it when the time is right. Family is a big part of my life and I want to have lots of kids of my own one day. ""Tennis is a big part of my life, but it's not my whole life. So definitely I want to achieve what I can on the court and then focus.""","Ana Ivanovic has a new all-Serbian team behind her for the first time .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed millions of dollars in additional funding to crack down on abuses in the state's drug rehab program as a result of an investigation by CNN and The Center for Investigative Reporting. The governor's budget summary specifies additional government oversight needed to run the Drug Medi-Cal program. ""The budget proposes 21 positions and $2.2 million ... to continue the state's intensive focus on program integrity and expansion of drug treatment services by recertifying all providers in the state,"" says the budget summary, which was released Thursday. CIR: Medi-Cal to overhal rehab program . The yearlong investigation by CNN and The Center for Investigative Reporting -- which culminated in reports in July on CNN.com and on CNN's ""AC360ยบ"" television program -- revealed widespread fraud in the drug rehab program, which is part of the largest Medicaid system in the United States. The investigation revealed that convicted felons were operating clinics in violation of the law, clinics charged taxpayers for ""ghost"" patients and teens had been taken from their group homes for drug rehab even though they had no drug problems. Regulators who could have stopped the fraud allowed it to continue, despite warnings that the system was being abused, the series found. The investigation prompted a swift and strong reaction from the state. A total of 177 clinic sites have been suspended and 69 referred to the state's Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution. The head of the program publicly apologized for the fraud before a legislative oversight hearing in September. ""Due to concerns about program integrity in the Drug Medi-Cal program, DHCS (the California Department of Health Care Services) took steps in July 2013 to eliminate fraud and abuse in the program. ... DHCS has conducted a review of internal operations to improve oversight and monitoring of drug treatment programs, and has improved coordination with counties to ensure appropriate monitoring and recertification of all drug treatment providers,"" according to the budget summary. State Sen. Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, chairman of the Senate Business, Professions and Professional Development Committee, said, ""I am pleased the governor is proposing additional positions and funding to fight fraud in the Drug Medi-Cal program. We will analyze his proposal during the budget process to see if it is sufficient, but it is a good start."" DHCS spokesman Norman Williams said the money will allow the department to add a wide variety of new positions to scrutinize individual clinics and the department's own procedures. Some staffers will comb through applications from rehab clinics to be recertified by the state -- a new requirement prompted by the series. Others will analyze data to make sure clinic billing matches the services provided, examine the department's policies and make recommendations for improvement. ""These are positions that will make the (Drug Medi-Cal) program stronger,"" Williams said. ""This amount gives us the support necessary to continue our efforts ... in a way that we will ultimately be able to improve the integrity of the program."" Of the $2.2 million, half will come from the state's general fund, and the rest will be matched with federal funds. All of the clinics featured in the CNN/CIR investigation have either closed on their own or have shut down after being suspended by the state. George Ilouno, one of the clinic operators who continued to stay open despite being out on bail on charges of Medi-Cal fraud and grand theft, pleaded guilty to Drug Medi-Cal fraud in September. He received a one-year suspended jail sentence, three years' probation, paid $90,000 in restitution to the state and must perform 60 days of community service. Will Evans and Christina Jewett with The Center for Investigative Reporting contributed to this report.","In July, CNN and CIR reported widespread fraud in California's drug rehab program .

"Editor's note: Aaron David Miller, a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington since 2006, served in the State Department as senior adviser for Arab-Israeli negotiations and in other roles under six secretaries of state. He is working on a book about presidential greatness. Aaron Miller says the Obama administration is departing from longtime policy on dealing with Israel. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama has embarked on what could represent a radical departure in America's Mideast policy, at least on settlements. Having worked for Republican and Democratic administrations, I took it for granted that the current president and secretary of state would first try to invest in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before publicly confronting him. After all, even the toughest secretary of state, James Baker, who initially had no confidence in the hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, found common ground with him in an effort to pull off the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991. Unlike his two immediate predecessors (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush), the president has decided to draw the line with Israel and push for a comprehensive freeze on settlements on the West Bank. The president seems unwilling to yield ground and to allow the Israelis any of the traditional loopholes that would have permitted some settlement construction. If the U.S.-Israeli brouhaha leads to a real confrontation, even the fall of the Netanyahu government, President Obama may not feel too bad about it. Fighting with Israel is a normal occupational hazard if you want to be an effective mediator. Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter and James Baker knew this. But tension with Israel was designed with a purpose under prior administrations. You didn't pick fights with an Israeli prime minister because you were frustrated or to make nice with the Arabs, but to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations that made you, America and the peace process look good. As President Obama heads to Saudi Arabia and Egypt this week, his strategy is not altogether clear. The logic appears to be to get Israel to freeze settlements, the Arab states to offer up partial normalization and together this will somehow get Israel and the Palestinians into a successful negotiation on the toughest issues -- Jerusalem, borders and refugees. The president would presumably be prepared to lay out his own peace plan if necessary. To make this work, the sun, moon and the stars would need to align almost perfectly. Netanyahu has already rejected an airtight freeze on settlements; the prospect of the Arabs, already scared of Iran, giving visas to Israeli entrepreneurs is unlikely. And the idea that a conflict-ending agreement can be reached between a Palestinian national movement so broken that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas share control over the guns, people and legitimacy of Palestine, and a right-wing Israeli government almost seems fantastical. I can only conclude that the administration -- filled with talented and experienced people -- understands the long odds, too. In fact, both White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have seen the Netanyahu movie before (he was prime minister from 1996-1999) and may well have advised the president that getting an agreement with him will be almost impossible. If the prime minister gave in on a freeze, he would be too weakened in his own country (without stunning concessions from the Arabs) that he couldn't go on to do an accord that divides Jerusalem and has Israel returning to borders very close to those of June 4, 1967. So what's the administration's real objective? Certainly, to improve American credibility and demonstrate its commitment to peace. But there is a backstory here that points strongly in the direction of pressing Netanyahu either to change his behavior or his government. The president and secretary of state have come out early and tough on settlements, and they're denying Israel any wiggle room. President Obama may be banking on the fact that no Israeli prime minister can afford a confrontation with America, particularly with a popular president at a time when Israel needs America to deal with Iran. And the president may also have concluded that if the prime minister decides to hang tough, well, we'll let the chips and his government fall where they may. The problem is the next Israeli government may be no more willing or able to do what the president and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would demand. It's a risky play so early in his administration. I hope the president has thought through the consequences, because what's left of the peace process depends on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron David Miller: U.S. has shied away from confronting Israeli prime ministers .

"(CNN) -- Fresh violence rocked Egypt on Sunday when an explosion wounded four people near military intelligence offices in the Nile Delta, state-run Nile TV reported. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. The chaos came a day after Egyptian student protesters who support the Muslim Brotherhood were accused of torching the cafeteria of a Cairo university, state media reported. The protesting students allegedly stormed the colleges of trade, engineering and science at Azhar University and set fire to its cafeteria, according to the official MENA news agency. Authorities arrested 60 students, the Ministry of the Interior told state-run Nile TV. The protesters were armed with Molotov cocktails and other weapons, the ministry said. One student was killed in the violence, the Muslim Brotherhood said in a statement. The Brotherhood said security forces, ""in an attempt to silence any voice of opposition,"" fired tear gas, live bullets and birdshot at the protesting students. Students at the university have been on strike following the killings of students and professors by security forces, the Muslim Brotherhood said. The clash at the university was the latest in a string of incidents between security forces and backers of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian government last week declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization, an Islamist group which helped propel ousted President Mohamed Morsy to power. Morsy, the nation's first democratically elected president, was forced out of office in July by the nation's military and arrested following widespread protests and petitions calling for his removal. Opponents said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Supporters called his removal a coup and a blow to the democratic movement that toppled former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. In clashes in Cairo on Friday, at least three people died and 265 were arrested. CNN's Ian Lee contributed to this report.","Sunday's explosion wounds four people, state-run media says .

WHO SHOULD TRY IT ""I can't think of one woman who wouldn't look good in this cut,"" says Townsend.

Check out the full story at InStyle.com . Who says you have to stop at the cut -- take your new look even further with one of these fabulous fall colors. Emma Stone's Dimensional Red . KEY COLOR NOTES If it's not natural, flame red hair can look costumey against nearly any complexion. But a coppery auburn with a wash of strawberry highlights like Stone's is flattering on skintones ranging from ultra-fair to tan and tawny. (Skip the shade if you're olive or darker.) And do take a tip from the star by asking that your brows be touched-up, too. The simple tweak enhances the overall sexiness of the shade. Charlize Theron's Buttery Blond . KEY COLOR NOTES ""This is just such a bright sexy blond,"" says colorist Denis De Souza, who works with celebrities like Mila Kunis, Olivia Wilde and Rachel Bilson. ""To make it work for fall, just be sure to amp up your makeup a bit. That way you won't look washed out."" De Souza also points out that because the tone is slightly ashy, it's best reserved for women with fair skin. ""Otherwise you get too contrast-y,"" he adds. Emma Roberts's Honey Blond . KEY COLOR NOTES What makes this blond so unique is the layers of dimensional color: A base of toffee blond is accented with ribbons of caramel and straw. We love this treatment for women who were towheads as children and are reticent to admit they're now light brunets. It also looks great on fair complected beauties with a pinkish hint in their skin; those with yellow notes can look too tone-on-tone. InStyle.com: 50 best celebrity wedding dresses of all time . Sarah Jessica Parker's Grown-Out Blond . KEY COLOR NOTES Ever since ombre came into fashion in the last year or so, colorists have perfected the art of the imperceptible fade. SJP's style exhibits no such precision -- and that's exactly why we love it. If you're a true brunet who went blond for summer, resist the urge to re-highlight. Trust us: The results can be spectacular. Maria Menounos's Tawny Highlights . KEY COLOR NOTES If you've got a light chestnut base like Menounos, a scattering of sunny highlights can enliven your look. Keep things sophisticated, not streaky, by making sure the highlights are ultra-fine and placed evenly throughout the entire head, even on the underside of your hair. You'll spend a long afternoon in the salon chair -- and the entire season thankful you did. InStyle.com: 45 chic bags for fall . Olivia Wilde's Refined Ombre . KEY COLOR NOTES ""Olivia hadn't colored her hair in seven or eight years when she came to me,"" De Souza confesses. ""I gave her a base that accented her natural medium brown with lighter honey highlights throughout. Then I lightened the tips with a shade for tones lighter than her darkest hair. It's ombre, but without being severe. And it grows out gorgeously without becoming brassy."" Ciara's Streaky Highlights . KEY COLOR NOTES Usually words like streaky, chunky and patchy aren't necessarily phrases we'd like associated with our highlights. But one look at Ciara's pitch-perfect strands changed our minds for good. Thick ribbons of a coppery blond right along the part are the perfect update to a glossy espresso single-process treatment. Ask your colorist for a few hidden streaks on the underside of your hair for a playful, peek-a-boo surprise. Mila Kunis's Perked-Up Brunet . KEY COLOR NOTES Does Kunis's color look too shiny and natural to be manufactured? That's exactly the idea. ""Mila has dark brown hair, so I highlighted it two levels lighter than her base,"" says De Souza. ""For anyone with olive skin and brunet hair, this technique looks amazing. It's simple and believable, but not at all boring."" Freida Pinto's Inky Black . KEY COLOR NOTES Freida Pinto's hair is so unique because it's nearly a true black, without a glint of auburn or purple in the light. Of course while the best way to get this look is to be born with it, there are a few key tricks for faking it. Ask your colorist for the deepest shade of brunet, not black, which is too severe and heavy metal for the look you're after. (Think coffee grounds, not tar.) And splurge on a luxurious glossing treatment as often as you can. Dyed black hair can look rough and flat without the extra love. InStyle.com: 10 hairstyles that are always in style .

"(CNN) -- The Egyptian government released on Tuesday one of four Al Jazeera journalists it had detained Sunday night, but continued holding the other three employees of the news network, which is demanding their release. Correspondent Peter Greste, producer Mohamed Fahmy, producer Baher Mohamed and cameraman Mohamed Fawzy were taken into custody Sunday evening in Cairo, the network said. Fawzy was released Tuesday morning; the other three men remained in detention and appeared Tuesday before magistrates, Al Jazeera reported. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said on its Facebook page that security forces arrested a Muslim Brotherhood member and an Australian journalist at a Cairo hotel. Greste, an Australian, previously worked for CNN, Reuters and the BBC. Fahmy worked for CNN and The New York Times prior to joining the Qatar-based network; Mohamed is a Cairo-based producer for the network. The ministry said the Muslim Brotherhood member used the hotel to meet with other members and as a media center to broadcast damaging news about the government for Al Jazeera. ""It is outrageous to be treating bona fide journalists in this way,"" said Al Anstey, managing director of Al Jazeera English, in a statement. ""The allegations that are being made are totally false and unfounded. We operate in Egypt legally, the team were working on a number of stories to show our viewers around the world all aspects of the ongoing situation in the country, and every member of our team has huge experience carrying out the highest quality journalism with integrity."" Calling the arrests arbitrary, Al Jazeera said the network ""has been subject to harassment by Egyptian security forces,"" including having its equipment confiscated and offices raided, despite the network not being banned from working in Egypt. The arrests occurred the day before the Committee to Protect Journalists issued a report saying Egypt, Syria and Iraq have become the deadliest countries for journalists. Seventy journalists were killed in 2013, with six of those deaths in Egypt, the CPJ said. Egypt's current round of political turmoil began on July 3, when President Mohamed Morsy was ousted in a military coup. Last week, the military-backed government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. Police and members of the Muslim Brotherhood have clashed in the streets since then.

"(CNN) -- With arrow straight driving, big hitting Dustin Johnson powered his way clear of the field at the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai Friday while first round leader Rory McIlroy paid the price for wayward play from tee to green on his back nine. Texan Johnson overpowered the Sheshan International course with a nine-under 63 to go five clear of McIlroy and fellow Americans Bubba Watson and Boo Weekley on 12-under 132 after two rounds. Johnson's playing partner Graeme McDowell -- still in the hunt on six-under -- could only look on in wonder. ""I've probably seen 18 of the best drives I've seen all year in the last two days,"" he remarked during their round. ""I really drove the ball well,"" Johnson told the official PGA Tour website. ""For me, that's a big key."" He picked up six birdies in his opening seven holes and after completing a front nine of 30 held it together to come home in 33. McIlroy, hunting his first tournament win of 2013, also made a fast start with three birdies on the front nine to build on his first round 65. But coming home it all went wrong for the 24-year-old Northern Irishman -- let down by errant tee shots and approach play to give up three shots to par. Finding the water on the par-five 18th with his approach shot, McIlroy made a disappointing bogey to finish on level par 72. ""I just hit a couple of bad shots, and then I guess I let it affect me a little bit, and then I started to doubt myself sometimes,"" McIlroy said. ""I didn't hit a lot of quality shots on the back nine."" He was joined in joint second place by Weekley (67) and Watson (69), the 2012 Masters champion a crowd pleaser on his first trip to China. ""Everything about the trip has been beautiful. Malaysia last week (CIMB Classic) and then here. It's perfect,"" he said. McDowell, second in the European Tour's Race to Dubai, shot a second straight 69 to share fifth with England's Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, Spanish pair Sergio Garcia and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and South African great Ernie Els. British Open champion Phil Mickelson was back on five under with U.S. Open winner Justin Rose. ""I'm making a lot of birdies,"" Mickelson said. ""But I've had too many mistakes,"" he admitted. Swede Henrik Stenson, who is leading the Race to Dubai, was completely out of sorts and shot a four-over 76 to stand six-over and in 70th out of the 78-man field.","Dustin Johnson takes halfway lead at HSBC Champions in Shanghai .

"On the road to Timbuktu, Mali (CNN) -- French-led troops in Mali have seized control of the airport in Timbuktu from Islamist militants and are fighting their way into the city center, spokesmen for the French Defense Ministry and the Malian military said Monday. ""We are winning in Mali,"" French President Francois Hollande said at a news conference. Malian and French forces have together been battling the Islamists to loosen their grip on the country's north, which the militants have controlled for months. Hollande, who refused to speculate on how long the French intervention would continue, said the Islamists still control the northern part of the country. The United States has also stepped up its involvement in the conflict by conducting aerial refueling missions on top of the intelligence and airlift support it was already providing. Photos: Mali military battles Islamist insurgents . Malian and French soldiers scored a key victory last week, taking control of Gao, a city east of Timbuktu that for months had been a militant stronghold. And flushing the Islamists out of Timbuktu, Mali's historic cultural center, would be a big symbolic gain. The Islamists were reported to be fleeing Timbuktu to the city of Kidal, more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) to the northeast. New fears for Timbuktu in Mali conflict . The quickening advance of the government forces has brought them to the heart of the territory held by the militants. Covering the fighting up close is almost impossible for journalists, who are prevented from gaining access to the front line. Journalists are allowed to enter a town only after it has been freed and its security guaranteed by French and Malian troops. French forces are involved in the fight in Mali, a former French colony that retains close ties with Paris, in an effort to prevent the Islamists from turning the once peaceful democracy into a haven for international terrorists. France has 2,150 soldiers on Malian soil, with 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere. Photos: Fears for Timbuktu in Mali conflict . The Islamic extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. The militants banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines. Refugees have told harrowing stories of life under the Islamist militants. But human rights groups have also raised concerns about reports that Malian soldiers are themselves carrying out extrajudicial killings and abuses as they counterstrike. Six reasons events in Mali matter . The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court issued a statement Monday putting Malian forces on notice that ""all those alleged to be responsible for serious crimes in Mali must be held accountable."" ""My Office is aware of reports that Malian forces may have committed abuses in recent days, in central Mali,"" the prosecutor said. ""I urge the Malian authorities to put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses and on the basis of the principle of complementarity, to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the alleged crimes."" The restrictions on journalists make it harder to gauge the realities on the ground. The United Nations' refugee agency, the UNHCR, has called for an increase in international aid for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced by the fighting in the country. More than 150,000 refugees have fled Mali into neighboring countries, and another 230,000 are displaced inside Mali, the agency said. One casualty in the battle for Timbuktu is the city's library, which was designated a world heritage site because of a treasure of rare books and manuscripts about precolonial Africa, a South Africa professor told CNN on Monday. ""What we don't know is the full extent of the damage,"" said Shamil Jeppie, who is director of the Timbuktu Manuscripts project. ""There are no phones or communications to Timbuktu, and there haven't been for some time. Much of the images show documents and papers tossed on the ground, but it appears that just a portion of the library is actually burned. The building itself was certainly razed."" Jeppie said it would ""be a loss for all humanity if the manuscripts were destroyed.""

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Long before the sun came up over the newly vertical Costa Concordia cruise liner, a little party was going on in Giglio harbor. It was just after 4am and the team of highly specialized salvage experts, who were feeling proud about the unprecedented rotation of the massive vessel that crashed on Giglio's shores in January 2012, were making their way to the dock from the control room where they'd spent the last 19 hours. When the Concordia finally came to rest on the platforms 30 meters below water at exactly 4am, the salvage vessels in the harbor blew their horns in celebration -- which summoned the villagers who came to the port. It escaped no one that a similar scene played out 20 months earlier when the Concordia first came to rest on the rocky shores. Only this time, instead of carrying blankets and warm clothes for the shipwreck victims, they carried champagne bottles for the salvage crews. INTERACTIVE: How ill-fated cruise liner was raised from Italian seabed . Captain Richard Habib, the director of Titan Salvage, which is leading the mammoth $800 million operation, was standing on shore in a well-worn gray Titan jumpsuit, to thank his team personally. He looked every bit like one of the workers and not at all like the big boss coming in from Florida. ""We've worked on this for the last 18 months, and our efforts paid off well,"" Habib later told CNN as he sipped a celebratory beer with workers at the Bar Fausto on the portside. ""It came together well."" Habib, himself a salvage master, stepped aside while the star of this particular show, Nick Sloane, the 52-year-old South African in charge of the Concordia salvage, and his key team took center stage. And what a stage it was. As the team walked from the port to the Fausto, the crowds cheered and rushed to hug them. Many popped champagne bottles and passed them around, almost as if the home team had just won the Superbowl. Many of the salvage workers sat at the outdoor tables, just like they do after every shift and wondered just what all the fuss was about. ""It's just a job,"" said one of the Scottish workers. ""I can't believe they are all here at this hour waiting for us."" In fact, the people of Giglio see the rotation, or parbuckling, of the Costa Concordia liner very differently than the salvage team that pulled off the feat. For the workers, it was a risky operation that succeeded. But for the Giglese, it is the first concrete step towards moving the beast from the island's shore. Throughout the day on Monday when the Concordia slowly rolled to vertical, the islanders watched and waited and paced up and down the port like nervous parents before a birth. Many of them lined the hills above the wreck with binoculars and time-lapse cameras to capture the event. When the morning sun finally rose to show the Concordia's twisted and bent starboard side, the horror of the wreck suddenly seemed more real than even the night it happened. For 20 months, the ship had been melded to its rocky underwater perch. When it was peeled off, it exposed a scene that looked something like a cross between an earthquake and a bomb. Soggy curtains hung limp in the broken windows, deck chairs were imbedded into the stateroom walls. One lone lifeboat that had been smashed into the ship's carcass looked as flat as a painting hanging on the wall. Suitcases and dingy brown stained bedding were pressed up against the few windows that were still intact. The stateroom balconies were folded up against the ship's outer wall, some trapping deck chairs against the cabin doors. Islanders mingled with journalists who studied the wreckage from every possible angle exchanging binoculars and long-lens cameras to get a better view, pointing out bizarre details of a scene that literally petrified the moment the ship crashed into the rocky shore. It was a surreal scene, and one made even more poignant by the fact that the other half of the ship was still pristine white, almost as if the ship was wearing a half-white, half-black masquerade mask. There was nothing to do but stare.","The Costa Concordia ship was righted after a huge salvage effort off the island of Giglio .

"(CNN) -- A freelance cameraman covering Egypt's constitutional referendum for The Associated Press has been released on bail, the news agency said Friday. Hassan Abdullah Hassan was producing video coverage outside a Cairo polling station when police seized him along with his driver, according to an AP report. His driver, Mohammed Salah Mohammed, was freed Thursday. ""We are pleased that Mr. Hassan has been released on bail, and we hope that any remaining legal questions can be resolved quickly,"" said John Daniszewski, AP's senior managing editor for international news. ""Hassan told AP by phone that he was arrested after police saw his footage being broadcast live on Al Jazeera Television's Egyptian affiliate and wrongly concluded that he was an Al Jazeera employee,"" the AP report said. CNN first learned of Hassan's detention on Twitter after Cairo-based AP journalist Jon Gambrell tweeted the news. Last month, Egyptian authorities detained four Al Jazeera employees. They released cameraman Mohamed Fawzy on December 31. But Peter Greste, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed from Al Jazeera English remain detained. Authorities accused them of holding illegal meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was declared a terrorist group there last month. Calling the arrests arbitrary, Al Jazeera has said the network ""has been subject to harassment by Egyptian security forces,"" including having its equipment confiscated and offices raided, despite the network not being banned from working in Egypt. Nearly 40 correspondents and editors representing 29 international media organizations sent a letter to Egyptian authorities on Monday, demanding the journalists' immediate release and accusing authorities of detaining them arbitrarily. They also call for the release of other journalists who have been detained in Egypt, some of whom they say have been arbitrarily imprisoned for more than five months. ""The arrest of these journalists has cast a cloud over press and media freedom in Egypt,"" the letter reads. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","The AP says Egyptian police released freelance cameraman Hassan Abdullah Hassan on bail .

"(CNN) -- A pro-privacy e-mail service long used by NSA leaker Edward Snowden abruptly shut down Thursday, blaming a secret U.S. court battle it has been fighting for six weeks — one that it seems to be losing so far. ""I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly 10 years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit,"" owner Ladar Levison wrote in a statement. ""After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations."" Based in Texas, Lavabit attracted attention last month when NSA leaker Edward Snowden used an e-mail account with the service to invite human rights workers and lawyers to a press conference in the Moscow airport where he was then confined. A PGP crypto key apparently registered by Snowden with a Lavabit address suggests he's favored the service since January 2010 — well before he became the most important whistleblower in a generation. Levison posted this message Thursday announcing the shutdown: . My Fellow Users, . I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I feel you deserve to know what's going on--the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests. What's going to happen now? We've already started preparing the paperwork needed to continue to fight for the Constitution in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. A favorable decision would allow me resurrect Lavabit as an American company. This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States. Sincerely, . Ladar Levison . Owner and Operator, Lavabit LLC . Defending the constitution is expensive! Help us by donating to the Lavabit Legal Defense Fund here. Reading between the lines, it's reasonable to assume Levison has been fighting either a National Security Letter seeking customer information — which comes by default with a gag order — or a full-blown search or eavesdropping warrant. Court records show that, in June, Lavabit complied with a routine search warrant targeting a child pornography suspect in a federal case in Maryland. That suggests that Levison isn't a privacy absolutist. Whatever compelled him to shut down now must have been exceptional. A voicemail to Lavabit went unreturned Thursday. Lavabit has 350,000 users who aren't Edward Snowden, and some are decidedly unhappy with Levison's decision, judging by a flood of angry comments posted to Lavabit's Facebook page Thursday afternoon. ""Too bad that I payed some years in advance to keep up the good work that now turns out to be terminated without any warning,"" wrote one user. ""I relied on this service which is basic for my private as professional online communication and have no idea how to migrate mails and recover mails being sent that never reached me in the past 18 hours."" ""I have my Steam account and EVERYTHING on Lavabit,"" wrote another. ""Please have the servers running so that we can migrate our services."" ""How am I supposed to migrate?"" a third user added. ""Some services require a confirmation sent to the old email address to be able to switch. I can't believe this. I just switched to Lavabit only a couple of weeks ago to get away from Hotmail snooping my shit."" A minority of commenters were more supportive. ""Holy s---, you guys are crying over your Steam accounts,"" wrote one. ""Just change your email to something else.

"(CNN) -- At least 12 people were killed and more than 130 injured Tuesday when two explosions hit an Interior Ministry building in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, Egyptian media reported. Previously, the semi-official Al Ahram news agency reported 14 dead, citing the country's Health Ministry. It was not immediately clear why the death toll was lowered. Among the people injured is the head of the security directorate of Dakahlia governorate, state-news agency MENA said, citing Health Ministry officials. Part of the building collapsed after the explosion, MENA said. One blast occurred on one of the top floors of the building and was followed by a car bomb, MENA reported. Egypt's interim Prime Minister Hazem al Beblawi called it a terrorist incident and said the perpetrators will not go unpunished. Without directly blaming the Muslim Brotherhood, the party that backs ousted President Mohamed Morsy, he called that party a terrorist group in his statement to the nation. The Muslim Brotherhood tweeted Tuesday that it ""strongly condemn(ed) the cowardly bombing in #Mansoura & express deep condolences to families of the victims #Egypt."" An Egyptian court in September ordered a ban on activities by the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, in a move that diminished its political power. Witness: Heavy damage at the site . Ahmed El Shabrawy was at his home when he heard a loud blast. He told CNN it took him five minutes to run to the building where he saw a man pulled by other residents from the rubble of the building. He estimated that dozens of cars were damaged, and there was a large area around one of the blast sites were there was ""heavy material damage."" At least 10 ambulances had responded to the scene, he said. So many people rushed to a blood donation center that workers had to turn people away, he added. CNN first learned of the blasts from Twitter. Upcoming vote on proposed constitution . The blasts come in the lead-up to Egypt's referendum on a new constitution, which will be held January 14 and 15. The draft constitution would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military. A military coup in July unseated Morsy, who was democratically elected. Since then there have been almost daily protests, some of which have ended in violence and other bombings, such as one on December 12 when 20 police recruits were injured in a car bomb attack. On Sunday, Ansar Jerusalem, a self-proclaimed jihadist group responsible for several terrorist attacks, mainly in the Sinai Peninsula, issued an online statement calling on army and police members to quit. ""With your staying in these institutions from evening to morning, you are incurring the anger of Allah,"" the statement said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Tuesday's bombing. Morsy, an Islamist leader, has endured a series of legal troubles. He and 132 others will face trial for escaping from prison in 2011, state media reported Saturday. Morsy will be tried along with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian Hamas, al Ahram reported. He is also charged with raiding other prisons, and killing soldiers and officers in Rafah, it said. He has been in custody since his ouster.

"(CNN) -- A new United Nations report asserts that both sides in the Syrian civil war have committed grave crimes in violation of international law. Government forces continue to attack civilian populations in what amounts to crimes against humanity, says the report, released Wednesday by the U.N. Human Rights Council. But anti-government groups, in their fight against President Bashar al-Assad, have themselves committed war crimes, including murder, torture and hostage-taking, the report states. The report provides details on nine massacres that it is investigating, eight believed to have been carried out by the government and one by the opposition. As the fighting rages, ""it is civilians who continue to pay the price for the failure to negotiate an end to this conflict,"" the agency said in a prepared statement. The report comes as the international community grapples with how to respond to a chemical attack in Syria last month that was allegedly launched by the government. Keep up with the latest developments . Government blamed for al-Bayda massacre . One of the eight massacres the report attributes to government forces is a notorious event that occurred in the village of al-Bayda in May. Some victims in al-Bayda ""appeared to have been hit in the head with blunt, heavy objects,"" the report states. ""Bodies of 30 women, also apparently executed, were found in a house not far from the centre while tens of bodies were strewn in the streets. Between 150-250 civilians were allegedly killed."" ""There are reasonable grounds to believe that government forces and affiliated militia including the National Defence Forces are the perpetrators of the al-Bayda massacre,"" the report says. Other massacres attributed to the government involved indiscriminate shelling of certain areas and the killing of civilians by snipers. Unlawful killings by government forces also were reported at detention centers, where there was a spike of deaths of people in custody, the report says. Shootings at checkpoints and snipers killing civilians in Damascus are also blamed on the government forces. Obama seeks support for attacking Syria while pursuing diplomacy . Jihadists linked to opposition abuses . The anti-government war crimes recorded in the U.N. report are mostly attributed to jihadist groups who joined the battlefield late but are now among the most powerful groups. In June, anti-government forces, including members of the jihadist Jabhat al-Nusra, attacked the Shiite areas of the village of Hatla. ""There are reasonable grounds to believe that the anti-government fighters who attacked Hatla unlawfully killed at least 20 civilians in violation of international law,"" the report states. The execution by anti-government forces of a 15-year-old boy accused of blasphemy is attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Another unlawful death recorded by the United Nations is that of a Catholic priest in Idlib. The priest was one of the few remaining Christians in a town where Jabhat al-Nusra operated, the report states. 'No military solution' The U.N. report is based on 258 interviews conducted between May 15 and July 15. ""The perpetrators of these violations and crimes, on all sides, act in defiance of international law,"" the report states. ""They do not fear accountability."" The period covered by the report precedes the date of the chemical attack in Syria that has brought the possibility of military strikes in response. Both sides in the civil war continue to fight because they believe that a military victory is possible, the report states, but it asserts such an outcome is not possible. ""There is no military solution to this conflict,"" it says. ""Those who supply arms create but an illusion of victory.""","Government forces continue to attack civilians, the U.N.

"Cairo (CNN) -- The legitimacy of Egypt's military-backed government is being put to the test as the country voted on a new constitution after years of political turmoil and deadly violence. The result of the referendum won't be announced for another few days. But there's little doubt it will be approved by a landslide, since opposition has largely been silenced through intimidation and arrests. After two days of voting, polls closed at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) Wednesday, state TV reported, showing images of clear plastic bins being sealed with zip-ties. The question is whether the voter turnout will be high enough to bolster the government that took power after the military ousted former Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsy from the presidency last year. A strong participation would translate into support for Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the military chief behind the coup and interim government. If the draft constitution is passed, elections are expected to follow. Some predict el-Sisi will run for president. Observers are watching to see if participation is above 33%. That's the percentage of voters who turned out for the former Islamist-backed constitution. Military rule popular with Egyptians, study finds . Violence on Day 1 . Egyptian security forces arrested 125 people on the second day of voting, the official news agency MENA reported. They were arrested for rioting and trying to obstruct the electoral process, MENA said. The first day of polling was already marred by outbreaks of unrest. The Ministry of Health said nine people died Tuesday in violence related to the referendum. Clashes were reported in several provinces. At least four were killed in Sohag and one in Beni Seouif in clashes between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and security. Violations reported by rights groups monitoring the vote ranged between campaigning for ""yes"" votes inside or near polling stations and preventing Christian voters from reaching polling stations in parts of Upper Egypt, which has a history of sectarian strife and is known for the strong presence of Islamist groups. Tuesday's deaths were the latest twist in three years of political upheaval marked by two presidential departures and hundreds of deaths. Deep political divide . The referendum is the first national vote since the ouster of the democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy. The proposed text would change the constitution to ban religious parties and give more power to the military. A deep political divide is evident between supporters of the interim military government and defenders of Morsy. Plenty of people voting at polling stations Tuesday expressed support for el-Sisi and the draft constitution. ""Egyptians' vote today shows that they are completely against the former regime and they welcome the road map,"" said Riham Emam. But others say that voices of dissent have been muzzled. ""The scary part is that opposition is no longer tolerated, even for political parties,"" said Khaled Dawoud, a spokesman for the liberal Constitution Party. Authorities have cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood since Morsy's ouster, rounding up the movements leaders and making membership illegal. Opinion: Is Egypt back where it was in 2011? Constitutional changes . Egyptians voted on the last constitution in December 2012, while Morsy was still in power. But that constitution was suspended after the military deposed him in July. The latest proposal differs from the last constitution in several ways. Some say the draft constitution would mean improved human rights and freedom of expression. The new version explicitly states that women are equal to men and allows them to hold official and judicial posts, Al-Ahram said. The new articles would also give parliament the right to impeach the President in the event of a breach of the provisions of the constitution, Al-Ahram said. Other new articles would criminalize torture, discrimination and arbitrary forced displacement. Critics say the latest draft would give too much power to the military without any civilian oversight. For example, the draft gives tremendous leeway to the army to try civilians in military courts -- something many Egyptians have opposed for years. Morsy's opponents said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values, but Morsy's supporters say that the military has now returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Hundreds died in clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsy supporters in the weeks that followed his ouster. Morsy has been in detention since July and faces charges of inciting the murders of at least three protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012. The protests were over the constitution that Morsy shepherded into effect. Ian Lee reported from Cairo, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

"(CNN) -- Protesters in parts of Egypt rallied Friday against the government and a vote on a constitution that would ban religious parties, leading to clashes with security forces or demonstrators' opponents in at least three cities, Egyptian media reported. The demonstrations are the latest by members or supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that has regularly protested Egypt's interim government since Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsy was ousted in a coup in July. Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with opponents in parts of Cairo after Morsy loyalists tore down posters supporting the proposed constitution, on which Egyptians will vote Tuesday and Wednesday, the semiofficial Ahram Online news outlet reported. In Giza, security forces fired tear gas at Morsy supporters to disperse their march there, Ahram Online reported. The demonstrators began to march after Friday prayers and clashed with police in various parts of the city, Ahram Online said. Clashes also broke out in al-Sabah city in Suez province, where security forces fired tear gas at a pro-Morsy march, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency. The Muslim Brotherhood-led National Alliance to Support Legitimacy had called for protests, MENA said. The alliance has focused its ire on Egypt's January 14-15 referendum on a new constitution, which would not only ban religious parties but also put more power in the hands of the military. The alliance has called for a boycott of the referendum. Muslim Brotherhood supporters have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Supporters of the organization demand the reinstatement of Morsy, who became the country's first democratically elected president in 2012, and the full restoration of their political and social rights. The interim government blames the group for coordinated attacks on churches and government facilities, including a recent bombing of a police headquarters that left 16 dead and more than 100 injured. The military ousted Morsy on July 3 after he was accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy's supporters say that the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Morsy is awaiting trial in several cases, including one in which he and 14 other Muslim Brotherhood members face charges stemming from December 2012 protests over a constitution he shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused Morsy and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy and four others are charged with inciting violence, but they are not accused of using force. Eleven others are charged with killing three men, torturing 54 people, using force and possessing weapons. That trial, delayed Wednesday, is expected to resume on February 1. Morsy, who says he still is Egypt's legitimate president, has refused to recognize the court's authority and has yet to accept legal representation for the proceeding.

"(CNN) -- The top-secret federal court that oversees government surveillance on Friday reauthorized the National Security Agency's program that collects data on nearly every phone call in the United States. The three-month renewal by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the first since two conflicting court opinions last month on the legality of the program. Revealed publicly in leaks last year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the program is at the center of the surveillance debate in the United States. Critics say it violates privacy rights of Americans whose data is collected even though there isn't any suspicion that they pose a security threat. The NSA and its supporters say the bulk collection authority is crucial to uncovering potential terrorists who haven't yet come to the attention of national security officials. The telephone data program, covered under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, has been authorized 36 times over the past seven years, the nation's top intelligence official said on Friday. President Barack Obama said recently that he is contemplating making modest changes following an independent review of the initiative. One possible change would remove the electronic surveillance effort from the NSA but requiring telecommunications companies, or perhaps a new quasi-government agency, to collect the data. ""The intelligence community continues to be open to modifications to this program that would provide additional privacy and civil liberty protections while still maintaining its operational benefits,"" Shawn Turner, spokesman for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said. A federal judge in Washington last month called the program almost ""Orwellian"" and said it was likely unconstitutional. Days later another federal judge in New York, in a separate challenge to the program, said it was lawful. The Justice Department on Friday filed an appeal of the Washington ruling. The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the New York suit, is appealing that decision. Split decisions will likely set the stage for legal wrangling over the course of the coming year that could ultimately result in a Supreme Court case. NSA won't say if it's 'spying' on Congress . CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","The national security program collects electronic data in bulk .

"(CNN) -- The town of Bude in the southwest of England is best known for its long sandy beaches and picturesque bays. Nowhere on its tourist brochures is a complex of white domes and dishes at Morwenstow mentioned. After the latest revelations published by the Guardian, New York Times and Der Spiegel, Morwenstow may become a little more familiar. The site -- now officially known as GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) Bude -- is at the heart of a global eavesdropping network run by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). It has more than 20 antennae orientated toward global communications satellites over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Africa and the Middle East, according to declassified sources. Based on documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the three newspapers reported Friday that GCHQ Bude is a critical hub in eavesdropping on the communications of government figures, and many others, in Europe and beyond. Among some 1,000 organizations and individuals whose e-mail or phone numbers appear in the documents: the European Commission, the government of Israel, African heads of state, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the NGO Medecins du Monde. None of the newspapers published any of the documents they were shown, and the volume of information collected on any particular individual or organization is unclear. The New York Times reported that, ""The documents include a few fragmentary transcripts of conversations and messages."" But one of the many hundreds of phone numbers listed in the documents from 2009 was that of a senior European official, Joaquin Almunia, who is Spanish. At the time -- just as Europe's financial crisis gathered pace -- Almunia was the European Union's economic and monetary affairs commissioner. According to Der Spiegel, he had a ""personal identification code in the British target database, with the code name ""Broadoak."" Almunia has since become the competition commissioner, handling antitrust disputes, and has been in a long-running dispute with Google over search-engine practices. In an apparent reference to the allegations about Almunia, the NSA said in a statement Friday: ""We do not use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of -- or give intelligence we collect to -- U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."" 'This is not the type of behavior that we expect' According to The New York Times, the French oil company Total and defense contractor Thales also are mentioned in the documents. The NSA statement concluded: ""The U.S. Government is undertaking a review of our activities around the world -- looking at, among other issues, how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners."" The European Commission reacted swiftly to the latest revelations. A spokeswoman in Brussels said that if proven true, they ""are unacceptable and deserve our strongest condemnation. This is not the type of behavior that we expect from strategic partners, let alone from our own Member States,"" meaning the UK. ""The Commission will raise these new allegations with US and UK authorities,"" she added. Spanish media also pounced on revelations about Almunia's communications. The headline in El Pais translated as: ""The US and UK spied on Commissioner JoaquÃ­n Almunia's mobile,"" while La Republica also focused on ""los servicios secretos britÃ¡nicos"" as the perpetrator. The British government is likely to come under further scrutiny from its European partners over its intelligence gathering activities. UK criticism of the NSA program has been more muted than that of France, Germany or Spain, in part because of the long intelligence partnership between the two countries. Review: NSA snooping programs should stay in place . According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister David Cameron did not join in a vigorous debate at the EU summit in October on the NSA eavesdropping, rather expressing his ""silent acquiescence"" to a strongly-worded statement in which Britain was indirectly warned that ""a lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence gathering."" By then, Der Spiegel had already reported that the documents leaked by Snowden showed that GCHQ had been involved in a cyberattack against Belgium's state-run telecom company, Belgacom. The company would only say at the time that ""the intruder had massive resources, sophisticated means and a steadfast intent to break into our network."" GCHQ shares much of the information it collects with the NSA. More than eyes on the sky? The Guardian reported earlier this year, again based on documents provided by Snowden, that the NSA had provided some $25 million to update the Bude facility. But it is also likely that the NSA has been and is still be able to gather directly data harvested by GCHQ Bude. Nicky Hager, an investigative reporter and author of several books on intelligence, told a committee of the European Parliament in 2001 that ""communications were screened for keywords entered into the system by the USA using 'dictionary managers'. The British therefore had no control over the screening process and had no idea what information was collected in Morwenstow, since it was forwarded directly to the USA."" Der Spiegel reported Friday that GCHQ Bude may do more than gaze into the heavens. ""Important undersea cables land at nearby Widemouth Bay,"" it reported. ""One of the cables, called TAT-14, begins at German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom's undersea cable terminal."" TAT-14 links terminals in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the United States. That may explain how so many German telephone numbers appear in one 2009 document provided to the newspapers by Snowden. ""Other documents indicate that the British, at least intermittently, kept tabs on entire country-to-country satellite communication links,"" like those between Germany and Turkey, Der Spiegel reported. Morwenstow has long been part of a global network of stations involved in intercepting satellite communications. The 2001 European Parliament report concluded: ""In Morwenstow....GCHQ, working in cooperation with the NSA and in strict accordance with the latter's instructions, intercepts civilian communications and passes on the recordings to the USA as raw intelligence material."" Surveillance program is now Obama's to own .","Reports detail surveillance facility in bucolic setting .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's public prosecutor has ordered ex-President Mohamed Morsy and members of the Muslim Brotherhood to stand trial, according to a state-run media report Wednesday. The deposed leader and 35 Muslim Brotherhood members will be tried, accused of collaborating with foreign organizations to commit terrorist acts and revealing defense secrets, according to the al-Ahram newspaper. Morsy is accused of spying for the Palestinian group Hamas, which the United States classifies as a terrorist organization, and assisting in acts of terror inside Egypt, judicial sources told al-Ahram. His 35 co-defendants, who include former presidential advisers and prominent members of the Muslim Brotherhood, will face a court for ""collaborating with foreign states to commit terrorist acts in Egypt, revealing defense secrets to foreign countries, funding terrorists and military training to achieve the purposes of the international organization of the Brotherhood,"" a statement from the prosecutor-general's office said. The accusations seem to be in connection with Morsy's escape from prison during the 2011 uprising that ousted longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy has been in custody since being pushed out in July. He already faces charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule last December. Morsy has refused to recognize the court. Morsy took power as Egypt's first popularly elected president in June 2012. But his time was marked by continued unrest, much of it targeting him and the Muslim Brotherhood, the once-banned Islamist organization he once led. Conditions in the North African country have not improved significantly since the military forced out Morsy and assumed control. Authorities have taken various steps to quell the social unrest, including legislation passed barring unauthorized protests. Morsy's supporters have called for his reinstatement as president.","Morsy, 35 others to stand trial, al-Ahram reports .

"(CNN) -- So many visitors to Turkey see little more than the beautiful but crowded Mediterranean coast or the great mosques and palaces of Istanbul. But the country is huge, and there are many more attractions away from the tourist hotspots. Relics of vanished civilizations, a vast inland sea with a water-loving cat and a Biblical mountain with views deep into Iran and Armenia are just some of the reasons to go. 1. See it all from a train . For people who like intrepid journeys but like them even more when they're sitting or lying down, the Turkish rail system is heaven. From February 2014, if all goes to plan, you'll be able to whiz between Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey's capital, on a new high speed train. East of Ankara the pace slows. The Dogu Expresi (Eastern Express) leaves nightly at 6 p.m. and takes just more than 24 hours to trundle from Ankara to Kars, almost 1,500 kilometers away in the remote northeast. It stops at the cities of Kayseri, Sivas and Erzurum, passes through the rolling fields of Anatolia and ends among snow-topped eastern mountains. The two-berth cabins have a mini-fridge stocked with mineral water and soft drinks, and washbasins with hot and cold running water. A porter makes your bed and brings drinks and snacks during the day, and there's a dining car. You can book online at Turkish State Railways, or by phone (+90 0216 337 8724), but the English version of the site is clunky -- it's easier to book through a travel agent or buy tickets at a station. Tickets cost $45 in a one-berth cabin on the Ankara-Kars route. 2. Hunt rare ruins . It sometimes feels that you can't walk more than a few paces in Turkey without stubbing your toe on some millennia-old relic. Some sites -- such as ever-popular Ephesus -- are packed with visitors almost all year round. But remarkably few people visit the equally spectacular Aphrodisias, where you can wander around a square kilometer of ruined temples and theaters with only tortoises for company. The site reached its zenith around 2,000 years ago, when it was famed for its sculptors. You can see some of their work in the excellent on-site museum. Aphrodisias is around 160 kilometers from the coastal resorts of Bodrum, Marmaris or Kusadasi. The easiest way to get there is by car, and car rental is available at all resorts and at Dalaman Airport. Ancient Aphrodisias, Geyre Bedesi, Karcasu; +90 256 448 8003; open (site and museum) April-October, daily 10 a.m.-7 p.m.; November-March, daily 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; admission TL10 ($4.50) 3. Sail an inland sea . Up to 400 meters deep and almost 120 kilometers across, Lake Van is a true inland sea. With no outlet, its waters are saturated with mineral salts that turn the shallows milky blue. In its depths, colonies of extremophile bacteria form weird, 40-meter-high towers. Only one kind of fish -- pearl mullet or inci kefali -- has adapted to live in its hyper-alkaline waters. Van is also famous for a breed of water-loving and often odd-eyed cat, and is rumored to have its own monster. You can swim in the shallows, where it's almost impossible to sink beneath the surface. More than a thousand years ago, the lake was part of the kingdom of Armenia. The ancient Armenian Surb Kach (Holy Cross) church on Akdamar Island, three kilometers from thev lake shore, has remarkable frescoes and carvings, which have recently been restored. It can be visited by a combination of dolmus and small boat from Gevas, about 50 kilometers from Van. Grand Deniz Turizm, Van-Tatvan Highway, 40 kilometers from GevaÅŸ and Van (+90 432 612 4038), offers boat trips to Akdamar and other islands in the lake. 4. Cycle among mountains . Turkey has thousands of miles of mountain and forest trails. Some of the most spectacular cycling country is in the Kackar mountain range and the valley of the River Coruh, where you can also go whitewater rafting. With several peaks rising well above 3,000 meters (the highest, Kackardagi, is 3,932 meters high), these mountains are snow-covered much of the year. In summer -- the best time to visit is June to August -- they're cooler than better known cycling spots closer to the Med. For a really big adventure, you can follow mountain roads all the way down to the Black Sea coast and fly back to Istanbul or Ankara from Trabzon. You can fly to Erzurum from Istanbul or Ankara, or take the train (see above). The Coruh Valley is around 120 kilometers north of Erzurum and more than a thousand kilometers east of Istanbul. 5. Follow an epic walking trail . The Lycian Way feels like a path trodden by the ancients but in fact this walking route stretching from the Aegean coast to the Mediterranean was pioneered in 2000 by an Antalya-based expat, Kate Clow. For most of its length, it parallels the Lycian coast, but it soars to 1,800 meters above sea level at its highest point, the shoulder of Tahtali Dag (Mt Tahtali). The best place to start (or finish) is the small resort of Olu Deniz -- there are village guesthouses and campsites along the way. You need at least four weeks to walk the entire 509-kilometer distance, but public transport is plentiful -- so you can walk for a week, or even just for a day or two. Several airlines fly to both Dalaman (about 50 kilometers from Olu Deniz) and Antalya from Istanbul and direct from European airports. Best times to go are April-May and October. More information at Lycianway.com or Cultureroutesinturkey.com . 6. Climb Mt. Ararat . Noah's Ark is said to have come to rest on top of Turkey's highest mountain, the 5,137-meter Agri Dagi (Mt. Ararat). Some believe it's still there. From the summit of Ararat, you can see a vast swath of Turkey and deep into Iran and Armenia. Ararat is a hard slog, requiring some technical mountain skills. The terrain is rugged, and climbers must contend with extremes of heat and cold -- the highest summit is snow-covered all year, and summer temperatures at the foot of the mountain can reach more than 30 C. It's essential to go with a trustworthy specialist company, avoiding amateur local guides who claim to know the mountain but lack skills needed for a safe trip. Getting to the top and back takes at least five days, using mules to carry tents and supplies. The ascent starts from the the city of Dogubayazit, about 1,500 kilometers east of Istanbul. Nearest major airports are at Erzurum and Van, both around 4-5 hours' drive. Turkish Mountaineering Federation, Hani A Blok Kat 4, 06050 Ulus, Ankara; +90 312310 1578 . Getting around . Travel in Turkey is affordable and efficient. If you mix and match road, rail and air transport, there's no part of the country you can't reach. Every town has its otogar (bus station), from which air-conditioned, long-distance coaches zoom to all points of the compass. On board, you can expect free tea, soft drinks, water, snacks and a squirt of eau de cologne from smartly dressed stewards. You can buy tickets in advance, but you should shop around for the best fare, because several lines compete on each route. For shorter journeys, you can pile into a dolmus. These minibuses run on fixed routes, but not at fixed times -- they leave when they're full. Turkish Airlines (+ 90 212 444 0849) flies to Istanbul and Ankara from major cities worldwide, with connections to Antalya, Dalaman, Erzurum, Trabzon and Van from Istanbul and Ankara. Other internal airlines with extensive domestic networks include Atlasjet (+90 850 222 0000) which flies to Antalya, Erzurum and Trabzon from Istanbul; Onur Air (+90 850 210 6687) flies to Antalya, Dalaman, Erzurum and Trabzon from Istanbul; Pegasus (+90 850 250 0737) flies to Erzurum and Van from Istanbul and Ankara.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former U.S. soldier accused of fighting with terrorists against Syrian forces pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was released from custody. Eric Harroun was sentenced to time served by a federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia, on Thursday. Court documents showed he pleaded guilty to an export charge involving conspiracy to transfer defense articles and services. The Phoenix man entered into a plea agreement with the government which remains under seal. Harroun was arrested in March and charged with conspiring to use a rocket propelled grenade while fighting with the al-Nusra Front, an alias name for the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq. If convicted of that charge, he faced a possible sentence of 30 years to life. Harroun allegedly posted videos on the Internet showing him with weapons. At a court hearing the next month, a federal prosecutor took the unusual step of revealing Harroun had been on a ""no-fly"" list and had been removed so he could fly from Turkey to the United States where he was arrested. This allowed U.S. authorities to take custody of Harroun without asking Turkey to arrest him and hand him over. The prosecutor did not say how long Harroun had been on the ""no fly"" list or whether he was aware of it. FBI agents observed him during the flight although he was not taken into custody until after he arrived in the United States. It's also not clear whether Harroun's name is back on the list. According to an FBI affidavit made public at the time of his arrest, Harroun crossed into Syria in January where he received training from the al-Nusra Front on how to use rocket propelled grenades and posted still photos and videos of himself on the Internet handling the RPGs and other weapons. The FBI interviewed him three times in Istanbul about his activities before he flew to the United States. The case appeared to present the United States with a thorny problem -- Harroun allegedly was fighting against the Syrian government which the United States also opposes. But the United States considers the al-Nusra Front a terrorist group. At the April hearing, federal public defender Geremy Kamens noted an FBI agent who testified said there was no evidence Harroun was involved in any terrorist activities. Harroun served in the Army from 2000 to 2003.","Eric Harroun initially charged with fighting alongside group affiliated with al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez pleaded not guilty Friday in the shooting death of a friend whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park. It was his sixth time appearing in a courtroom since his June 26 arrest. Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the June 17 death of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player. He also faces various weapons charges. He will be held without bail until his next court appearance on October 9. Hernandez, 23, was let go by the Patriots after his arrest. Investigation continues in another case . Friday's arraignment came as authorities continue to investigate Hernandez in connection with an unsolved 2012 double homicide case in Boston. Investigators have obtained July 2012 video surveillance allegedly showing Hernandez at a nightclub at the same time as two men who were fatally shot that night, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. The video apparently does not show Hernandez interacting with Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, according to a law enforcement source. The development was first reported Wednesday by the Hartford Courant. Boston police have said the men were inside a BMW that was sprayed with gunfire after they left the nightclub. Law enforcement sources said they believe Hernandez rented a silver SUV with Rhode Island registration that was linked to the scene of the double homicide. After Lloyd's murder, Bristol, Connecticut, police discovered the vehicle by accident while searching the garage of Hernandez's uncle, a law enforcement source told CNN. Boston police had been looking for the vehicle for almost a year, law enforcement sources added. Hernandez has not been charged in the unsolved double shooting. His attorneys have previously declined to comment to CNN when asked about the ongoing Boston investigation. Defense: Jury will find him 'innocent' A Bristol County, Massachusetts, grand jury last month indicted Hernandez on a first-degree murder charge and five weapons charges. Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the shooting of Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Defense attorney Michael Fee said he was pleased with the indictment because it gave his client ""a path to trial,"" where a jury will find Hernandez ""innocent."" Police have not located the gun believed to have been used to kill Lloyd. But prosecutors say Hernandez returned a rental car with a bullet casing that allegedly matched bullets found at the scene. Surveillance cameras showed the car believed to be carrying Hernandez and the others at the southeastern Massachusetts industrial park where Lloyd's body was found, according to authorities. Another Hernandez defense attorney, Charles Rankin, asserted that ""not one shred of evidence has been presented yet."" ""At the end of the day, we're confident that Aaron is going to be exonerated and we look forward to that process,"" Rankin said. Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter said authorities have more than circumstantial evidence against Hernandez. ""There's a tremendous amount of evidence,"" he told reporters. One of Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou, said Friday that ""these are very difficult days. ""We just keep praying to get through this,"" she said. The next court hearing is scheduled for October 9, when the judge will hear a defense motion to extend and make more stringent a gag order, Sutter said. Hernandez has been sitting in a jail cell as his former team, known for its stellar offense, contends for another Super Bowl title. The Patriots open their regular season Sunday against the Buffalo Bills. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Phil Gast and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Defense attorney says ""not one shred of evidence has been presented yet""

"Concepcion, Philippines (CNN) -- ""Hi Kee-ran!"" From out of the crowd lining the roadside, I hear a voice calling enthusiastically. It's Rowena and her 5-month-old baby, waiting patiently in line for the latest distribution of relief supplies to arrive in Concepcion. Ten days ago, Rowena was the first person I met in this town, huddled by candlelight with her family of eight in a school. They had been living in the third grade classroom with two other families since November 8, when Typhoon Haiyan ripped through the Western Visayas region of the Philippines and destroyed their homes. Unfailingly polite, always smiling, and ever courteous, she has become a symbol in my mind of the people of Concepcion and their grace under pressure. Some unseen force has compelled me to pick up my camera and go for one last walkabout before leaving this place. Over the next hour, as the sun sets on this storm-battered coastal town, I meet many of the characters who have narrated its story and provided me with a salient lesson in dignity and resilience. Rowena is handed a token for the distribution by a man named Johnny Franco. Grizzled and tough, he is a local councilor and president of the Fisherman's Association. He's also a criminologist by training and a fish processor by profession. The Philippines is a quirky country. Earlier in the week, Johnny took us on a tour of Sitio Puntalouis, a poor fishing neighborhood clinging to a nearby stretch of coastline. He introduced us to family after family who had lost their homes and their livelihoods to the storm. But, tellingly, there was one very important fact which he failed to mention that morning -- his own losses. As I chat with him, the sun setting on the sea behind us, he laughingly gestures to a broken fishing boat lying by the roadside. ""That landed on my house,"" he says. And there in front of us is the pile of concrete rubble which is all that remains of the Franco home. Johnny, his wife and two daughters have been living under a tarpaulin and surviving on relief supplies. ""My sister is rebuilding, so we can live with her for a while. She's married to an Australian, so they can afford it."" Johnny's fish-drying business has also been destroyed and, like so many other people here, he has no way to make a living. Yet he shrugs and tells me life will go on. Smoke is drifting along the seafront and flaming bonfires of debris are being fed by a group of local people under the watchful and mischievous eye of Jun Garilva. ""This is a community effort to get on with the cleanup,"" he laughs. ""We're not waiting for the municipality to do it."" Like so many men here, he is a former seaman and has traveled the world as a bosun on container ships. Now he is the proud owner, along with his wife Bee, of the somewhat battered Jun Bee Resort hotel. On the day of the typhoon, they were forced to abandon the building when a 20-foot storm surge smashed through the ground floor, destroying all before it. They have tidied up as best they can and are playing host to various foreign and Filipino aid workers. ""I think it will take the town six months to recover from this,"" he muses, serious for a moment, ""but we will recover."" Across the road, another sign of recovery: In the dying light, a group of young men are boisterously indulging in the national sporting obsession -- basketball. They have cleared a space among the fallen trees, broken bamboo poles and general debris which has come to form so much of the landscape here. ""Hey Joe,"" one of them calls in the ubiquitous greeting for white foreigners, which is a throwback to the U.S. military presence here during World War II. ""Come and join us."" Despite the fact that I have six inches on most of them, I respectfully decline, knowing they would run rings around me. Across the town, there is a reassuring buzz and bustle; traders manning their stalls by candlelight, a preacher calling to the world through a battery-powered sound system, and light pouring from the local church. Inside, a group of people gather to say the rosary and share each other's company. This is a deeply religious country, predominantly catholic. Father Tujaha is away in the city of Iloilo tonight. Yesterday he told me he had secured funding from a religious order to help rebuild 10 fishing boats and was hoping to get funding for 10 more. His main mission though, is to find a way to rebuild the elementary school next door. ""We will succeed,"" he says, smiling. On the other side of the square, the hum of a generator comes from behind the municipal hall. Inside, I find Mayor Villanueva at his desk working on the local government response to the crisis. For the past three weeks, he and his team have been here day and night organizing, coordinating and administering. Across from the mayor, Leo Ladaquin gives a weary wave and calls a greeting, ""Hello my friend! Is there anything you need?"" Leo is a farmer by profession, but has been working as a volunteer since Haiyan hit, organizing boatloads of supplies to the outlying islands. I wave back and turn away to hide my emotion, realizing that I'm undoubtedly the least needy person in this town. And yet people who have lost everything have consistently offered me what little they have, be it coffee, spam or just a welcoming smile. And never, not once, has anybody ever asked me for anything. Leaving the Municipal Hall, I bump into Luna, a native of Concepcion who has come back to help coordinate the civil society response. She is the one who brought us here. As she waves off a mini-bus loaded with volunteers from a church group in Iloilo, I ask her what it is that makes this place special. ""You know, I was just thinking about this last night,"" she answers. ""I am amazed by the bond that exists between the people here, the sense of community."" She points to a sign which has appeared in the plaza which, roughly translated, reads ""We love Concepcion and we will rebuild it."" As I head home, ""Hi Kee-ran"" rings out through the darkness and I can just make out the form of Rowena and some of her family gathered around an open fire. The kids pose and joke for the camera. Their temporary classroom home has been reclaimed for lessons and they have been moved to a tent. Still homeless. Still smiling.","Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013 .

"(CNN) -- A wave of protests broke out at Syrian embassies on several continents amid reports of hundreds of deaths in one Syrian city and hours before a possible U.N. Security Council vote on a response to the violent crackdown in the country. Here's a breakdown of some of the demonstrations Friday and Saturday: . CAIRO . Egyptian police arrested 12 people, mostly Syrians, accused of setting the first floor of the Syrian embassy in Cairo on fire, according to Egyptian police Maj. Karim El-Fouli. Groups of Syrians outside the police station demanded the release of those detained, El-Fouli said. About 100 people sat outside the police station, leading to a tense standoff with police, said Sumer Badr, a Syrian activist in Cairo. Badr said demonstrators gathered because of the ""massacre"" in Homs. (The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition activist group, had reported that more than 200 people were killed in the besieged city Homs. One activist told CNN the assault on Homs took place after dozens of soldiers from the Syrian army defected and fled into the city.) Syrians in Cairo chanted, ""Mubarak gone gone, Assad next next"" -- references to former Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted after a popular uprising last year, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom many Syrian protesters are demanding step down. LONDON . About 150 protesters gathered outside the Syrian embassy in Belgrave Square, London's Metropolitan Police said, and five people were arrested after gaining entry to the building in the early hours Saturday. One person was arrested for assault on a police officer. The demonstrators called for the ouster of al-Assad. The protest continued outside the embassy Saturday afternoon. Syrian Ambassador to London Dr. Sami al Khiyami told CNN one room had been broken into and furniture damaged. The U.K. Foreign Office condemned the break-in and said it was reviewing security arrangements. BERLIN . Thirty-one people broke through the locked doors of the Syrian embassy in Berlin, police said. The men -- all Syrian or of Syrian decent -- infiltrated the building, destroyed office furniture and displayed a flag out of an embassy's office window, Berlin police said. The intruders also spray-painted slogans on walls. Police arrived and detained all the men, who were later released. WASHINGTON . A few dozen protesters gathered outside the Syrian embassy in Washington on Friday night. Some chanted, ""shame, shame, shame on you."" The demonstration was largely peaceful. KUWAIT . A group of Syrian nationals as well as Kuwaiti citizens stormed Syria's embassy in Kuwait early Saturday, damaging property in the building, the state-run Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said. The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry condemned the incident, saying it was a ""breach on Kuwait's policy towards diplomatic missions in the country,"" according to KUNA. Both Syrian nationals and Kuwaitis were arrested, the agency said, but the exact number was not released.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama stands at a significant crossroad. On Wednesday, he received a set of recommendations from a panel he appointed to review the government's surveillance programs -- a decision he made after Edward Snowden's blockbuster leaks about National Security Agency spying triggered outrage. The choices he makes will permanently place his signature on the intelligence initiative and help define his legacy as a chief executive who promised a more open and transparent government when he entered the White House nearly five years ago. NSA domestic and international phone and e-mail surveillance is considered some of the most widespread intelligence gathering performed by the U.S. government. As a presidential candidate, he sharply criticized his predecessor, George W. Bush, for creating and expanding a foreign intelligence program that included communications of American citizens. ""This administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance civil liberties. It is not,"" Obama said during a speech in 2007. ""There are no shortcuts to protecting America."" But since becoming President, Obama changed his posture as he came face-to-face with national security priorities in a post 9/11 world. He no longer criticized the NSA program. In fact, he maintained its status quo and rarely talked about it. Until he was forced to. Snowden released documents earlier this year that revealed the scope of surveillance, including the bulk collection of numbers, times and dates of telephone calls made by Americans. NSA official: Snowden amnesty ""worth having a conversation about' Obama did not promise changes to the program amid the resulting storm of controversy, but did authorize a review of NSA practices and more steps to protect personal privacy. ""What I recognize is that we're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards and as technology moves forward, that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance,"" Obama told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview on ""New Day"" in August. With that independent review, which found that the government needs to do a better job to protect civil liberties, complete, the President has a choice to make. Will he be the chief executive who truly champions civil liberties or one who cements government surveillance of its citizens in the name of national security? Alex Abdo, staff attorney at the ACLU's National Security Program, which is involved in lawsuits challenging government surveillance, said the President has reached ""a tipping point"" in his tenure. ""He can chose to follow the recommendations from the panel he selected or he can choose to double down on the bulk surveillance of innocent Americans,"" Abdo said. Report: NSA snooping program should stay in place . While the independent report said the surveillance program should stay in place, it suggested more than 40 changes that would rein in the scope and provide more oversight. Among the recommendations: ""The government should not be permitted to collect and store all mass, undigested, non-public personal information about individuals."" Perhaps most critical is the report's finding that the bulk collection of information is ""not essential to preventing attacks."" ""We have identified a series of reforms that are designed to safeguard the privacy and dignity of American citizens, and to promote public trust, while also allowing the Intelligence Community to do what must be done to respond to genuine threat,"" the authors of the report wrote. Surveillance watchdogs in Congress said the report shows that it is too encompassing and question whether it makes the country safer. ""The message to the NSA now coming from every branch of government, from every corner of our nation: NSA you've gone too far,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said. The report is coupled with a court decision this week that found the collection of data on nearly every call made by U.S. phone subscribers is likely unconstitutional. While that decision doesn't mandate any changes to the program, the issue is expected to reach the Supreme Court. 5 questions about the NSA court ruling . It is now up to Obama, the program's one-time critic, to steer the direction of sweeping intelligence gathering. And at first glance, significant changes are unlikely. Less than 24 hours after the release of the report, Obama rejected one recommendation to install a civilian head of the NSA and split off its military ties. ""The administration has decided that keeping the positions of NSA Director and Cyber Command Commander together as one, dual-hatted position is the most effective approach to accomplishing both agencies' missions,"" NSA spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the President's objective is to ""maintain the program while making reforms to it."" Further indications of the President's reluctance to be pinned down emerged after a meeting with executives from the top tech companies. Following the sesssion this week at the White House on Tuesday, one participant said they were frustrated with the lack of discussion on the NSA program. The technology industry has pressured Obama to make changes to the federal snooping programs, concerned their bottom lines could take a hit. Last week, a group of top firms wrote an open letter to Obama alleging the spy programs undermine ""the freedoms we all cherish"" and declaring: ""It's time for a change."" The public will have to wait until January to know what course Obama will take. That's when he is expected to deliver a national address to announce and explain any changes. CNN's Jim Sciutto, Evan Perez and Jim Acosta contributed to this report .","President Obama has to decide what recommendations he will adopt from spy review .

"(CNN) -- Ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and 132 others will face trial for escaping from prison in 2011, state media reported Saturday. Morsy will be tried along with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian Hamas, al-Ahram newspaper reported. He is also charged with raiding other prisons, and killing soldiers and officers in Rafah, it said. This is the latest in a series of legal woes for the deposed leader. This week, state media reported that Morsy and 35 Muslim Brotherhood members will be tried for allegedly collaborating with foreign organizations to commit terrorist acts and revealing defense secrets, according to al-Ahram. Morsy is accused of spying for the Palestinian group Hamas, which the United States classifies as a terrorist organization, and assisting in acts of terror inside Egypt, judicial sources told al-Ahram. He has been in custody since his ouster in July. He already faces charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule last year. Morsy has refused to recognize the court.","Morsy will be tried along with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian Hamas .

"(CNN) -- Nearly three hours after the crash, David Eun walked through customs at San Francisco International Airport. By then, the adrenaline rush was subsiding enough that he could begin processing the enormity of it all. He'd just survived a catastrophe. The Samsung executive describes himself on his Twitter profile as being an ""all-American Korean"" a ""pensive optimist"" and a frequent flier. He's used to getting on planes and crossing the Pacific. He'd been at the same airport in April for a weeklong trip to Seoul, where Samsung is headquartered. Asiana Flight 214 might have been just another plane ride for Eun. Instead, the tech savvy businessman found himself bracing for life as something went terribly wrong in the landing. And he tweeted the experience. ""I just crash landed at SFO. Tail ripped off. Most everyone seems fine. I'm ok. Surreal ..."" Other passengers on the plane described a harrowing experience. Elliott Stone could see the tarmac below him. The angle of descent seemed too sharp. The pilot tried to raise it at the last minute, said another passenger. In vain. ""And then right when it appeared to coast for the landing, all of a sudden the engine was off, like you sped up, like the pilot knew he was short. And then the back end just hit and flies up in the air and everybody's head goes up to the ceiling."" He said the back of the plane broke off. That's where several flight attendants were sitting. Several people watched the plane crash from the airport or other nearby areas. Still others saw it up close, sitting in other planes on the tarmac. For them it was like watching a frightening movie. Only, it was all real. Flight data recorders recovered from crash . Witnesses describe unusual landing . Everything looked normal at first. The plane was coming into the airport Saturday in a routine flight pattern. But then the wheels seemed too low too soon, said Dan Glickman. When a plane lands, there is typically white smoke from the friction of the wheels. But there was a large plume of white smoke when Flight 214 touched down. Then people heard a pop and a fireball burst out from underneath the aircraft. ""It just pancaked immediately. It collapsed and then it slid,"" Glickman told CNN affiliate KTVU. ""It just kept sliding and sliding and sliding. I was surprised it didn't come apart. It was unreal."" Danielle Wells also saw the plane go down. ""Literally just witnessed a plane crash start to finish. I cannot stop crying I can't believe this,"" she said on Twitter. Kristina Stapchuck saw the crash from a window seat on another plane. She saw Flight 214 rock back and forth and the tail come off. Other parts came off and shattered everywhere on the runway. It looked like the plane was sliding on its belly all the way down the runway. ""It all happened so suddenly,"" she said. People who watched it happen feared the worst. They could see the inside of the plane in orange glow from the fire. Smoke was billowing from the plane. One passenger on the plane shot a photograph that showed flames and smoke bursting out of the plane's windows. Those outside thought it was instant death for everyone aboard. Flames and smoke were bursting out of many of the aircraft's windows. Why the crash was survivable . Passengers dashed from aircraft . Eunice Bird Rah's father was on Flight 214. He sent her text messages telling her he was fine. He didn't want her to worry so he chose his words carefully. ""I think ... he didn't want me to know the full-on details of what was going on around him,"" Rah said. Passengers huddled together and pushed open emergency exit doors, Stone said. Some didn't bother to use evacuation slides; they jumped directly out onto the tarmac to save themselves. Ben Levy helped people out even though he had broken ribs. He tweeted a photo of fellow passengers sitting atop their bags. Behind them, the Asiana jet sat consumed in smoke. At the airport, witnesses said they could see people running out. ""I was happy to see that some people were running out,"" said one man. ""Then I went, 'Oh my god, some people lived.' Then emergency responders and firefighters were all over the tarmac. ""They're evacuating the injured,"" Eun tweeted again. ""Haven't felt this way since 9/11."" He was one of the lucky ones aboard Saturday. There were 291 passengers and 16 crew members on Flight 214. ""Friends, pls don't call right now. I'm fine,"" he tweeted. ""Most people are totally calm and trying to let the fire and rescue do their jobs,"" he said. ""Just like during 9/11, most people are great and try to be helpful in crisis..."" The charred carcass of the jet was still on the runway. Many of Eun's fellow passengers were in Bay Area hospitals. When he finally left customs, Eun began to think about it all -- and about all the people he cherished. Expert: Shouldn't have been close to hitting seawall .

"Syria (CNN) -- We'd been in Damascus for several weeks, watching out of our windows as smoke hovered almost daily over the city's skyline. Where we were staying holed up was somewhat safe but it didn't insulate us from the noise of the battles threatening to engulf the Syrian capital. One day we stood outside a local ice cream seller's shop as tracer fire lit up the night sky. The ice cream seller then tried to give us our cones for free. As foreigners, we stood out in a crowd of locals, all of whom were weirdly protective of Damascus and put out that we weren't seeing their city at its best. In a lull in the fighting one man turned and asked me if I'd gotten chance to see the window St. Paul was lowered from before his escape to Europe - a popular attraction for western tourists. I promised I'd put it on my list of things to do. All of us were trying to avoid discussing ""these problems"" as Damascenes euphemistically refer to the threatening civil war. In private, others were more forthcoming. In a doctor's examining room, on auto pilot I started my practiced patter that ""things weren't as bad as I'd expected,"" only to be cut short by the doctor who said simply, ""You seem really nice, please promise you'll go back to your country soon."" Syria faces societal fissures . But I didn't want to go, there was so much more here I wanted - needed - to see. The next day though I thought of his advice. After successfully navigating the Damascus back streets to avoid the myriad checkpoints it was with a great sense of irony that we had to pull over at one to ask for directions to the nearest highway out of town. My only hope was that the soldier would believe that actual ""terrorists"" -- as the Syrian authorities refer to the opposition fighters and activists -- would surely be slicker. With a great show of exasperation he described the route out to Daraya, checked we'd understood and made a great show of waving us through. At the next checkpoint the soldier had a list of those wanted for questioning, I held my breath as he looked me over. Two meters, about the length of the car's hood, up the road there was yet another checkpoint, this one had appeared while were navigating the first two. Eventually though we were through and on our way to ""Free Syria"" as Daraya had declared itself. Its citizens were among the first to take to the streets after the Syrian uprising began but the town's proximity to the Mezza military airport had brought them uncomfortable scrutiny from the Air Force Intelligence service. The young activists we met told us with pride that Daraya had almost emptied as security raids hunted activists down in alleyways and as they hid at the homes of friends and relatives. Nowhere was safe for them. But that was then. For most of the last two months the Free Syrian Army had maintained control over the town. Regime forces had to content themselves with shelling from a distance. As we drove through town we found a clean up underway and for the first time the anxiety I'd been carrying around all the time while in Syria had started to dissipate. Their belief that the war had been won was clearly catching. When it came time to break the fast, -- this was during the Muslim month of Ramadan -- they spread out local delicacies and made me try a liquorice drink that was possibly the most disgusting thing I'd ever tasted. U.S.: Assad 'disconnected from reality' They laughed and snapped pictures on their phones as I struggled to keep a straight face. Until then I hadn't realized quite how young they all were. Looking around properly I realized they were all in their late teens or early twenties. One young man came and sat at the end of the table with me. He wanted to talk about his detention at the hands of the Syrian forces. As his story tumbled out, I had to struggle to take in what he was describing. He told me that he'd been raped with wooden sticks during interrogations; that he'd watched others forced to carry out sexual acts on each other, and that during the beatings they would make them hold salt in their mouths. He recounted a litany of abuse and humiliations, all in the same deadpan voice. Two more young men came forward with similar stories. They showed me the scars the shackles had left on their ankles and wrists, and the marks of the electric clips on their nipples. They seemed to want to tell me everything. We too quickly ran out of time. They were very keen for me to see their nightly demonstration, though it more closely resembled a celebration. Young men joining arms around drummers performing the familiar chants of the revolution that we'd all grown accustomed to from grainy YouTube videos but this time inflected with song and the belief that victory was close. As we drove to where we were spending the night we heard the rumble of mortars overhead. ""Don't worry,"" we were told. ""It's somebody else's turn tonight."" On our next visit I had gotten so used to hearing in Damascus that ""something is happening"" that I was almost inured to it but when the shelling began it felt closer then it ever had. We were advised to leave and we did. Many of those who helped us are still inside Syria so I don't want to say anything more but in the days and nights after we left I stayed close to my laptop and phone. In the beginning they tried to stay in touch. As bombs fell they went out and filmed video after gruesome video. I play them back, listening to the voices of young men I'd grown to know and like, narrate the unfolding massacre. Very quickly, even that contact was gone. The government had cut the power supply in to Daraya and conserving phones was a matter of survival. It's they only way they can hope to let the world know what is happening. To protect their families many have gone in to hiding, constantly on the move. Every once in a while I'll see that they've managed to get online but only very briefly and then they're gone again. This is the only proof I have that they are still alive. Syria explained: What you need to know .","In Damascus, people watch as tracer fire lit up the sky .
Locals were annoyed we were not seeing the best of their city .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian activist hailed by many fellow protesters as a hero, had a message Wednesday for his country's leaders: ""If you are true Egyptians, if you are heroic Egyptians, it's time to step down."" Ghonim, who was freed Monday after being held by Egyptian authorities for 10 days, said it is ""no longer the time to negotiate"" with the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ""There's a lot of blood now"" that has been spilled, he said. It's time for people at the highest levels of the government ""to apologize to the families"" of those killed, he said. Follow Wael Ghonim on Twitter . Human Rights Watch said Tuesday 302 people had been killed in the Egyptian protests -- 232 in Cairo, 52 in Alexandria and 18 in Suez. ""A lot of times, the policeman would stand on the bridge and shoot people down,"" Ghonim said. ""This is a crime. The president need to step down because this is a crime."" Ghonim played a key role in organizing the protests that have convulsed Egypt for more than two weeks. He was the administrator of a Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest January 25. ""The plan was to get everyone onto the street,"" he said. ""Number one was that we are going to start from poor areas."" As the plan succeeded, the organizers' tactics shifted, he said. ""We went on the street on the 25th and we wanted to negotiate,"" he said. ""They decided to negotiate with us at night with rubber bullets, with police sticks, with water hoses, with tear gas and with arresting about 500 people. Thanks. We got the message. Now, when we escalated this and it became really big, they started listening to us."" The 30-year-old was on leave from his job at Google in Dubai, where he lives with his wife and two children, when he went to Egypt to participate in the demonstrations. Ghonim, who refers to himself as an Egyptian activist, describes himself as ""Head of Marketing -- Middle East & North Africa at Google"" on his LinkedIn.com profile. His disappearance on January 28 captured international attention. ""I work for the best company to work for in the world,"" he said. ""I have the best wife and I love my kids, but I'm willing to lose all of that for my dream to happen, and no one is going to go against our desire. No one."" Then, with a tear track running down his cheek, he challenged Vice President Omar Suleiman to try to undo his efforts and those of his supporters. ""Kidnap me, kidnap all my colleagues!"" he said. ""Put us in jail! Kill us! Do whatever you want to do. We are getting back our country. You guys have been ruining this country for 30 years. Enough! Enough! Enough!"" He showed CNN on Wednesday a notarized power of attorney granting control of all his assets to his wife. Holding it up, he said, ""I'm ready to die"" to bring change to Egypt. Ghonim cited as his greatest heroes Mohandas K. Gandhi, the father of India's independence movement, and Mark Zuckerberg, the 26-year-old founder of Facebook. A crowd of thousands cheered Ghonim on Tuesday when he spoke at Tahrir Square, where hundreds of thousands of protesters have demanded change for more than two weeks. As he walked through the streets of his upscale neighborhood Wednesday, unaccompanied by security and clutching a laptop, passersby recognized him and ran up to kiss him on the cheek and embrace him. A taxi driver stopped his car in traffic, got out and hugged the 30-year-old executive. Another driver handed a cell phone to Ghonim and asked him to say a few words to his daughter. Yet Ghonim said he is uncomfortable about being the face of the popular uprising in Egypt. ""This is not about me,"" he said several times during an hour-long interview in a relative's Cairo apartment. Ghonim added that he is proud of the protests, which he described as a ""youth revolution"" and ""Revolution 2.0."" The Muslim Brotherhood, he said, played no role in organizing the initial protests, and in fact ""would not participate."" Ghonim conceded that Mubarak has ""sacrificed a lot"" for Egypt but said the 82-year-old leader represents a system that needs to be replaced. He demanded that Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party be dissolved immediately. He also said, though, that Mubarak should be treated with dignity. He said the initial goal of the protests was to call for the resignation of Egypt's unpopular interior minister and demand improved conditions for the poor. The calls for Mubarak's resignation came after Egyptian security forces responded to peaceful protests with force, he said. Police clashed with protesters in the early days of the protests, before being replaced by the military, which created a generally more peaceful atmosphere. Ghonim, who comes from an affluent Egyptian family, said the activists who organized the protests intentionally designed their movement to be anonymous and faceless, without a clear leader. He cited the movie ""V for Vendetta"" as a source of inspiration. When asked whether he was referring to a famous scene of the film's protagonist blowing up Parliament in London, Ghonim laughed. No, he said, he drew inspiration from a character who anonymously advocated for change.","NEW: ""I'm willing to lose all of that for my dream to happen""

"(CNN) -- Has nothing been learned from ""Ironside?"" The recent NBC reboot of the classic crime drama featuring Blair Underwood in the role made famous by Raymond Burr in the late 1960s and early 1970s was one of the first of the fall television shows canceled. But don't think that will stem the tide of reboots yet to come. Get ready for new versions of ""Remington Steele,"" ""Charmed,"" ""Boy Meets World"" (which will be updated to ""Girl Meets World""), ""Love, American Style,"" ""Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous."" And some of the former cast members of ""Falcon Crest"" have been saying they've been approached about a possible reboot of the nighttime soap. So everyone should be excited that these popular shows will be getting new life, right? Wrong. Rose McGowan, one of the stars of the original ""Charmed,"" tweeted ""they really are running out of ideas in Hollywood"" while her former co-star Alyssa Milano tweeted ""the thing about them doing a #charmed reboot is ... it just ... it feels like yesterday. It feels too close."" Seems Milano and fellow former co-star Shannen Doherty would rather see the series end up on the big screen than redone on TV. Both recently tweeted in support of a ""Charmed"" film. Fall TV scorecard . Hollywood has long loved a reboot. The movie industry appears to offer sequel after sequel to capitalize an an already existing fan base, so bringing back a beloved show would seem to make sense. But Zap2it's Laurel Brown points out that ""for the most part, it's the shows that don't know why they exist -- other than having a connection to the past -- that falter. This is, unfortunately, all too common a problem."" ""It's hard to make a TV show a success,"" she wrote. ""That's the thinking that often seems to be behind the idea of a reboot. But are reboots any help? Looking at their recent history, the answer may be a resounding no."" We have seen it with shows such as ""Charlies Angel's,"" ""The Bionic Woman,"" ""Love Boat,"" ""Knight Rider,"" ""Get Smart"" and ""Melrose Place."" This season's ""Ironside"" was declared ""worst new drama"" by reviewer Brian Tallerico. As one TV Guide writer said, ""Sometimes viewers have such strong memories of an original that the new version can never compare."" ""Honing the 'spirit' of a beloved show is difficult; recapturing it is even more so,"" writes Brie Hiramine of Flavorwire. ""There is no magic formula for creating television that resonates, especially when trying to appease preexisting fans."" Sequel mania: A guide to the next five years of films . Not all of the redux retro shows, fail, however. Brown notes that sci-fi and fantasy genres seem to do well getting makeovers a la ""Battlestar Galactica"" and CBS has found success with the crime drama ""Hawaii Five-O."" TNT's ""Dallas"" has also done well with audiences (TNT is owned by CNN's parent company). And for a little dash of irony, it was recently announced that -- just in time for the 20th anniversary of the series -- there will be a reboot of the cartoon show ""Reboot.""","There are several television reboots planned .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Car bombs rocked a number of predominantly Shiite Muslim neighborhoods of Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 13 people and wounding 53 others, police officials told CNN. The violence adds to the particularly bloody fighting and political instability that Iraq and its capital, Baghdad, has seen in recent months. Six car bombs detonated Monday in five neighborhoods across Baghdad within a period of about two hours, police said. The blasts come two days after at least 19 people were killed in bombings in the capital. Separately, on Wednesday, at least 61 people were killed and scores wounded in attacks in Baghdad and across the country. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed in violence, most of them civilians. Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since fighting broke out recently to the west of Baghdad in Anbar province, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraq's security forces have been battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. The violence recalls the bloody fighting at the height of the Iraq War that nearly tore the country apart. On Saturday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden talked with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki about U.S. support for Iraq's fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group trying to overthrow the Iraqi government. Biden's office said the two leaders agreed on the importance of the Iraqi government's continued outreach to local and tribal leaders in Anbar province.","Six car bombs explode in five neighborhoods across Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations suspended all activities in Syria on Saturday due to the escalating levels of violence, the head of the global body's mission said. ""There has been an intensification of armed violence across Syria over the past 10 days,"" said Gen. Robert Mood, head of the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria. ""This escalation is limiting our ability to observe, verify, report as well as assist in local dialogue and stability projects -- basically impeding our ability to carry out our mandate,"" Mood said. The situation, Mood said, was too high risk. 'Choking siege' leaves Syrian town in crisis . The U.N. monitors, whose number gradually rose to about 300, were sent in to ensure that both President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters were abiding by a six-point peace plan brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan. A ceasefire took hold April 12 but only nominally, it turned out. Violence has soared in recent days with reports of heavy government bombardment of town and chilling massacres of civilians. On some occasions, the monitors themselves have come under fire. ""The lack of willingness by the parties to seek a peaceful transition, and the push towards advancing military positions is increasing the losses on both sides: innocent civilians, men women and children are being killed every day,"" Mood said. He said U.N. observers will no longer be conducting patrols and will stay in their locations until further notice. This suspension will be reviewed on a daily basis, Mood said. Operations will resume when we see the situation fit for us to carry out our mandated activities. Syrian opposition groups estimate that between 12,000 and 14,000 people have died in the months of uprising against al-Assad's rule.","The United Nations says Syria poses too much of a risk for observers .

"(CNN) -- Move over, Coke. It looks like Apple is the real thing. The tech giant has ended Coca-Cola's 13-year run as the world's most valuable brand on a highly regarded annual list. And the rivalry between Apple and Google has apparently been good to both. Bolstered by the dominance of its Android operating system, Google also leapfrogged Coke, moving into second place on Interbrand's yearly Best Global Brands list. They headed a tech-heavy list, on which IBM, Microsoft, Samsung and Intel helped round out the top 10. But Apple shone brightest, as much for its role as a cultural institution as for the products themselves. ""Every so often, a company changes our lives, not just with its products, but with its ethos,"" Interbrand CEO Jez Frampton said in the report. ""This is why, following Coca-Cola's 13-year run at the top of Best Global Brands, Interbrand has a new No. 1 -- Apple."" Interbrand, which consults with companies about their public image, compiles its list based on financial performance of the company, the role the brand plays in influencing consumers, and how secure the brand's top money-making products are in their field. According to the report, Apple's brand is estimated to be worth $98.3 billion, a 28% increase over 2012, when it was No. 2 on the list. Coca-Cola's value also rose, but by only 2%, to $79.2 billion. Much of Apple's boost can probably be attributed to its growing presence in China, where iPhones and other Apple devices are increasingly popular. Apple and Google were just two of many tech companies among the list's fastest-rising brands. Facebook gained 43% to hit No. 52, making it the only social-media site on the list. Amazon jumped 27% to No. 19. Last year Google was fourth on the list. ""Tech brands continue to dominate Interbrand's Best Global Brands report -- underscoring the fundamental and invaluable role they play in consumers' lives,"" the report reads. The report estimates that the list's tech companies have a combined value of more than $443 billion. Last year Apple eclipsed Microsoft to become the most valuable public company in history, although its stock has since dipped. This year, Apple was surpassed by Samsung in the total number of smartphones sold worldwide, and some in the tech community knocked the company for what they perceived as a lack of innovation compared to its competitors. But the newly released iPhone 5S sold a record 9 million units during its first weekend, far outdistancing the 5 million or so iPhone 5 handsets sold in the same amount of time last year. (It's worth noting, though, that China was part of the initial rollout of the 5S but wasn't for the 5.) Interbrand says its not worried about Apple on the innovation front. ""(CEO) Tim Cook has assembled a solid leadership team and has kept Steve Jobs' vision intact -- a vision that has allowed Apple to deliver on its promise of innovation time and time again,"" Frampton said.","Technology is well represented on the 2013 ""Best Global Brands"" list .

"(CNN) -- A suicide bomber who carried out an attack in Somalia this weekend was an American citizen of Somali descent, a website associated with the Al-Shabaab Islamist movement claimed Sunday. The website named the bombers as Aden al-Ansari and Cabdi Salaam al-Muhajir, and posted what it said was an audio interview with al-Muhajir speaking American-accented English. The speaker urges his ""brothers and sisters"" to ""do jihad"" in America, Canada, England, ""anywhere in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in China, in Australia, anywhere you find kuffar,"" a derogatory term for non-Muslims. The African Union force trying to establish order in Somalia said there had been an attack Saturday involving two suicide bombers in the capital Mogadishu, but said AU troops ""beat off"" the attack by ""al-Qaeda linked terrorists."" Al-Shabaab is associated with al Qaeda and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. The African Union military spokesman in the country did not immediately respond to a CNN question about the identity of the bombers or whether any AU troops were injured. Omar Jamal, a Somali diplomat at the United Nations, identified the person who made the audio recordings as Abdisalam Ali of Minneapolis. He told CNN that friends of Ali had listened to the messages in English and Somali and were ""convinced it is him."" The discrepancy in names may mean that the name released by Al-Shabaab is a nom de guerre. Jamal said Abdisalam left Minneapolis on November 4, 2008, with another man, Burhan Hassan, who has since been killed. Kyle Loven, an FBI spokesman in Minneapolis, told CNN, ""We're aware of the reporting but not able to confirm any IDs at this time."" In the Somali-language interview that Al-Shabaab released, the speaker says he has been fighting with the group for two years and killed ""many infidels"" with his own hands. Jamal said this weekend's bombing was the third time a Minnesota Somali-American had carried out a suicide bombing in Somalia. The previous two were Shirwa Ahmed, 27, who was the first confirmed American suicide bomber in U.S. history, and Farah Mohamed Beledi, also 27. Ahmed killed himself and 29 others in the fall of 2008. The FBI identified Beledi as one of two suicide bombers responsible for killing two African Union soldiers in Somalia in May. In recent years, approximately 20 young men -- most of them Somali-Americans -- have traveled from the Minneapolis area to Somalia to train with Al-Shabaab, and a number of them have gone on to fight with the terrorist organization, U.S. officials said. And this month, a federal jury found two Minnesota women guilty of raising money for Al-Shabaab. According to the federal indictment, Amina Farah Ali, 35, and Hawo Mohamed Hassan, 64, of Rochester, Minnesota, solicited funds in ways that included going door-to-door ""under the false pretense that the funds were for the poor and needy."" The two were charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Ali was also found guilty of 12 other counts including sending more than $8,000 in 2008 and 2009. CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","A website associated with Al-Shabaab posts an audio interview with the alleged bomber .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Saying he hopes ""tourists from around the world will soon return,"" Egypt's newly appointed minister of antiquities announced Thursday that tourist sites will reopen on Sunday. ""All of the Pharaonic, Coptic, Islamic and modern sites"" will reopen, said a statement from the Minister of Antiquities Affairs, Zahi Hawass. The decision was made after Hawass met with members of the ministry and the Antiquities and Tourism Police to discuss security measures. ""Dr. Hawass stated he hopes tourists from around the world will soon return to Egypt,"" the statement said. Hawass, former secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, was appointed to the new post January 30 under former President Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak stepped down Friday after 18 days of protests and unrest. There has been widespread concern about Egypt's antiquities being damaged or looted during the upheaval, particularly after reports of a break-in at the nation's main museum in Cairo. Hawass' office also said Thursday that ancient burial sites have been broken into. Sabry Abdel Aziz, head of the Pharaonic Sector of the ministry, told Hawass that a ""false door"" and other items were stolen from the tomb of Hetep-Ka, in Saqqara. In Abusir, a portion of a false door was stolen from the tomb of Re-Hotep, the ministry said. In addition, some storage magazines in Saqqara, including one near the pyramid of Teti, had their seals broken, along with a magazine at Cairo University, the ministry said. Hawass has formed a committee to prepare reports on what, if anything, is missing. Abusir is a pyramid field on the left bank of the Nile, north of Saqqara, where many 5th Dynasty pharaohs chose to site their burial monuments. Saqqara, one of Egypt's oldest burial sites, has several royal pyramids. The Egyptian military caught people attempting to loot sites at Tell el Basta and a tomb in Lischt, the ministry said. ""There have also been many reports of attacks on archaeological lands,"" the statement said, adding that Hawass has asked all of the second heads within the ministry to prepare reports for each site in Egypt. Hawass said Sunday that at least 17 artifacts were missing from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The museum was broken into on January 28, not long after anti-Mubarak protests began. He updated that number to 18 on Monday, but said two of the missing relics -- a heart scarab and one of 11 missing Shabti statuettes -- funerary figurines -- had been found. On Tuesday, a blog post on Hawass' website said that wooden fragments belonging to a damaged New Kingdom coffin had been found in a preliminary search of the museum and its grounds. Also found were fragments belonging to a statue of King Tutankhamun being carried by the goddess Minkaret, according to the posting, but ""all of the located fragments belong to the figure of Menkaret. The small figure of the king has not been found."" Hawass said he believes the looters dropped objects as they fled, and ""every inch of the museum must be searched before the Registration, Collections Management and Documentation Department, which is overseeing the inventory, can produce a complete and final report of exactly what is missing,"" the post said. The Army was allowing few people into the museum, making it difficult to carry out a search, according to the posting. Hawass said January 31 that the intruders had vandalized statues and display cases and stolen jewelry from the museum's gift shop. A number of suspects were apprehended shortly after the break-in, he said, some with antiquities in their possession. The Tuesday blog post said that Hawass ""would like to clarify earlier statements in which he announced that nothing was missing (from the museum)."" He said when the search committee made its first pass through the museum, ""objects that were at first thought to be missing were found thrown into trash cans and corners far from their original locations"" and he was led to believe that all the items would be found in a full search. ""Professionals out to steal would normally be careful not to damage the objects they were planning to take, so the initial impression was that the attackers were vandals rather than thieves,"" the blog post said. Hawass was also misinformed by a museum staffer about a statue of the pharaoh Akhenaten and was told it was only damaged when it was missing, the post said. ""In addition to expressing what he then firmly believed, which was that museum staff would continue to locate the missing objects, his intent in these earlier statements was to reassure the world that the damage at the museum, while tragic, was far less widespread than originally feared, and to make clear that the museum's most major masterpieces, such as the Golden Mask of Tutankhamun, were safe.""","The sites will reopen on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Another wave of deaths engulfed Syria on Saturday, and top security officials kept their jobs after the regime formed a new government. At least 131 people died Saturday, including 31 in the turbulent city of Deir Ezzor, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The largest city in the country's eastern region, Deir Ezzor is ""in dire need of help"" because it is ""under continuous indiscriminate shelling targeting residential homes since yesterday,"" the LCC said Saturday. ""The uninterrupted intense shelling makes it impossible to reach the wounded and to recover the bodies of martyrs (the dead) that are lying on the roads and in houses. The medical and humanitarian situation is extremely difficult, especially with the ongoing complete outage of the internet services and mobile communications,"" the LCC said. A 23-year-old volunteer for the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, Bashar al-Youssef, was shot dead Friday in Deir Ezzor, the fourth Red Crescent member killed on duty since September. The worker, shot while on ""first-aid duty,"" wore a uniform ""clearly marked with the Red Crescent emblem,"" the International Committee of the Red Cross said. ""This comes at a time when the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent are virtually the only organizations able to work in areas affected by the violence in Syria,"" said Alexandre Equey, deputy head of the ICRC's delegation in Syria. ""We take such incidents extremely seriously."" The violence occurred as the Syrian regime announced a new government just weeks after parliamentary elections. Riad Hijab, who served as minister of agriculture and agrarian reform, is the new prime minister, President Bashar al-Assad said in a decree. A longtime member of the ruling Baathist party, Hijab also governed the Syrian provinces of Latakia and Quneitra during his political career. The country's top diplomat, Foreign Minister Walid Moallem, is keeping his post. Two top security officials, Defense Minister Dawood Rajiha and Interior Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Shaar are staying in their jobs as government forces clamp down on an anti-regime uprising. The Syrian government -- which has asserted its support of reform and change during the 15 months of unrest -- touted a ""wide turnout"" for its May parliamentary elections, when more than 7,000 candidates vied for 250 parliamentary seats. Members of the opposition regarded the elections as a sham. They said a vote for any of the candidates amounted to a vote for al-Assad, whose family has ruled the country for 42 years. They argued that the government is only interested in maintaining its power by any means and urged Syrians to boycott the elections. Since the anti-government uprising started in March last year, more than 15,000 people in Syria, mostly civilians, have been killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The United Nations has said that at least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. CNN cannot confirm specific reports of violence in Syria because the government has restricted access to the country by international journalists. Opposition groups say the violence began when a government crackdown on peaceful protesters generated a nationwide uprising, including the armed resistance. Syria consistently blames terrorists for the violence. The government on Saturday said it buried 68 security personnel killed by terrorist groups. The LCC also said another 13 soldiers died overnight when they tried to defect. In Syrian hospital, no escape from war . World powers have been working to avoid a full-blown civil war, but a U.N. and Arab League-backed peace initiative has failed to take hold. Fears of a wider conflict heightened in the Middle East on Friday when Syrian artillery shot down a Turkish military jet. The act comes as Syrian-Turkish ties have worsened during the anti-government uprising. Turkey, which hosts Syrian opposition groups and thousands of Syrian refugees, has been outspoken in its criticism of the al-Assad regime. A Syrian military spokesman quoted by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency on Saturday said Syrian forces struck ""an unidentified aerial target that violated Syrian airspace."" The craft -- flying ""at a very low altitude and at high speed over territorial waters"" -- crashed in Syrian territorial waters near Latakia province, the spokesman said. Syrian authorities eventually learned that the target was the Turkish jet. Turkish President Abdullah Gul said Saturday that the craft may have entered Syria's airspace, according to the semi-official Anatolia news agency. ""When you take in to account the speeds at which jet planes travel over the sea, it is routine for planes to go in and out of borders,"" he is quoted as saying by the news agency. ""It is something that happens without bad intentions and that happens due to the high speeds."" The search for the plane continues, he said, speaking in Kayseri, central Turkey. ""It is not possible to cover something like this up. Whatever needs to be done will be done, without a doubt,"" he said, according to Anatolia. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the incident ""serious"" and hopes both sides handle the situation with ""restraint"" via ""diplomatic channels."" Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, whose country neighbors Syria, said his government's ""main concern is the spillover of the crisis"" into the region. ""If this conflict were to turn in an all-out sectarian or civil war Iraq will be affected, Lebanon will be affected, Jordan will not be immune, Turkey could be,"" he said. ""We don't want to see chaos reign in the region, in the neighborhood and that's why Iraq should have a say, a role in what is going to go in Syria, no country can ignore or bypass Iraq in this regard."" CNN's Saad Abedine, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Hamdi Alkhshali and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 131 deaths reported by opposition group .

"(CNN) -- One in 50 children is homeless in the United States every year, according to a report released Tuesday. The National Center on Family Homelessness estimates more than 1.5 million children are without a home. The report, by the National Center on Family Homelessness, analyzed data from 2005-06 and found that more than 1.5 million children were without a home. ""These numbers will grow as home foreclosures continue to rise,"" Ellen Bassuk, president of the center, said in a statement. The study ranked states on their performance in four areas: the extent of child homelessness, the risk for it, child well-being and the state's policy and planning efforts. The states that fared the poorest were Texas, Georgia, Arkansas, New Mexico and Louisiana. Connecticut, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island and North Dakota performed the best. Homeless children have poor health, emotional problems and low graduation rates, the study found. ""The consequences to our society will play out for decades,"" Bassuk said. ""As we bail out the rest of our nation, it is also time to come to their aid."" The report offers recommendations such as improved support to ensure that children's schooling is not interrupted when they lose their homes, and services to address the trauma of homelessness. Other highlights in the report, ""America's Youngest Outcasts: State Report Card on Child Homelessness:"" • 42 percent of homeless children are younger than 6. • African-American and Native American children are disproportionately represented. • More than 1 in 7 homeless children have moderate to severe health conditions, such as asthma. • Approximately 1.16 million of homeless children today will not graduate from high school.","The National Center on Family Homelessness analyzed data from 2005-06 .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian forces secured and cleared a Cairo mosque that had become the epicenter of Saturday's confrontations between protesters and the military, interior ministry spokesman Hani Abdel-Latif said. Hundreds of supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy had been holed up in the Al-Fateh mosque in central Cairo since overnight. Without food or medical supplies, but fearful of reprisals if they walked out, the protesters earlier rebuffed the military's request for them to clear the building. The situation escalated as security forces fired at the mosque's minaret, claiming there were snipers firing at them. In the end, the security forces were successful in securing the place. The clashes at the mosque had threatened to pull Egypt into another day of widespread violence on Saturday. Political unrest preceded the military coup that ousted Morsy, and his supporters have held massive rallies against the interim government and its supporters. Both sides blame each other for instigating violence. ""We are not facing a political struggle,"" interim presidential adviser Mustapha Higazi said. ""We are facing war waged by extreme forces."" The spokesman referred to the protesters as terrorists and warned that ""what we see in the streets will not be accepted."" The government urged pro-Morsy protesters to ""come to their senses"" and unite Egyptians. ""We express our deepest sorrow and offer our condolences to those who have their blood spilled,"" Higazi said. At least 173 people have been killed across the country since Friday's mass protests began, the government said. It was an especially bloody week in Egypt, as the interim government put in place by a military coup seeks to restore stability to the country while Morsy supporters fight to restore the democratically elected former president to power. With no end to the clashes in sight, the pressure on the international community to act increases, raising questions about aid and diplomacy in North Africa and the Middle East. The government stepped up its rhetoric Saturday, blaming the protestors -- particularly those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood -- of attacking police stations, churches and civilians. The future of the Muslim Brotherhood and others will be subject to evaluations regarding their legal status, Higazi said. Members of the Muslim Brotherhood who have not been involved in violence and who would like to ""join the peaceful Egyptian march toward the future"" would be welcomed, but others will face the law, he said. ""We are not in the effort of dissolving anyone, or preventing anyone from being active in the public domain, but are trying to make sure everyone is legalized according to Egyptian law,"" he added. The interim government spokesman also accused the international media of bias and telling an incomplete story. Inside the Al-Fateh mosque . Hundreds of protesters defied a government-imposed curfew Friday night and stood fast at Ramses Square. The government had warned that those breaking curfew would be dealt with ""firmly."" But security forces appear to have acted with restraint overnight, when 1,000 people reportedly took refuge inside the mosque located on the square. During clashes on Friday -- which protesters had dubbed ""a day of anger"" -- the building had served as a makeshift morgue and field hospital for the pro-Morsy protesters. The military offered to provide safe passage out for those inside the mosque, but the protesters said they feared that they would be attacked by pro-government supporters aligned with the military who were also outside the mosque. The military told the protesters inside the mosque that they would be taken to an unspecified location, said Hanan Amin, a doctor who spoke with CNN from inside the mosque. Without water and food, and distrustful of the military forces outside the building, those who remained inside said they felt like hostages. ""We want to go home in a very polite way,"" Amin said. ""It's a shame for our military persons to deal with our people like this."" A son of Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohamed Badie was killed Friday during a protest near the mosque, said the Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice party. Ammar Badie, 38, was shot in his neck and head. More violence . Elsewhere in Cairo, the military engaged Friday night in battles with roving bands of armed protesters, state media reported. Helicopters circled overhead, and there were reports that protesters were trying to shoot them down. Smoke wafted through Ramses Square from a fire that engulfed a nearby commercial building. It was unclear what caused the fire. Death counts continued to rise in the confrontation that began Wednesday when an estimated 580 people were killed and 4,000 wounded as the military forced pro-Morsy protesters out of encampments in Cairo. There was no apparent progress toward a political resolution to the crisis. An umbrella group for opponents of the military government called for daily demonstrations next week. The casualties have not been limited to Morsy supporters and security forces. A number of bystanders, residents and journalists have been killed. In northern Egypt, at least 25 people were killed and 171 wounded in fighting Friday between Morsy supporters and the military in the coastal city of Alexandria, a government spokesman said Saturday. The Interior Ministry said 1,004 Muslim Brotherhood members were arrested Friday across Egypt. State-run Nile TV reported Brotherhood members were charged with rioting and creating violence. Authorities seized seven hand grenades, five automatic weapons, pistols and 710 rounds of ammunition, state media said. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a meeting next week of European Union foreign ministers to coordinate a response. U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the crackdown by security forces Thursday and canceled scheduled joint exercises by the U.S. and Egyptian military. Obama received a briefing on Egypt on Saturday, a senior administration official told CNN. Obama has declined to label Morsy's ouster by the military a coup, a declaration that would stop U.S. military aid to Egypt. CNN's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo; Mariano Castillo wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Asiana Airlines Flight 214 passenger Ye Mengyuan was alive when flung from the plane during this month's crash landing but was killed moments later when run over by a rescue vehicle, a California coroner said Friday. Ye died as result of ""multiple blunt injuries that are consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle,"" said San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault. ""Those injuries she received, she was alive at the time."" Officials previously had said that was what they feared had happened after the crash on July 6 at San Francisco's airport. Ye, 16, of China was one of three people who died in the crash and its aftermath. Read more: Asiana crash probe moved on from SFO . San Francisco Fire Department Chief Joanne Hayes-White, attending a news conference with Foucrault, called the incident ""a tragic accident"" and apologized to Ye's family. One of the department's aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles struck the girl while she was on the ground, possibly covered with firefighting foam being sprayed on and around the burning plane, the chief said. ""I particularly want to express our condolences and apologies to the family of Ye Mengyuan in light of the coroners' findings (in) this tragic accident,"" the chief said. ""Obviously this is very difficult news for us. We're heartbroken. We're in the business of saving lives,"" she added. ""There's not a lot of words to describe how badly we feel about it."" The fire department is reaching out to the family through the Chinese consulate's office. The investigation of what happened after the crash remains with the city's police department. Police are reconstructing the crash scene to ascertain what happened during the rescue, the chief said. She called the crash ""a difficult, challenging scene."" ""We believe it was one of the specialized rigs at the airport, the ARFF rigs, aircraft rescue firefighting vehicles,"" Hayes-White said. San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee said he was ""profoundly saddened by the involvement of a responding emergency vehicle in the death of 16-year-old Ye Mengyuan."" ""On behalf of the people of San Francisco, I offer my deepest condolences and regret for her tragic death, and the deaths of her close friend, Wang Linjia, and 15-year-old Liu Yipeng,"" the mayor said in a statement. Ye and Wang, also 16, were part of a group of 35 teachers and students from a middle school in Jiangshan traveling to California for a summer camp program. Wang was found dead at the scene along with Ye. Liu died days later in a San Francisco hospital. Foucrault, the coroner, met with the three families Thursday to discuss his findings, the fire chief said. The mayor said firefighters and first responders helped save the lives of 304 of the 307 passengers and crew aboard the flight. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash landing, which also injured more than 180 people aboard the flight.","Ye Mengyuan, 16, of China was struck and killed by a fire department vehicle .

"Washington (CNN) -- All but one of the U.S. diplomatic posts closed this week in a sweeping response to fears of a possible al Qaeda attack will reopen on Sunday, the State Department said. The Obama administration closed 19 embassies and consulates throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and issued a worldwide travel alert due to the threat apparently linked to communications between leaders of the terror group. The closures took effect on Sunday. The embassy in Sanaa Yemen, where al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in based, will remain closed due to continued concerns about a possible attack. Separately, the State Department withdrew most of its diplomatic personnel from its consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, on Thursday, citing a ""separate credible threat"" and warned U.S. citizens against travel to Pakistan. Diplomatic personnel were moved to the capital, Islamabad. The Lahore facility also will remain closed. ""We will continue to evaluate the threats to Sanaa and Lahore and make subsequent decisions about the reopening of those facilities based on that information,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""We will also continue to evaluate information about these and all of our posts and to take appropriate steps to best protect the safety of our personnel, American citizens traveling overseas, and visitors to our facilities,"" she added. One U.S. official said there was no link between the broader terror threat and the reason for the action taken in Lahore. However, the official said it doesn't rule out a possible link to al Qaeda. Most of al Qaeda's core leadership is believed to reside in Pakistan and Lahore known to be home to other extremists sympathetic to the group. Response to terror threat scrutinized: Did U.S. go too far? No U.S. diplomatic posts in Pakistan were closed as a result of the wider warning inked to al Qaeda. Read more: Yemen says it foiled al Qaeda plot . In that case, CNN previously reported U.S. officials intercepted a message between al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and a top ally in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, telling him to ""do something"" -- an inference to a terror plot. Now, two U.S. officials tell CNN that in his communication with Zawahiri, Wuhayshi, who is the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, laid out a plan for a plot and then Zawahiri acknowledged the communication. Wuhayshi, the officials said, was not asking for permission from Zawahiri -- but rather informing him of his plans. This scenario -- that Wuhayshi presented Zawahiri with a plan -- was first reported Friday in the Wall Street Journal. CNN has also learned that the al Qaeda leaders communicated via some kind of encrypted messaging system, with multiple points of entry to allow for various parties to join in. Asked about his assessment of the terror group in light of the latest threat, President Barack Obama reiterated his conclusion that its core blamed for 9/11 is ""on its heels."" But he restated that al Qaeda and other extremist groups ""have metastasized"" into regional organizations that can still threaten U.S. interests, including embassies. ""And that's exactly what we are seeing right now,"" Obama said, noting that anti-terror efforts are an ongoing process. ""We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is to weaken it and to strengthen our partnerships in such a way that it does not pose the kind of horrible threat that we saw on 9/11,"" he said. The origin of the Pakistan threat was not clear but a separate official said it was ""conceivable"" Lashkar-e-Tayyiba was involved. Lahore is well-known as a base for that group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. Journalist Annabel Symington in Islamabad contributed to this report.","State Department says 18 diplomatic posts will reopen on Sunday .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Manned by a pair of trained officers, a large private security jeep moves slowly past the high walls lining a residential street in the suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa. Heavily armed and alert, the officers scan the designated area, looking for any suspicious activity. They work for CSS Tactical, a private security company hired by local residents to patrol their area and protect them from any potential criminals. ""To be proactive, we need to be noticed,"" says Ricky Croock, managing director of CSS Tactical. ""We need people to say 'hold on, there is a dedicated tactical vehicle.' ""A tactical vehicle is a bigger vehicle -- it is more aggressive, it's a deterrent. So the first point is we want to deter as opposed to catch crime."" The security officers are well armed. They carry semi-automatic weapons and hand guns and they're trained in how and when to use them. And while only the police have the power of random stop and search in public places, security companies also stop people they regard as suspicious. From April 2011 to March 2012 there were 15,609 murders in South Africa, as well as 64,514 sexual offenses and 101,203 cases of aggravated robbery. According to the country's latest ""Victims of crime survey,"" 57% of respondents felt that housebreaking/burglary was the crime most feared in their area of residence. In recent years, South Africa has stepped up efforts to tackle crime, one of the country's worst social ills. Last September, the South African Police Service said that serious crime in the country had been reduced by 31.8% from 2004/5 to 2011/12. But 2011 to 2012 saw a reduction in serious crime of just 1.9%. ""We only have the official crime statistics to go by,"" says Rudolph Zinn of the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. ""If you look at what the police would report annually in September of every year, we see over the last three or four years that crime has leveled off. ""The more concerning factor is the high percentage of so-called violent or contact crime, which is about a third of all the crime reported to the South African Police Service."" And that's what has fueled the boom in the country's private security industry, crime experts say. There are nearly 9,000 companies and 400,000 registered active private security guards. That's more than the police and army combined, according to South African officials. ""The security industry is bigger than what it has ever been in South Africa,"" says Zinn. ""I think the growth in the industry is definitely attributed to the fact that, let's call it a weak policing or ineffective policing, and it created the opportunity for private individuals to move into the market."" Some of those individuals have a military background. Waal de Waal, chief operating officer at South African-owned Protea Coin, spent 18 years in the special forces and military intelligence before joining the private security sector a decade ago. He is today one of the 17,000 people employed by Protea Coin. Part of the multi-million dollar company's work is dealing with small-scale crime, like recovering fuel stolen from a petrol station. The company, which also provides security at many of South Africa's mines and has been kept busy by the recent strikes in the sector, offers a range of services, including 24-hour property monitoring and protection against organized criminal syndicates. ""The role of private security companies is distinctively different to that of the police,"" says Petrus Van Niekerk, the chief executive of Protea Coin. ""We view our role as private security to really aid and support the police."" But what happens when private security companies take matters into their own hands? The South African government claims that it's an industry that threatens national security and is determined to tighten its regulation. ""A very dangerous situation arises if you have a security industry that outstrips both your police and your army and there is completely no regulation of that industry,"" says Jenni Irish-Qhobosheane, the head of the Civilian Secretariat for Police. ""I think the public can find themselves in situations where, basically, they are put at the mercy of private security companies who are unprofessional,"" she adds. One measure considered by the country's government is that private security firms must be owned by South Africans. ""This type of move is going to frighten away foreign direct investment and I think that is a danger,"" says Hanes Venter, sales director at the South African arm of G4S, a London-listed global security giant. ""Foreign direct investment is already down year on year but this is a worry from that perspective for me."" Whatever regulations the South African government eventually introduces, it seems unlikely the demand for private securities companies will diminish amid high unemployment rates, as well as widespread poverty and simmering industrial tensions.","South Africa has 400,000 private security guards, and nearly 9,000 security firms .

"(CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board has wrapped up its on-scene work as part of its investigation of the Asiana Flight 214 crash at San Francisco airport, the agency said Monday. Investigators are done examining the runway and the wreckage, which is now in storage at the airport. But they may still return to examine the plane again if needed. Most of the government probe has moved to Washington where investigators will further analyze cockpit voice and data information, piece together mountains of records and run other crash material through NTSB labs. Additional interviews with first responders is the only work still being done in San Francisco, the NTSB said. The flight carrying 291 passengers and 16 crew took off from Shanghai and stopped in Seoul before heading to San Francisco. It was an unremarkable flight prior to final approach that should have been routine in ideal flying conditions. Asiana regularly flies into San Francisco. But flying too slow and too low as it neared the airport on July 6, the pilots of the big jetliner sought to abort the landing at the last second. The plane slammed into the sea wall and then the runway, its tail breaking off and the fuselage full of people spinning down the tarmac. Three passengers, all girls, died in the first notable U.S. air crash in four years. More than 180 people were hurt and the rest walked away relatively unscathed. Most were able to escape before the plane erupted in smoke and flames. The runway was littered with plane parts, bags, and a carpet of other debris that was examined in varying detail by investigators. Investigators do not expect to know for several months at least what exactly caused the crash. But early information from the board has centered heavily on the actions of the crew. The pilot at the controls was training on the 777 although he was experienced at flying other big Boeing and Airbus jets and had landed in San Francisco previously in those planes.","Investigators are done with their work at the airport .

"(CNN) -- With their soulful voices and traditional Zulu dance moves, South African acappella singing sensation Ladysmith Black Mambazo have been blending vocal harmonies to take audiences on a musical journey for nearly half a century. The legendary male choral group has sold millions of albums worldwide, collaborated with music icons such as Paul Simon and counts Nelson Mandela as one of their faithful fans -- the venerable Nobel Peace Prize winner has described the group as ""South Africa's cultural ambassadors."" It's all a far cry from when young farmer-turned-factory worker Joseph Shabalala formed the band in 1964, hoping to use music as a vehicle to unite people in a country suffering from social divide and conflict. ""The music is for the people, we must take this music to the people,"" recalls Shabalala, one of the two remaining original members of the nine-piece group. Already successful in their homeland, the band's international breakthrough came in 1986, when American singer and songwriter Paul Simon featured them on his album ""Graceland."" Simon also took them on tour with him and produced the band's ""Shaka Zulu"" album, which won the 1988 Grammy Award for best traditional folk album. Since then, Ladysmith Black Mambazo have won two other Grammys and have received a total of 16 nominations. See also: South African comic duo stir up stereotypes . But, apart from years of successful touring and international recognition, it is the relationship with Nelson Mandela that has come to play a big part in the band's career. The group first met South Africa's first black president at his birthday party in 1990, not long after he was freed after spending 27 years in jail. ""We were on stage and we sang a song and he stood up and he danced with us and he shook our hands and he said keep up the good work... your music has been great inspiration for me,"" says Albert Mazibuko, one of the original members of the band. ""After that he never wanted to do anything without Ladysmith Black Mambazo -- we have been with him all over the place."" In 1993, at Mandela's request, the group accompanied the future president to the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, Norway, and one year later they sang again for him at his inauguration. In 2003, Mandela recruited them again as ambassadors for his HIV/Aids global awareness campaign, 46664, named after his prison number. Like the anti-apartheid icon, the awardwinning ensemble carry a message of peace and hope in their music. ""Ladysmith Black Mambazo music is about inspiration,"" says Mazibuko. ""We are encouraging people to not lose hope in anything. We try to give people the hope that there is a tomorrow, there is a better thing that is waiting for us in the future and that there is a solution for every problem in the world."" Shabalala named the group after his hometown, Ladysmith, a farming town in the foothills of the Drakensberg Mountains -- ""black"" refers to ""oxen,"" the strongest of all farm animals, and ""Mambazo"" -- the Zulu word for ""axe"" -- refers to ""chopping down"" the local competition. See also: Recycled hotel soap saves children's lives . The roots of the group's music extend back some 100 hundred years, in the gold and diamond mines of South Africa when black workers would entertain themselves in labor camps by composing music and dances. But they had to dance softly ""on tip toes"" so they would not disturb the white guards. Shabalala's vision was to keep this rich musical tradition -- known as ""isicathamiya"" -- alive by combining it with what he heard in churches. His brothers and cousins joined him and since then the acappella band has very much remained a family affair -- to this day, Ladysmith Black Mambazo's band is comprised of Shabalala's friends and family members, including his sons and cousins, with an age span ranging from septuagenarians to those in their 20s. See also: Master storyteller brings folk tales to life . Their 2011 release, ""Songs from a Zulu farm,"" has also received a Grammy nomination for best world music album -- the band say it is their most personal work to date, featuring traditional Zulu tunes that recreate the world they grew up in. See also: Africa's popstars . With Shabalala and Mazibuko being today the only two remaining original members of the group, the band's old guard is now passing down their message of hope and peace onto the younger generation.

"Bountiful, Utah (CNN) -- It was two weeks after D-Day, a few miles from the bloody shores of Omaha Beach. An airstrip had been carved out of the Normandy countryside, costing the lives of 28 Army engineers at the hands of German snipers. A lone sniper still remained in the nighttime distance. Despite the risk, Capt. Jack Tueller felt compelled to play his trumpet. That afternoon, his P-47 fighter group had caught up with a retreating German Panzer division. As the U.S. Thunderbolts descended on their targets, they saw French women and children on top of the tanks. After an initial fly-by, the order was given to attack anyway. ""We were told those human shields were expendable,"" Tueller said. Back at the airstrip, Tueller took out his trumpet. He'd used it on many a starlit night to entertain the men of the 508th Squadron 404th Fighter Group. ""I was told, 'Captain, don't play tonight; your trumpet makes the most glorious sound,' but I was stressed,"" he said. He was so troubled that he was willing to take a chance the sniper wouldn't fire. ""I thought to myself, that German sniper is as lonely and scared as I am. How can I stop him from firing? So I played that German's love song, 'Lilly Marlene,' made famous in the late '30s by Marlene Dietrich, the famous German actress. And I wailed that trumpet over those apple orchards of Normandy, and he didn't fire."" The next morning, the military police came up to Tueller and told him they had a German prisoner on the beach who kept asking, ""Who played that trumpet last night?"" ""I grabbed my trumpet and went down to the beach. There was a 19-year-old German, scared and lonesome. He was dressed like a French peasant to cloak his role as a sniper. And, crying, he said, 'I couldn't fire because I thought of my fiancé. I thought of my mother and father,' and he says, 'My role is finished.' ""He stuck out his hand, and I shook the hand of the enemy,"" Tueller said. ""[But] he was no enemy, because music had soothed the savage beast."" ""Boy, you have strong lips"" Tueller had learned to play the trumpet as a child growing up in Wyoming. His mother, a nurse, died at 29, and his father, a bartender and alcoholic, left the next day -- leaving Jack and his brother, Bob, orphans. They left their home in Superior to live with an aunt in nearby Evanston. She gave Jack his first trumpet, and he quickly discovered he had a musical ear. ""In 1939, I was playing in Yellowstone Park in a dance band of 22 musicians at Lake Hotel. The famous trumpet player Louis Armstrong came up to the band during intermission and said, 'You sound pretty good for white cats,' "" Tueller recalled. He asked Armstrong what advice he would give a young trumpet player. ""He said, 'Always play the melody, man. Look at them, see their age group, play their love songs, and you'll carry all the money to the bank.' "" Tueller enrolled at Brigham Young University, where he met his future wife and fellow trumpeter, Marjorie. ""This beautiful brown-haired gal with luscious lips said, 'Did you play the trumpet solo at the freshman assembly?' And I said, 'Yes, ma'am, I did.' She said, 'Boy, you have strong lips.' Being a sophomore, I said, 'Would you like to try me?' She nodded, and I went over and kissed her."" In 1941, as war clouds gathered, Jack enlisted in the Army and was sent to fighter school because he was an ""individualist,"" he said. ""I wanted to fly it, fire it, navigate it, shoot the guns."" He once flew his plane through a dirigible hangar at Moffitt Field in Sunnyvale, California. The commandant was fuming mad. ""He stood me in a brace, then he kind of smiled and says, 'We don't want to quell spirit like that ... but don't do it again!'"" When D-Day arrived on June 6, 1944, Tueller was in the air, flying five missions. ""I witnessed the invasion from a ringside seat. We saw 2 million men, 10,000 ships. And we just shot at everything,"" he said. ""We tried to help those men trying to get off the landing craft at high tide, where a lot of them were drowned. ""I remember feeling pride and sadness as I saw the bodies of 4,000 killed in two hours."" Tueller credits common sense and his first flight instructor, a crop duster, with his survival that day -- and the rest of the war. ""I learned to love low-level flying. I never came off enemy targets high. I'd lay it down a row of trees 400 knots, a foot off the ground, so all the flak would go over my head. They'd wonder where I'd gone."" Trumpet in the cockpit . Tueller managed to fly 140 missions without taking a single bullet hole to his airplane -- the name of his infant daughter, Rosanne, painted on the side. ""Everyone wanted to fly it; they thought it let a charmed life."" And on each mission, Tueller carried his trumpet in the cockpit. ""I took it in a little canvas bag attached to my parachute. I figured if I ever got shot down, it would go with me, and if I survived and got put into a prisoner of war camp, I could get an extra bar of soap from the guard."" His tour of duty ended just before his fighter group left for Belgium and the Battle of the Bulge. Three months later, his plane was shot down and destroyed. The pilot was killed. Tueller went on to fight in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and served in the Pentagon during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War. He retired in 1966 as a colonel, having earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, almost two dozen air medals and two Legions of Merit, the nation's highest peacetime award. Now 89, Tueller takes care of Marjorie, his wife of 68 years, who has Alzheimer's disease. As Veterans Day approaches, he has a word of advice to veterans: ""When you become a veteran, it's my opinion that you should do everything to make people realize the wonderful life that you really have."" He still has his trumpet of 70 years and still performs at schools, family get-togethers and church functions. He has a stereo system installed in the back of his family van, where he inserts a CD of big band music and begins playing the melodies of a bygone era. ""I was an unruly child,"" he said. ""Music tamed me. ... My ambition as the last action on my part as a veteran is to hit high C and fall right into the grave. What a way to go!""","Jack Tueller learned to play the trumpet as a child growing up in Wyoming .

"(CNN) -- I have a confession to make. In the 2005 Chicago Marathon, I did not finish in 3 hours, 11 minutes. That's the time I've reported to those who've asked about my PR (Personal Record) and it is, quite frankly, wrong. I actually ran a 3:12. The mistake is mine. These days, with those little plastic chips attached to sneakers (they record a runner's time from the moment he crosses the starting line to the finish line -- not merely from the moment the gun goes off), there's a difference between one's stated time and his official time. I was always under the impression that 3:11 was my official time. Then -- oops -- last night I checked. It was, I confess once again, 3:12. Shame, thy name is Pearlman. This is a long-winded way of saying that Paul Ryan and I have something in common. He, like I, exaggerated his marathon PR as well, recently boasting to conservative talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt of a ""two hour and 50-something"" clocking over 26.2 miles. When I first heard of the blunder from the Republican vice-presidential candidate, I empathized. Hey, maybe ""two hour and 50-something"" was actually 3:02. Or even 3:05. I mean, memories get foggy, chips malfunction, the cranial lobes shut down after such a strenuous endeavor. News: Ryan walks back exaggerated marathon time . Then, ahem, the good folks at Runner's World did a little digging and, eh, ahem, uh -- well, Ryan's time was, ahem, eh, uh -- 4:01:25. Double glub. In the congressman's defense, the race occurred 22 years back, in the Duluth-based Grandma's Marathon. That's a long time ago. And yet -- no. No, no, no, no, no. There is no possible explanation for a four-hour marathoner claming he's a three-hour marathoner. None. Zero. Nilch. Having been a runner for the last 32 years, and having competed for a season of track and cross country at the University of Delaware (I was arguably one of the nation's worst 100 Division I runners), and having completed 11 marathons, I can tell you -- with 100% certainty -- that when Paul Ryan says (more or less), ""Oops, simple mistake,"" he is full of it. For those of you who don't run, a 4:01 marathoner insisting he broke three hours is the equivalent of a .220 hitter speaking of a .310 average. It's a retired small-town mayor looking back at his time as a U.S. senator; a dive-bar rock band bragging of once opening for KISS at Madison Square Garden. In this world of ours, there are exaggerations (""She looked just like Halle Berry!""), there are boasts (""Hell, gimme a week in the pool and I'll destroy Michael Phelps!"") and there are flat-out, straight-up, no-holds-barred lies. This is a flat-out, straight-up, no-holds-barred lie. Of course, in and of itself, perhaps Ryan's fib isn't such a big deal. The world is filled with once-upon-a-time jocks recalling glory that, truth be told, wasn't all that glorious. (Isn't this what high school reunions are made for?) But when it comes to Wisconsin's favorite son, a lie -- in this case about a marathon time --isn't such an isolated occurrence. In case you missed the Republican convention, Ryan's speech was an unambiguous ode to mistruth. Among other dandies, he ripped the president for ignoring the Simpson-Bowles commission recommendations -- even though Ryan voted against its final report; claimed the American people were ""cut out"" of stimulus spending when, actually, more than a quarter of all stimulus dollars went for tax relief for workers. On and on and on and on. Here's the strangest thing of all: A 4:01:25 marathon is no joke. OK, Paul Ryan was never going to be the next Alberto Salazar or Rod Dixon. But there's something to be said for the mediocre jock who trains his butt off, loads up on energy gel and fights his way through 26.2 miles. Just as easily as lying, the man could have talked about fighting through the wall at 18 miles; about seeing his family cheer him on from the side of the road; about crossing the finish line and feeling downright (hey!) Reaganesque in the moment. Truth be told, there's no shame in being average. There's only shame in refusing to accept it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman says one's official marathon record is not something a runner takes lightly .
So Paul Ryan claiming to have run 26.2 miles in under three hours seemed amazing, he says .

"(CNN) -- Syria's president on Sunday accused the United States of trying to destabilize Syria by providing political support to rebels fighting the regime. Bashar al-Assad also said a months-old peace plan aimed at ending the violence has not failed, but it has yet to be implemented because countries are supporting the ""terrorists"" in Syria. Al-Assad's interview with German broadcaster ARD aired as the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported another 60 people killed in the country Sunday. It also came the same day U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Syrian regime's days are numbered. Noting a number of recent defections from the regime, Clinton said, ""the sand is running out of the hourglass."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon added Sunday that the situation in Syria has deteriorated significantly and become more militarized. ""Appalling"" human rights violations continue, he said, and the killings and violence have turned even more sectarian. ""President Assad must understand that things cannot continue as they are. Fundamental change is needed,"" he said. Al-Assad said in the interview it should not be those outside Syria who get to decide his future, telling ARD it should be up to the Syrian people. ""The people will decide who should be our representative, the people's representative, through the ballot box,"" he told ARD. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, now the United Nations and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria, brokered a six-point peace plan in March. The Syrian government accepted the plan, which proposed an end to the violence, access to humanitarian groups, and an inclusive political dialogue. ""Kofi Annan is doing, so far, difficult but good work,"" al-Assad said. ""There are many obstacles, but it shouldn't be a failed plan."" Annan arrived in Damascus on Sunday for talks with al-Assad, Annan's spokesman said. Asked about Annan's plan for a unity government in Syria, al-Assad said one already exists, pointing to local elections in December in which opposition members won a small number of seats. That they didn't win more, he said, was down to the voters. Al-Assad said the United States is ""of course"" implicated in the deaths of Syrian civilians as long as it provides political support to terrorists in the country. The United States ""is part of the conflict,"" he said. ""They offered an umbrella -- political support -- to those gangs to create instability, to destabilize Syria."" The regime has long blamed the violence in Syria on terrorists, armed gangs, and foreign fighters bent on creating unrest. Al-Assad said Sunday that some of the captured terrorists hail from Tunisia and Libya. Military: Shelling from Syria hits Lebanon . The president said he welcomes a visit by Clinton or any other U.S. official to hold ""serious and honest"" discussions about its role in the country. ""We never closed the door,"" he said. ""They closed the door."" While he said the United States is offering political support to the rebels, other countries are arming them. He named Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and said he doesn't have concrete evidence but goes by their foreign ministers' official announcements that they want to support the rebels with arms. Al-Assad also said Turkey is ""offering logistical support for smuggling"" weapons. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Sunday that two ""terrorists"" had confessed to smuggling gunmen and various types of weapons from Turkey, and that one of them received weapons training from Turkish security forces. SANA also reported Sunday that authorities foiled an attempt by an armed terrorist group to enter Syria from Turkey. Security forces killed and wounded a number of terrorists while the rest fled back to Turkey, it said. Another group tried to cross the Turkish border into Syria on Friday, the news agency reported. Al-Assad said it was ""gangs"" who carried out the massacre in May of more than 100 children, nearly half of them children, in the town of Houla. About reports that the perpetrators wore Syrian army uniforms, al-Assad said the gangs wore them to make the government look guilty. That has been a strategy of the rebels ""from the very beginning,"" he said. Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war . The president said he has a two-pronged solution to ending the fighting, beginning with combating the terrorists. ""The other axis is to make dialogue with the different political components, and at the same time, we have reform,"" he said. Asked whether this reform should be sped up, al-Assad said a timetable would be subjective. It's happening as quickly as possible, he said, but it must be based on circumstances inside the country. The United Nations has said more than 10,000 people have been killed since the Syrian crisis began in March 2011. What started as peaceful protests against the regime spiraled into a bloody government crackdown and armed uprising. One opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said last week that more than 16,700 have been killed, including more than 11,000 civilians.

"Qena, Egypt (CNN) -- In a deserted playground a few hundred miles south of Cairo, 13-year-old Asmaa Ashraf fiddles with a broken rusted slide. She is waiting listlessly for a lesson with her math tutor. The bright-eyed teenager lives in a sepia-toned village in the province of Qena, a place of rural poverty and neglect. But she has big dreams about education. She wants to open a school one day. ""At my school, we'll learn,"" she says, brushing her hands longingly over the slide. ""Teachers will show up and we'll be allowed to ask questions. We'll be allowed to draw with color."" Such aspirations, however, amount to fantasy for most youth in a country still struggling to land on its feet after being turned completely upside down. Two and a half years after the country's uprising began, Egypt's fledgling democracy is stillborn, stubbornly stuck between its past and future. And as the government struggles to wade through the country's protracted political problems, Egypt's festering education system is orphaned -- even though, with a growing youth population, it's key to the country's future. In the World Economic Forum's latest report on global competitiveness, Egypt ranked near the bottom -- 131st out of 144 countries -- for quality of primary education. Egypt's literacy rate is 66%, according to a 2011 United Nations report. Meanwhile, a report by London think tank Chatham House says just $129 a year is spent on each Egyptian student; the United States, for example, spends 40 times as much. The situation is worst in regions far from the capital, and in Upper Egypt, where more than half the population is under 29. Many schools look more like rank penitentiaries rather than hubs of learning. Students and teachers seem to be on the verge of exhaustion rather than bursting with inspiration. And forget technology. Desks and a stable electricity supply are luxuries. ""We didn't have enough desks last year,"" recalls Asmaa's 12-year-old neighbor, Omnia. ""So most of us just sat on the floor. We only get a little paper, but my mom found this,"" she said, holding up a small, faded ""Hannah Montana"" notebook. The American pop culture reference is lost on her. To make up for the gaps in education, millions of middle-class Egyptian families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25% -- on private tutoring. It's impossible to know how much money is spent in all, but some estimates put the total at $1 billion a year. Public school teachers rarely make more than $300 a month. More than a few of them say they teach the bare minimum in class so that they can earn more from the same students in private tutoring sessions. ""There are too many issues to deal with,"" said one 32-year-old teacher in Asmaa's village. ""I have kids of my own I'm struggling to take care for."" He says he gives three hours of private tutoring in the evening and does mechanical work on the side. For parents with any hope that their children will be better off, investing in education is essential. Egypt's final secondary school exams are a rite of passage for students. Their scores chart their future. If they don't do well, they won't get a place in college. The status quo is even more somber for Egypt's women. According to a recent World Bank report, the illiteracy rate for young people in Upper Egypt is 17%, higher than the national average of 11%, and the illiteracy rates for females is 24%, almost twice that of males. Also, 70% of young women in Upper Egypt are jobless. More: Interactive -- Impossible odds, unstoppable girls . Politicians, whether they're from the ruling Muslim Brotherhood or the opposition, agree that educational reform is needed. But they quickly fall silent when pushed to articulate plans. One politician said the country simply has ""bigger fish to fry,"" with a controversial new constitution and still no full, functioning parliament. But with unemployment at staggering rates -- 33% for men age 20-24 and 53% for women in the same age -- Egypt has a highly combustible pool of frustrated and disenfranchised youth in danger of becoming a lost generation. ""This is a generation that desperately needs to learn how to critically think, to learn how to be in the 21st century,"" said Malak Zalouk, director of the Middle East Institute for Higher Education at the American University in Cairo. ""Mubarak's regime trained students to be loyal citizens. And now, despite a revolution for dignity ... there is none."" It sounds like an almost hopeless picture. However, as Egypt's public education system founders, a few innovative ideas have emerged. This year, a few Egyptian entrepreneurs have launched Nafham, a Web-based startup that features crowd-sourced educational videos. Nafham, which means ""We understand"" in Arabic, hopes to provide an alternative -- a virtual classroom -- for struggling Egyptian families. It divides the Egyptian public school curriculum into lessons that can be explained in 5- to 15-minute videos, covering all lessons mandated by the government curriculum. Since the website went live in October, Nafham's staff of teachers created around 4,900 videos, while 1,000 videos were crowd-sourced -- reviewed and approved by the staff. By late May, Nafham's YouTube channel had more than 1 million views. For the 65% of Egyptians who don't have Internet access -- those who stand to gain the most from the service -- Nafham says it hopes to form group viewings in some villages. It is also in talks with some companies to offer USBs with Internet access to groups throughout the countryside. Another innovative initiative is Teach for Egypt, a start-up created by Nada Ramadan, a 24-year-old Egyptian who's a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington. Based on the Teach for America model, Ramadan plans to recruit ambitious college graduates -- most from within the Egyptian community and diaspora -- to commit to a two-year service in which they are trained extensively and placed in underprivileged schools. Ramadan says she's running into problems, however, while trying to implement her idea. The bureaucracy in Egypt leaves little room for productivity, let alone creativity and innovation. Still, she continues to push on. ""We could all stand around and protest that the government is failing us, or we could go out and offer the solutions,"" she said. ""So, that's what we're trying to do."" But until those solutions are offered, Asmaa -- and a whole generation in waiting -- will continue to linger near broken slides, daydreaming about the future.

"(CNN) -- The Egyptian uprising, launched by young liberals hoping to bring freedom, democracy and equality to their country, has finally produced a new president. Mohamed Morsi, long known as the hard-line enforcer of the Muslim Brotherhood, has promised to govern for all Egyptians, vowing to protect the rights of women, children, Christians and Muslims. He says he will preserve all international agreements, implying peace with Israel, and has made a commitment to democracy, saying ""there is no such thing"" as ""Islamic democracy."" It all sounds good, and tens of millions of Egyptians, along with millions more around the world, hope he is sincere. And yet the Muslim Brotherhood has much to prove -- beginning with whether or not it can be trusted. For many years the Brotherhood was banned in Egypt, so it operated underground. Since the revolution, Egyptians have had a chance to see it in action. What they have seen so far is an organization impressively capable of modulating its message to suit specific audiences to achieve political gain. More importantly, the Brotherhood has revealed a troublesome habit of breaking its word. Morsi won the presidency, but not before his Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of the Brotherhood, managed to lose half of its popular support in a matter of months. Millions of Egyptians soured on the Islamist group after seeing how it acted since coming out of the shadows. Its leaders knew their presence would trigger international concern and probably a harsh crackdown. When Hosni Mubarak fell, they pledged they would not try to control Egyptian politics. But they promptly changed their minds. The Muslim Brotherhood leaders promised to contest only a minority of seats in the legislature, rather than trying to win a majority. They broke that promise. They promised, through Morsi himself, ""We will not have a presidential candidate. ... We are not seeking power."" They broke that promise. They vowed to run a thoroughly inclusive process for developing a new Egyptian Constitution. They broke that promise, too. Clearly, the Brotherhood, and the soon-to-be Egyptian president, have developed something of a credibility problem. In parliamentary elections this year, Brotherhood candidates won 10 million votes, almost 40% of the total. The more radical Islamist party, the Salafis, took 28%. Altogether, Islamist parties took control of a stunning two-thirds of the seats in parliament. The courts recently disbanded that parliament, but not before Egyptian voters had a chance to see it in action. It was a sobering sight. Despite all the promises of supporting the ideals of the revolution and embracing equal rights for women, the parliament took on proposals that would have dramatically set back women's rights. And when they put together a panel to write the constitution, it was so loaded with Islamists that a number of groups withdrew in protest and filed lawsuits. That panel, too, was disbanded by the courts. Support for the Brotherhood collapsed. Morsi won just 5 million votes in the first round of presidential elections, half as many as in the parliamentary election, one of every four votes, and just one in 10 eligible voters. He won the presidency only because many voters felt the runoff left two terrible choices: the Brotherhood or a return to the Mubarak era. Many opted to spoil their ballot rather than support either candidate. What became clear in parliament is that when the Brotherhood gained power, it legislated along much less moderate lines than when campaigning, giving speeches to mixed audiences, or speaking to the foreign press. In the past, Morsi has called for banning women and non-Muslims from running for president. His election rallies reportedly featured pledges to imposing Sharia, chants of ""Our capital shall not be Cairo. ... It shall be Jerusalem,"" and other deeply disturbing slogans. Still, the Brotherhood is strategically oriented. It keeps its eye firmly on its long-term goals while displaying flexible short-term pragmatism. To win the presidency it negotiated with the strongest power in Egypt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Morsi will not have a free hand to govern, at least not in the short term. The constitution is not even a work-in-progress yet. It's unclear what role the president will have. And there is currently no parliament. Egypt is in dire economic shape, and the need to continue the flow of aid from Washington may temper rash impulses for now, particularly regarding peace with Israel. Although less than 24 hours after his ""message of peace,"" he already seems to be backtracking on that front. Morsi's words must be followed closely, but they must be matched against his actions, especially in the longer term, when the cameras leave Tahrir Square, the place where Egypt's revolution started with calls for real democracy and equality. His first speech as president-elect touched on the right themes. But the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt's soon-to-be president still need to show they are true to the ideals of the revolution, not just clever manipulators of a popular uprising. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Can Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi be trusted as Egypt's president?

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans lit candles outside the hospital where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela lay Wednesday night amid a report that the former president was on life support. An official briefed on his condition said he was on life support, but government spokesman Mac Maharaj declined to comment on the report, citing doctor-patient confidentiality. Mandela, 94, considered the founding father of South Africa's multiracial democracy, has been hospitalized since June 8 for a recurring lung infection. Authorities have described his condition as critical since Sunday, and after visiting him late Wednesday night, President Jacob Zuma canceled his visit to Mozambique where he was supposed to attend a summit Thursday on infrastructure investment. As the nation remained on edge, police barricaded the street leading to the hospital's main entrance. Well-wishers hung balloons, stuffed animals and messages of support along the wall, and crowds hovering nearby sang ""Where is Mandela?"" ""We need you!,"" one sign read. ""We love you tata, get well soon!"" said another, referring to Mandela by the Xhosa word for father. Several relatives came out to collect some of those items Wednesday. ""He's going to feel a lot better when he sees these signs,"" said David Manaway, Mandela's grandson-in-law. Why Mandela has six names . His former physician and the nation's ex-surgeon general, Dr. Vejay Ramlakan, also visited the hospital Wednesday, said the national news agency, South African Press Association.

He was elected the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed. Nelson Mandela Fast Facts . ""He is our hero. He is my mentor, my father.

As South Africans steeled themselves for the worst, details emerged about the family's meeting in his boyhood home of Qunu on Tuesday. An archbishop also stopped by the hospital and conducted prayers, calling for ""a quiet night and a peaceful, perfect end"" for the former president. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba joined the family at the hospital where Mandela remained in critical condition, the South African Press Association reported. ""Fill them with your holy courage and the gift of trusting faith, and take away their fears so that they may dare to face their grief,"" he said, according to a copy of the prayer posted on the bishop's website.

"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) -- Flying over the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, I looked out the window and got my first exciting glimpse of the Sumatran rainforest. It was vast, lush and green, but it wasn't all rainforest. There were squares of farmland and large patches of trees in neat rows that I knew were palm oil or pulp and paper plantations. From above, the patches of green seemed to flow in and out of the rainforest, but I knew those patches of rainforest were shrinking. I turned around and saw that the other members of our CNN crew on the plane with me-- correspondent Philippe Cousteau, tech expert John Sanders and Hong Kong based cameraman Scott Clotworthy-- were all looking out the windows, too. After all the preparation and the travel delays, we had finally made it. We knew this was going to be a trip unlike any other. Our first destination was at a very remote camp in Jambi Province near 30 Hills National Park. I knew how remote it was going to be, so it wasn't a surprise when we traded our caravan of pickup trucks for three giant off-road vehicles. We knew since we were here during the rainy season, these vehicles were the only way to get up these extremely muddy mountain trails. Read more: Phillipe Cousteau on why you should care about Sumatra . I didn't know just how treacherous these trails would be until the driver of our off-road truck stopped and told us that we would have to cross the bridges on foot. If a bridge broke or the truck slid off, we didn't want to be inside. It was dark, and the CNN U.S. crew didn't have our gear because our luggage was lost in transit. I was the only one with hiking boots and Philippe was the only one with a flashlight. We eased out of the trucks into slippery, squishy mud and walked slowly toward the bridge trying to avoid deep puddles. These bridges were a test of our balance and nerve. Each bridge was two sets of heavy logs lashed together, one set of logs for the left tires and one set for the right. We looked down and estimated it to be a 6 meter drop. We slowly and carefully walked across one side, one at a time, tightrope style. Scott and John even did it carrying their cameras. Amazingly, no one slipped. Even more amazingly, the trucks all made it across with no problem. I was still very glad to see the camp lights come into view. We had finally arrived at the Frankfurt Zoological Society Orangutan camp. This group is doing some amazing work to help replenish a critically endangered Sumatran orangutan population. Their goal is to take captive Sumatran orangutans that were pets and teach them how to live in the wild so they can be released into the rainforest. Orangutans were extinct in this area of Sumatra before the FZS came here. Now, more than 140 live in this patch of rainforest. Once the generator powered down for the night, I lay in my bed and listened to the sounds of the rainforest just outside. Soon it started to rain and the sounds of the rain mixed with the sounds of the rainforest were incredible. I will never forget the sound of the Sumatran rainforest surrounding me, and the feeling of knowing the next day I would see a captive orangutan released back into the wild.","Jenni Watts produced Expedition: Sumatra, CNN's new environment special .

"(CNN) -- U.S. ski queen Lindsey Vonn damaged the same knee that underwent major surgery in February when she crashed Tuesday on a training run at Copper Mountain in Colorado. Following the incident, she was not admitted to the hospital but underwent ""further evaluation, as is typical after a crash,"" according to a statement from the U.S. Ski Team. On Wednesday, Vonn's spokesperson Lewis Kay revealed that the Olympic downhill champion had damaged the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her troublesome right knee during the fall. ""Lindsey sustained a mild strain to her right knee, a partial tear to her right ACL, minor facial abrasions and scapular contusions from her fall,"" Kay said in a statement. ""She needs to rest for a few days and then will pursue aggressive physical therapy and will determine the next time she is able to compete after seeing how she responds to the treatment. ""We will provide a further update when new information becomes available."" The news comes as a significant blow to Vonn, who was preparing to return to competitive racing after her serious knee injury earlier this year. Vonn was airlifted to a hospital in February after she landed heavily on her right knee on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria. She underwent surgery for knee reconstruction. Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn dating . Vonn was crowned America's snow queen when she became the first American woman to win the Olympic downhill title at the Vancouver Games in 2010. She followed up her Vancouver victory with a stellar World Cup season in 2011-2012, winning 12 races and the overall title with a new record points haul. A combination of illness and injury disrupted Vonn's dominance on the slopes last season. She planned to return at the World Cup event in Beaver Creek, Colorado on November 29.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Demonstrators packed Kiev's Independence Square in freezing temperatures on Sunday, rallying in defiance of new laws that set limitations on the right to protest. Protesters and police accused each other of attacks during the large demonstration, which stretched into the early morning hours. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said protesters, wearing masks and helmets, used flares, tear gas, baseball bats and stones in clashes with police, breaking doors and windows on police buses and trying to take over government buildings. Video from the scene showed protesters and police squaring off, with demonstrators hurling Molotov cocktails toward officers. The ministry said 30 police were injured, and one was taken hostage by the protesters and later released. A post on a Facebook page for Olesia Orobets, an opposition lawmaker, said she had been attacked by police and her phone had been taken away. Estimates of the number of protesters in the capital's square varied widely. At least four of them were detained by police, the Interior Ministry said. Negotiations possible . Sunday's protest marked the latest fallout over legislation that was approved Thursday by lawmakers loyal to Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who signed it into law soon afterward. Amid the clashes, there were some signs that the opposing sides might soon sit together at the negotiating table. Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Sunday that he had received a call from Yanukovych saying the government was prepared to negotiate with the opposition. The President's office said he was creating a working group to overcome the political crisis and had ordered it to meet with the opposition. The clashes and possible move toward talks come in the wake of weeks of public protests after Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned a trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead. The new law includes provisions barring people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission. Opposition politicians have objected to the way that Yanukovych's Party of Regions pushed the bill through the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. Vitali Klitschko, an opposition leader and former heavyweight boxing champion, said the law -- which was adopted by a show of hands -- was ""invalid,"" according to his UDAR party's website. He stood between the police and the crowd in the square, trying to prevent violence. The far-right Svoboda Party said in a news release that people were ""outraged by the Party of Regions actions at the Verkhovna Rada and their recently adopted draconian laws. Protesters are demanding resignation of the government and asking the authorities to stop the persecution of activists."" Kerry: 'Anti-democratic' steps . The U.S. Embassy called for an end to the violence in the streets Sunday. ""We further urge the Government of Ukraine to immediately start negotiations with all sides to resolve the political standoff, address protestors' concerns, and prevent violence from spreading,"" the embassy said Sunday. ""Violence only serves to foster fear and confusion, and distracts from the need for a political solution, which is the best way to carry out the will of the Ukrainian people."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also criticized the new legislation in remarks Friday, saying it was ""rammed through"" the parliament ""without transparency and accountability"" and that it ""violates all the norms"" of the European Union. ""We believe deeply that the people of Ukraine want to affiliate and want to be associated with Europe and they want to turn in that direction,"" Kerry said. ""And the steps that were taken yesterday are anti-democratic, they're wrong, they are taking from the people of Ukraine their choice and their opportunity for the future."" In December, despite weeks of protest by anti-government protesters, Yanukovych agreed to a deal with Russia's President Vladimir Putin for Moscow to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas. The tumult in Ukraine goes to the heart of its future ties with Russia and the rest of Europe. Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. The protests have unfolded since November 21, when Yanukovych changed his stance on the EU trade pact, which had been years in the making. The demonstrators say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. Ukraine's government said the terms needed to be renegotiated to better protect Ukrainians. Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: The President's office says a working group will meet with the opposition .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this month, a video of young men doing the ""Harlem Shake"" -- bare chests and thrusting pelvises -- in front of the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters in Cairo attracted worldwide attention, for putting one finger up to the moral authority of Islamic conservatives now struggling to govern Egypt. But over in Alexandria, a soft-spoken teenage girl offered a far more unsettling challenge to the powers that be. Hebat Allah Mahmoud, a young karate enthusiast, was refused a place in her school's tournament photo because, she claimed, she does not cover her hair with a hijab. Her teacher denied such charges of discrimination. Hebat Allah, however was unwilling to take this lying down. Instead, she took to YouTube, in a video in which she tearfully lambasted authorities for willful blindness and narrow-mindedness. Did they not know, she asked, that most of the girls put on the hijab at school but took it off once they left the premises? And she criticized teachers' interpretation of Islam, for insisting that the hijab was religiously mandated and that those who did not wear it were less worthy than those who covered. ""We should have equal rights as stressed by the Prophet,"" she told the camera. Read more: Harlem shaking the Arab world? Hebat Allah's challenge to the one size-fits-all vision of Islam presented by Egypt's now ruling religious conservatives shifted to the international stage this week. At the United Nations, governments and NGOs from around the world have been negotiating a document on the elimination of violence against women, under the umbrella of the Commission on the Status of Women. The final text, hammered out after weeks of hard negotiation, reiterates the rights of women to lead their lives free of violence, coercion and discrimination. The mere discussion of such issues was, however, enough to send Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood into a frenzy. ""It eliminates Islamic morals, and seeks the destruction of family institution,"" the Brotherhood warned in an apocalyptic official statement. ""Then society dissolution will occur, and last steps of cultural invasion will be complete."" In urging other Muslim-majority country governments to reject the document, the Brotherhood attacked it for undermining what they consider a man's God-given right to control women (through various means, including marital rape, it seems, according to their communique), further alleging that it promotes homosexuality, adultery, abortion and free love. Read more: Egyptian blogger -- why I posed naked . This hysterical response to any attempt to promote gender, sexual and reproductive rights, at the United Nations and on the ground in the Arab world, is nothing new; the Mubarak regime was just as intransigent on many of these points. And I've come across it time and again in the past five years I've spent traveling across the Arab region, talking to men and women about sex: what they do, what they don't, what they think and why. Sexuality might seem a strange focus in these tumultuous political times. It is, in fact, a powerful lens with which to study a society because it offers a view, not just into intimate life, but also of the bigger picture: politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations that shape sexual attitudes and behaviors. If you really want to know a people, start by looking inside their bedrooms. In today's Arab world, the only socially-accepted context for sex is heterosexual, family-sanctioned, religiously-approved, state-registered marriage—a social citadel. Anything else is ""forbidden"", or ""shameful"" or ""impolite."" The fact that large segments of the population in most countries are having hard time fitting inside the fortress -- especially the legions of young people, who can't find jobs and therefore can't afford to marry -- is widely recognized, but there is also widespread resistance to any alternative. The upshot of this refusal to grapple with the changing realities of sexual and personal life in the Arab world can be seen in statistics: spiraling rates of HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections, a rising tide of sexual violence, on the street and in the home, and the thriving business of clandestine abortion. And I've heard it in the stories of desperate housewives, dissatisfied husbands, conflicted youth, hard-pressed sex workers and many others whom I've met along the way . For all our constraints, the Arab world is neither hopeless, nor helpless, when it comes to sex. There are innovators from across the region who are trying to tackle the taboos, break the silence and deal with the fall out, be it getting sexuality education in schools or providing sexual and reproductive health services for young people, or tackling sexual violence, or trying to find space in society for those cross social norms, unwed mothers or men and women in same-sex relations among them. Nor are these projects simply carbon copies of efforts elsewhere in the world; the reason they are taking root is because they are adapted to the region, and work along the grain of religion and culture. Read more: Tahrir's bodyguards fight to 'cure Egypt's disease' Now Islamic conservatives argue otherwise. Too often, they say to tackle such matters is ""un-Islamic"" and a sell-out to the West. But this is simply not the case. Arab and Islamic culture has a long history of talking about sex, in its all its problems and pleasures, for men and women -- and that includes Prophet Mohammed himself. There is precious little in ""Playboy,"" ""Cosmopolitan,"" ""The Joy of Sex,"" or any other taboo-busting work of the sexual revo¬lution and beyond that Arabic literature -- much of it written by Islamic scholars -- didn't touch on over a mil¬lennium ago. On a wide variety of gender and sexual issues -- be it contraception or abortion or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality -- there are alternative interpretations in Islam. It's not just Arab human rights activists at the UN who have been making this point in recent days; Egypt's teenage karate dissident argues much the same. Those who seek to control society through religion -- in any culture -- discourage such independent thinking and diversity of opinion. But with the new climate of freedom of expression emerging in Egypt, and elsewhere in the Arab region, millions now feel emboldened to challenge these dictates. Politics, religion and sex are the three ""red lines"" of the Arab world: subjects you're not supposed to tackle in word or deed. But just as people in countries across the region are busy contesting received wisdoms in politics, and are starting to challenge the role of religion in public policy, I hope they will start asking the same hard questions of sexual life. Read more: Don't lose hope over Arab Spring . The ""slippery slope"" logic reflected in the Muslim Brotherhood's statement remains all too common in across the region. It's the fear that any move toward greater personal freedom -- especially sexual freedom -- will lead to a free-for-all and a violation of Islamic principles. But this reflects a fundamental lack of trust in the citizenry, which is a feature of dictatorship, not the hallmark of democracy. If Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood wants to walk the talk of freedom and justice, dignity and equality, that means giving people information and resources and trusting them to use it responsibly -- in and out of the bedroom. Achieving these goals in personal life is important to realizing them in public life, and vice versa: the political and sexual are natural bedfellows.

"(CNN) -- Former Olympic star Carl Lewis fails to meet residency requirements in New Jersey and is ineligible to run for the state Senate, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State Kim Guadagno decided Tuesday. Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medal winner, wanted to run for the state Senate seat in the 8th Legislative District. New Jersey Democrats had sought Lewis, a resident of Medford, New Jersey, to put his name on the Democratic ballot against Republican state Sen. Dawn Addiego, in the Republican-leaning Burlington county. Both New Jersey's state houses are currently controlled by Democrats. Guadagno, a Republican, ruled that Lewis, who grew up in New Jersey before going to college out of state, failed to meet a four-year residency requirement. The campaign for the June 7 Democratic primary would have been the 49-year-old track legend's first time vying for a political seat. The running star won four gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, two golds for the long jump and 100-meter 1988 in Seoul, two more at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and one gold for the long jump at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Lewis is the third athlete leaping into the political sphere in Burlington County in recent years. Former Philadelphia Eagle lineman Jon Runyan was elected to Congress last year and former NHL player Brian Propp ran an unsuccessful campaign for a 7th District Assembly seat in 2007.","A Republican official decides Lewis fails to meet residency requirements .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You're sitting in an airport lounge and seize the chance to check your e-mails before your flight departs. You log on and are tempted by a wireless Internet provider offering free Internet access. So, do you take it? Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. All it takes, they say, is a computer program downloaded from the Internet, an open access point and a user who has ignored basic security advice. ""The difficulty for travelers is differentiating between a good Internet access hotspot and a rogue, or somebody trying to actually glean credentials from you. The issue is that you don't necessarily know the difference between a good and a bad one,"" computer security expert Sean Remnant told CNN. In 2008, AirTight Networks dispatched a number of so-called ""white hat"" hackers to 27 airports around the world to test the vulnerability of their Wi-Fi systems. They found that 80 percent of the private Wi-Fi networks tested were open or poorly protected. The wireless security company also found that basic services at several airports, including baggage handling systems, were vulnerable to hackers. Operators were using Wired Equivalent Privacy, known as WEP, which was found to provide inadequate protection to hackers as early as 2001. One year after the survey was conducted, CNN Business Traveler met Remnant at London's Heathrow airport, which was not included in the original survey, to test the potential dangers to unprotected Wi-Fi users.  Watch what happened when we took a hacker to Heathrow » . Armed with a laptop, our ""white hat"" hacker took a seat in the crowded departure lounge at Terminal 3 and proceeded to scan the airwaves with his laptop, using a program he downloaded form the Internet called Airodump. ""It dumps everything in the air,"" Remnant explained. ""So if I execute the command to start Airodump, instantly I'm seeing probably 20 wireless networks with four or five of those having relatively weak server security."" ""There are several risks just on this screen,"" he continued. ""One is that we actually don't know whether the public networks are legitimate or not."" The original survey conducted by AirTight Networks found the most common name for rogue Wi-Fi points was ""Free Public Wi-Fi."" ""You'd have no idea if somebody sitting down to a laptop was a casual traveler trying to collect their email from an open port, or actually they were setting up a rogue access point,"" Remnant said. ""Your security guys in the airport aren't going to spot someone doing this because it's a technical thing,"" he added. Once connected, the hacker would have access to everything on your screen, from passwords, to bank account details, to the contents of e-mails. Do you suspect you've been a victim of Wi-Fi hacking? Tell us your story in Sound Off . And it's not just happening at airports. The rapid spread of Wi-Fi networks to cafes, hotels and even entire cities is providing hackers with more opportunities to ply their trade. Last month, Venice rolled out what is believed to be Europe's most extensive Wi-Fi network. According to mobile media company Jiwire, there are now more than 273,000 free and pay Wi-Fi locations in 140 countries. The majority can be found in the United States, China, the United Kingdom and France. And most hotspots are located in hotels, along with cafes and restaurants. However, the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry group that tests and certifies Wi-Fi equipment, says the increased availability of Wi-Fi has not led to a rise in hacking cases. ""We certainly haven't seen any kind of sudden epidemic of hackers in open hotspots or anything like that,"" said the group's marketing director, Kelly Davis-Felner. She said all Wi-Fi enabled devices have in-built security measures, and all users need to do is to switch them on. The most up-to-date wireless security system is WPA2, which provides greater protection than its predecessors WPA and WEP. ""If you're updating Facebook, or checking your personal e-mail or surfing the Web, there's really no reason at all to worry about using an open network,"" Davis-Felner said. ""Any kind of online shopping or banking or anything that would require you to exchange sensitive data over the airwaves, then we advise people to exercise caution."" The best way to protect sensitive information is to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which encrypts the data moving to and from your laptop. Kiran Deshpande, president of AirTight Networks, had this advice for travelers: ""Connect only to the networks that you trust. Make sure that your communication is secure, disconnect the wireless when you stop using it, and maintain the list of wireless connections that you use on your laptop so that you don't accidentally connect to networks that may spring up when you're traveling.""","Security experts warn Wi-Fi users to be more vigilant against hackers .

"Paris (CNN) -- The new Human Rights Watch report ""Torture Archipelago"" documents in excruciating detail the use of torture in government detention facilities in Syria, including how, where, when and under whose command this torture was carried out. Documenting human rights violations in Syria is anything but easy, so how did we do it? Since the beginning of anti-government demonstrations in March 2011, Syria has been doing whatever it can to keep independent observers from finding out what exactly is going on. For many months, it refused to issue visas for such work, and widespread violations were committed with few independent witnesses. Some journalists from outside Syria bravely crossed the border without official permission, to provide valuable first-hand accounts of attacks and violations. But crossing the border illegally can be dangerous. Several journalists have been arrested and others killed on these assignments, making Syria one of the deadliest countries for journalists at the moment. News: Report describes brutal torture in Syria . In April of this year, Syria finally agreed to the deployment of 300 United Nations observers and to grant visas to some journalists, but those who got into Syria have faced difficulties on the ground. When members from the U.N. observer mission, accompanied by several journalists, tried to investigate claims of a massacre in the small village of Qubeir on June 7, Syrian government forces initially prevented them from entering the village. When the observers finally entered the village one day later, they saw clear evidence that something terrible had happened. Journalists on the scene reported that ""the smell of burnt flesh still hung heavy in the air"" and that ""blood was in pools"" in a house. But somebody had removed the bodies. It is hard to not draw the conclusion that government forces held up the U.N. observers while somebody tried to clean up the crime scene. News: In Syria, a massacre feels eerily familiar . On June 16, the U.N. observer mission suspended its patrols in Syria because of increased fighting. The observer mission had also come under attack on several occasions. Further complicating the work of impartial observers is the increasing amount of propaganda from both sides. We have long since stopped trusting any information coming from the government, but we cannot always trust information from opposition activists either. Some are reluctant, for example, to admit that a victim was an opposition fighter, instead presenting the person as a civilian. So how does Human Rights Watch overcome these challenges? We get the best evidence when we are able to examine the crime scenes ourselves. Despite significant risks, we have entered Syria without official permission on several occasions to investigate alleged violations. The last time, in April, we visited five towns that had just been attacked in the northern province of Idlib. We photographed bullet marks and blood traces on walls where people had been executed during the army's attack. We interviewed neighbors who had found the bodies, and in one case, we even spoke with a wounded person who had survived an execution attempt. But rights-abusing governments cannot count on hiding the truth even if they manage to keep observers out. Syrians are still leaving the country in large numbers. By comparing information from multiple, separate, detailed witness accounts, we are wresting out the truth despite the best attempts of Syria's intelligence agencies. ""Torture Archipelago"" is based on more than 200 long and detailed interviews. We asked former inmates of government detention centers not only about the torture, but also about the layout of buildings, the location of the interrogation rooms and torture chambers, and the names of guards and fellow inmates. We documented scars and studied photographs. We asked former detainees to draw the layout of the detention floor, and we asked them to point out on satellite imagery the exact building where they were detained and tortured. We posed the same questions to defectors from the army and intelligence facilities who visited or worked in these facilities, many of whom gave us names and ranks of their superiors overseeing these detention facilities. What we found is that Syrian authorities are running a network of underground detention facilities. We have identified the locations, names of commanders, and torture methods of many of these. While the actual number is probably higher, the 27 detention facilities listed in our report are those for which multiple witnesses have indicated the same building and described in detail the torture methods being used there. By publishing this information, we are putting Syrian authorities on notice that their crimes will not stay secret. It can take time -- it has taken us several months to map these detention facilities -- but with enough perseverance, the truth will come out about the violations taking place in Syria. The question then becomes: Who will hold those responsible to account?

"(CNN) -- Infighting between Syrian rebels threatened a hospital in the northern city of Aleppo on Sunday, a source said, forcing doctors to hide patients as clashes flared between Islamists and members of the Free Syrian Army. ""Doctors are working neutrally, treating both sides,"" said the source in northern Syria, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal attacks. As doctors treat the wounded, fighters from the FSA and the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, are fighting outside the hospital and plotting to attack each other inside, the source said. The clashes come after the FSA gave ISIS members a 24-hour ultimatum to surrender and leave the country and arrested 200 members of the al Qaeda-linked group. Spain arrests suspected militant returning from Syria . ""We repeat that we don't want any foreign fighters in Syria,"" FSA spokesman Loauy Mokdad told CNN on Saturday. ""We do not want any terrorist groups in Syria. We will not allow them to make bases in Syria."" For months, the groups maintained an uneasy alliance as they fought to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. But now, infighting within the rebel groups has threatened to tip the balance among rebel forces toward militant groups and away from more secular brigades. The FSA has accused ISIS of killing FSA officers and committing crimes against civilians. ""After six months attempting to hijack our revolution and after they controlled some liberated areas and after they start to force our people to act like Islamic state, we gave so many warnings to them, that's something not acceptable for us,"" Mokdad said. ISIS issued its own ultimatum on Saturday, giving the FSA 24 hours to free their prisoners, or they will leave their joint posts with the FSA in Aleppo. Meanwhile, the source said, time is running out at hospitals in the violence-ravaged area, where diesel fuel needed for generators and ambulances is in short supply and could run out within days. Doctors, the source said, face danger from all sides. While rebels clash, the source described how government forces are closing in on three sides of the city. ""The medical staff in Aleppo will be targeted by ISIS if they know that they are treating FSA patients, by FSA if they know that they are treating ISIS patients, and by (the) regime's airstrikes if they know that they are treating both,"" the source said.","Rebels from the Free Syrian Army are clashing with al Qaeda-linked fighters .

"(CNN) -- While Tiger Woods continues to find his feet at the Farmers Insurance Open in California, the man who many are tipping to be his heir is racing to the front of the pack. Jordan Spieth fired a second-round 63 at Torrey Pines' North course on Friday to move one shot ahead of first round leader Stewart Cink, who backed up an opening round 64 with a one-under 71. The 20-year-old won the John Deere Classic last July to become the first teenage winner on the PGA Tour for 82 years and is now in pole position to claim a second tour title after producing a flawless display which included nine birdies and no bogeys.

""Any time you can shoot a lower score than a 66 or 65 and you can really get it deep and be in a zone and not worry about what your score is ... that's special,"" Spieth said, PGATour.com reported. ""That's proving that I can play my best golf when it matters on a PGA Tour venue. Each time you can do that, you get more and more confident that you can do it more often,"" he added. Woods, who was paired with Spieth, could only manage a one-under 71 to add to an even par opening round. The 38-year-old has won eight times at Torrey Pines -- including 2008 U.S. Open -- is now languishing down in a tie for 50th. ""I was just a fraction off, and at this level and on golf courses like this, if you're just a fraction off it doesn't take much, especially as tight as the North Course is,"" Woods said, PGATOUR.com reported. ""I had so many balls that landed in the fairway that went in the rough. Now I can't be aggressive, I've got to play conservative into some of these flags. When you should be able to fire at some of these flags, I just couldn't."" The 14-time major winning admitted before the tournament that time may be running out on his bid to overtake Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major wins. But Woods was generous in his praise of the man who may be a multiple major winner in the future. ""The kid's got talent. He hits it a long way, phenomenal putter,"" Woods said. ""He made a boat load of putts today from the 10- to 20-foot range, and on poa (a type of grass) greens, that's not easy to do. He was pouring them in there. He had speed to them, too. That's what you have to do to putt on poa. He putted with a lot of confidence."" Woods won't be ruling himself out of the running just yet, despite being nine shots off Spieth's lead, but will have to produce something spectacular at the weekend. Closer to the top, Belgium's Nicolas Colsaerts has a good chance of breaking his duck on the PGA Tour after a second round 67 took him up to third place at eight under. America's Billy Horschel and Australia's Marc Leishman are currently one shot further back in a tie for fourth. His compatriot Jason Day had a disappointing second round, limping to a one-over par 73 and drop down into a nine-way tie for 11th on five-under par. Lee Westwood had a better day on Friday carding a 68 after a disappointing opening round of 73 -- the Englishman is now tied for 22nd on three under with, among others, Keegan Bradley who added a 72 to an opening round of 69. Westwood's compatriot Ian Poulter will feel he still has an outside chance of victory after repairing the damage of an opening round 75 with an impressive five-under par 67 to leave him on two-under.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese communists need to fight corruption if China's ruling party is to survive, China's president said Friday. ""The Party is soberly aware of the gravity and danger of corruption,"" said Hu Jintao, who as president also serves as general secretary of the Communist Party of China. He warned that fighting corruption remains ""a major political task the (communist) party must attend to at all times"" to ensure survival. Hu spoke in a meeting marking the 90th year anniversary of the CPC. Over 6,000 invited guests, mostly top communist and government leaders and prominent party members from all walks of life, gathered in the cavernous Great Hall of the People for the gala event. For the occasion, the podium was bedecked with a giant CPC emblem, hammer and sickle, and several red flags. Hu delivered the keynote speech that lasted more than one hour. He ticked off the CPC's achievements over the past 90 years. ""China has developed rapidly in the past 30 plus years thanks to reform and opening up, and the country must promote its future development by continuing to carry out reform and opening up,"" he intoned. But he also warned that the party is facing ""long-term, complicated and severe tests in governing the country."" The major challenges for the party, he pointed out, includes ""lacking in drive, incompetence, divorce from people, lacking in initiative, and corruption."" To cope with these ""growing dangers,"" Hu urged the party to ""police itself and impose strict discipline on its members."" He stressed that the party's survival largely depends on ""cracking hard on and effectively preventing corruption."" If not handled properly, he warned, corruption will ""cost the party the trust and support of the people."" In 2010, according to Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the CPC's anti-corruption body, 146,517 party members were punished for corruption. Among them, 5,373 were criminally prosecuted. High-profile corruption cases involving senior officials, experts say, have dented the CPC's reputation and popularity. Still, the CPC remains the biggest ruling political party in the world. It boasts of more than 80 million members, or 16% of China's 1.3 billion population. Among them 24.3% are below 35 years old, and 37.1% have college or higher educations, according to Qinfeng Wang, the vice minister of Organization Department of the Central Committee of the CPC. Hu called on ""outstanding individuals in all fields"", especially among the youth, to join as party members. One of CPC's challenge, experts say, is how to attract young Chinese, especially those who were born after 1980, many of who perceive the CPC as irrelevant to their daily lives. ""The whole party must care about young people, listen to what they have to say,"" Hu said, because the young people ""represent the future and the hope of the party."" Hu also acknowledged the zigs and zags the CPC took in its 90-year evolution. ""We made mistakes and even suffered severe setbacks in some historical periods,"" he said. Hu didn't elaborate on the CPC's setbacks. Instead, he said the cause of those mistakes is that ""the guiding principles of the party at the time were divorced from the real conditions in China."" The CPC's top brass attended the meeting, including Premier Wen Jiabao, Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to succeed Hu as communist partry chief next year, and Vice Premier Li Keqiang, who is expected to replace Wen as premier in 2013. CPC was founded in 1921. It took power in China in 1949 after toppling the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) regime and founding the People's Republic of China. It has since ruled as the single dominant part in the country. Under CPC rule, the Chinese government in recent years has been confronting a slew of intractable problems, including corruption, a growing gap between the rich and the poor and environmental degradation. In recent months, the Communist Party has tightened political control after anonymous calls on cyberspace for a Middle-East inspired ""jasmine revolution"" triggered jitters in the Chinese leadership. Hu called on the party members to unite and seek social stability. ""Without stability, nothing could be done, and even the achievements already made could be lost,"" he said.","China's president says party must fight corruption to survive .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A former transit police officer convicted last year in the shooting death of an unarmed man on an Oakland, California, train platform was freed from prison early Monday morning, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. ""He was released at 12:01 a.m.,"" said spokesman Steve Whitmore. Johannes Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter conviction, but California law gave him one day of good conduct credit for each of the 365 days he served behind bars, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry said in a court order he signed last week. Mehserle has been behind bars since a Los Angeles jury found him guilty on July 8, 2010. Mehserle, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer when the shooting occurred, said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun when he fatally wounded 22-year-old Oscar Grant on New Year's Day 2009. Violent protests erupted in Oakland last November when Perry sentenced Mehserle to just two years in prison, which meant he could be released after another seven months. At least 150 people were arrested during the protests, which Oakland Police Chief Anthony Batts described at the time as ""tearing up the city."" See damage caused by protesters . Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, had asked the judge to sentence Mehserle to the maximum 14 years in prison. She and four other family members who spoke at the sentencing hearing last year called him ""a murderer."" The jury acquitted him of the more serious charges of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. Although his defense attorney argued for probation, Mehserle told Perry before sentencing that he would be willing to go to prison if the sentence made his city and family safer. ""I shot a man,"" he said. ""I killed a man. It should not have happened."" A conviction for involuntary manslaughter can carry a sentence of four years, but the judge had the option of adding an ""enhancement"" that could have made the sentence 14 years because a firearm was used in commission of a crime. CNN's Rick Martin, Alan Duke and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Johannes Mehserle walks out of prison early Monday .

"You could blame weeds, trees, and grasses if you start itching, sneezing, coughing, and wheezing this fall. But the usual suspects aren't the only triggers. A host of household items -- candles, chemicals, stuffed animals, and spices -- may be the real culprits. From blue jeans buttons to limes to teddybears, allergy triggers  come in many ways, shapes and forms. ""Many homes are filled with irritants, and if there's a high enough count of an irritant, you'll react,"" says Christopher Randolph, M.D., an allergy expert and professor of pediatric immunology at Yale University. Here, a rundown of 11 sneaky suspects -- and how to stop them from bothering you. Candles . You can't be allergic to essential oils -- which make candles smell like autumn leaves or dune grass -- but their odors can inflame your nasal cavities, according to James Wedner, M.D., chief of allergy and immunology at the Washington University School of Medicine. ""People with nasal allergies have a natural increased sensitivity, so they're likely to get a runny nose or watery eyes around candles,"" he says. ""To the person with the sensitive nose, it's no different than cigarette smoke."" What to do: If you're very sensitive, avoid candles altogether. But if you love the smell and want to use them at home, buy candles that have few ingredients and feature just one scent, such as pumpkin. By a process of elimination you may be able to pinpoint which scent or ingredient bothers you. (Smoke from candles can also be an irritant, though that usually comes from snuffing it out; open a window or blow out the flame outside.) If you have a bad reaction to a scented candle, getting some fresh air should make you feel better. Perfume . Fragrances can contain hundreds of chemicals that are mostly untested on humans, Wedner says. When those chemicals bond with the essential oils in perfumes and are then sprayed into the air, sensitive people may take offense. Sneezing, congestion, and headaches can be the result. What to do: Kindly ask your colleagues to go easy on their favorite fragrances, and bring a portable fan to keep your area as scent-free as possible. If the thought of not wearing a fragrance leaves you blue, stick with body creams and moisturizers that have light scents. These are less likely to irritate you. Soaps and detergents . You think it's the chemicals in cleaning products that make you itch? Surprise: ""The majority of skin sensitivities are caused not by the cleaning agent but by a perfume additive,"" Wedner says. ""And nearly every soap now has some sort of plant in it to make it fancy -- roses, elderberries, etc. The skin can respond with irritation, and give you a rash."" Read more on how to identify a rash . What to do: Buy organic or specially marked soaps; look for ""no additives,"" ""nonscented,"" or ""phthalate-free"" on the label. Phthalates are chemicals that help improve texture, but they've been linked to allergic reactions; products that contain them may have ""diethylphthalate"" or something similar on the label. Dove, Tide, and Ivory all offer low-irritant products, as do many organic brands. If fabric softener seems to be giving your skin fits, try using a sheet of aluminum foil in your dryer instead; this trick will get rid of static cling. Or use a scent-free, no-additive version, like Seventh Generation Free & Clear Natural Fabric Softener. If you're in a public laundromat, wash and dry towels first, which will soak up the residue left behind by previous users. Then be sure to use that same washer and dryer to clean and dry your clothes. Stuffed animals . Dust mites living in mattresses and pillows are a huge allergy trigger. Roughly 15 percent of the population is allergic to these microscopic bugs. Encasing mattresses and pillows with impen­etrable covers and cases is a useful step, but it's not enough. The mites also love kids' favorite furry toys. What to do: Wash, dry, then repeat ... and use very hot water. ""Toys should be washed at 140 degrees, which will ensure that the mites are killed,"" Randolph says. After they're clean store them on a shelf, not on the bed. What to do with the nonwashable toys? Every two to three weeks put them in a plastic bag in the freezer for a couple of hours, which will also kill the mites. Carpeting . You may love the feel of carpeting under your feet, but mites find it just as attractive. ""Even if you vacuum constantly, you've still got mites,"" Wedner warns. What to do: Remove wall-to-wall carpeting -- who doesn't like a beautiful wood floor? -- and use small rugs that can be washed in hot water monthly. ""And keep the humidity below 50 percent"" with your central air system or a dehumidifier, Randolph says. ""Dust mites thrive in humidity."" Read more on how to allergy-proof your house . Spices . They add nuance and zing to a variety of dishes, but there's no getting around spices' origin: pungent plants. For some people, eating the spices made from these plants leads to a just little sniffling. For others, it may cause itching, swelling, and even burning of the lips. What to do: Avoid the spices more likely to cause trouble: coriander, poppy seeds, pepper, dill, paprika, cumin, and saffron -- which, in broad strokes, means Indian and Middle Eastern food. If you're not sure which spices bother you, record what you've been exposed to each time you have symptoms and look for the common denominator. Need help planning an allergen-free Halloween? Read on for some tips . Christmas trees . A word to the wise before the holidays: Mold grows fast on Christmas trees. ""When you put that tree in a bucket of water, invisible mold grows almost immediately,"" Wedner says. ""Most people are allergic to or irritated by mold spores."" What to do: Try a fake tree. Can't live without a real one? Ask when it was cut down before you buy it; trees that were cut weeks in advance are already ripe with mold. Then, starve it of water and keep it for as short a period as possible. Mold grows on houseplants, too, so keep them on the dry side. Wall paint . The solvents and synthetic resins used in paint often lead to itchy eyes and headaches. Oil-based paints are a particular problem because they can continue releasing chemicals even after they dry. What to do: Keep windows open as often as possible and allow fresh air to circulate for four weeks after painting, no matter what kind of paint you use. ""Once it has dried -- and I mean really dried, weeks later -- the odor goes away, and you won't have a problem,"" Wedner says. If possible, use latex paint, which emits less gas than oil-based kinds due to its water base. By the way, there isn't any real latex in latex paint, so if you're allergic to latex gloves the same won't apply to the paint. What about paint with low levels of VOCs (volatile organic compounds)? They spew fewer chemicals into the air and are less smelly than regular paints. But that doesn't mean they won't bother you. To find these paints, look for the ""Green Seal"" certification mark on the label. Alcohol . An actual allergy to alcohol is quite rare, but being allergic to the grains and additives used in liquor is not: wheat or the preservative sulfur dioxide could cause a rash or a stuffy nose. New York City allergist Wellington Tichenor, MD, founder of the information site Sinuses.com, also blames grains like corn, bar­ley, and rye, as well as fruit flavorings. Wine and beer may create problems, too. What to do: Stick with grain-free liquors like potato vodka, rum (made from sugar), and tequila (the agave plant). Skip all flavored liquers. And if sulfite preservatives in wine bother you, red wine tends to have fewer preservatives than white. Also, look for wine labeled ""sulfite-free"" (it won't stay fresh for long). And remember that anything with carbonation (like a wine cooler) increases the likelihood of an allergic reaction, Tichenor adds. Blue jeans buttons . The buttons on your jeans are probably made with the metal nickel -- a rash trigger for up to 20 percent of women. A nickel rash near your waistline is usually itchy, red, and sometimes blistery. What to do: Take your pants to a tailor and have her replace the nickel buttons with plastic ones (another metal might also cause irritation). A second option: Coat the button with clear nail polish, a remedy found to be effective in a recent St. Louis University study. Just be aware that nail polish itself may lead to a rash if you're sensitive to it. Lemons and limes . Limonene, a zesty compound in lime and other citrus fruits, gives many people watery eyes and a burning sensation in the nose, Wedner says. It might even irritate your skin, whether you touch it or eat or drink products containing limonene. What to do: If you get a rash, treat it with topical hydrocortisone creams used for bug bites and poison ivy. Skip the lemon or lime wedge with your drink or salad, and look out for lime in salad dressings, desserts, and marinades (it's used in numerous dishes).

"(CNN) -- South Sudanese government forces have recaptured the key town of Bor from rebels after fierce fighting, the town's mayor said Saturday. Bor, the strategically important capital city of Jonglei state, north of South Sudan's capital, Juba, has changed hands several times in a month of fighting. The mayor of Bor, Nhial Majak Nhial, told CNN on Saturday that the rebels were fleeing and that government forces were on the ground. He said that the defeated rebel force numbered well over 15,000, and that the rebels had lost a lot of people in the fighting. The conflict has also taken a heavy toll on civilians in the town. Local agencies estimate that between 1,200 and 1,400 civilians were killed when rebels held Bor between December 17 and 24, the mayor said. It's not yet known how many more civilians lost their lives between December 31, when the rebels recaptured the town, and the government's reported victory Saturday. But Nhial said more atrocities had been committed while the town was again in rebel hands. ""They have taken all the cows, they have killed all the people, all the people who they've found, they've killed them,"" he said. ""There will definitely be more than 1,200 civilians killed,"" he said. ""Absolutely more than that. The local population is more than 225,000, and they cannot all run. Anybody who couldn't leave the town or the area is killed by the rebel forces. They've even killed my own aunt."" The mayor said there was no food in his town, much of which has been burned to the ground, and he made an urgent appeal for humanitarian aid. The area around Juba, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) away, is now safe, he added. Ethnic violence . The country erupted into violence on December 15, when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. Since then, militia members loyal to Machar have battled government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir. The conflict has taken on an increasingly ethnic dimension, with widespread atrocities reported. Representatives of the government and rebels have been holding talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but violence continues to wrack the world's newest country. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic warned Friday, at the end of a four-day visit to South Sudan, that one month of fighting had ""set South Sudan back a decade."" ""Mass atrocities have been committed by both sides. During my visit, I have received reports of mass killings, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, sexual violence, the widespread destruction of property and the use of children in the conflict,"" Simonovic said. ""Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands are now displaced, with about 70,000 people seeking protection in U.N. camps and 30,000 in the two U.N. compounds in Juba alone,"" he added. Medecins Sans Frontieres said Wednesday that heavy fighting over the preceding few days had wounded hundreds of people and displaced thousands. The humanitarian group, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said its teams had treated 116 people suffering from gunshot wounds in the towns of Malakal and Nasir in Upper Nile state amid clashes there and elsewhere. The charity said Friday that it had been forced to suspend its activities in Malakal after its compound was looted by armed men who threatened its staff. ""This leaves thousands of people without much needed surgical and general health care -- a matter of huge concern to us,"" general director Arjan Hehenkamp said. Museveni: Ugandan forces involved . The conflict has forced many South Sudanese to flee their homes. The United Nations said this week that about 413,000 people are displaced within South Sudan in total, many of them women and children. Another 80,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, more than half of them to Uganda, the United Nations said. Speaking Wednesday at a summit of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region in Angola, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said some of his country's troops were fighting alongside South Sudanese government forces, the Sudan People's Liberation Army. On January 13, he said, ""the SPLA and elements of our army (the Uganda People's Defence Forces) had a big battle with these rebel troops at a point about 90 kilometers from Juba where we inflicted a big defeat on them."" He added, ""Unfortunately, many lives were lost on the side of the rebels. We also took casualties and also had some dead."" Museveni criticized South Sudan's governing SPLM party for failing to prevent what he said began as an internal political struggle from turning into a deadly conflict. ""To turn a political problem into a military one, having mismanaged the political problem itself in the first place is not acceptable,"" he said. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war. Journalist Samson Ntale and CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Mayor of Bor says government forces have again recaptured the town from rebels .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A landscape restoration of a rubbish dump has won the Energy, Waste and Recycling category at the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, Spain. Spanish architects Batlle and Roig have returned a 150 hectare rubbish dump back to nature. ""La Vall d'en Joan"" (The Valley of Joan) project, designed by Spanish architects Batlle and Roig, has transformed a 150 hectare site in the Garraf Natural Park, south-west of Barcelona into a green terraced agricultural landscape. In awarding the prize, judges Luis Mansilla -- Mansilla + Tunon architects -- and Martin Keiding -- editor-in-chief of Arkitektur DK -- described the scheme as: ""a perfect example of bringing dead nature back to life by converting rubbish into a beautiful piece of landscape architecture...using few and humble means"". Joan Roig of Batlle and Roig Architects told CNN: ""The idea was to create a system of hills and banks in a way that would avoid erosion from water and to give the rubbish dump back to nature with a natural design."" Work to transform the site -- the largest landfill in Spain -- began in 2000 and was completed earlier this year. It is a striking redrawing of a previously scarred and polluted landscape. The landfill has been servicing Barcelona's metropolitan area for over 30 years. More than 20 million tons of rubbish was spread around the valley before the site was closed in 2006. In some places, you would have to dig down over 100 meters before you found soil again. But this isn't just a cosmetic makeover. There is an underground drainage system on site which filters contaminated waste fluids. Part of this recycled water is then used to irrigate the park. ""The whole project is very sustainable,"" Roig said. Furthermore, the dump is also utilizing the bio gas that is emitted to provide electricity. Some of the rubbish has remained above ground. Housed in large steel cages which flank the entrance to the site, Roig says they serve as a permanent reminder to visitors of the site's previous life. Judge, Martin Keiding told CNN: ""It's a very beautiful and simple design. It is landscape architecture that is inspiring. It is a very good example that everyone could look at and say: 'We could do the same.' This competition is about pointing out good examples that could inspire architects."" Batlle and Roig's winning design was one of eight short-listed projects in the Energy, Waste and Recycling category, which was notable for the variety of entries. They range from state of the art, hi-tech plans such as the Digital Beijing designed by Studio Pei Zhu and Urbanus, right down to low-cost, primitive ventures like the Community Cooker devised by Kenyan company, Planning Systems Services. The communal cooker is turning rubbish into fuel to feed residents of one of Africa's biggest slums -- Kibera -- on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya. The project was highly commended by the judges. ""Sustainability is a very important issue and so are the questions about rubbish, especially in Third World countries,"" Keiding said. ""The community cooker is a way of introducing a solution directly into the society."" Keiding, himself a trained architect, believes that Energy, Waste and Recycling is the most important category at the inaugural World Architecture Festival. ""We are facing big problems, so it is a great opportunity for architects to work seriously with this problem on many different levels. ""I think flashy executive buildings are interesting in one sense but they are not interesting if they are not dealing seriously with this matter. In my opinion you can throw them out. We have to be far more serious about integrating aspects of sustainability into architecture."" Both Mansilla and Keiding noted that engineering and architecture had to combine to deal with issues concerning waste and recycling. They said that achieving sustainability was a difficult task but it also represented a great opportunity for architects to contribute to the sphere.","Spanish architects win prestigious category award at World Architecture Festival .

"(CNN) -- The Egyptian president and his Islamist friends had another think coming if they thought they could sneak a radical constitution past the people who fought for democracy in Tahrir Square. The draft constitution, and the political maneuvers that made it possible, have sparked the rage of liberal and secular Egyptians, who fear their dream of a truly free Egypt, with genuine equality for men and women, for people of all religions, is slipping away. Why is democracy proving so difficult, perhaps impossible, to put in place? One reason stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what democracy means. In places where dictatorship has prevailed, many hold the incorrect belief that democracy equals majority rule. They think democracy is a method for imposing the views of those who win elections upon those who lose. Clearly, elections and majorities are a key element of decision-making in a democracy. But just as important is establishing basic principles of fairness and justice, creating a consensus of what the nation considers fair, and then developing the institutions and rules that guarantee they will survive through the ups and downs of politics. News: Morsy aide blames upheaval on small, powerful minority . The creation of that foundation is known as the ""constitutional moment,"" a crucial time in a nation's history when the people come together to decide what they believe, what truths they consider ""self-evident."" It's a moment that, ideally, sets aside the political fashions of the day. To succeed and create a stable future, it demands a measure of consensus. The heart of the political battle in Egypt today lies in the proposed constitution, which President Mohamed Morsy insists he will bring up for a vote this week, a move the opposition calls an act of war."" Many countries are familiar with this process. Americans have studied the evolution of the national consensus that led to the U.S. Constitution, a document so brief and brilliant it is regarded with a depth of reverence usually reserved for mystical religious texts. The European Union has been wrestling with a constitutional document, unable to create one that builds true consensus. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood and the more radical Islamists known as Salafis dominated the country's first democratic elections and took their victories as a green light to ignore the views of the opposition. Islamist parties had a head start in electoral politics, far ahead of secular and liberal parties. Under dictatorship, Islamist parties, though brutally persecuted, could carry their message through public services. The message of the Quran, now appropriated by Islamist parties, gave them a running advantage out of the political gate. Liberal parties have a complicated case to make. It not easy to explain that you can be devoutly Muslim and support the secular rule of law, for example. It is also easier to explain the fairness of majority rule than the concept that in democracy it is crucial to protect minorities. Bergen: Zero Dark Thirty: Did torture really net bin Laden? With easy electoral victories, Islamists proceeded to implement their agenda, much faster than many expected. A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, a man named Mohamed Morsy, had declared in 2011, ""We are not seeking power."" The make-up of the panel that would write the constitution sparked bitter conflict from the beginning. The assembly, which should have made the most of the country's precious constitutional moment, was supposed to include representatives of all segments of society, constitutional scholars, intellectuals, members of professional guilds, union members, writers; in short, views from all Egyptians. The first panel was such a transparent power-grab by Islamists that the courts threw it out. A second assembly chosen in June proved just as controversial. Once again, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party used its muscle to pack it with supporters. Non-Islamists, one by one, walked out of the constitution-writing body in frustration at the strong-arm tactics. Fearing the courts would invalidate the process, President Morsy essentially made himself dictator on November 22, the day after the rest of the world heaped praise on him for helping broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, providing a measure of political cover. The opposition took to the streets, in what started to look like Revolution 2.0. Then Morsy ordered the constitutional assembly to hurry up and finish its work. In a mad rush, with a final session of 19 hours, the assembly approved a draft. By then, all the non-Islamists walked out. The document, scheduled to go to voters for ratification on December 15, is an affront against democratic principles. It lays the groundwork for an eminently un-free future. Opinion: Morsy miscalculating Egyptians' rage . Trying to quiet the opposition, Morsy rescinded the decree that gave him absolute power, but he plans to go forward with a constitutional referendum, pushing forward a document littered with tiny seeds that can germinate into religious oppression. It is not surprising that it received high praise from Yasser Borhami, one of the country's top ultra-conservative clerics, who raved about its many ""restraints on rights"" and concluded, ""This will not be a democracy that can allow what God forbids, or forbids what God allows."" The constitution says Sharia is the main source of legislation, and establishes that the (unelected) scholars of al-Azhar, the ancient center of Muslim learning, shall be consulted on Sharia matters. The draft speaks of equality for all, but orders that the state should ""balance between a woman's obligations to family and public work."" It also says the state must ""protect ethics and morals and public order,"" and guard the ""true nature of the family."" That alone is enough to justify every kind of interference in the personal lives of Egyptians, particularly women. The draft guarantees freedom of religion, but then says this is only for monotheist religions. It also bans ""insulting prophets and messengers,"" opening the door to curtailments of speech, especially on religious grounds, and creating fears for Buddhists, Hindus, and followers of the persecuted Baha'i sect. This is just a sampler of what the constitutional draft brings. The opposition, at last looking coherent and unified, faces a steep road ahead. Sadly, so does Egypt. President Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood were not able to sneak their constitution in the dead of night. Instead, the entire country has seen the murkiness of the process. Instead of giving Egypt strong democratic underpinnings, they have built a brittle foundation for a deeply divided country. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Democracy proving hard because Egyptians seems not to grasp how it works .

"(CNN) -- Among the dead were 40 women and children. Again, as in Houla, the images are chilling. Babies, lifeless. Wrapped in blankets, white shrouds. Women with faces in hues of ghostly whites, deep purples and reds -- the colors of death. Civil war imminent in Syria, U.N. warns . The world gasped two weeks ago at the slaughter of at least 108 people in the Syrian town of Houla. Now, activists say it has happened again, this time in the village of Qubeir, not far from the city of Hama. The reactions are eerily familiar: horror. Shock. Then, reaction and blame on Bashar al-Assad and, from his government, blame on armed terrorists. Photos: In Syria, families flee and rebels fight . A camera captures the dead, some burned beyond recognition. ""Those are the children of Qubeir farm. Those are the children of the massacre, the same as Houla,"" says a man's voice in the video posted online. ""Take a look, Arabs. Take a look, Muslims. Were they terrorists? Take a look, Kofi Annan."" Syrian rebels face off with regime troops in 'sniper alley' At least 78 people, including 35 from one family, were killed by Syrian regime forces in Qubeir, said the opposition network Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Some residents suspected the Shabiha, armed gangs that work as freelancers for the government. The village had only about 200 people. In one lethal sweep, almost half were gone. Opposition activists said Syrian government forces shelled Qubeir for an hour before militias on foot turned AK-47 rifles on people, some at close range, or slashed them with knives. Opinion: The only glimmer of hope for Syria . The government said those accusations were false. Throughout the Syrian crisis, al-Assad has said terrorists are responsible for the bloodshed. On Thursday, the regime put Qubeir's suffering on terrorists and said the massacre was intended ""to be used to pressure Syria,"" state media reported. Your Take: Should the U.S. intervene in Syria? The video of the dead was posted on YouTube late Wednesday. CNN could not independently verify its authenticity. Neither could United Nations observers who tried Thursday to reach Qubeir but were blocked by the Army as well as civilians. The observers wanted to ""establish the facts on the ground"" so that the world could be certain as the United Nations General Assembly took up talk of Syria. Many nations blamed al-Assad for Houla. Would they think the same way about Qubeir? ""Shocking and sickening"" is how U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described the massacre. Syria's Christian conundrum . Then he told the General Assembly that the observers trying to reach Qubeir were shot at with small arms. Al-Assad's government, he said, has lost ""all legitimacy."" The camera pans over the bodies, sometimes in herky-jerky fashion. Plastic bottles of frozen water. Shards of ice. Summer temperatures are climbing. How else to preserve the dead? U.N. observers in Syria come under fire as crisis boils . Some victims, maybe about 40, were buried Thursday, said a youth activist who was not named for safety reasons. They were not buried in the way their families would have wanted but in mass graves. The Shabiha hauled the other bodies away to neighboring villages, the activist said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Qubeir ""simply unconscionable."" The time has come, she said, for the world to unite around a plan to remove al-Assad. Nine days ago, U.N. Special Envoy Kofi Annan urged al-Assad to take bold and visible steps to change his military stance, to honor his commitment to an agreed-upon peace plan. But the opposite has happened. Syria: How a year of horror unfolded . Annan told the General Assembly that shelling of Syrian cities has intensified, and ""government-backed militia seem to have free rein with appalling consequences."" He said: Al-Assad has not indicated a change of course. The hour demands more. Syria is on the precipice of all-out war. The camera scans the faces of the dead. You might think at first they were sleeping, they look so peaceful. Yet they did not know peace in their final moments. The next shot is of dried blood and bruised eyes and noses. The international rights group Avaaz sent out a report card Thursday on Syria's failing truce. • Launch of inclusive peace process: failed. ""The opposition is unable to organize effectively in Syria due in part to the detention, torture and murder of countless opposition activists."" • Cease-fire: failed. ""Clashes between forces are rife, and crackdowns against peaceful protesters and regime shelling of residential areas continue unabated."" • Delivery of humanitarian aid: partial. ""The government heavily controls (International Committee of the Red Cross) and Red Crescent aid routes and has prevented aid from entering across borders, while aid can only be distributed in 5 locations and under regime control. Although Assad mentioned that other agencies could enter the country yesterday, it was unclear how this will work."" • Release of detained prisoners: failed. ""While 86 Aleppo University students were released in early May, more than 600 remain in detention."" • Free movement for media: failed. ""While the regime claims 400 visas have been issued for media, journalists' movements remain severely restricted, making it virtually impossible to report freely; the people they speak to are often targeted for speaking to them."" • Freedom to protest: failed. ""Peaceful protesters are still regularly targeted by shooting and even shelling, in addition to round-ups of protesters, including children, who are routinely tortured in detention."" The camera hovers over charred flesh. A blackened corpse is said to be of a mother cradling her baby. It is unwatchable. Media websites that post the video attach warnings of graphic material. Experts on Syria agree. It is another Houla. ""Assad and his regime have been slaughtering people on an industrial scale for well over a year now, and there's no reason to think they're going to stop because Kofi Annan politely asks them to,"" said Michael Weiss of the British think tank the Henry Jackson Society. ""How many more of these bloodbaths will the West abide by without intervening to protect Syria's civilians?"" he asked. He said he the world ought to realize that the Houla massacre, however shocking, was hardly unique. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Amir Ahmed and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","A video posted online claims to show another massacre in Syria .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Libyan government on Saturday defended its brief detention of four U.S. military personnel in western Libya, saying they were taken into custody after two vehicles in an American convoy sped off from a checkpoint. When the three-vehicle convoy was stopped Friday near al-Aijalat, officials discovered that one of the vehicles carried two Americans who were armed, said Abdulfattah Saleh, director of national security in the department of Sabratha, about 50 miles west of Tripoli. As the two were being questioned, the other cars in the convoy drove off, Saleh said. One of the vehicles that drove off caused an accident, he said. The two who were being questioned as well as two occupants of the vehicle involved in the accident were detained and handed over to the Interior Ministry, Saleh said. The four were detained for hours Friday before being released, U.S. officials said. Earlier Saturday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. officials were ""still trying to ascertain the facts of the incident."" The four were in Libya ""augmenting security at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli,"" a State Department official told CNN late Friday on condition of anonymity. The detentions followed the U.S. announcement last month that it was stepping up military support for Libya's fledgling security forces, which have been overwhelmed by militia violence and unrest since the overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Popular sentiment against the various militias has been mounting for months in Tripoli and other parts of the country, including the eastern city of Benghazi, where increasing violence has included assassinations. On September 11, 2012, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi. The United States has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of anyone involved in that attack. While U.S. authorities have filed charges in the case, no one has been arrested. The detention of the four personnel followed reports of a U.S. military operation in October that saw members of the Army's elite Delta Force launch a raid in Tripoli that captured Abu Anas al Libi, an alleged al Qaeda operative wanted for his role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Libya's interim government called his capture a kidnapping and demanded an explanation from Washington. ""We value our relationship with the new Libya,"" Psaki said. ""We have a strategic partnership based on shared interests and our strong support for Libya's historic democratic transition."" Barbara Starr reported from Washington and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta; CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: The four people were held for several hours before being released, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Monday he will appeal a Superior Court's decision to reverse Monsignor William Lynn's conviction for covering up crimes of offending priests. A three-judge panel ruled Thursday that Lynn -- who had been the first Roman Catholic priest in the United States to be convicted of covering up the abuses of others -- should be released, reversing his 2012 conviction for one count of child endangerment. He originally was sentenced to three to six years. ""There is something wrong with this Superior Court panel,"" Williams said. Lynn's conviction was for not removing a defrocked priest, Edward Avery, from active ministry in the 1990s after learning Avery had molested a teen. Avery pleaded guilty in March 2012 to sexually assaulting the 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-99 school year and remains in prison. Williams adamantly expressed his disapproval of the Superior Court's decision. ""I am disgusted by the Superior Court's cavalier, disregard for the child victims of pedophile priests and Monsignor Lynn's role,"" Williams told reporters. ""Monsignor William Lynn knew Father Avery had sexually molested children."" Lynn's attorneys had convinced the Superior Court panel that the laws at the time only applied to people who directly supervised children. ""Certainly, he (Williams) has a prerogative to appeal. I don't think his appeal will be successful, but he certainly has the right,"" Lynn's attorney, Thomas Bergstrom said. A spokesman for the State Correctional Institution at Waymart, Pennsylvania, told CNN that Lynn's bail had been posted, but he hadn't been released, because of pending paperwork. Lynn's bail was $250,000, Bergstrom said. Williams said it is undeniable Lynn, now 62, was responsible for endangering the child. ""We will charge everyone that we believe we have sufficient evidence within the statute of limitations to prosecute,"" Williams said, ""No one is protected or untouchable -- wherever the evidence leads us we will go."" Lynn, now 62, made no statement after last week's ruling. After he was convicted 18 months ago, he said: ""I've tried to serve God as best I could. My best was not good enough.""

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- The South African ruling party appealed for calm Thursday after Nelson Mandela was hospitalized a day earlier in Johannesburg. A spokesman for the African National Congress said Mandela was undergoing routine tests. ""It is a well-known fact that Madiba is 92-years-old and no longer a young man,"" said Jackson Mthembu, the spokesman. ""As South Africans, let us all allow doctors at the hospital to do their best in conducting tests on our elder statesman. We also wish to confirm that Madiba is well taken care of at the hospital."" Madiba is the former president's clan name, which is popular in the country. The spokesman also urged the media to ""refrain from making unfounded and unwarranted speculation"" on Mandela's health. ""We also request the media, in particular, to give Madiba's family and the hospital the necessary privacy,"" the spokesman said. Mandela was flown to a Johannesburg hospital on Wednesday from Cape Town, where he was on vacation, according to a source close to his family who is not authorized to speak to the media. ""He is in no danger and is in good spirits,"" his foundation said in a statement. Mandela rarely makes public appearances. His last appearance was at the closing ceremonies of the World Cup in South Africa over the summer. He recently released a new memoir, ""Conversations With Myself."" The Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of sabotage and attempts to overthrow the government under South Africa's former apartheid regime. He was released in 1990 and served as president four years later.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman on Thursday to discuss recent developments in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, officials said. Netanyahu returned to Israel after the discussions, which also looked at economic cooperation between the two countries and other regional matters, one of his representatives said. ""The Prime Minister emphasized that Israel places a premium on security arrangements, including Jordan's interests, in any future agreement that will take into consideration the peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, signed 20 years ago,"" Netanyahu's media adviser said. The meeting follows U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's recent visit to the region. Kerry met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu in hopes of working out a framework agreement for the resumption of negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. A statement from Jordan's royal court said the meeting came in the framework of ""continuous consultation and coordination between the King and all the parties involved in the peace process, considering His Majesty's keenness on achieving tangible progress that meets the aspirations of the Palestinian people and at the same time protects the high interests of the Jordanian kingdom."" During his visit to Jerusalem this month, Kerry met multiple times with Abbas and Netanyahu. He declined to share details of the conversations with reporters but told them that progress was being made during the trip. Kerry has floated a proposal based on five months of intensive consultations with Israelis and Palestinians since the resumption of the peace process last summer. Defense minister comments . Earlier this week, U.S. officials reacted angrily to comments attributed to Israel's defense minister criticizing Kerry's efforts to broker a peace agreement. The derisive remarks appeared in a popular daily Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronot, and reflect Moshe Yaalon's skepticism of the Kerry-led U.S. efforts ""both in private conversations in Israel and in the U.S."" ""American Secretary of State John Kerry, who turned up here determined and acting out of misplaced obsession and messianic fervor, cannot teach me anything about the conflict with the Palestinians,"" Yaalon said, according to the paper. Yaalon later issued an apology in a written statement sent to the media from the Defense Ministry. Kerry defies the odds with intense drive for Middle East peace .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- In 17 years working at CNN I've worked on countless breaking news stories, from earthquakes and hurricanes to the 2011 tsunami that devastated Japan. But nothing prepared me for what I've seen in the past few days in my own country -- the Philippines. As Super Typhoon Haiyan weaved its destructive path across the east of the country more than a week ago, I was drafted in to help with our coverage as the network scrambled into action. It had only been nine months since I'd left my newsroom job in the United States to join our corporate offices in Hong Kong, but I quickly found myself in the city of Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas, with my CNN colleagues. I am not used to being in the field, so to deal with this difficult assignment in my own backyard, I had to shut down. Offering all they have . We wasted no time. We walked to a village nearby where we met Juanito Martinez. He was gathered with two of his friends in a shack, not far from the city's battered airport. Juanito looked at me with a smile and asked, ""Have you eaten yet? Come eat!"" I was astonished that his first words to me were to find out if I was hungry -- despite all that was happening around us. Juanito and his friends were squatting under a few pieces of overlapping corrugated metal sheets reinforced only by broken tree trunks and pieces of wood. They had little to offer as they'd lost everything. A bowl of rice and a pot of boiled noodles was all they could muster on their makeshift table. But that's Filipino hospitality. Even at our lowest moments we offer all that we have. Juanito proceeded to tell us his story. He was very matter of fact. ""My wife and daughter died in the storm,"" he said. He pointed behind to where their remains still lay. In a gentle tone he added, ""I just want to know where their bodies will be taken so I can light a candle for them."" That was it. That was his only request. Juanito looked at me again and smiled. He repeated his invitation, ""Come eat!"" When it started to rain again I looked around me. There was not a single house left standing. There was nowhere to seek shelter. The entire area was completely flattened and littered with debris and the occasional body of another tragic victim. I couldn't imagine how people managed to survive day after day, night after night. People lined up in droves at the airport to get out of typhoon-ravaged Tacloban. One woman told me, ""I have nothing left here. There is nothing left here. So we are leaving."" But others chose to stay behind. Some did not have a choice. 'Tsunami' shock . Many of those we talked to said they thought it was just another storm -- the usual heavy rainfall and strong winds they were so used to. So they stayed home. But it was the unexpected storm surge that destroyed and killed. Some called it a tsunami. One woman told us the water went as high as a five-meter tree. Whispering in short phrases, she described how the water rose quickly and swept her four-month-old baby and her three-year-old from her arms. I'm a mother too and thought about my own children. I could not wait to hold them in my arms. Everyone had a story to tell: the little girl who waited patiently with her mother at the airport, the young mother who lost her husband, six children, mother and siblings. And then there was the man who wanted to end his life because his beloved wife and two daughters died in the storm. Courage . But amid the widespread grief and despair, it was the extraordinary courage of my fellow Filipinos in Tacloban that struck me most. On our final day in Tacloban, I saw a group of people walking back to town. A man looked up to the sky and asked out loud, ""How much longer? How much longer?"" I wished I had an answer for him. There was little I could do, little that I could give. I only had some cereal bars and crackers in my backpack that I gave away to people at the airport before I got on a plane back to Manila. I eventually arrived back in the capital to numerous emails, texts, and messages on my cellphone and on my Facebook page from family and friends. I was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, their willingness to help. I was seeing first-hand how my fellow Filipinos were coming together before my eyes -- organizing and volunteering. I have lived overseas for almost two decades but my return to the Philippines allowed me to witness Filipinos at their worst and best. The Filipino spirit is alive among us.
