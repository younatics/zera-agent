"A breakthrough in the design of batteries could mean the days when your mobile phone spends half the time plugged into the wall are numbered. A remarkable new prototype battery needs just 12 minutes to fully recharge, rather than the hours conventional cells need to replenish. What's more, researchers at the University of Maryland say their new invention could bring about the long sought-for miniaturisation of energy storage components. Cross section: A new kind of battery made from millions of tiny nano-sized cells could revolutionise electrical energy storage and slash the time it takes to charge our electronic devices . That's the breakthrough that might finally allow electric cars to give petrol-powered vehicles a run for their money. The battery uses structures called nanopores to hold electrolyte to carry electrical charge between nanotube electrodes at either end. Many millions of these nanopore cells can be crammed into one larger battery the size of a postage stamp. Co-author Eleanor Gillette said: 'A nanopore is a tiny hole, 80,000 times smaller than a human hair, that's made in a sheet of ceramic material.' Chanyuan Liu, lead author, added: 'We coat energy storage material at two ends of this nanopore, then after fuelling the electrolyte each single nanopore will become a battery and all of them are connected in parallel.' Miss Liu, a Ph.D. student in materials science and engineering, says the battery, described in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, can be fully charged in 12 minutes and it can be recharged thousands of times. 'Fast charging is a very appealing quality,' she told The Times. At the moment, she said, her batteries have the potential to equal the capacity of mainstream batteries, but researchers are working on increasing their energy. 'But the best bit is how fast it can be,' she said. An electron microscope view of the battery: Each end of the tiny pore is treated to add nanotubes that collect the electrical charge conducted by the liquid electrolyte filling the pore . In a statement announcing the nano battery, researchers say they have identified improvements to the design that could make their next batch of batteries ten times more powerful. Such an advance could revolutionise electronics and electric-powered devices, finally making devices like electric cars a viable product. While a kilo of petrol stores about 13,000 watt hours of energy, a kilo of battery can only hold 500, making e-cars difficult to use over long distances. Miss Liu's battery is at the moment just a small, very thin slice of ceramic sheet. But the Maryland team say the device should be scalable. In a single postage stamp-sized area more than a billion nano-sized cells could be wired in parallel, they say. The research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.","Researchers say their battery could be a breakthrough in energy storage .

"America last night refused to rule out seeking a United Nations resolution for action in Syria, potentially delaying any air strikes even further. Despite tough talk from the White House about the pressing need to prevent further atrocities, US Secretary of State John Kerry suggested the UN route was still open and ‘no decision has been made’. His comments came as Barack Obama prepared to show politicians harrowing footage of the effects of a chemical attack in Syria. Warning: graphic content . US Secretary of State John Kerry (right) said last night no decision had been made with regard to America launching an air strike on Syria . The move is a last-ditch attempt to shore up support ahead of a Congress vote on limited military action this week. The 13 videos, which politicians will watch today, show civilians including young children convulsing and frothing at the mouth, apparently from the effects of nerve gas, then left lying dead or dying, in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta last month. Syria's President Assad's has denied having anything to do with the attack but admitted he felt partly responsible for the incident which claimed more than 1,400 lives . The footage, which was broadcast on national television in the US yesterday, has been verified by the intelligence community. President Obama promised to put the plan to congressmen following David Cameron’s defeat in the House of Commons. But his victory in the Senate or the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is by no means assured. Reports suggest both are deeply divided, and many fear their constituents have little appetite for another military entanglement in the Middle East. A defiant President  Bashar al-Assad yesterday gave an interview to the US network CBS News, in which he  denied using chemical weapons against his own people, and warned of retaliatory strikes by his allies. Mr Kerry signalled a possible return to the UN as he spoke in Paris yesterday, following meetings with French president Francois Hollande. Mr Hollande backed intervention but is under increasing pressure at home and from other European countries to take the United Nations route. The French president has promised to examine the report from the UN weapons inspectors before acting and suggested he, too, might seek a resolution from the Security Council. The US Secretary of State, who will hold talks with Foreign Secretary William Hague in London today, said: ‘On President Hollande’s comments with respect to the UN, the president [Barack Obama], and all of us, are listening carefully to all of our friends. ‘No decision has been made by the president.’ Any attempt to get such a resolution would almost certainly be vetoed by Russia and China, and would at the very least delay any missile strikes on President Assad’s regime by weeks. President Obama said in St Petersburg last week that there was ‘paralysis’ within the Security Council. President Obama is preparing to show US politicians disturbing footage of the aftermath of the attack . The harrowing video shows victims suffering convulsions and foaming of the mouth after nerve gas was rained upon Damascus and its surrounding areas on August 21 . The disturbing video has been considered a last ditch attempt of President Obama to stir up support for military intervention in Syria . The US administration has made it clear they are in no doubt the Assad regime carried out a chemical attack on August 21, killing 1,429 people including more than 400 children. US lawmakers will consider a resolution authorising the ‘limited and specified use’ of US armed forces against Syria for no more than 90 days and specifically barring American ground troops from combat. As the administration prepared for days of lobbying in favour of action, Mr Kerry said: ‘The vast majority of members of Congress are undecided. And that’s why the videos are being shown and the briefings are taking place.’ One of the videos shows a room full of children in brightly coloured shirts, lying pale and lifeless on the ground. In another, a man uses a resuscitation machine on a motionless toddler. Mr Kerry said: ‘Those videos make it clear to people that these are real human beings, real children, parents being affected in ways that are unacceptable to anybody, anywhere by any standards.’ Yesterday a US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe the UN route was being seriously considered. ‘We have always supported working through the UN but have been clear there is not a path forward there and we are not currently  considering proposing another vote,’ he said.","US Secretary of State said 'no decision has been made'

"If you like vacations to include filthy bathrooms, nerve-wracking elevator rides and a potential murder scene then say hello the Leland Hotel - at least, that is, if you believe the online reviews. The historic Detroit landmark which opened in 1927 promoted itself as a luxury hotel with 800 rooms in the bustling downtown area. In its heyday, there was also a dining room, coffee shop, ball room and 11 stores. However as fortunes changed in the once-industrious Michigan city, so did the luck of the hotel where in recent years guests have complained of indescribable smells, surly staff and filthy conditions up until it finally closed its doors. Hotel of horrors: Among guests' complaints about The Leland Hotel in downtown Detroit are rude staff, paper-thin walls and filthy rooms . Enjoy your stay! The Leland closed its doors as a hotel several years ago and has been converted into apartments . Creepy: The once-grand hotel was slated by guests in reviews who described the terrifying condition of the rooms and the unsavory characters roaming the halls . Reviews posted on Tripadvisor.com by one-time guests of the Leland allege that conditions were almost comically bad at the hotel. According to a Detroit couple, who claim to have stayed in March 2009 while attending a music festival in the downtown area, the Leland 'is an experience all in itself'. The guest, registered on the travel site as Mwoike, writes: '...the staff was (is) extremely unhelpful, and when we finally got up to our room (the elevators are as horrific as everyone has described) and begun to unpack, another couple unlocks our room door and walks in. The hotel double booked our room! 'One of the years we stayed there... Someone had been stabbed right in front of the doors to the hotel and there was a huge puddle of blood on the ground. 'Another time, in the very early morning, we were verbally assaulted by someone who apparently worked in the hotel.'

Room with a view: It's hard to see what attracted visitors to the downtown Detroit landmark . Landmark: The hotel opened in 1927 but in its final years was dogged by scathing reviews from guests . They do admit that the lobby is 'huge and has an old timey beauty to it' but thanks to the dance club downstairs, it is 'like being inside a subwoofer'. Another guest Vader W, who claimed to have traveled all the way from Scotland to the hotel, complained of 'a smell to it that I could never quite work out' in the same lobby. He alleged: 'The elevators seemed like a zoo, everytime you went in you found another unique local savage and with it the feeling of watching your back and pockets.' Vader also claimed that his hotel room windows were coated in dirt, the toilet and bath had not been cleaned while the shower didn't work properly. Scary stay: Guests noted that the graffiti-tagged hallways and poor lighting were not for the 'faint-hearted' Grimy: Chunks of plaster missing from a dank wall at the Leland . Heyday: The Detroit-Leland boasted 800 rooms, a ballroom and grand lobby when it first opened in 1927 . He concluded: 'AVOID AT ALL COSTS!'

"Most great-grandmothers, having undergone surgery involving 33 cm of intestine being removed, might take it easy afterwards, perhaps recovering with a cup of tea in front of daytime TV. But one 85-year-old is nursing herself back to health in a rather less traditional way. As Britain's reputed oldest 'lady of the night', Sheila Vogel-Coupe, grandmother of Katie Waissel, who shot to fame in 2010's X-Factor, is sticking to her sideline of pleasuring male clients. Although she's lightened her workload, she's hoping to get to work full time, and is proud that she's still seeing to clients only 8 weeks after her surgery. 'I don't think I'll ever stop,' she says. Sheila, who appears in a new Channel 4 . documentary My Granny The Escort, due to air next week, explains her unusual late-life . career choice: 'The most important reason is because I love sex. Even . thinking about it makes me feel better,' she says. Still working: Katie Waissel's granny, Sheila Vogel, continues to work as an escort despite being 85 years old . 'Young men see something about me. It is . a nice feeling. Often men call me up and they say please go on talking . because you're turning me on. I'm very very sexy,' she says. During her recovery . period Sheila says she's having to turn down a string of men. She shows the camera one text that reads: 'How's my sexy young woman doing this week?' then boasts: 'It's from an accountant.' The mother of three, grandmother of 3 and great-grandmother of 2, only became a prostitute four years ago, at the ripe old age of 81. she says she missed having male company since the death of her aeronautical engineer husband in 2004, so turned to selling her body as a solution to loneliness. Sadly, . if not surprisingly, Sheila's job has created rifts in her . family, so much so that she only remains on speaking terms with one of her . three daughters. Great-gran escort Sheila flashes a black suspender belt and lacy stocking while relaxing on her armchair . At the time of the expose, during 2010's X-Factor, it was reported that Katie screamed down the phone when she found out her grandmother was a £250-an-hour prostitute. 'You'd think I had committed a murder,' Sheila says of her family's reaction to the expose, which she was tricked into by a reporter from newspaper New of The World, which has since been shut down. 'They couldn't believe it. I said, ""What do you think I've done?"" But everyone thinks about things differently I guess. 'They wanted me to promise I would never do it again, but I told them to stuff it,' says Sheila. Since then only her daughter Josie has forgiven her mother for revealing her shocking secret. X-Factor's Katie Waissel (left, with Shiela and right, pictured recently) was distraught at her gran's revelation during the 2010 series . 'It is difficult,' admits Josie. 'But if I told her not to do it, she'd still do it -- but she wouldn't tell me. If she goes off to a hotel I make her ring me first and after -- there are some nutcases around. 'She'll never stop because she wouldn't be happy,' she adds. At the time of the expose in 2010 Sheila described Katie's reaction as 'vicious and vile'. 'She screamed and shouted at me, saying ""What are you doing to Mummy, what are you doing to the family?"" 'She thinks I heaped shame on them. But I told her, ""I'm doing what I enjoy - just leave me to do what I want to do."" 'I'm proud to be a prostitute. I love what I do. I love sex,' she said. She has even extended an invitation to X Factor supremo Cowell: 'Simon's welcome any time.' Sheila, who goes by the name Grand Dame Cecilia Bird on the website for escort agency Mature Courtesans, has bedded men as young as 20 and even made kinky sex tapes, which she proudly plays on the Channel 4 documentary. Announcement: Sheila Vogel, grandmother of Katie Waissel, said her X-Factor stardom ruined her escort career . 'It makes me feel good that at the age I am, I’ve preserved my body . so well and men love it. It's lovely to still be sexy at my age. I mean, look at . this, announces Sheila. So does she do it for the sexual thrills or the company? 'I think it's both,' Sheila admits. 'It doesn't begin and end with sex, there's also companionship. I've been on my own for the last 8 or 9 years and I do get lonely. So I do like the companionship of a gentleman.' 'I really have no inhibitions,' she adds, and says she doesn't feel guilty about seeing clients who are married. Great-gran Sheila Vogel-Coupeis 85 years old but has no plans to give up . 'Some of my clients have a fetish and want . to call me mummy, auntie or grandma. I think it is a bit weird,' Sheila told The Sun back in 2010. 'It seems to be the 'in' thing. All the younger men want older women and . I'm the oldest one at my agency, possibly the oldest in the country. 'I . asked one, ""What do you want with an old lady like me?"" He said, . ""Because you're experienced, intelligent. Give me some intelligent . conversation.""' At the time, X Factor finalist Katie's . sister Natalie Davis said in a statement: 'We were completely shocked . and devastated to hear the news that my grandmother has been conducting . immoral activities, including prostitution and pornography. 'We, as a family, disassociate ourselves wholly from these activities and from any future stories that arise from them.' In the aftermath, Sheila admitted to reporters that Katie's mother Diana, her daughter, was furious with her actions. 'Diana called me a f***ing wh*** and her husband called me a wrinkly . saggy old lady. 'The family are very embarrassed about it and Diana is . making a big thing out of it to try to get Katie publicity and sympathy.' But twice-married Mrs Vogel-Coupe, who has also appeared in a porn film, is defiant. 'I work as a prostitute because I love it,' she declared. 'It gives me great satisfaction and keeps me young. 'I could go on for years yet. Why should I stop? 'I think of myself as a refined lady giving a very special service men are not going to get anywhere else. 'I've had a few celebrity clients but I would never say who they were. They worked in the music industry and TV and things. 'I like to make men happy and content. I have no inhibitions. I love people. I'm an outgoing personality who lives in the 21st century.'","Sheila Vogel-Coupe first revealed her secret during granddaughter Katie Waissel's time on 2010's X Factor .

"Castleford's plans for a new stadium moved a significant step closer on Thursday when local councillors gave the go-ahead for a major retail development. Members of Wakefield Council's planning committee approved the outline application for a £135million project for a Five Towns Park on land just off the M62 motorway at junction 32. The development includes a 10,000-capacity stadium for the Tigers as well as a new food store, shops and a country park. Castleford Tigers celebrate following the Challenge Cup Semi Final match against Widnes Vikings . The proposal will now go before Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Local Government, who has the power to order a public inquiry. 'It's a bit like getting over Becher's Brook,' said Castleford chief executive Steve Gill. 'It's a massive relief considering the amount of time and effort that has been put in to get to this stage. 'There's still a fair way to go but the vote was unanimous and I hope that will be taken into account when it goes before Eric Pickles. 'It's a major step towards getting a new stadium and providing nearly 2,000 jobs which will transform the area.' Unless the application is referred, work could start on the project later this year. Gill insists Castleford need to move into a new stadium to preserve their Super League status, arguing that the club's ageing current home on Wheldon Road is no longer sustainable.","Castleford's plans for stadium move closer after go-ahead from local council .

"For daredevil gorilla Alf the lure of a horde of autumnal acorns proved too much to bear. After discovering a tasty treat lurking at the foot of a nearby oak tree, the intelligent western lowland ape turned his attention skywards gazing longingly at the bounty hanging in the canopy above his head. Fearless, the 17-stone primate stunned keepers at Longleat Safari and Adventure Park by clambering through the branches of the oak tree to perch precariously 40ft above the enclosure's lake. Daring: Brave Alf, the western lowland gorilla, stunned keepers at Longleat Safari Park, when he scaled the great heights of a 40ft oak tree . Intrigued: After foraging around in the grass at the foot of the oak tree, Alf, the 10-year-old ape, gazes skywards at the bounty of acorns hanging above his head, left. The bright beast carefully tested each precarious branch to check it could take his 17-stone weight . Foraging: Scouring the branches Alf feasts on the tasty autumnal treats . With each step, the bright beast, carefully tested the branches anxious to see if they would take his weight. The 10-year-old edged his way further along the tree's seemingly shaky arms, balancing high above the half-mile expanse of water as he tucked into the nuts. Looking on, Alf's bemused older brothers Evindi, seven, and 14-year-old silverback Kesho kept their feet firmly rooted to the ground. Staff at the Wiltshire wildlife park watched in awe, carefully monitoring Alf's daring exploits. Brothers Alf, Evindi and Kesho, are part of the bachelor troop of gorillas at the park's Gorilla Colony, which opened last year. Keeper Mark Tye said: 'Alf has always been the more adventurous of the brothers and he also seems to be the most fearless. Stunned: Keepers at the safari park said they were surprised to see 'daredevil' Alf clamber so high into the canopy. A spokesman said while they are natural climbers the gorillas tend to keep their feet on the ground . 'We’re not entirely sure why he felt the need to climb up quite so high to collect the acorns as there were plenty lying on the ground but perhaps he was looking for a bit of peace and quiet and knew the others weren’t going to join him. 'Although the branches look quite delicate, Alf is a very smart gorilla and he carefully tested them before venturing out along them,' he added. A Longleat spokesman added: 'Naturally gorillas forage for their food, for whatever is around, be it nuts or fruit. 'They are good climbers but don't normally climb that high. Alf clearly has a head for heights. He is a bit of a daredevil. 'Gorillas certainly are not natural swimmers which is why we have the lake beside their enclosure as a more natural divide rather than bars or fencing. 'Staff observed and monitored the situation but weren't too concerned.' He said Alf is usually spotted feasting on a mix of fruit and vegetables, weighing around 5kg a day, with bananas and strawberries topping his list of favourite treats. Based on Alf needing around 5kg of food a day, the primate would need to munch his way through more than 800 of the tiny nuts to sustain him. Each acorn contains 23 calories. Satisfied: Edging closer to his goal, the western lowland gorilla perched precariously in the tree, tucking into his well-earned snack . The brothers, who were all born at Dublin Zoo, were reunited for the first time in 2010 to form the new male-only colony at Longleat. The £3million enclosure features an extensive outdoor grassy area and overlooks the park's Half Mile Lake. In addition to the trees, keepers installed a range of outdoor climbing logs and frames for the four-strong troop to enjoy. As well as the three brothers, the enclosure is home to Boulas who came from Twycross Zoo. The western lowland gorilla is native to Africa and is the smallest type of gorilla, with males reaching around 6ft tall and around 26 stone. Western lowland gorillas are native to Africa. While endangered they are more common than their mountain gorilla cousins . While an endangered species, western lowland gorillas remain more common than their relatives, the mountain gorilla. In . the wild, they live in heavy rainforests in Cameroon, Central African . Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola and the Democratic . Republic of Congo. It is not known exactly how many live in the wild. They are smaller than their mountain gorilla cousins and have shorter hair and longer arms. Gorillas have a good head for heights but are usually found on the ground living in troops of up to 30. Troops are led by one dominant, older adult male - often called a silverback. The . leader of the group organises activities including eating, nesting in . leaves and moving around the troop's three-quarter to 16-square-mile . home range. The silverback will often give impressive displays of his . physical power, standing upright, throwing things, making agressive . charges and pounding his chest while barking out a powerful roar. Despite these displays, gorillas are generally calm and are rarely aggressive. They are vegetarians and snack on roots, shoots, fruit, wild celery and tree bark and pulp.Females give birth to one infant after a nine-month pregnancy. Infants ride on their mothers' backs for the first two or three years of their lives. The primates are under threat in the wild from deforestation and hunters.","Daredevil Alf spots acorns hanging above his head .

"Questions have emerged over whether David Petraeus' mistress leaked details of the CIA's investigation into the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Suspicions over how much Paula Broadwell knew about the probe come as the CIA's former boss stepped down on Friday over the alleged affair, days before he was to testify in the investigation. Officials say they expect he will still testify over the incident, which left four Americans dead on September 11 this year, yet it will be delayed. The new concern comes over what, if any, confidential information he shared with his biographer and alleged mistress. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Close: Paula Broadwell is thought to be David Petraeus' mistress and she spoke publicly about the government's handling on the attack on the Libyan embassy . Broadwell, a married army veteran who met Petraeus in 2006, was speaking at the University of Denver on October 26 when she was asked about the attack. 'Now I don’t know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually - had taken a couple . of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the . consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back,' she said, according to the Daily Beast. 'So that's . still being vetted.' In response, the CIA denied that claim on Sunday when the tape of Broadwell's talk surfaced, saying that it was not true. The agency confirmed that since 2009 they have not had the authority to detain prisoners. 'Any suggestion that the Agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless,' they told the site. The only other news station to report that claim at the time that Broadwell made her speech to the University of Denver was Fox News, which she references moments before making the claim about the alleged prisoners. According to the clearest timeline of Broadwell and Petraeus' alleged affair, which is said to have started in 2011 and ended in 'early summer' of this year, they would have been broken up for at least a few months by the time of this conference. She went on to defend both the government's controversial reaction to the crisis and the CIA's lack of disclosure. Disclosing possible secrets: At the Denver talk in October, Broadwell spoke about a theory that the embassy was holding a number of Libyan prisoners at the time of the September 11 attack . Making the rounds: She spoke regularly about Petraeus in an effort to promote her book . 'The challenging thing for General . Petraeus is that in his new position he is not allowed to communicate . with the press. So he’s known all of this, they had correspondence with . the CIA station chief in Libya. Within 24 hours they kind of knew what . was happening,' she said. 'If you remember at the time, the Muslim video, the Mohammed video that came out, the demonstrations that were going on in Cairo- there were demonstrations in 22 other countries at the time, tens of thousands of people and our government was very concerned that this was going to become a nightmare for us. 'So you can understand if you put yourself in his shoes, or Secretary Clinton's shoes, or the President's shoes, that we thought it was tied somehow to the demonstrations in Cairo. It's true that we have signal intelligence that shows the militia members in Libya were watching the demonstrations in Cairo and that did galvanize their efforts. 'As a former intel officer, it’s frustrating to me because it reveals our sources and methods. I don’t think the public needs to know all of that. Broadwell has come under intense scrutiny ever since Petraeus, the four star general credited with the surge in Afghanistan, submitted his resignation citing an extramarital affair. Working benefits: Broadwell wrote that she learned a great deal by being mentored by Petraeus . Out: Petraeus resigned on Friday November 9 citing an extramarital affair . During the lengthy discussion, Broadwell's high aspirations are clear as she spoke repeatedly about how she has had the life-long goal of becoming the National Security Adviser. When asked if she had the chance to talk to any previous NSA's, she said that she had not but she considers 'Maddie' and 'Condi' to be great role models, referring to Madeline Albright and Condoleezza Rice by their nicknames. Broadwell's high achieving personality and her unusually comfortable nature around Petraeus raised concerns among Petraeus' close advisers in the year leading up to the revelation of the affair. To those outside the general's tight-knit circle, however, news of the affair came as a big surprise when it was announced on Friday. Petraeus was expected to make headlines when he was made to testify in front of Congress about what and when the CIA knew regarding the timeline of events in Libya when a group of terrorists stormed the consulate killing ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The affair was discovered by the FBI when they responded Jill Kelley, a Florida woman and friend of Petraeus who allegedly received email threats from Broadwell. Both Kelley and Broadwell are married with children, but that didn't stop Broadwell from becoming defensive of Petraeus. She supposedly told Kelley to 'stay away from my man'. Though there were multiple threatening emails, none of them were considered criminal so the FBI has not charged the army reservist. News of the affair 'was like a lightning bolt', said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Petraeus was scheduled to testify in front of Congress on Thursday, but that has since been pushed back in light of his resignation. Now his replacement, CIA deputy director Michael Morell, will appear instead of Petraeus. Feinstein went on to say that just because Petraeus no longer works at the CIA, that does prohibit Congress from compelling him to testify about Benghazi at a later date. WATCH THE CLIP HERE .

"Auctioneers have been condemned by Jewish leaders after selling off a haul of Nazi memorabilia in Adelaide this week. On Thursday, about 20 items from World War I and II went under the hammer and were sold to military enthusiasts willing to fork out between $300 and $700 for a slice of Third Reich history. Amongst the 560-item auction were Nazi flags, SS runes and a gas mask case. About 20 Nazi items from World War I and II were sold on Thursday, including swastika-emblazoned flags . The auction came just days before Sunday's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of D-Day that contributed to Allied forces winning World War II. But Jewish Community Council of South Australia president Norman Schueler said auction house Mason Gray Strange should have known better than to remind survivors of the Holocaust and their families of the horrific time. 'There are various ways of looking at this. The obvious thing - but not in this case - is that people are hoarding and keeping manifestations of an evil part of world’s history,' he said. 'They cling to it and see (Nazism) as unfinished work. 'In this particular case it was literally an estate and it’s sad that someone did hoard it and everyone should realise the distress it causes. This gas mask case were part of the 560-item auction held by Mason Gray Strange in Adelaide . 'It’s particularly irresponsible of the auctioneer to profit by it, especially when the world’s biggest auction house, eBay, does not permit this stuff to be auctioned. That’s the crux of it.' It has been 70 years since World War II, but Mr Schueler said it did not lessen the effects the Nazi regime had on survivors. 'They would not realise what it meant for someone to see a SS or swastika, they cannot know what it means to the family,' he said. The Jewish community says the auction would have caused distress to survivors of the Holocaust . 'It is not only felt by Jews but a lot of Germans suffered unnecessarily because of Hitler - there were many good Germans. 'Another thing that helps demonstrate the magnitude of what happened is that not only six million Jews were lost, but there 56 million people lost because of the war that Hitler started.' Despite the controversy, Mason Gray Strange auctioneer Robert Hunkin said they had received no direct complaints from the community. SS swords and daggers sold for between $500-$700 each, and flags were sold for between $300-$500 . He said it was never the auction house's intention to offend anyone. 'I do understand the history (of the Holocaust) and am aware of it, but there was absolutely no feedback to express discuss or furore at the sale,' Mr Hunkin said. 'I am very sympathetic to the Jewish community and Mason Gray Strange had no intention of offending anyone and we regret if we have.' Mason Gray Strange said they never meant to cause offence and were deeply sympathetic to the Jews . Mr Hunkin said he had decided to go ahead with the auction because there was a demand for military memorabilia in the past. 'They were German memorabilia but in previous auctions we have had militaria from all different nationalities and they always sell very well,' he said. 'We weren’t selling it to any neo-Nazis or radicals or anything like that, they were all militaria enthusiasts.' SS swords and daggers were sold off for between $500 and $700 each and the Nazi flags went for between $300 and $500 each.","About 20 items from World War I and II were sold on Thursday in Adelaide .

"Man bites dog: Ryan Wantenpaugh, 34, allegedly cooked his ex-girlfriends dog then fed it to her . A Northern California man has been arrested after his ex-girlfriend said he cooked her dog and fed it to her. Ryan Watenpaugh, 34, of Palo Cedro was arrested on Thursday on charges of stalking and animal cruelty. He remains jailed on Friday. Watenpaugh's ex told police he had repeatedly struck her while they were dating and that after one assault, she left her Redding apartment and returned to find her Pomeranian, 'Bear,' missing. USA Today reports that the woman said she suffers from bruises and minor cuts after the assaults and she claims that she was twice held against her will while she was trying to escape him. Police say the couple briefly reconciled last week and Watenpaugh cooked the woman a meal and she ate it thinking it was like any other meal. But she told police he later texted her and asked how her dog had tasted. On Tuesday at around 1 a.m. the woman . heard a truck pull up to her residence and she saw Watenpaugh walk to . her house and place a mysterious object on her doorstep. When she went outside, she saw two of the dog's paws outside her door. Police say Watenpaugh has denied killing or cooking the dog.

"Arsene Wenger insisted he never thought of resting Mesut Ozil after the German inspired Arsenal to victory at Aston Villa. The World Cup winner scored his first goal of the season at Villa Park to spark a blitz which saw the Gunners net three times in just over three first-half minutes to seal a 3-0 victory. Ozil set up Danny Welbeck for his first goal since his £16million move from Manchester United before Aly Cissokho's own goal sealed the win after just 36 minutes. Mesut Ozil scored his first goal of the season for Arsenal and also assisted Arsenal's second goal . The ex-Real Madrid ace was heavily criticised after Arsenal's 2-0 Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. But Gunners boss Wenger wanted to show faith in his £42.5m record buy and did not consider benching him. 'Not really no,' he said. 'I have many offensive players and you look to find the right balance. I gave (Alexis) Sanchez a rest because he's played many games and we have many experienced players who are top quality. 'You have to show him the confidence is there and he showed he can respond when he was under scrutiny. 'It's always a sensitive point, you don't know how people respond to that.' Arsene Wenger said he never lost faith in the German as Arsenal beat Aston Villa 3-0 . Welbeck also opened his account for the season to leave Wenger delighted. 'It was a similar goal to the one he scored in Switzerland (for England), it comes from the left and he pushed it in because the timing of his run was good,' he said. 'He had a very good performance, kept the ball well and had a good all-round game.' Villa were ravaged by a stomach bug which ruled out Darren Bent, Nathan Baker and Ashley Westwood. Midfielder Westwood withdrew in the warm-up and Andreas Weimann was sick and substituted at half-time while Brad Guzan and Fabian Delph were also ill despite playing. Danny Welbeck scored his first goal for the club after his £16million move from Manchester United . 'We had so much bad luck this week,' said boss Paul Lambert. 'Before the game we lost Darren, Nathan and Westy and then Andi at half time. Fabian had a bug and Guzan too. 'I knew we weren't best prepared because of the virus going around. A lot of the staff are not feeling good. 'It's a tough game for us when everyone is 100 per cent fit but the lads were running on empty.' Ciaran Clark and Delph had both gone close during a fast start for Villa, who would have gone top of the Barclays Premier League with a win. 'If we had scored at the start it might have given us something to hang on to. The start we've had is great and there are a lot of positives at the moment,' Lambert added, after their first league defeat of the season. 'We have 10 points from five games which is a good return.'

"Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been named in the trial of 46 alleged Islamic extremists . Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been named in the trial of 46 alleged Islamic extremists who are accused of brainwashing young men in Belgium into travelling to Syria where many are now fighting for Islamic State. Belgian prosecutors have linked the British cleric to Fouad Belkacem, the leader of a now-disbanded extremist group, Sharia4Belgium, which was established under Choudary’s guidance to campaign for sharia law in that country. Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday purport to show how British Islamists arranged a meeting with Belkacem. There is also a transcript that is said to be of a telephone conversation between Choudary and Belkacem in which Choudary offers guidance on cultivating followers. While Belkacem has not fought in Syria, the court in Antwerp has heard that he was the main driver behind the organisation. He is currently serving a jail term for inciting hatred against non-Muslims. There was no suggestion in the Belgian court that Choudary was involved in any alleged brainwashing or suspected terrorist activity. The documents also reveal that another one of Choudary’s followers, Rahin Aziz, has strong links to Belkacem. Aziz, who uses the assumed name of Abdullah al-Britani, fled Britain for Syria in March before being convicted in his absence of violence in the UK. He is now believed to be fighting with IS. In a video analysed by the Belgian authorities, Aziz threatens the use of violence unless Belkacem is released. He says: ‘We Muslims will not stop until we see our brother released or we will die on this path.’ The terror trial is one of the biggest to be staged in Europe. Belgian prosecutors have linked the British cleric, pictured in London in 2011, to Fouad Belkacem, the leader of a now-disbanded extremist group, Sharia4Belgium, which was established  to campaign for sharia law .","The 46 alleged Islamic extremists are accused of brainwashing young men .

"Police responding to a report about a loud party in Florida arrested an 18-year-old girl for allegedly serving alcohol to underage friends - while her mother was hiding in a bedroom. Mariel Weinand, 18, has been charged with one count of having an open house party in connection to the Tuesday incident. Her mother, 56-year-old real estate agent Carolyn Weinand, has been hit with 26 counts of selling, giving or serving alcohol to people younger than age 21, and a single count of hosting an open house party. Scroll down for video . Like mother, like daughter: Mariel Weinand, 18 (left) was arrested along with her mother, 56-year-old Carolyn Weinand (right) for throwing a house party where alcohol was being served to minors . Animal house: Police discovered beers and cans containing alcohol strewn throughout the Weinands' home in the 500 block of Starboard Drive in Naples, Florida . Sloshed: Police observed that when Mariel came to the door, she was so drunk that two friends had to prop her up . It all started at around midnight Tuesday when the Weinands' neighbor in Naples called police to report an out-of-control gathering taking place in their home in the 500 block of Starboard Drive, the station NBC2 reported. When officers arrived on the scene, they witnessed some 20 party-goers scurrying inside the house, locking the doors and switching off the lights in a failed bid to fool police into thinking that no one was home. Mariel Weinand eventually came out to talk to the officers, who observed that that the petite, 5-foot-1 blonde was so drunk that she had to be propped up by two friends. Web of lies: When police reached Carolyn Weinand on the phone, she claimed that she was out of town and knew nothing about her daughter's alcohol-fueled party . Shocking find: As police were searching the house for Mariel's guests, they discovered her mother (center) hiding in a bedroom . The 18-year-old reportedly told police that the house belonged to her realtor mother, who was out of town that night. When police reached Mrs Weinand on the phone, the 56-year-old woman said that she was away and knew nothing about the party, but gave officers permission to clear her home. Inside, police said they found bottles and cans containing alcohol littering the property, along with a small amount of marijuana outside. Party girl: The 18-year-old had about 20 people over at the house drinking and smoking marijuana . Excuses: Mrs Weinand told officers she thought she was keeping her daughter (pictured) and her friends safe by hosting the party in her home . As the responding officers were searching the premises for Weinand's guests, they came across none other than then teen's mother hiding in the bedroom – even though she was supposed to be out of town. Carolyn Weinand came clean that she was aware of the soiree and said she thought she was keeping her daughter and the girl's friends safe by hosting the party in her house and not allowing the teens to drink and drive. The 56-year-old mother also admitted that she knew that alcohol was being served to minors, but denied buying it for the party.","Police in Naples, Florida, said Mariel Weinand, 18, was so drunk she could not stand on her own .

"A war hero who lost both legs and an arm while serving in Afghanistan has called Facebook 'harsh and narrow-minded' after they removed a picture of one of his stumps because it was 'offensive'. Former Corporal Andy Reid, 37, from St Helens, Merseyside became a triple-amputee when a landmine exploded while he was on patrol in Helmand Province in 2009. The father-of-one posted the picture of his stump with the caption 'hard work on the legs today'. Scroll down for video . Andy Reid, 37, from St Helens, Merseyside, (pictured right at Camp Bastion in 2009) said the decision by Facebook to remove the photo of the stump was 'harsh and narrow-minded' But it was taken down by the social media's site communities team after a user complained about it. The site removed the innocent image, despite the fact it does not ban violent clips, including beheadings. He told The Sun: 'It's just a picture of my leg at the end of the day. What's offensive about it? 'This is nowhere near as offensive as some of the pictures spreading from Islamic State fighters. 'What's the difference between me without my leg on and pictures of what's going in Gaza? Corporal Reid who served with 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said he posted the picture to show people what it is like to live as an amputee. The photo was linked to the Facebook page of Pilgrim Bandits, a charity that takes injured troops on excursions. Deborah Risbridger, a spokesman for the group, confirmed that Facebook had taken it down because it was deemed 'offensive'. Corporal Reid talks to Prince Charles after winning the overcoming adversity award at the 'Millies' in 2010 . Corporal Reid stepped on a landmine whilst out on patrol in Helmand Province in October 2009 . She said she was 'bemused' by the decision, considering some of the content readily available on the site, including images of beheadings and executions. 'This is common currency for these guys and it is not remarkable for Andy,' she added. 'When you set it against that backdrop it seems particularly harsh to have it removed.' Facebook operate a system where a user can 'report' content if they believe it is explicit or offensive. This is then flagged up to their communities team who then decide whether it should be removed.

A spokesman said: 'Our experts work quickly and efficiently to review every report. Occasionally they make a mistake.

"The government body NICE said thousands of deaths could be avoided each year if doctors and nurses wash their hands. Stock picture . One in 16 patients are developing infections on NHS wards because of poor hygiene among staff, according to NICE. The government body says 800 patients a day – or 300,000 a year – are infected by a member of staff or by dirty equipment. It is estimated the infections cause 5,000 deaths annually and contribute to another 15,000. NICE says the figures are ‘unacceptable’ and that many of the deaths could be avoided if doctors and nurses simply washed their hands. Campaigners accuse NHS  staff of becoming ‘complacent’ about hygiene and say patients are becoming ‘more ill’ in hospital when they should be getting better. While hospitals have taken deep-cleaning measures to eliminate superbugs such as MRSA, there are fears staff may have failed to carry out more routine hygiene measures to control other infections. NICE today issues new – seemingly basic – hygiene guidelines. They include telling staff to wash their hands between patients, making sure equipment is clean and not leaving tubes inside patients for too long. Professor Gillian Leng, NICE deputy chief executive, said: ‘It is unacceptable that infection rates are still so high within the NHS. 'Infections are a costly and avoidable burden. They hinder a patient’s recovery, can make underlying conditions worse, and reduce quality of life. ‘Although there have been major improvements within the NHS in infection control, particularly in relation to Clostridium difficile and MRSA bloodstream infections in the last few years, healthcare-associated infections are still a very real threat to patients.’ The guidance from NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) includes telling managers to carry out regular checks on whether staff are washing their hands properly and to ensure enough soap and hand-gel is provided on each ward. Doctors are also told not to prescribe antibiotics too freely – and certainly not for colds and coughs – amid fears that bacteria are becoming resistant. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘People go to hospital to get better but it appears that they are at risk of becoming more ill due to infections. ‘This is an avoidable “never event” that must be stopped from happening urgently. It is simply unacceptable that patients are still being exposed to such high risks of infections, which in some cases can lead to the death of the patient. One in 16 patients are developing infections such as MRSA on NHS wards because of poor hygiene among staff. NICE says it is estimated the bugs cause 5,000 deaths a year, and contribute to another 15,000. Stock picture . ‘Concerns over hospital-acquired infections are nothing new and warnings highlighted over the last decade have not been heeded. ‘It would appear that infection control is dropping off the NHS agenda and healthcare workers and hospital managers have become complacent in recent years over this issue. ‘Many patients who are admitted to hospital are frail and elderly and very vulnerable and are at serious risk of acquiring infections. We receive many calls to our helpline every year from patients who are concerned about the cleanliness of their hospitals.’ Half of junior doctors should start . their new jobs a month later to prevent a surge in death rates, experts . say. The Academy of Royal Medical Colleges has called for a shake-up to . the training system to reduce the impact of ‘Black Wednesday’, which . falls in the first week in August. This is when thousands of junior . doctors start their new jobs and figures show patients admitted on this . date are 6 per cent more likely to die. The academy wants half of . junior doctors – those who have already been working for one year – to . start their new jobs in September. In recent years hospitals have been concentrating on eliminating the superbugs MRSA and C difficile by deep-cleaning wards and carrying out regular checks. But there is concern staff have taken their eyes off the ball in terms of following basic hygiene practices. Tom Sandford, director of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Infection prevention and control are key to patient safety and need to be prioritised by every health service organisation. It is vital that all healthcare workers are actively involved in upholding infection control and hygiene standards and nursing staff have been at the forefront of many successful efforts to reduce infections and promote patient safety. ‘Infection prevention and control are serious issues that require clear leadership.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘MRSA and C difficile rates are at the lowest levels since mandatory surveillance began. ‘Data shows that England has one of the lowest rate of infection per inpatient treated in Europe. But we know that there is more to do to on preventable infections and NICE is right to urge the NHS to go faster on this. ‘Last month we announced a new safety drive so the NHS can halve avoidable harm, including preventable infections, and halve the costs of avoidable harm over the next three years.’ Actress Amanda Redman has revealed how her mother almost died after contracting a string of potentially lethal infections following a routine operation. The actress said her mother Joan was taken to the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton earlier this year after suffering from gallstones. She claims the 79-year-old spent two months in intensive care, almost dying four times, after catching ‘several’ infections. Miss Redman, 56, said: ‘My mum has been incredibly ill. She has been in hospital for two months in intensive care. Actress Amanda Redman has revealed how her mother almost died after contracting a string of potentially lethal infections after being admitted to the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton earlier this year, suffering gallstones . ‘She is slowing getting better. She went in with gallstones and then she had several different infections. She has nearly died four times now. ‘We are so close and it has been hideous. But she is getting better now, which is great. ‘On top of that, one of my oldest friends, who I have known since I was 14, also died recently. He was 71 and was in the same hospital as Mum. ‘He told me he had been given hours to live and I thought he was being dramatic. ‘I held his hand all night and he died the next morning. It was such a shock.’ The actress, best known for her role in the BBC series New Tricks, said her mother had been 'incredibly ill' Miss Redman is best known for her role as Sandra Pullman in the long-running BBC One series New Tricks. She is now appearing in a new ITV drama about comedian Tommy Cooper. Her father died when she was a teenager, and her brother Tim died of pneumonia at the Royal Sussex Hospital in 2008 at the age of 43. Asked if her mother’s hospital ordeal and her friend’s death had made her more aware of her own mortality, she told Yours magazine that she had cut dairy products from her diet and given up smoking. She added: ‘With my friend and mum being ill, it has made me a lot more health conscious. ‘Mum has got all her marbles and she is so strong. But physically, she is dreadful. I don’t want to be like that.’ A spokesman for the Royal Sussex Hospital declined to comment last night. Miss Redman has not accused the hospital of inadequate care or failing to look after her elderly mother. However, in 2005 the hospital became the subject of an undercover investigation by the BBC’s Panorama programme. It revealed elderly patients suffering neglect and a series of indignities, including being left hungry and thirsty and being made to wait hours to go to the toilet. The programme sparked an investigation by Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, which issued an apology over ‘serious lapses in the quality of care’.","Government body revealed 5,000 patients die a year from superbugs .

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP, is facing a showdown with his own shareholders and said their anger is 'deeply disturbing'. Senior executives at several of Britain's most successful companies and banks have faced an outpouring of anger from ordinary investors over their multi-million pound pay and bonuses, now being called the 'Shareholder Spring'. And this uprising against fat cat pay deals appears to be heading for Sir Martin. Consultants ISS, who own 20 per cent of the company's shares, say its investors should vote against his pay deal and some other large shareholders plan to do the same on June 13. But in a robust defence of his salary and benefits, just a week before WPP's annual meeting, Sir Martin has warned that Britain must ensure people in its private sector are as well paid as those in America and Europe. WPP has increased its pre-tax profits by almost a fifth to £1 billion in the last year, and so senior executives like him should be rewarded, he said. 'The compensation debate in the UK now seems to have shifted, from undeserving bankers paid for failure and from payment for performance, to what is fair pay,' he wrote in the Financial Times today. 'I find the controversy over my compensation deeply disturbing. Some imagine that I wake up every morning and make decisions including those over compensation in the shaving mirror. 'The board's compensation decisions are right because they reward performance, not failure. 'I thought the object of the exercise was to behave like an entrepreneur not a bureaucrat.' He continued that he had built up the company himself and staked his own money to make it a success, adding WPP had 'materially outperformed the FTSE 100' last year and made shareholders a lot of money. Sorrell, who was paid £13million last . year, has seen his base salary increase by 30 per cent to £1.3million, . his target bonus has increased from 167 per cent to 250 per cent and his . maximum bonus has increased from 300 per cent to 500 per cent. In total, shareholder advisory . service Manifest said Sorrell could get £29million over 5 years, if he invests . £4.55million in the company’s share-based bonus scheme. His battle could become a test case for how much UK executives should be paid, experts are claiming. Last month bosses at insurance giant Aviva were left humiliated after their multi-million pound bonuses were rejected by investors at their annual meeting. Test: If it rumbles on Sir Martin's row with shareholders could form a test case for what top UK senior executives, most of whom are in the City of London, pictured, should be paid . Barclays has also received a bloody nose, with 31.4 per cent of shareholders failing to back its pay and perks. This included a package of up to £26.6million for its chief executive Bob Diamond. While mining giant Xstrata received a protest vote of 39 per cent over its remuneration report, which sanctioned a package worth £6million for its boss Mick Davis. And Sly Bailey, chief executive of Trinity Mirror newspaper group, was forced out after weeks of criticism from investors and shareholders about her £1.7million pay package. And now WPP's shareholders are threatening not to vote Sir Martin's package through. WPP's major . investors are predicting a revolt with at . least three of the group’s top ten shareholders preparing to vote . against the pay and perks due to Sorrell. Chairman Philip Lader and Jeffrey Rosen, who heads its remuneration committee, have written to shareholders claiming that WPP has ‘not been insensitive to current economic conditions’, but that the pay rise ‘reflects the board’s commitment to pay for performance’. Shareholders will vote on June 13 on Sorrell’s pay arrangements at the annual meeting in Dublin, where WPP moved to in 2008 to be outside the tax jurisdiction  of Britain. In response to Sir Martin's views, shareholder ISS said today: 'Our investor clients are quite clear that companies cannot cherry-pick benchmarks to justify inappropriate pay.' Sources close to the company suggest WPP might even consider quitting the London stock market if investors vote against the proposals in sufficient numbers ahead of the vote on executive remuneration being made binding as the Government plans in 2014. Such a move would be hugely embarrassing for the Government after it claimed last year that its business-friendly policies would persuade WPP to return to London, something Sorrell confirmed earlier this year.","The CEO of WPP faces a battle with shareholders to get his pay voted through next week .

"They say a mother will do anything for her child even if it means putting herself in harm's way. In this case, a fully-grown hippopotamus was flipped several feet into the air as she stood her ground against an aggressive elephant bull, giving her calf time to run to safety. Amazingly, she emerged relatively unscathed from the attack suffering nothing more than a little cut on the side of her body and a rather bruised ego. A mother hippo was flipped several feet into the air as she stood her ground against an aggressive elephant bull, giving her calf time to run to safety . The scene was captured by wildlife photographer Rian Van Schalkwyk, 40, at the Erindi Private Game Reserve in Windhoek, Namibia. 'I felt incredible privileged to see this. I've been in the bush a long time, but this was the most spectacular scene I've ever witnessed, I couldn't believe it,' the South African said. Van Schalkwyk, who works as a GP in Rundu, a small town in the north east of Namibia, on the Angolan border, was spending a long weekend at the reserve with wife Bonnie and a host of other family members. The spectacular scene unfolded on Sunday after lunch when all of the other guests had gone back to their rooms to sleep. Ouch: Despite the force of the attack the mother hippo emerged relatively unscathed suffering just a cut on the side of her body . Take that: An elephant bull charges a female hippopotamus as her calf scampers to safety, in Erindi Private Game Reserve in Windhoek, Namibia . Don't cross him: The hippo rolls after she is flipped into the air by the angry elephant . From the vantage point of a restaurant viewing deck overlooking a water hole, the photographer and his loved ones got a private view of this incredible animal interaction. 'I was taking photographs of the hippos in the water but because of the ongoing drought the staff came and put some grass out for hippos, because they have nothing else to eat,' Van Schalkwyk said. 'Immediately about twenty hippos came out of the water and started grazing. 'The next moment a large elephant bull came charging out of the bush in a rush, it was going for the grass as well.' The elephant was initially happily grazing alongside the hippos but became agitated and flapped its ears frantically when they began to venture closer. Charge: The hippos got to close for comfort for the elephant who was grazing alongside them happily at first . The baby hippos run for safety as the mother takes the full brunt of the force by the elephant . The scene was captured by wildlife photographer Rian van Schalkwyk, 40, at the Erindi Private Game Reserve in Windhoek, Namibia . When the hippo mother in the pictures strayed just that little bit too close the elephant decided to take drastic action. Although adult female hippos can weigh upwards of 1.5 tonnes the cow was dwarfed by the male elephant - which was able to flip her with his trunk with ease. 'She landed on her back and rolled 360 degrees down the embankment towards the water,' Rian said. 'Afterwards, the elephant just stood there and shook his head. The hippo retreated into the water. 'The calf ran away towards the other hippos and the mother stayed in the water for about five minutes before eventually coming out. 'It was incredible. It happened so quickly, elephants are incredibly fast over short distances. 'I felt very sorry for the mother trying to protect her young. It was quite emotional to see her go to those lengths, to stand her ground against a much bigger animal. 'You could see in her whole demeanor that she was quite taken aback, even the elephant seemed like he was thinking about what he did.' The mother and the calf were quickly reunited but far from being lavished with sympathy, the herd acted aggressively towards her and she was forced to retreat with her calf and stand apart from the group. The elephant's mood did not improve much, as he carried out a handful of mock charges on other hippos before venturing into the waterhole to chase away a few sunbathing crocodiles. The grumpy giant then treated himself to a dust bath before departing, leaving the hippos to finish grazing in peace. 'For me, it was the experience of a lifetime,' Van Schalkwyk said. 'I felt privileged to see animal behaviour like that, but I also felt for the mother. All of us just stood there for a while afterwards not talking, just taking in the scene.'","The female hippo emerged relatively unscathed from the attack .

"A 21-year-old college student has been charged with creating ricin after two concerned professors turned him in. Kyle Allen Smith allegedly told a biology teacher at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh he was planning something 'borderline illegal' and planned to use the chemical as 'a biological weapon'. It came after he approached a chemistry professor on October 29, asking him about oil and protein extraction from seeds to make 'ribosomal-inhibiting proteins' - a potentially lethal concoction.

"The email account that appears to belong to General David Petraeus' alleged mistress may have been broken into by hacking group Anonymous. The email address that allegedly belongs to Paula Broadwell, the biographer who is at the center of the cheating scandal that forced the acclaimed former CIA director's resignation, is listed as one of the accounts that was broken into by the 'hacktivist' group. Buzzfeed reports that the email is one of the ones that was obtained when the hackers targeted commercial intelligence company STRATFOR. Scroll down for video . A Woman Scorned? It is being claimed that the affair between David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell emerged after she sent threatening emails to Ms Kelley . Not concerned about privacy: Broadwell tweeted her personal email account to her public page . Anonymous claimed responsibility for the December 24, 2011 hack and they used the email and credit card information that they obtained from the site to make more than $1million to a variety of charities. Buzzfeed points out that it is unclear what information- if any- was stolen by the group. Broadwell's email is a major point of contention in the ongoing federal investigation into Petraeus' extra marital affair that led to his resignation. Her email that was hacked by the group was a derivation of her name, and it is not one that she has kept quiet since she posted the address on Twitter, inviting fans to email her for tickets to The Daily Show when she was doing a publicity visit to promote her Petraeus biography. 'Other woman': Paula Broadwell, left, is married . and has two children. Petraeus has been married to his wife Holly, . pictured right, for 37 years, and they also have two children . Broadwell is at the center of the storm surrounding Petraeus' downfall as she allegedly sent harassing emails to a woman that Petraeus worked with. That woman, who has since been identified as Jill Kelley, contacted the FBI because she felt threatened and feared for her safety. A government official told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.' The official added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and thought she was in a 'lovers triangle.' A person who knows both Mrs Kelley and Petraeus confirmed their friendship and said she saw him often. All three of those involved- Kelley, Petraeus and Broadwell- were all married to other people and they all have multiple children. Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student . Petraeus quit his post as CIA director in disgrace on Friday while offering an apology over the affair, allegedly with his biographer, Paula Broadwell - who allegedly sent a threatening email to another woman whom she felt was getting to close to him. His apology came as reports show that the affair blew up in Petraeus' face after Broadwell allegedly sent e-mails threatening another woman whom she accused of getting too close to him. Petraeus told friends that he had begun the affair with Broadwell shortly after he had left the Army to begin his work with the CIA, according to ABC News. Ed Williams, a neighbor who lives two houses down from the Broadwell family in Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood, told Reuters: 'Everyone is surprised and shocked.' Awkward: Holly Petraeus (left in white) and Paula Broadwell sit in the front row during the CIA confirmation . hearing of US Army General David Petraeus . Glory Days: David Petraeus is America's . best-known general and arguably the most consequential Army leader of . his generation. Here he salutes troops in Afghanistan in 2011 . Earlier in the week, Williams, a retired editor, saw Broadwell with her two children when she was voting in last week's U.S. presidential election. He said that Broadwell appeared chatty and cheerful. Neighbors were working on putting together a belated party to celebrate the release of her book. 'She gave no indication all this was going on,' Williams said. Broadwell, who is married with two young sons, has not responded to multiple emails and phone messages. She had planned to celebrate her 40th birthday in Washington this weekend, with many reporters invited. Her husband Scott emailed guests to cancel the party.","Biographer Paula Broadwell allegedly had affair with Gen. David Petraeus .

"Louis van Gaal feels ‘lousy’ about Manchester United’s dismal start to the season but is confident he will be given more time than David Moyes to revive the fallen giants of English football. United’s record of 13 points from their opening 10 league games is their worst since 1986. Previous manager Moyes had six more points at the same stage last season but was sacked 10 months into a six-year contract. Van Gaal warned that it might take until the end of his three-year deal to get it right, and admitted that the current situation is unsatisfactory for the owners and supporters after United spent more than £150million on players in the summer.

Manchester United players look dejected after Sergio Aguero gave Manchester City the lead last weekend . ‘It’s not good enough,’ said the Dutchman. ‘I feel myself very lousy for the fans in the first place, and also the board because they have a great belief in me, my staff and my players. ‘When you have 13 points from 10 matches you aren’t doing well but we are in a process. I said from the beginning when we won every game (on tour) in the United States that the process shall take more than one year — it will take three years, I hope, because that is always dependent on a lot of things. ‘I cannot say when the results will come. When I did it with Bayern Munich it was December 8, but it could be February 1 here. ‘It doesn’t matter because it’s a three-year process. I have signed for three years.’ Asked why he thought he would be given that long in the job when Moyes’s reign ended so abruptly, Van Gaal added: ‘That is only the belief in yourself and the players and the staff. It is based on that. You can think differently and believe differently. ‘I cannot speak for him (Moyes). I can only speak for myself. I have already given the answer.’ Van Gaal believes United supporters understand that his attempts to instil his philosophy in the squad have been disrupted by a chronic injury list that has forced him to adopt three different formations during his short time in England. Manchester United's starting XI the last time they started the season this poorly: . 1. Chris Turner . 2. John Sivebaek . 3. Arthur Albiston . 4. Norman Whiteside . 5. Paul McGrath . 6. Kevin Moran . 7. Bryan Robson . 8. Gordon Strachan . 9. Frank Stapleton . 10. Peter Davenport . 11. Jesper Olsen . Scorers: Davenport (2), Whiteside . Van Gaal hands out instructions to Wayne Rooney during their 1-0 defeat by Manchester City last Sunday . Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring Manchester City's winning goal at the Etihad last weekend . ‘I have experience that people have a great belief in what we are doing and in the way we are playing,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When I am in the streets I have been surrounded by very positive sayings. ‘I am training in another way to what most of the other managers are doing. I train players in their brains. Every player has to know why he is doing things on the pitch. ‘That will give results in time and not only one game. That is what I want to develop. Not only for one match, but for a certain period and that takes time. ‘That is what I have always done in all my clubs. You can listen to what the boards of other clubs have said about me. Of course, when I want to select the same line-up I cannot. I have to solve the injury problems every week. The balance of the team is the problem. That is why I have remodelled the structure of my team for the third time.’ Van Gaal has belief in what himself and assistant manager Ryan Giggs (centre) are doing . Van Gaal has to make yet more changes in central defence for Saturday’s game against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford after Chris Smalling was sent off and Marcos Rojo carried off with a dislocated shoulder in last weekend’s Manchester derby defeat. With Jonny Evans and Phil Jones still injured, Van Gaal refused to confirm whether midfielder Michael Carrick would fill in as an emergency centre back alongside either Tyler Blackett or Paddy McNair. There was at least more positive news on Rojo  with United confirming that they have decided not to send the Argentina defender for shoulder surgery that would have kept him out of action for up to three months. Rojo could now be back within six weeks, although Van Gaal is aware that there is an increased risk that the player could suffer a recurrence of the problem. ‘Maybe with this injury it is very difficult that it won’t happen again, and that’s the problem,’ he said. ‘It’s always the same with this injury, I cannot change that. The human body has been made by God, not by me.’ VIDEO Old Trafford defensive crisis for Van Gaal .","Manchester United have picked up just 13 points from 10 Premier League games this season .

"Viewers of Channel 4's coverage of the Paralympic opening ceremony last night were furious after the broadcaster repeatedly cut from the live action to ad breaks. Many took to social networking sites to complain, with several saying the broadcasting rights should have been given to the BBC instead. TV presenter Phillip Schofield tweeted: 'loving the spectacle of the Paralympics but it sits a bit awkwardly with the ads or is that just me.' Not impressed: Viewers complained about Channel 4's coverage that was broken up by adverts . When Channel 4 cut to a second ad break twenty minutes into the ceremony, viewers voiced their outrage. Channel 4 showed five advert breaks in the first hour and a half of its coverage, featuring advertisements for brands like Toyota and Asda, Paralympic sponsors like Sainsbury's and even for its own Paralympic coverage. Viewers missed an inspirational video montage and the entrance of athletes from several countries during the breaks. A Channel 4 insider said they were showing fewer ads than they usually would. The insider tweeted: 'If you're asking about ads, we're showing less than usual but as a commercially funded bcaster they allow us to show events like the Paras.' Should the BBC have bought the rights to the Paralympics - and shown an ad-free Opening Ceremony? Should the BBC have bought the rights to the Paralympics - and shown an ad-free Opening Ceremony? Now share your opinion . A spokesman added: 'We took the decision to run less advertising during the opening ceremony than would usually be broadcast in our peak time programming but Channel 4 is a commercially funded public service broadcaster and advertising allows us to invest in original programming and events such as the Paralympics.' Radio DJ Chris Evans said: 'Nice, . sell cars off the back of the national anthem. How patriotic. We'll be . right back to the opening ceremony after these messages.' The . reaction contrasted with that received by the BBC for its Olympics . coverage. The broadcaster was highly praised around the world for its . seamless coverage of all events and both the opening and closing . ceremony, while stations like NBC in the U.S. was criticised for not . showing key events live. Several Twitter users said that the broadcasting rights should have been given to the BBC instead. One user, 'Abby', wrote: 'however well Channel 4 do the Paralympic coverage the advertbreaks are going to let it down.' Jon Snow, pictured carrying the Paralympic Flame, led the coverage for Channel 4 last night . He was joined by former triple jumper Jonathan Edwards and Paralympic medallist Ade Adepitan . While 'Emily' said: 'not impressed with the amount of ad breaks already in theparalympic coverage #shouldbethebbc.' A peak audience of 11.2 million watched last night's Channel 4 coverage of the London 2012 Paralympic Games opening ceremony – the biggest Channel 4 audience in over 10 years. The average audience across the four and a quarter hour show was 7.6 million, 40 percent share of the television audience. This compares to a peak audience of 2.8 million for the Paralympics opening ceremony in Beijing in 2008. Channel 4’s Chief Creative Officer, Jay Hunt said: 'Last night's opening ceremony was a spectacular start to the London 2012 Paralympic Games and I'm delighted that so many viewers enjoyed it with us.  It kicks off eleven days of great sporting coverage on Channel 4.' 'Katz' tweeted: 'Wish the BBC had the #paralympic coverage as well. Their . coverage of the games was superb. The ad breaks on ch4 are going to get . on my wick!'

Martin said: 'So, C4 can broadcast 6 hours of music without an ad-break . but NOT our own Paralympic Opening Ceremony? Morons.' And Ross Taylor tweeted: 'Wow C4.

Dave Mager tweeted: 'An Ad Break in the middle of the #Paralympic Opening Ceremony? Disgusting.' And Twitter user Oliver Primus said: 'Nothing says 'inspirational paralympic story' like ad breaks about cars and shit films.' Dame Kelly Holmes wrote: 'What's with the Ad breaks, I want to see it.' Viewers voiced their frustrations with the ad breaks during the Opening Ceremony coverage on Twitter . Many countries missed their nations arriving at the Olympic Stadium because of the breaks . TV Presenter Clare Balding was also part of the Channel 4 team covering the Paralympics Opening Ceremony .

Professor Steven Hawking opened the ceremony with a monologue about . humanity and science and dancers with umbrellas played out a short . opening section before the athletes' parade, many took to the social . networking site to express their approval. Among the questions asked of the broadcaster was why they were able to run a six-hour advert-free music broadcast a week ago yet the Paralympics had regular intermissions . In the first hour of broadcasting there were five advert breaks for a variety of well-known brands . Some people defended the coverage, however, saying people should complain to Locog which issued the rights to broadcast and not Channel 4 .

"The Home Office is dragging its feet over plans to reinstate exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration, Nick Clegg claimed yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister admitted the Government would not meet a pledge to put in a system to track everyone who leaves Britain by 2015. But he accused Home Secretary Theresa May of moving too slowly and said he was sending in Lib Dem minister David Laws to speed things up. Checks: Nick Clegg said the immigration system inherited from Labour was a mess, not least because the last government scrapped exit checks to track who had left Britain when their visas expired . His attack comes amid growing . Coalition tensions over immigration and appeared to be an attempt to hit . back at Tories who have embarrassed the Lib Dems by accusing them of . holding back anti-immigration measures. Mr Clegg had objected to a pilot . scheme to drive vans around bearing posters telling illegal immigrants . to ‘Go home or face arrest’. Urgency: The Deputy Prime Minister revealed he has asked a senior Lib Dem to put pressure on the Home Office on a daily basis . The Lib Dems have also tried to scale . back plans for immigration bonds – £3,000 payments on top of visas . issued to visitors from high-risk countries, repayable only upon leaving . Britain. The process of dismantling traditional . exit checks at ports and airports began under John Major’s government . and was completed by Tony Blair’s ministers. One obstacle to the exit checks being . brought back in has been delays to the introduction of a £750million . e-borders scheme that will electronically collate and store information . on every passenger entering and leaving Britain by boat, plane or train. Last month, the Home Office’s senior . civil servant, permanent secretary Mark Sedwill, told MPs his department . still aimed to set up exit checks before the election in 2015, . He said: ‘The objective is to have . exit checks through e-borders and other mechanisms by 2015, so . essentially by the end of the Parliament.’ But Mr Clegg said: ‘I have been . concerned with the urgency with which the Home Office is seeking to . implement the Coalition commitment that I insisted on – that exit checks . should be restored. ‘I have asked David Laws to chase this through Whitehall day in, day out. ‘Do I think checks will be in all exit places by 2015? That is unlikely because of the complexity of it. ‘But I hope we will be able to demonstrate very significant progress.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The .

"James McClean has explained why he did not wear a poppy-embroidered shirt like the rest of his Wigan team-mates at Bolton on Friday night. This weekend's round of fixtures will see clubs up and down the country wear poppies on their jerseys to commemorate Remembrance Sunday on the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. However, Londonderry-born Republic of Ireland winger McClean, 25, took the personal decision not to wear a shirt emblazoned with a poppy at the Macron Stadium. Wigan winger James McClean refused to wear a poppy on his shirt against Bolton . McClean looked dejected during his side's 3-1 defeat against Bolton at the Macron Stadium . McClean did not wear a poppy on his shirt during a match between Sunderland and Everton in 2012 . McClean's then Sunderland team-mate John O'Shea did wear a poppy-embroidered shirt during the game . Latics' official website published a letter from McClean addressed to Wigan chairman Dave Whean before kick-off on Friday night in which the winger, who was named among the substitutes, clarified his stance. In that letter, McClean said: 'I have complete respect for those who fought and died in both World Wars - many I know were Irish-born. I have been told that your own grandfather Paddy Whelan, from Tipperary, was one of those. 'I mourn their deaths like every other decent person and if the poppy was a symbol only for the lost souls of World War One and Two I would wear one; I want to make that 100 per cent clear. You must understand this. 'But the poppy is used to remember victims of other conflicts since 1945 and this is where the problem starts for me. Former Sunderland winger McClean refused to wear a poppy on his shirt unlike his Wigan Athletic team-mates . Wigan's James Perch warmed up for his side's match against Bolton with a giants poppy on the front of his top . The giant screen at the Macron Stadium showed a tribute to Remembrance Sunday . Bolton Wanderers players and Lofty the Lion observe the minute silence during their home clash against Wigan . McClean's manager Uwe Rosler and his coaching staff also observed the minute's silence . 'For people from the North of Ireland such as myself, and specifically those in Derry, scene of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre, the poppy has come to mean something very different. 'Please understand, Mr Whelan, that when you come from Creggan like myself or the Bogside, Brandywell or the majority of places in Derry, every person still lives in the shadow of one of the darkest days in Ireland's history - even if, like me, you were born nearly 20 years after the event.

"Striking teachers and union protesters who forced thousands of lessons to be cancelled spent this afternoon drinking in Westminster. After marching past Parliament in protest at pay reforms, dozens of people carrying union flags and wearing badges in support of the industrial action were seen drinking wine and beer in nearby pubs and restaurants. One in four schools was closed and many others were forced to introduce emergency timetables after the NASUW and the National Union of Teachers (NUT) staged walkouts in the North East and Cumbria, the South West, South East and London. A group of people carrying union flags seen drinking outside the Marquis of Granby pub in Westminster . NASUWT chief Chris Keates declared today: ‘No teacher comes out with a spring in their step taking strike action.’ But . supporters of those same striking teachers seemed to be quite happy as . they spilled into the streets of Westminster clutching bottles of wine . and pints of lager. Groups . which almost certainly included teachers and union members were seen . clutching flags and wearing badges declaring: 'Protecting teachers, . defending education' as they enjoyed a drink in the sun. One . of the flags was seen planted in an empty bottle of wine outside Pizza . Express in Millbank, while round the corner groups of protesters downed . drinks outside the Marquis of Granby pub. At a branch of Pizza Express a short walk from the Houses of Parliament a woman wearing union stickers was seen clutching a bottle of wine . Empty: After a bottle of wine was emptied a protester planted a union flag in it outside Pizza Express . Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the education select committee, said: ‘They claim they’re standing up for education, but it looks like they’ve been sitting down for a boozy lunch. ‘Today’s jolly won’t do anything to convince parents that these unions really care about educating children. ‘All these strikes will do is disrupt parents’ lives, hold back children’s education and damage the reputation of the profession.’ It is the latest industrial action in a . long-running dispute over plans for performance-related pay for the . best teachers and changes to pensions and conditions. Speaking . at a rally in Durham, Miss Keates said: ‘What we are seeing is a real . air of determination to demonstrate that they are sick and tired of . Education Secretary Michael Gove's denigration of the profession and the . relentless attacks he has made on them, which they believe are attacks . on children and young people.' Ms . Keates estimated that around 2,000 people had taken part in the Durham . rally alone, and said the strikes had ‘served their purpose’. NUT general secretary Christine . Blower said: ""Today's strike action has been a great success and is an . indication of the anger and concern that teachers share about the . changes this Government is making to the profession. 'Strike action does of course always . come at a price and we are very well aware of the disruption this causes . to parents' working lives as well as their children's education. 'Unfortunately, with a Government . that will not negotiate on the issues of our dispute over pay, pensions . and workload, we have been left with little choice.' Protest: Earlier thousands of trade unionists march marched through central London on the way to Parliament and the Department for Education . She added: 'We do not want to be on . strike but if we do not make teaching attractive there will be huge . problems for recruiting and retaining good teachers. 'Michael Gove has demoralised an . entire profession and today's action is a direct result of his and the . Government's steadfast refusal to accept there are problems that need to . be resolved. 'We urge the Government to set aside their prejudices and talk to the profession for the sake of everyone.' But Prime Minister David Cameron said responsibility for the walkouts lay with the unions and that he was ‘disappointed’ they had decided to strike. ‘It is very inconvenient for parents, it is not good for pupils' education,’ he told BBC Sussex radio. ‘And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews.’ Childcare search website . findababysitter.com said it had seen a 77 per cent rise in emergency . childcare adverts being posted since Monday afternoon, compared to the . same period last week. Parents are paying out up to £100 for emergency care, the site said, amounting to £1.2 billion in total. Placards: Members of the National Union of Teachers also took part in a rally in Hoglands Park, Southampton. Target: Education Secretary Michael Gove featured on many of the placards in the protests . The unions have said that the dispute focuses on three key issues - pay, pensions and conditions. They . are opposed to Government plans to allow schools to set teachers' salaries, linked to performance in the classroom, and argue that . pensions changes will leave their members working longer, paying in more . and receiving less when they retire. They also accuse the Government of attacking their working conditions, including introducing reforms that will allow schools to have longer school days and longer terms.

Day out:  A teacher carries her young son on a march through Bristol (left) while a dog was roped into the protest in Portsmouth . Unions: A large march also took place in the centre of Bristol, with one in four schools forced to close around the country . A Department for Education spokeswoman . said: ‘The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for . pupils and parents today as possible. ‘In . spite of this, thanks to many hard-working teachers and heads, only . around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today. ‘It . is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are striking over the . Government's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more. ‘In . a recent poll, 61 per of respondents supported linking teachers' pay to . performance and 70 per cent either opposed the strikes or believed that . teachers should not be allowed to strike at all. ‘All strikes do is disrupt parents' lives, hold back children's education and damage the reputation of the profession.’ She insisted the government had met with the unions ""frequently"" to discuss their concerns, and that they would continue to do so. The first regional walkout took place in the North West on June 27, and further strikes took place in the East of England, the East Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside on October 1. Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.","Thousands of teachers walk out in dispute over performance-related pay .

"Antibacterial soap is pointless because most people do not use it correctly, a researcher has claimed. The increasingly popular product has little or no benefit for most people because they do not wash their hands for long enough. Dr Rolf Halden, from the Center for Environmental Security, at Arizona State University, says the soaps are beneficial in hospitals where people know how to use them, but that they are pointless in the home. Scroll down for video . Dr Rolf Halden says it is pointless for most people to use antibacterial soaps as they do not wash their hands for long enough to allow them to work effectively . He said that to kill bacteria people need to wash their hands with antibacterial soap for 20 to 30 seconds, but that most people only do so for an average of six seconds. As a result, he says antibacterial soaps will be no more effective than other soaps, Live Science reports. Dr Halden adds that miicrobes can also adapt to antibacterial ingredients in the soaps, meaning they become resistant to them. He believes this could even increase their resistance to antibiotics which could make it more difficult for doctors to treat infections. Dr Halden has also warned that there is some evidence to suggest the chemicals in antibacterial soaps can affect our hormone levels. During the last 20 years, the number of products containing triclosan and triclocarban – antimicrobial chemicals – has soared. Dr Halden says the soaps are effective in hospitals where staff know they have to wash their hands for between 20 and 30 seconds to kill bacteria effectively . As a result, some three-quarters of people in the U.S. now have the substances in their urine. The Food and Drug Administration has now started the process of regulating the use of antibacterial products. It says they will have to be taken out of all products unless the manufacturers can prove they are both effective and safe for human use. ‘The FDA's move is a prudent and important step toward preserving the efficacy of clinically important antibiotics, preventing unnecessary exposure of the general population to endocrine disrupting and potentially harmful chemicals, and throttling back the increasing release and accumulation of antimicrobials in the environment,’ Dr Halden told Live Science.","People do not wash their hands for long enough for the soap to work .

"This is where Abu Hamza may get his just deserts.

The fortress-like super-prison, notoriously dubbed the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies', where a clutch of terror convicts are also ending their days . The firebrand, 56, who was tried under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, had denied helping to organise a hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 when three Britons were killed. He is currently awaiting sentencing. However, Hamza is expected to apply within weeks to be moved to a cushy U.S. medical prison serve his life sentence. He wants to be transferred to the Federal Medical Centre in Devens, Massachusetts, where he will have access to a craft room and a music practice room.He will also be able to take continuing education classes or play hockey - and even study culinary arts. The application for the move will be put in by Hamza’s lawyers on the grounds that his disability - he has stumps for arms and only one eye - means he needs preferential treatment. The proper name for the prison in Florence is the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility. It is currently home to 490 convicted terrorists, gang leaders and neo-Nazis. Many have been transferred from other prisons after killing inmates or prison staff. They include Richard Reid, the attempted shoe bomber; Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th 9/11 hijacker; and al-Qaeda terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Centre in 1993 and the bombing of the US embassies in Africa. It has been suggested Egyptian-born Hamza may have come across his new neighbours before. He led the Finsbury Park Mosque in London in the 1990s, which was reportedly attended by both Moussaoui and Reid, but denied ever having met them. Hamza is likely to go to H-unit, home to a number of Islamist terrorists and Robert Hanssen, a FBI agent serving a life sentence for passing secrets to Russia. Some have held hunger strikes. D-unit houses home-grown terrorists including Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber, and Eric Rodolph, who bombed the Atlanta Olympics.

Eric Firkins, a chemistry teacher from South Croydon, England . A former hostage kidnapped by Jihadists in Yemen said today that hate preacher Abu Hamza's conviction was 'justice' for his role that left four hostages dead. Eric Firkins was part of a group of 16 western tourists taken at gunpoint 16 years ago. Three Britons and an Australian died when Yemeni forces rescued the hostages and the New York jury heard the radical preacher at Finsbury Park Mosque had been in contact with the kidnappers. It is claimed Abu Hamza had been hoping to exchange the hostages for his son, stepson and several other British radicals arrested days earlier in Yemen. Speaking from his south London home Mr Firkins said: 'I am very pleased justice has been done. Anyone that has done what he has done must be evil. 'I don't want people in our country to tolerate what he has committed, he preached hatred against the English and he did it openly and felt free to carry out acts of terror. 'It's justice. I don't want to judge anyone but I judge the bad acts he has done.' Laurence Whitehouse, who was among the hostages and whose wife, Margaret, was one of the Britons shot dead, spoke of his relief at the court's decision. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'This has taken a long time, even though there was evidence of his involvement early on. We could have had less trouble and strife in the world if effective action had been taken against him earlier.' Better behaved prisoners are granted extra privileges, with the best behaved given five hours of phone calls a month and the right to eat together out of their cells. The five extradited men will be allowed to see the imam four times a week. The library holds 158 Arabic books and 320 videos and DVDs on Islam. They will have the right to pray in their cells and have prayer beads, rugs and headgear. Inmates can also use a law library for two hours a day. Following Hamza's conviction, British Prime Minister David Cameron today pledged to 'take more steps' to speed up the deportation of people who pose a threat to his country. Mr Cameron said it was 'good that he has faced justice' and insisted he would take action to speed up the extradition process if his Conservative Party remains in government next year. Mr Cameron told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think it's good that he has faced justice and justice has been done. I think we should reflect on whether we can extradite faster. 'I think Theresa May, the Home Secretary, did a brilliant job. It took 10 years but Abu Hamza, off to America, and, of course, Abu Qatada, deported to Jordan. 'We have made progress in a way no government before us has made progress and we should be clear that we have got a good domestic record in terms of prosecuting and convicting people who are guilty of terrorist offences here in Britain.' He added: 'I think speeding up extradition and speeding up deportation... I think we need to look at the avenues of appeal that there are and make sure that those are gone through more quickly, and we have made changes there. 'Obviously, we also need to look, as I've said many times, at the European Convention on Human Rights and the position that we have got to get into where, if someone threatens our country, we should be able to deport them if they have no right to be here and that is absolutely essential that we restore that. 'We have taken some big steps but I plan to take more steps if I'm elected as a Conservative Prime Minister after the next election.'","Hamza is expected to be incarcerated there after he was found guilty of a string of terror offences .

"President Barack Obama has admitted exchanging letters with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, in a move which could set the stage for the first meeting between a U.S. and Iranian leader since Iran's 1979 revolution. It is hoped a meeting could lead to a . solution in the row over Iran's nuclear weapons programme, which Obama . said is 'larger than the Syrian crises' . Foreign secretary William Hague is also said to be due to meet Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's minister of foreign affairs,  at the UN general assembly meeting in New York. 'We came in [and] stabilized the situation' Obama told ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday when asked about economic recovery . Obama intends to close 'loopholes for the rich'...and is facing stiff opposition from Republicans. Some say they will only play ball if Obama delays enacting his health care bill . But Obama admitted that it would not be easy. In a television interview aired on . ABC News, on Sunday, when asked whether he and Rouhani had 'reached out' to each other, Obama confirmed that they had exchanged letters, the Guardian reports. Obama said: 'I have. And he's reached out to me. We haven't spoken directly...' He added: 'Negotiations with the Iranians is always difficult. 'I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy.' Tehran has reportedly also tweeted on President Rouhani's Twitter account that he would also meet Hague, despite the UK not requesting a meeting. Tehran has also tweeted on President Rouhani's Twitter account that he would also meet Hague . The Foreign Office said it had not had official word from Tehran about a meeting. The US and its allies suspect Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability. Tehran says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, but Israel regards it as a threat to its existence and refuses to rule out military action. With the election of an apparently more pragmatic president in the Glasgow educated moderate Rouhani, it has been hoped Western countries might see a better chance for diplomacy and strike a deal to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and avoid any conflict. The tweet has been accepted with cautious optimism. If Mr Hague meets with Rouhani or Zarif it could heal the diplomatic wounds which were opened when the British Embassy in Tehran was attacked by a mob in 2011. The last meeting between an American and Iranian leader was in 1977 when President Carter met Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. During the interview Obama suggested involving Iran in wider talks on Syria. He said Tehran needed to recognise the impact of what was happening in Syria, adding:  '... what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region.' Obama said that Iran's leaders should not take comfort in the fact that America has not used force against Syria and remember that preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East was a higher priority for the U.S than than ridding Syria of chemical weapons. 'On the other hand, what they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically.'","Said row over Iran's nuclear programme is 'larger than Syrian crises'

"Health tourists taking advantage of free treatment on the NHS have cost the taxpayer £40million, it has been revealed. Due to the lax system of checks carried out by GPs and British hospitals, many foreigners are able to undergo often lengthy and expensive treatment then simply leave the country without paying. Conservative MP Chris Skidmore carried out a study of 118 health trusts which has revealed that up to 3,600 foreigners run up debts to the NHS of £1,000 or more each year. Burden: Health tourists receiving treatment on the NHS and leaving without paying have cost British taxpayers £40million . Mr Skidmore is now calling on the government to introduce new laws to clamp down on patients from overseas who cheat the system. He said: 'NHS services are paid for by British taxpayers, who work hard and are proud of the health service that successive generations have built. 'Opening this up internationally, free of charge, is not fair on those who actually pay for it.' Mr Skidmore wants all non-emergency hospital patients to provide passports or proof of residence before they receive treatment. And he believes GPs need to carry out far more effective checks before they refer patients for treatment. Under his proposals, non-UK residents would also be charged a flat fee for seeing a GP. He added: 'GPs are often the first point of contact with the NHS for individuals, and as such provide a gate keeping function. 'At present anyone can register with a GP, and it is not obligatory for the practice to check whether or not an individual is entitled to free hospital care. 'It is therefore entirely possible for a patient eligible for charges to be referred to a hospital for treatment, and not pay a penny, due to the necessary information not being transmitted.' Mr Skidmore used Freedom of Information requests, to ask every NHS Trust in the country how much they were owed by foreign nationals and how much of that had been written off. Of the 118 trusts responded Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust were owed the most with more than £8million renmaining unpaid. The next two were Barts and London NHS Trust, who were owed around £3 million and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust who were owed roughly £2.7million. Earlier this week BBC's Panorama programme revealed some health tourists are paying bribes of up to £1,000 to get onto GP surgery lists so they can claim free treatment. Reform: Conservative MP Chris Skidmore believes GPs need to carry out effective checks before they refer patients for treatment . Their investigation uncovered a thriving black market in which NHS staff are illegally accepting cash. Once registered with a practice, patients are being seen by GPs and then referred for hospital treatment worth tens of thousands of pounds. The investigation found one manager at a . surgery in the West Midlands was offering to register an entire family . from India for £5,000. Research: Conservative MP Chris Skidmore carried out a study of 118 NHS trusts . He also took £800 from a female undercover reporter posing as a health tourist to put her on the practice’s list. The reporter claimed to be an Indian patient suffering from the back condition sciatica, which wouldn’t merit free treatment as it isn’t deemed urgent. But she was subsequently referred to hospital for an MRI scan that would have cost the NHS £800 – the same as the cost of her place on the list. The unidentified manager told her it was ‘good business’ as she had already got her money back with the cost of the scan – and would be likely to benefit from more expensive treatment. The manager said: ‘Just with the scan you’ve made your money.’ The investigation also discovered that ‘fixers’ – who aren’t employed by the NHS – are putting overseas patients on GP lists in exchange for cash. These individuals are likely to have close ties with managers or doctors within the surgery who agree to register the patients. Mr Skidmore said: ‘This is nothing short of abuse of precious NHS resources. It’s highly irresponsible of somebody to be making money out of patients who are vulnerable. ‘The law is clear: if you’re not eligible for free treatment then you should be paying for it.’ Only patients who have lived in the UK for the past year can get free hospital treatment. But NHS staff will treat anyone whose condition is deemed life-threatening or urgent, including women giving birth. Treatment at hospital A&E units and walk in clinics is also free for all. GPs have discretion about whether or not to charge patients who are not on their lists depending on how urgent they assess the patient’s condition to be. But GP surgeries are not legally obliged to register overseas patients. In fact many don’t, as they worry that if the patients are later referred to hospital, they won’t pay for the treatment. Although hospital staff are meant to check patients have been living in the UK for at least a year before treating them – unless they are urgent – many don’t bother. So once patients are on GP lists, they can potentially be given thousands of pounds of hospital treatment without ever having to pay. For EU residents, their home country will cover the cost of treatment in the UK through the European health insurance card scheme. In addition, the Health Service will not charge for treating certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV to prevent them spreading. Health Minister Anna Soubry said: 'The NHS is not there to serve the health needs of the world and we will not tolerate abuse of the system, but it does have a duty to help anyone whose life or long-term health is at immediate risk without demanding a credit card up front. 'Last year we began a wholesale review of the current system to address concerns about access, cut down abuse and consider how best to ensure those who should pay do so.'","Tory MP carries out survey of 118 NHS Trusts to reveal shocking statistic .

"A grandmother on disability benefits was pulled before the courts on fraud charges after she was accidentally overpaid £30,000 - because  officials couldn't read the handwriting of a doctor who examined her. Driving test examiner Angela Paisey, 57, had been seen by a consultant after being forced off work with a debilitating arterial disease which required surgery on her legs. But the senior medic’s scribbled report was so illegible, civil servants at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) who tried to read it mistakenly believed Mrs Paisey was entitled to the highest level of mobility and carer payments and waved through £500 per month in welfare handouts. Scroll down for video . Fraud charges against Angela Paisey (pictured) were thrown out when the officials' blunder was revealed . Mrs Paisey (pictured) said she had endured a 'living hell' since her house was raided by police last year . The blunder went unnoticed for five years until a work colleague of Mrs Paisey tipped off investigators at the DWP that she might be being paid too much benefits and officials began investigating her. Last week Mrs Paisey, from Eccles, Greater Manchester was due to face court on benefit fraud charges but the case was thrown out by a judge after civil servants admitted they had sanctioned the payments after misreading the doctor’s report. Today she told how she had endured a ‘living hell’ since her house was raided by police in June last year. She had been suspended from work for 15 months whilst the case was investigated. Her peripheral vascular disease is now so severe her leg problems have become inoperable while the case has gone through the courts. 'I could have been sent to jail simply because someone couldn’t read a doctor’s handwriting,' she said. 'I just assumed I was getting the right amount because the doctor filed his report and you trust a doctor’s opinion. 'It’s been horrendous and a 16-month living hell - but it seems the DWP don’t care that my reputation has been completely tarnished. They made me feel like a criminal and it was awful. 'The bottom line is it was the DWP that should be blamed for giving me the money. I didn’t know the criteria for how much I would get - it was all in the consultant’s report and for whatever reason the DWP couldn’t read it.' Pictured are Mrs Paisey's swollen legs during a 2009 holiday. She suffered from a debilitating arterial disease which required surgery . Anglea Paisey's case was processed under a now outdated benefit scheme called the Disability Living Allowance. The allowance, which was devised for adults aged 16 to 65, could be claimed by those suffering from disabilities which affected their day-to-day lives. Criteria for receiving the allowance was based on the disability's effects on the individual's life, rather than the type of condition or its symptoms. Under this system, which continues to be slowly phased out, benefits were often granted as indefinite. In many cases the recipients' conditions improved to a point where the benefit was no longer necessary - but the lack of subsequent case reviews meant they continued receiving money. A new scheme has since been introduced to try and provide better scrutiny around disability benefits. Known as the Personal Independence Payment, to be granted benefits under this scheme a more objective assessment with the prospective recipient takes place which requires a face-to-face consultation with a medical professional. The scheme also includes regular individual case reviews so if an individual's condition worsens or improves the amount of money they receive can be reassessed. The roll-out of the Personal Independence Payment began across wider Britain in June last year. Mrs Paisey, a blue badge holder, had initially been twice turned down for Disability Living Allowance but applied for a third time in October 2008 when a further operation on her leg left her unable to walk more than 100 yards unaided. She went to see the consultant who assessed her mobility and then filed his handwritten report with his recommendations to the DWP to help them decide how much benefit Mrs Paisey was entitled to. Later she was able to return to work full-time but was able to continue claiming the benefits as benefits staff left them open-ended, rather than subject to a yearly review - a service usually reserved for those who have lost a limb or are confined to wheelchairs. After the DWP were alerted, investigators began filming her as she worked at driving test centres in Blackpool, Preston and as far as London. In all she received £29,303 in Disability Living Allowance. Mrs Paisey added: 'I initially applied for DLA because I thought I might be entitled to it. I applied for the right for mobility and the girl from the DWP phoned me and said ""I don’t think you are claiming enough"". She asked a couple of questions and said ""leave it with me"" and I got it at the highest rate. Mrs Paisey (pictured) mistakenly received a total of £29,303 in disability payments . 'I had been refused benefits altogether before. They refused and I asked for a review and they refused it again. Then I had my third major operation so I decided to apply again. I applied and they gave me it at the highest rate. As it’s off the consultant’s report I thought I must be even worse than I think I am. 'They gave me it for an indefinite period but I didn’t think anything was the matter. The benefit claim was awarded on the premise these people knew what they were doing but apparently I’m supposed to be psychic. I never saw any reason to question the doctor’s report and had no correspondence with the DWP regarding my benefits apart from her annual statement. 'I said I didn’t need any care and the consultant even put self-care is okay on the report, yet the DWP said I was entitled to care payments and I had no reason to question it. 'Everyone at work knew I was on benefits. It wasn’t a secret. I explained what I had been through. Why would I hide it? It was legitimate as far as I was concerned. 'They had been filming me at work to try and prove I could do more than I claimed. I had said I couldn’t walk more than 100 yards and that was always the case. I used to come down the stairs and out to the car - about 20 yards. They filmed me for five or six months all over the country to try and gather some evidence. I didn’t have a clue this was going on. 'What’s really frightening is that when they arrested me they put me in the police station and searched my house, took my laptop and phone and got me in a room with just the duty solicitor and it was very intimidating.

At Blackpool magistrates court, 18 driving test centre managers from all parts of the UK were due to testify against Mrs Paisey. But when doubt was raised about the way her claim had been handled by the Government, the prosecution offered no further evidence and the case was dismissed by District Judge Peter Hollingworth. Mrs Paisey now faces a tribunal on October 7 to see if the DWP will pursue their case further and make her repay the money. A DWP Spokesman said: 'This case relates to the old system of Disability Living Allowance which is an outdated benefit with many claimants on indefinite awards without systematic on-going checks. 'That is why we have introduced the new Personal Independence Payment with a face to face assessment and regular reviews. This is to ensure the benefit is more objective and support better targeted at those who need it most.'

"National Front parade bugler Allen Boyce, who died recently aged 82, left £28,416 in his will to Ukip. Nigel Farage said the money would be given to charity . Ukip faced a new race row last night over a £28,000 gift from a pensioner branded ‘evil’ by a judge for giving a bomb-making recipe to a man who attacked immigrants’ homes, writes Simon Walters. Allen Boyce received a two-year suspended jail sentence for handing bomb-making instructions to a British National Party activist who was jailed for a race-hate campaign against Asian families in Eastbourne. Details of political donations published last week show that Boyce, a National Front parade bugler, who died recently aged 82, left £28,416 in his will to Ukip. Boyce pleaded guilty at Lewes Crown Court in 2006 to incitement to possess explosives. He told Terry Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. Collins did not use the recipe, but carried out a 14-month race-hate campaign against three families.  He was jailed for five years for pelting their homes with stones and a firework tied to a brick. Judge Anthony Niblett suspended Boyce’s sentence for two years  and placed him under a two-year supervision order. He told him: ‘Your involvement in criminality  stems from your extreme political views which are abhorrent to all  right-minded people. On mature reflection, you will understand the wrong, indeed the evil, in which you have become involved.’ Last night, Mr Farage reacted quickly to defuse the row and announced the money would be given to charity. In a statement issued shortly after The Mail on Sunday contacted Ukip over the donation, the party said it was ‘horrified at the provenance of this money’. It said the cash would now be passed to a charity ‘helping Christians and Yazidis suffering in Kurdistan’.

"Pepe is the most cherished player of the Portuguese public, mainly because of his enormous empathy with the people. He always has a smile on his face for the fans, is the first to sign autographs and even expresses more emotion when singing the national anthem than his Portuguese-born team-mates. Unlike other Brazilian players who have played for Portugal, Pepe has always been popular with the Portuguese people. Gone! Pepe was sent off by referee Molirad Mazic during Portugal's 4-0 defeat against Germany on Monday . Ouch! Pepe leaned into Muller after the pair had begun a spat with Portugal already two goals down . The controversies that he was involved with at Real Madrid never affected how much Portuguese people saw him, because they understood his extreme passion in defending his club . This time, however, by getting sent off for his headbutt on Thomas Muller in Portugal’s 4-0 defeat to Germany, his image appears much more spoiled in Portugal. The press didn't spare him after the game and the public vox pops also saw him heavily criticised. But knowing Pepe, he willl issue a public apology and will be forgiven again. And that should happen in the next few days, in a way that pleases the Portuguese Federation, because they also want him to clean up his image. For example, the main theme in Portugal the day after this controversy are the injuries of Fabio Coentrao and Hugo Almeida. Pepe’s sending off is of less importance. If you asked the majority of Portuguese people if they still want Pepe to play, perhaps a few would say no today, but in a few days most would say yes. Laying down the gauntlet: Muller ended up netting a hat-trick for Germany in their opening game win . Every little helps: Pepe is one of Cristiano Ronaldo's best friends which aids his relationship with the public . The vast majority, over 90 per cent, will say that the player born in Brazil must be in the team. We may well say that Pepe's image has been damaged after the Germany defeat, but not enough, as we say here in Portugal, to put his head on the guillotine. The fact that he's one of Cristiano Ronaldo’s closest friends also helps him within the national squad and the Portuguese people. Everyone knows, even those most critical of his behaviour, that without Pepe Portugal will struggle to beat USA or Ghana, because Neto or Ricardo Costa are not at his level. Also because his importance to the team, the Portuguese Federation didn't criticise the player after his red card and his behaviour. For sure if it was another player without Pepe’s influence on the team, the treatment would be very different.","Portugal defender was sent off for headbutt against Germany .

"NFL dreams would be out of the question if President Obama had a son. As part of a profile for The New Yorker, Obama is asked if he might feel ambivalent watching professional football, given recent headlines about concussions and health problems affecting players. The president's response was clear. 'I would not let my son play pro football,' he said. 'But, I mean, you wrote a lot about boxing, right? We’re sort of in the same realm.' Though  President Barack Obama poses for photos with members of the 1972 Miami Dolphins including head coach Don Shula (R), quarterback Bob Griese (L) in this August photo, he recently said 'I would not let my son play pro football' President Barack Obama (L), seen here holding up a jersey given to him by head coach John Harbaugh (R) after welcoming members of the National Football League Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens, said NFL players ' know what they're doing' when it comes to the risks of the sport . Obama also said that professional football players are aware of the game's much-publicized risks. 'At this point, there’s a little bit of caveat emptor,' he went on. 'These guys, they know what they’re doing. They know what they’re buying into. It is no longer a secret. It’s sort of the feeling I have about smokers, you know?' The sentiments expressed in the profile are similar to ones Obama gave to The New Republic in January 2013 . 'I'm a big football fan, but I have to tell you if I had a son, I'd have to think long and hard before I let him play football,' he said. 'And I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence. In some cases, that may make it a little bit less exciting, but it will be a whole lot better for the players, and those of us who are fans maybe won't have to examine our consciences quite as much.' Seen here with members of the University of Alabama football team in 2013, Obama said last year 'I tend to be more worried about college players than NFL players in the sense that the NFL players have a union, they're grown men, they can make some of these decisions on their own' regarding football's risks . Obama also said at the time he was more concerned about college players as opposed to those in the NFL. 'I tend to be more worried about college players than NFL players in the sense that the NFL players have a union, they're grown men, they can make some of these decisions on their own, and most of them are well-compensated for the violence they do to their bodies,' he said. 'You read some of these stories about college players who undergo some of these same problems with concussions and so forth and then have nothing to fall back on. That's something that I'd like to see the NCAA think about.' Unlike Obama, San Franscisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh last year said his son Jack will be allowed to play the sport when he is old enough, CBS Sports reports. 'I have a 4-month old, almost 5-month old son, Jack Harbaugh, and if President Obama feels that way, then there will be a little bit less competition for Jack Harbaugh when he gets old,' he said. Last year Obama (here with the University of Alabama team in 2013) said he thought football 'will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence'","Compared football's risks to those of boxing .

"Spaghetti: A pizza delivery man told a jury how Alexis Wright, pictured, stripped for him when he delivered her order . A pizza delivery boy told a jury yesterday how the woman at the center of the Zumba prostitution scandal 'made (his) day' when she stripped in front of him and tipped him generously after he delivered spaghetti and meatballs to her door. The risque details came as a landlord who rented an office to Alexis Wright testified that he became suspicious about her profession when tenants heard 'groaning and moaning' coming from the workspace and claimed he found a box of adult toys and used condoms nearby. The two men were among the first to give testimony in the trial of Mark Strong Sr., an insurance businessman charged with 13 counts that accuse him of helping the fitness instructor engage in prostitution in the dance studio in Kennebunk, Maine. Wright, is accused of having sex with scores of local Johns at her studio, an office across the street and at her home. Authorities have said she videotaped clients without their knowledge. She will be tried later. Christopher West, a landlord who rented office space to Wright, testified he began receiving complaints from other tenants within a couple of weeks. He testified about loud music, moaning, groaning and laughter coming from the office. He became suspicious when he witnessed men coming and going. He told police he intended to evict Wright but was asked to hold off because of an ongoing investigation. After police executed a search . warrant, he said, he discovered a box of adult toys, a bin of used . condoms and baby wipes and a massage table. An agent seized two video . cameras, including one that was hidden. On trial: The two men were among the first to give testimony in the trial of Mark Strong Sr., pictured, an insurance businessman charged with 13 counts that accuse him of helping the fitness instructor engage in prostitution in the dance studio in Kennebunk, Maine . Dan . Racaniello, manager of a pizza shop next to the studio, testified that . when he delivered spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread, Wright came . to the door wearing only a towel, which she dropped to reveal she was . naked. He said she paid $40 for the $8 meal and told him to keep the . change. 'She fussed around with her wallet and off goes the towel. I felt awkward,' said Racaniello, who left her apartment stunned by the nudity and the generous tip, saying, 'It made my day.' Strong and Wright have pleaded not guilty. Strong helped Wright launch her Pura Vida dance-fitness studio by co-signing for her lease and loaning money with commercial notes that were repaid with interest. He contends he didn't know about allegations of prostitution, and testimony on Thursday indicated that he didn't sign any documents related to the rented office. Opening statements: Attorney Daniel Lilley, who is representing Mark Strong Sr., gave his opening statements in the Zumba prostitution case in York County Superior Court, Alfred, Maine on Wednesday . Prosecution: York County Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan, pictured, opened the case for the prosecution on Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2013 . The defense contends the married . Strong engaged in bad behavior by having an affair with Wright but . didn't engage in criminal conduct. Prosecutors, meanwhile, contend . Strong communicated frequently with Wright about business details via . video chat, email and text. The . case has generated attention because of the size of the operation . alleged by prosecutors and police and its location in a quaint seaside . village near Kennebunkport, home of the Bush family's Walker's Point . summer compound. A lawyer who has seen a client list says it includes more than 150 names. Law enforcement officials say Wright kept meticulous records suggesting the sex acts generated $150,000 over 18 months.Strong's wife of 30 years and several other family members were in court on Thursday. Tried later: Wright, is accused of having sex with Johns at her studio, an office across the street and at her home. She will be tried later . Affair: The defense contends the married Strong engaged in bad behavior . by having an affair with Wright, pictured left and right, but didn't . engage in criminal conduct . Afternoon testimony was delayed by a . letter sent to attorneys from a law firm representing the town of . Kennebunk. In the letter, a lawyer said personnel documents cannot be . released and lawyers were informed that the documents were purged under . union rules. The defense contends Strong was targeted by Kennebunk police because he was looking into allegations of unprofessional conduct by its officers. And the defense intends to delve into the background of the lead investigator, including a protective order sought against her and an extramarital affair with her police supervisor that led to a reprimand. Justice Nancy Mills expressed frustration that prosecutors had been aware of the potential wrinkle for more than a week without telling her. Delays have plagued the trial. Jury selection was halted twice because of legal action, leaving potential jurors in limbo for weeks before selection was completed and opening statements were delivered on Wednesday.","The two men were among the first to give testimony on Thursday in the trial of Mark Strong Snr .

"The cast is known for their stiff upper lip at dinner parties and restraint in responding to a range of dramas ranging from death to murder and secret love children. Lady Mary is cold, the Dowager Countess of Downton Abbey sometimes unkind. But now the secret behind their detachment has been revealed, as the stars have been banned from being tactile to make the series more believable. Scroll down for video . The cast of Downton Abbey have been banned from hugging each other to make the series historically accurate, but occasionally breaks convention, such as Lady Mary's night of passion with Lord Tony Gillingham . Alastair Bruce, who advisers producers of the ITV drama on etiquette and historical accuracy, said characters should not hug or show lots of affection to each other as this was simply not done in the 1920s. A lack of antibiotics in the era meant disease was less easy to cure and spread rapidly, so people would avoid physical contact in a bid to reduce the risk of becoming ill. 'I tell the actors not to touch each other,' Mr Bruce told BBC Radio 2. 'I don't want any hugging, no physical contact; they just didn't do that in those days.' His reasoning sheds some light on some of the Downton Abbey storylines. When Lady Mary, played by Michele Dockery, receives little comfort from her family after the death of her husband Matthew Crawley following the birth of their first child. Despite the tragedy characters show restraint, with Lady Edith unable to comfort her bereaved sister. The cast broke with convention during the death of Lady Sybil as they tried to comfort and settle her . A rare moment between Branson, played by Allen Leech, and Lady Sybil,  played by Jessica Brown Findley . Lady Mary Crawley and Anthony Gillingham appear to break with the stiff upper lip convention of the show . Mr Bruce said the number of Downton Abbey devotees, who are known for paying strict attention to the historical accuracy of the Julian Fellowes show, means he tries to be extra strict to make the series as realistic as possible. 'It is important getting the detail right and the pressure does increase,' added Mr Bruce, who also advised producers of the King's Speech. 'People long to find error.' However, just as a television aerial was seen on set and a plastic water bottle in a publicity photograph, some instances appear to have slipped through the net. In episode one of the series four Carson, the trusted butler, appears to break with both 1920s convention and the upstairs-downstairs rule, as he warmly hugs Lady Mary who is still struggling to come to terms with her new role as a widow. And Lady Mary's night of passion with Lord Tony Gillingham also appears to go against the cold, detached expectations of the era. The scene where Lady Sybil dies, in which a number of characters comfort and try to hug her, also shows the cast departing from their usual detached interactions. However Lady Mary, whose character is known for her frosty approach, manages to bring back the coldness in series five as she appears shocked that her sister has run away after her secret love child was revealed. 'I can't think why!' she exclaimed. The response, typically Downton, from the Dowager was: 'My dear. A lack of compassion can be as vulgar as an excess of tears.'","Cast told not to hug or kiss each other as this was 'not done' in the 1920s .

"British judo fighter Karina Bryant earned Team GB's 19th medal of London 2012 this afternoon after winning bronze in the women's 78kg contest. Bryant, 33, saw off the challenge of Ukranian Iryna Kindzerska to secure third place, earning Great Britain their seventh bronze in another successful day for the home nation. The medal is a personal triumph for Britain's most successful judo fighter Bryant, who had resorted to asking strangers for cash earlier this year, amid fears a lack of it will derail her Olympic dream. On the podium: Bryant celebrates with her bronze medal in the ExCel Arena today, just 24 hours after colleague Gemma Gibbons ended Britain's 12-year wait for an Olympic judo medal . Job done: Bryant was defeated in the semi-finals, but dug in to pick herself up and earn Britain a bronze medal this afternoon in the women's 78kg event . Decisive moment: Bryant lands a successful waza-ari on her Ukranian opponent to seal Great Britain's seventh bronze . Overwhelmed: Bryant collapses to the floor after earning victory in the bronze medal match against Ukranian Iryna Kindzerska . Despite being a four-time European champion, the Olympic medal is Bryant's first podium appearance at the Games, having reached the round of 16 in 2000 and 2008 and the quarter-finals in 2004. She won her hard-earned bronze medal less than a day after Gemma Gibbons' emotional silver medal judo performance yesterday. Bryant's bronze came after she secured third place at the European Championships in Russia back in April. Her chances of a medal looked slim early on in the contest against Ukranian Kindzerska, as she went behind to a waza-ari in the first minute of the contest. But Bryant showed fighting character to level the fight with a waza-ari of her own, before winning the contest minutes later in front of fervent home support at the ExCel Arena. Bryant revealed in May she had launched an appeal to strangers for cash so she could afford a small car to get her to training. After Gemma Gibbons secured Britain's first Olympic judo medal in 12 years yesterday, Bryant celebrates after making it two medals in as many days . Fighting hard: Bryant secured a bronze after last 16 finishes in 2000 and 2008, and a quarter final in 2004 . Battling hard: Bryant was spurred on this afternoon by a typically raucous crowd at the ExCel Arena . The Aldershot judo star said she needed £5,000 for a 'modest runaround' to get her from her Aldershot home to her training base in Camberley, 10 miles away. She said earlier this year: 'I had so many problems with my car. At one point I was having to crawl through the boot to get in. 'I need something I can rely on to get me through the next few months and the Games because it is stressful worrying about whether I can get to places.' The website supporting Bryant was created by KEODigital, the team behind Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's Fish Fight campaign.","Bryant is four-time Euro champion but won first Olympic medal today .

"The bunk-bed and the sofa-bed employed the same rationale and are now a firm fixture in any average urban home. Now a designer has come up with another way to reduce the amount of furniture you need in your flat - by turning a rug and a table into one piece of furniture. Alessandro Isola was inspired to create the multi-purpose furnishing after becoming increasingly annoyed whenever he tripped over creases in the rug on his living room floor. Multi-functional: A designer has come up with a way to reduce the amount of furniture needed in your home - by designing a rug which can also be used as a table . Double act: The piece of furniture can be used as a rug on the floor, but can be curved into various different shapes to double-up as a rug or even a shelf . Alessandro Isola said he wanted to 'enhance the folds and curves' of a rug in his project 'Stumble Upon' The Italian designer decided he wanted to put that annoyance to good use and 'enhance the folds and curves' which often appear in flooring. That's when he came up with this dual-purpose rug, which he calls 'Stumble Upon'. To the naked eye, the piece of furniture appears to be a stylish rug. But when one corner is overturned, a smooth, shiny . surface is revealed - which doubles up as a 'functional table area'. It means you can be comfortably walking on the rug one minute - but can then be using it for your Sunday roast the next. On his website, Mr Isola, who studied at the Oxford School of Architecture, said: 'Enter a room and immediately you feel the evidence of an occupant. 'Either they're in the room with you, or you feel the atmosphere of an event that has since occurred. 'If you look down you may see a crease, a fold or a wrinkle in the carpet for instance, signifying a movement or activity that happened on the surface of that very floor space. 'This usually causes a slight annoyance . and is firmly pulled straight. 'Stumble Upon enhances those folds and . curves creating flexibility and contrast. 'The fold or the flick of the corner edge . momentarily reveals its craftsmanship. Its quality is usually measured . by how well it is finished underneath. The shows six different ways in which the mullti-purpose rug can be folded, in order for it to be used in other ways . The designer was inspired to come up with the idea because of the number of times he tripped over a creased rug. He said he wanted to put the creases to good use . The item has a carpet-style top with a smooth, metallic-looking underside, to differentiate between the table and the rug . 'This thought has been accentuated and the fold of a corner has been exaggerated to produce a dual surface. 'Stumble Upon acts as a functional table area, accented with a contrasting material. 'The fold means it can be configured and tessellate into multi-functional surfaces that suit the moment.'","Alessandro Isola found it irritating when he tripped over creases in his rug .

"From Botox and fillers to vampire face lifts and creams developed by NASA, the fight against wrinkles seems to grow ever more high-tech. But one beauty company is convinced it can beat frown lines, not with the help of injections and expensive creams, but with a simple piece of sticky tape. Realine Beauty has created a £28 hypoallergenic frown line patch - made from tape - that claims to 'naturally and effectively' smooth out forehead frown lines after a few hours application or while you sleep. Beat the frown lines: Fed up of your lines? Realine Beauty has created a £28 hypoallergenic frown line patch, which promises to smooth them while you sleep . Users are advised to first prepare by cleansing the skin . area, smooth out the frown line area with one hand and hold the skin . taut. Then place the patch over the centre of the forehead frown line . and leave the patch in place for several hours or overnight. The brand explain that while . wearing the patch, the forehead skin is restricted from movement and the . skin area 're-educated', which, they say, gives a smoothed and relaxed appearance that's retained after the patch has been removed. Speaking about the new product, which . should be used nightly for the best effects, the company says: 'Simply . designed for home use or on your . travels, the Realine Beauty patch gives you the personal power to . improve your appearance and to easily reduce frown lines, eliminating . dependence on cosmetic procedures, beauty therapists or expensive . so-called miracle potions.' Patch it: The brand advise users to place the patch over the centre of the forehead frown line and leave it in place for several hours or overnight . Robin Capstick, Founder of Realine, which is sold at Fenwicks Bond Street, said: 'I wanted to . create a frown patch that was effective, easy to apply, and covered a . large skin surface area. 'It was important that the adhesive was . medically approved, and restricted muscle movement, whilst remaining . kind to the skin.' But do they really work? 84 per cent . of clinical trial participants think so - they said their frown lines . appeared smoother after using the patch. These aren't the first of their kind. A similar product called Frownies was created in 1889 by Margaret Kroesen to help her daughter, a concert pianist, beat her frown lines. Her business then took off and Broadway and Hollywood stars became avid fans of the Frownies. How do they work? The brand explain that . whilst wearing the patch, the forehead skin is restricted from movement . and the skin area 're-educated', which, they say, gives a smoothed and . relaxed appearance that's retained when it is removed . Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD of 111 Harley St said: 'This isn’t the first time that frown line patches have been available on the market, and with no active ""anti ageing"" ingredients, this particular product does not differ from its predecessors. 'The science here is simple; when sleeping we tend not to contract our facial muscles through expression so by adding this strip, it reduces the movement even further and keeps the area ""smooth"". 'This patch is not going to smooth or heal the lines that already exist on the forehead and any visible result will start to reverse once the patch is removed. 'In reality you could achieve the same effect from using tape or a tight hairstyle, however the difference here is the patch has been formulated to be hypoallergenic.'","Realine Beauty created hypoallergenic frown line patch .

"President Barack Obama has now attended at least 400 fundraisers since taking office.

Bush ended his two White House terms having conducted 318 . fundraisers, a total Obama reached more than a year ago. Knoller is known in the White House press room as an amiable cataloger of presidential miscellany, sometimes with better records than the . White House itself is willing to share. The Republican National Committee said in a fundraising email Monday . morning that by its count, Obama had already . conducted 400 fundraisers. That would make Monday night’s dinner, where . Democratic voters paid between ranged $15,000 and $32,400 to see the president . speak for 12 minutes, his 401st money-raising event. Several news outlets took that line, declaring that on . Monday Obama 'surpassed' 400 fundraisers while living at 1600 Pennsylvania . Avenue. Whichever total is correct, the president has been picking . up the pace of his hat-passing as November's elections draw near: The fundraiser-in-chief has attended seven such . events since mid-July. Despite Obama's association with high-dollar donor events, it's Bill Clinton who holds the fundraising record, appearing at 638 events throughout his two terms in office. President Obama would have to hold nearly six times as many fundraisers as he's headlined this year - so far - during his final two and a half years in office in order to catch up with Clinton.

"Owen Farrell and George Ford could rekindle their junior partnership this weekend as England consider naming both players in the starting line-up to face South Africa. With Kyle Eastmond struck down by illness, head coach Stuart Lancaster could be short of options in the midfield for Saturday’s Test against the Springboks. Luther Burrell is also sidelined with a hand injury and the England selection panel are now deliberating whether to name Farrell at No 12, with Bath playmaker Ford pulling the strings at fly-half. England coach Mike Catt (right) works with George Ford and Owen Farrell (left) in training on Monday . Sir Clive Woodward urged Lancaster to move Farrell . Sir Clive Woodward wrote in his Sportsmail column on Monday that England are in need of a natural kicker like Farrell at inside centre — something that Eastmond does not offer — and the Ford-Farrell combination would tick that box. The pair, who were once opponents at junior rugby league clubs in Yorkshire, thrived in the same partnership at England age-group level, when they lost just two games in five years. ‘I’m sure he (Kyle) will get over the sickness and diarrhoea, but it’s about how much it takes out of him and the knock-on effect of not doing the work,’ said Lancaster. ‘The obvious options are to put George in at 10 and Owen at 12. ‘You can bring someone like Billy Twelvetrees in at 12, while Luther Burrell is on a return to play this week but he hasn’t done anything for two or three weeks, so isn’t really in the equation for us. They are the options.’ Farrell (right) and Ford played for England in the final of the Junior World Cup in 2011 . Johann van Graan has hailed England’s Graham Rowntree as ‘one of the best forwards coaches in the world’, who has created a ‘world-class scrum’. He added: ‘Graham is a good friend of mine. We coached against each other for the first time in 2012. What a great guy and what a great (team of) coaching staff — just look at guys like Stuart Lancaster, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt.’ The physical threat posed by the Springboks might count against Ford in selection, but Lancaster will weigh up the pros and cons in Tuesday's training session at Pennyhill Park. Ford’s small stature — 13st 3lb compared to Farrell’s 15st 2lb frame — could lead to him being targeted by some of South Africa’s powerful ball-carriers. Lancaster added: ‘It is a four-game series. I’ve got in my own mind further games and options to look at combinations. ‘The question in my mind is: do you give the players another opportunity who played their part last week (in the 24-21 defeat by New Zealand) to improve on that performance? Because there is a lot of frustration.’ Sir Clive Woodward says England are in need of a natural kicker like Farrell (right) at inside centre . Head injuries to Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley mean the Northampton pair will have cognitive testing ahead of Thursday’s team announcement. Dave Attwood also picked up a minor knock and a hip injury to Semesa Rokoduguni, who is expected to train on Tuesday, will have Anthony Watson on red alert ahead of a possible promotion to the starting XV. Lancaster is hopeful that all will be available for selection, while Ben Morgan is also pushing to oust Billy Vunipola after the No 8’s impact off the bench on Saturday. The latest injury problems are far from ideal for Lancaster, who is hoping to end a barren winless run against South Africa this weekend. England have suffered 10 defeats and one draw in their last 11 meetings with the Rainbow Nation, having failed to record a victory since 2006. The Monday morning debrief after Saturday’s defeat at Twickenham was, in the words of loosehead prop Joe Marler, ‘very honest’, but focus must now turn towards their next challenge. The Quins front-row said the second-half performance was worthy of words that he ‘can’t really use’ and has promised to bottle up the frustration ahead of the second Test on Saturday. ‘The Southern Hemisphere teams have set the standard over the years and are continuing to do so,’ said Marler. ‘But I’d like to think we’ve got a squad now who can go toe-to-toe with them. It’s about having the belief that we’re not just capable of hanging in there against them, but can ramp it up ourselves at the right time and can take them to some darker places.’ Stuart Lancaster is hoping to end a barren winless run against South Africa this weekend . But while England will still be seething from their defeat by the All Blacks, South Africa will arguably be even more aggrieved after their shock 29-15 loss to Ireland. England will face some hugely powerful forwards in the likes of Duane Vermeulen, Victor Matfield and Bismarck du Plessis and Marler knows his side must front up if they are to overcome their Southern Hemisphere hoodoo. ‘Against every international team at the moment you’ve got to be physical otherwise you’re going to get pumped,’ said Marler. ‘South Africa as a nation stand very tall and proud; their DNA is run hard and, if that doesn’t work, run harder. They pride themselves on that and they’ve got a world-class tight five.’","Sir Clive Woodward said England are in need of a natural kicker like Owen Farrell at inside centre .

"Ebola fears have stopped more than 7,000 West African Muslims attending an annual pilgrimage after Saudi Arabia implemented a travel ban. But the country said this year's Hajj had been free of Ebola and other contagious diseases because of measures it took to protect more than 2million pilgrims who took part in the annual Islamic event. Pilgrims today began leaving the desert tent city of Mina, where they were taking part in the ritual of the stoning of the devil - one of the last rites of the Hajj. Scroll down for video . The Hajj: Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba (centre) inside the Grand Mosque during the annual pilgrimage in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. More than 2million pilgrims took part this year . Huge numbers: Pilgrims today began leaving the desert tent city of Mina, where they were taking part in the ritual of the stoning of the devil - one of the last rites of the Hajj . Many headed back to Mecca, ending the Hajj as they started it by circling the cube-shaped Kaaba seven times. The Hajj, which lasts around five days, ends on Monday. There were fears regarding Saudi Arabia's readiness to ensure a healthy Hajj for pilgrims after the kingdom became the epicentre for the potentially fatal Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers). Several health workers and doctors died of that coronavirus in Saudi Arabia earlier this year, raising alarm about the safety of hospitals. Acting Health Minister Adel Faqih told reporters that the kingdom deployed thousands of health workers during the Hajj and performed data screening on pilgrims upon their arrival as a precaution. Involved: Muslim pilgrims on the third day of the Hajj perform 'the stoning of the devil' ceremony in Mina . Mostly-relaxed attitude: Only a handful of people in Saudi Arabia – where no Ebola cases have been confirmed - wore protective masks while circling the Kaaba in Mina . Mr Faqih said: ‘I am pleased to announce that the Hajj (was) free of epidemic diseases. May God accept the pilgrimage of our guests and ensure that they enjoy good health and wellness.’ He added on the sidelines of a press conference that the kingdom's ban on issuing visas to people from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea would remain in place for the foreseeable future. The measure affects some 7,400 would-be pilgrims from the West African countries, which have been the hardest hit by the virus that is estimated to have killed more than 3,400 people. ‘That will continue until further notice until we are comfortable that it is not anymore an epidemic in these countries,’ Mr Faqih said. About 12 per cent of the population of Liberia is Muslim, while more than a half are part of the religion in Guinea and Sierra Leone, reported Al Jazeera. Disease: Volunteers arrive to pick up bodies of people who died of the Ebola virus in Freetown, Sierra Leone . Working hard: A health worker pushes a wheelbarrow full of rubber boots for washing at the end of the day at the Bong County Ebola Treatment Unit near Gbarnga in rural Liberia . Only a handful of people in Saudi Arabia – where no Ebola cases have been confirmed - wore protective masks while circling the Kaaba. MailOnline reported last month how Muslim pilgrims on their way to Mecca were tested for the Ebola virus at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos prior to their trip. More than 200 Muslims from Oyo State in south-west Nigeria underwent stringent health checks by Nigerian health officials. Nigeria is the only country in the region which has been affected by Ebola that had clearance to send pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj. The Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, which must be completed by all adult Muslims at least once in their life if they have the financial and physical ability. Many travel thousands of miles to get there.","More than 7,000 West African Muslims stopped from attending pilgrimage .

"Emergency surgery: Gaby Scanlon was celebrating her 18th birthday when she fell ill . A teenage girl who had her stomach . removed and 'nearly died' after drinking a cocktail containing liquid . nitrogen was the victim of a 'irresponsible alcohol industry,' according . to senior health bosses. Gaby Scanlon had been drinking with . friends at a wine bar to celebrate her 18th birthday when she was bought . two 'Nitro Jagermeister' cocktails. She downed both drinks in quick succession and very quickly felt unwell. The A-level student became very breathless and then doubled over with 'horrendous stomach pains' before an ambulance was called. The teenager was rushed to hospital where doctors diagnosed a perforated stomach. Suffering intense pain, she was rushed into theatre where surgeons were forced to remove most of her stomach to save her life. The student was said to be 'doing . well' after the emergency operation but is set to remain in hospital for . some time and will face specialist medical treatment for the rest of . her life. At the weekend the teenager was . apparently well enough last night to write on Twitter: 'Maybe stay off . the liquid nitrogen' is not a f****** funny thing to say to me.' She . also tweeted: 'I nearly died.' Both tweets were later removed from the website. But last night Dr John Ashton, . director of public health for Cumbria, said she was a victim of a . dangerous gimmick used to sell more alcohol. He said: 'This girl is the victim of an irresponsible alcohol industry that's now competing on gimmicks. 'People should not be playing . chemistry in public houses. This is a very, very cold substance and it . is similar to subjecting your oesophagus and stomach to frost bite. Cooling cocktail:  Liquid nitrogen is used in some luxury cocktails and is known for freezing everything it comes into contact with . 'As this case highlights there are . major safety implications and it is time there was better regulation put . in place to prevent things like this dreadful incident happening . again.' He said a total ban would only lead to . increased demand for the dangerous cocktails but said there should be . 'stringent regulation.' Consultant gastroenterologists say the . teenager will face a lifetime of specialist medical treatment in order . to live a normal life. As well as being unable to digest . certain things Miss Scanlon will have to avoid some sugary foods and . drinks and have regular vitamin injections. Investigation: Lancashire Police said the Oscars wine bar have ceased selling the liquid nitrogen cocktail . Popularised by celebrity chef, Heston . Blumenthal, liquid nitrogen - which vapourises at -196C - has been . increasingly used in recent years in the preparation of drinks. It is used to chill glasses and is a crowd-pleaser thanks to the dramatic-looking water vapour it releases at room temperature. But it is highly dangerous and can . cause very serious cold burns if it comes into contact with skin or . tissue and should never be ingested. It is believed the cocktails drunk by . the Miss Scanlon still contained drops of the liquid nitrogen which then . caused horrendous burns to her stomach. Last night her mother Lisa Hensall, . 38, was said to be too upset about the incident to speak but her . stepfather Ian Henshall, 40, said the family were hoping for a quick . recovery. Trendy: TV chef Heston Blumenthal has pioneered the use of liquid nitrogen in his restaurants including making ice-cream using it . Mr Henshall said: 'She is our main concern at the moment and we are just concentrating on her getting better.' Dr Ashton said it was time the Government brought in better regulation of the drinks industry to stop such tragic incidents. He said: 'It is shocking that a . teenage girl goes out to celebrate her 18th birthday and ends up in . intensive care with life-changing injuries. 'The alcohol industry uses these types . of gimmicks to make alcoholic drinks more enticing - yet staff can use . liquid nitrogen without any proper training. Liquid nitrogen is formed by cooling down the harmless gas nitrogen to such a low temperature that it becomes liquid. It is intensely cold (-196°C) and if not used properly can cause frostbite or cryogenic burns when it comes into contact with living tissue. Professor Peter Barham, of the University of Bristol's School of Physics, said: 'As with any very hot or very cold liquid proper safety measures must be taken - just as no-one would drink boiling water or oil or pour it over themselves, so no-one should ingest liquid nitrogen. 'Liquid nitrogen can be used safely in the preparation of foods. However, since it is not safe to ingest liquid nitrogen due care must be taken to ensure that the liquid has all evaporated before serving any food or drink that was prepared with liquid nitrogen.' In fact, liquid nitrogen is used in cryotherapy medical treatment to burn away skin abnormalities, such as warts. But it will have the same effect if consumed, burning internal tissue in the stomach. Where the burn causes a hole or perforation in the stomach wall it will allow gastric acid to leak into the abdominal cavity, which can be fatal. This is a surgical emergency and in cases where the damage can't be repaired, the stomach will have to be removed. The oesophagus, the muscular tube that transports the food, is connected directly to the small bowel. In the short term a feeding tube may be necessary. But surprisingly, the body soon adapts to digesting food without a stomach, where the food is normally stored and mixed during the initial phase of digestion. The small intestine will act more like a stomach over time and keep food there for longer while it is broken down. Most normal foods can be eaten after a total gastrectomy - whole stomach removal - but in smaller portions and more frequently. The operation is most often performed in cancer patients. Doctors may advise avoiding meals made up of foods high in added sugar. This is because food will be entering the bowel rapidly and sugar-laden foods exacerbate the problem, potentially causing a transitory drop in blood pressure and unpleasant symptoms such as feeling dizzy or faint. People without a stomach need to have regular injections of vitamin B12 as the stomach controls its absorption and deficiency can lead to anaemia. 'These things are allowed to continue in this country because of the Government's lack on control over the drinks industry. 'Essentially it amounts to a form of . cowardice because there are drinks industry interests in every . constituency and the Government is worried about repercussions.' He said it was time dangerous . substances like liquid nitrogen formed part of the licensing application . with staff being properly trained to handle it. The incident happened last Thursday . when Miss Scanlon went out to Oscar's winebar in Lancaster with friends . to celebrate her 18th birthday. Shortly before 11pm she was bought two . 'Nitro Jagermeister' cocktails costing £8.95 and she downed them both . with the space of a few minutes. She very quickly began to complain of a . horrific pain in her stomach and severe breathlessness and was rushed . to Lancaster Royal Infirmary by paramedics. The management of the wine bar has . stopped all liquid nitrogen cocktails and were said to be 'tremendously . concerned' for the teenager. The sixth-form student lives with her . family in a quiet cul-de-sac in a semi-detached home on the outskirts of . Lancaster in the village of Heysham. Liz Nicholls, principal at Ripley St . Thomas Church of England Academy, says the teenager is one of their . 'most hardworking and mature students' She said: 'Our whole school community . is shocked and upset at what has happened. 'Our thoughts and prayers are . with Gaby, her family and her friends who are obviously upset and . distressed. We are pleased to hear that she is making better than . expected progress.' Coun Paul Aitchison, chairman of . Lancaster City Council's Licensing Act Committee, said that he was at . the same bar a few months ago and tried the Nitro Jagermeister drink. Mr Aitchison, who at 20 is one of the . country's youngest councillors, said: 'I heard about this and I was . quite shocked because I have actually tried it myself. 'I thought it sounded interesting, . that's probably one of the draws. You assume the drinks served in . licensed premises will be safe. 'I didn't have an adverse reaction to it. It was quite scary to think that it could have possibly happened to me.' A number of witnesses at the wine bar . were interviewed by police and the premises has stopped selling drinks . containing the liquid gas. A spokesman for Lancashire Police . said: 'Medical opinion is that this would have proved fatal had the . operation not been carried out urgently. 'The investigation is still in its . early stages and we are still interviewing witnesses to establish the . full facts. The premises involved have fully co-operated with all . agencies and have suspended drinks involving liquid nitrogen.'","Gaby Scanlon had been drinking at a bar in Lancaster to celebrate her 18th birthday when she was left feeling breathless .

"The father of Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o has revealed how the 12 Years A Slave actress's family suffered real brutality and torture in Kenya. Miss Nyong'o won both awards and critical praise for her performance as Patsey in director Steve McQueen's harrowing film in which her character appeared in some of the most shocking scenes, but her own family were also the victims of harassment, violence and even murder. As an opponent of former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, the actress's father Peter Anyang Nyong'o was tortured repeatedly, while her uncle Charles Nyong'o's body was never found after he was attacked on board a ferry and hurled off the ship. Family ties: Lupita Nyong'o's father Peter Anyang Nyong'o (pictured with his daughter at the Oscars) has revealed how the 12 Years A Slave actress's family suffered real brutality and torture in Kenya . Peter Nyong'o, now a leading Kenyan politician . who serves on the country's Senate, has now revealed the true extent of . family's brutal treatment, which led to them having to flee to Mexico . where Lupita was born in March 1983. Mr Nyong'o said he had struggled to . watch his daughter's acting triumph, but added that his own experiences . pale in comparison to Solomon Northup, played in the historical drama by . British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. 'We . were put into prison and the torture chambers by the regime, but it was . like a dinner party when you compare it to what the slaves went . through,' he told the Independent On Sunday. Winner: Lupita Nyong'o, pictured at the Oscars, won both awards and critical praise for her performance as Patsey . Mr . Nyong'o said that his brother Charles had vanished in 1980, two years . after Mr Moi came to power, and at a time which Mr Nyong'o described as . being 'difficult' politically. His body was never recovered and no one has ever been brought to justice for the killing. 'Even now, no information has come to . light. I know he was on a ferry in Mombasa and witnesses who I managed . to talk to told me clearly that it was not an accident and he had been . attacked and pushed off the ferry. But the witnesses were too terrified . to testify to the police,' he said. Mr . Nyong'o said he had spoken to members of the Kenyan Special Branch and . although he was told by one that they knew what happened the force were . unwilling to help him. Academic . Mr Nyong'o, who is Secretary-General of Kenya's Orange Democratic . Movement and has been the Kenyan Minister for Medical Services since . 2008, said he believes his brother was attacked because of his own . opposition to Moi's rule. Investigators . believe Moi and his allies plundered more than £3 billion from Kenya's . coffers during his 24-year rule, and he was known to have used the . country's security services to kill and torture critics of his regime. Mr . Nyong'o and wife Dorothy were forced to leave Kenya for Mexico, where . he found work at  El Colegio de México as a visiting lecturer in . political science, and where his daughter was born. On . the family's return to Kenya in 1987 they had to go into hiding at a . number of safe houses because Mr Nyong'o, who was trying to set up an . underground democratic party, became the victim of harassment and . arrest. As a young girl . Lupita and her five brothers and sisters had to move with their parents . from place to place, with her father often taken into police custody on a . weekly basis, while the rest of the family were the victims of . threatening phone calls. Opposition: Mr Nyong'o, who is Secretary-General of Kenya's Orange Democratic Movement believes his brother was attacked because of his own opposition to Daniel arap Moi (pictured) Mr Nyong'o said he thought that his . daughter's insecure upbringing and constant need to adapt to new . surroundings may have helped her to take on some of the transformative . skills needed to become an actor. Both . Mr Nyong'o and his wife travelled from Kenya to attend the Oscars . ceremony where his daughter took home the Best Supporting Actress award, . and he described her performance in 12 Years A Slave as 'tremendous'. He . said: 'Lupita called me to tell me [when she was] nominated. She was . really touched that she had done well enough to be nominated. It was a . great achievement in its own right.'

"YouTube is set to launch a launch a new subscription music service that take on Spotify and others. The service will offer access to over 20 million tracks, along with concert footage and remixes, along with videos. According to Android Police, the service will supposedly also offer a free 30 day trial and will cost $9.99 per month thereafter. YouTube's new subscription music service will take on Spotify and others. YouTube has reached deals with all three major music labels — Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group — and many independent labels as a whole representing about 95 percent of all labels, the people said. Determining which artists are blocked —and where— could be confusing because some indie artists have their music distributed in certain countries by the major labels. Singer Adele, for instance, is signed with Beggars Group's XL Recordings in the U.K., but Sony Music's Columbia label distributes her music in the U.S. 'YouTube is set to launch a service called YouTube Music Key, and Google is set to rebrand Google Play Music All Access to Google Play Music Key,' the site claims. 'Specifically, it looks like YouTube Music Key will offer ad-free music, audio-only playback (for background or screen-off listening), and offline playback.' The company has been locked in a major row with independent artists over the plans. The company acknowledged the plans after being dragged into a public dispute over royalties that will result in the blockade of some independent artists' music videos. The Google owned video site said in a statement that it is 'adding subscription-based features for music on YouTube' and that 'hundreds of major label and independent artists' have signed on. The paid service, to be launched within a few months, will likely allow playback of videos without ads and allow for offline playback on mobile devices. That's according to two people familiar with the matter. The people weren't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Singer Adele, who is signed with Beggars Group's XL Recordings in the U.K., but Sony Music's Columbia label in the U.S. could see her music banned from YouTube in some territories over the deal. The people also confirmed that a small number of independent artists who had not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked in some countries starting in a few days, even on the free version of YouTube. YouTube will block the music videos so users of the test version won't be confused about which content they can access for free and with features require payment, the people said. Allowing free streams of music by certain artists while not offering them on the paid service would erode the value of the paid plan, one person said. The move also adds pressure on those labels to sign, because not being on YouTube altogether will result in less advertising revenue and exposure.

Independent labels are being offered the same per-stream royalty payment as the major labels, but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year. Rich Bengloff, president of the American Association of Independent Music, an industry group representing independent labels, said he disagrees with the characterization that only a few labels haven't signed. He argued that independent artists are being treated unfairly simply because they lack market power. 'I'm not very happy, obviously,' he said. 'We're asking to be treated equitably and fairly.' One person familiar with the terms said that independent labels are being offered the same per-stream royalty payment as the major labels, but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year. Alison Wenham, CEO of the Worldwide Independent Network, another trade group representing indie labels, said in a statement that YouTube's decision to blockade some labels was a 'grave error of commercial judgment.' She said services like Spotify and Deezer have done a better job representing independent music on their platforms. BPI Chief Executive, Geoff Taylor said: 'We think it is wrong for YouTube/Google to threaten to ostracise certain independents - denying fans the opportunity to hear their music, and labels and artists the chance to earn a living from it - because they are unwilling to surrender to a take it or leave it ultimatum. 'As the dominant online video platform, YouTube/Google should negotiate fully and fairly with independents and not misuse its power.'","Will cost $9/99 per month .

"Children in Australia and New Zealand were once amongst the most adventurous in the world, surfing, climbing, diving, racing and swimming in the huge natural playgrounds that their countries afforded them. These days, one in four Australian children are overweight, as are 29 per cent of children in New Zealand, according to the Lancet Medical Journal. A 59-year-old physicist, who was one of a bunch of daredevil children that pioneered adventure sports in the sixties by surfing the biggest waves, wrestling in mud, and rolling down hills in old tyres in New Zealand, believes it’s about time the nations stopped wrapping their children in 'cotton wool'. 'Myself and my brothers were raised in the wilderness and we developed that comfort zone with the outdoors. As opposed to kids today who are developing a comfort zone with the settee and their bedrooms,' Clive Neeson told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Pioneering: Clive Neeson strapped his $7 camera onto his surfboard to ride the biggest waves way before the invention of the popular GoPro camera in 2004 . Back then: In the 70s Mr Neeson set off around Europe with his backpack, camera and surfboard . To prove his point, Mr Neeson has revealed 45-years of stunning footage of him and his adrenalin seeking friends playing with very few barriers to stop them learning, exploring and having fun outdoors. Part of his motley crew was the man responsible for popularising the extreme sport of bungy jumping, AJ Hackett. Hackett famously jumped from the Eiffel Tower in 1987 and founded the first commercial bungy site in 1988. Mr Neeson grew up in a time when parents let their children play outside for hours on end, without needing to contact them by mobile phone. A time when children wanted to be outdoors, rather than sat at home in front of a screen. They had little money, but they gained a wealth of experiences. 'It was their mothers who insisted they play outside. They had no toys so there was a lot of innovation,' Mr Neeson explained. 'Kids these days are wrapped in cotton wool and there are too many restrictions, all the way down to the backyards of homes, they are not free to play in parks any more. It's manifesting itself in adults as well - they are not playing out, they are working out,' he added. No worries: The children were free to get as muddy as the liked in the great outdoors . Makeshift: Mr Neeson and his friends used what they could find to make their own fun . Relaxed upbringing: Mr Neeson was born in East Africa. His mother (pictured) was a wildlife cinematographer and he had a great time on adventures with his four brothers when they moved to New Zealand . His advice for parents? 'Take the kids camping and make sure it’s the happiest time they've ever had in the great outdoors.' Mr Neeson believes that children not exploring outdoors is 'the biggest thing to threaten our civilisation'. ‘We can’t find scientists… all these problems, including obesity, are linked,’ he said. Dr Arne Rubinstein, an expert on adolescent development, agrees with Mr Neeson: 'I strongly believe that the time for boys to learn boundaries and to experiment is when they are young.' ‘The outdoors is the perfect environment. If they wait to do it when they are adults using cars and other potential lethal devices then the consequences can be disastrous. 'We are failing a whole generation of children by wrapping them in cotton wool and not letting them get out there, get muddy, scratched up and bruised… it’s part of their basic education.' Growing up, Neeson and his 'oddball friends' created an early version of snowboarding – grabbing some wood and sliding along the hilly slopes - windsurfing and hang gliding, long before their popularisation into main stream sports and filming it all along the way. Inventive: The daredevil children threw together what they could find. In this photo they appear to have created one of the first paddle boards . Skying: Mr Neeson's film, Last Paradise, shows how he and his friends embraced extreme sports . The filmmaker, one of four boys who were born in East Africa to wildlife cinematographer parents, has now spent $500,000 turning the videos he captured on his $7 camera into an award-winning feature film titled Last Paradise. Mr Neeson was doing some technical troubleshooting at Peter Jackson's studio in New Zealand during the making of Lord Of The Rings, when he used some of his own footage to test a machine. People in the studio said it was the most 'extraordinary footage they'd ever seen' and thus Mr Neeson was spurred on to make his own flick. The nostalgic film, which is made up of 70 per cent of footage filmed by Neeson, shows the beginning of extreme sports in one of the most beautiful landscapes on earth and follows it through to what it is today. Adventurous: The group travelled around the world to surf the biggest waves . Natural beauty: The physicist and filmmaker wants parents and schools to allow children to make the most out of their natural environment . The film also has a strong environmental thread and clearly documents the detriment of some of New Zealand and Australia’s greatest wildernesses. 'It's more than a film... I've had people email me and say ""it's really changed my life"", both their relationship with the wilderness and with their kids. Mr Neeson strapped his cameras to his surfboard and improvised snowboard – pioneering extreme action video photography - way before the invention of the pricey GoPro camera that was invented by an American man on a surfing trip in 2004. 'I built water housing for both of them and 1970s,' he said. Retro: Mr Neeson made water housing for his cameras in the 1970s and strapped them to his surfboard . Touring: The filmmaker has taken his movie Last Paradise around Australia to 25 different cinemas . Passionate:  The film also has a strong environmental thread. 'all the beautiful places I loved as a child have gone,' Mr Neeson said . The film premiered last year in Perth, where Mr Neeson now spends half of his time, and toured 25 cinemas around Australia. Due to the overwhelming response he received Mr Neeson now plans to take the film back on the road to around 30 schools and towns and is inviting people who are interested in watching it to register their interest on the Last Paradise website. ‘If you’re interested we will organise the tour to come to you,’ he said.

"A Los Angeles restaurant is offering a deal to customers who agree to look at the person on the opposite side of the table instead of their mobile phone screens. Eva Restaurant is giving a five per cent discount to customers who are willing to leave their mobile phones with staff when they are seated. Owner Mark Gold told KPCC radio on Tuesday that the policy is an attempt to create an environment where diners connect to each other instead of technology. Eva Restaurant is offering a five per cent discount to diners who hand over their phones to restaurant staff . The owner believes the new approach encourages diners to engage with each other rather than their phones . He added that the approach hasn't been implemented to satisfy restaurant-goers that get annoyed by phone chatter or the glow of smartphone screens. Restaurant staff make the offer to diners when they introduce themselves at the start of the meal. Gold claims nearly half take advantage of the discount, and many express gratitude at the opportunity to let go of their devices for a while. Paying attention to your companion during a special meal out might be considered a basic courtesy. But a survey earlier this year revealed that for 68 per cent of Britons, this is no longer the case, for they would happily take a mobile phone call during a dinner date – even if they know it is not important. The study revealed the rise of ‘Rude Britannia’ since the proliferation of smartphones, with 63 per cent leaving their devices on the table while out for dinner with a friend. A survey earlier this year revealed that 68 per cent of Britons would happily take a mobile phone call over dinner . More than a third of those questioned admitted they would struggle to live without their mobiles. More than half (59 per cent) keep their phones with them at all times, and 16 per cent walk around with them in their hands all the time. One in seven of the 1,000 people polled even take their phones to the toilet with them to send text messages or check Facebook. 'The British have always been synonymous with good manners and politeness,' said Hannah Bouckley of the mobile phone company Recombu, which conducted the study. She added: 'The research shows we are shunning our manners due to obsessive phone addiction. 'It was only 10 to 15 years ago when high earners and business people were the only owners of clunky mobile phones. Now everyone from young children to pensioners relies heavily on a mobile phone. 'If we are not accepting calls and texts at dinner, we are playing games, watching videos or organising our lives with them.'","Los Angeles restaurant offers five per cent discount to diners who part with their mobile .

"Negotiators paid a $1.6 million ransom for the release of a German-American journalist who was kidnapped in Somalia and held for two years and eight months, a commander of pirates who held him said Wednesday. A German spokeswoman would not confirm that money was paid for the freedom of Michael Scott Moore and U.S. policy prohibits paying ransoms. Moore is 'doing well' and receiving medical care, Germany's Foreign Ministry said. Somali pirates on Tuesday freed a German-American journalist and writer, Michael Scott Moore, two and a half years after he was kidnapped in the war-torn Horn of Africa nation . Moore is 'doing well' and receiving medical care, Germany's Foreign Ministry said . Moore, 45, was flown to Kenya's capital after being freed in Somalia on Tuesday. A special German Foreign Ministry crisis group and German federal police had worked 'very closely' with U.S. authorities to win Moore's freedom after he was kidnapped on Jan. 21, 2012, while researching a book on piracy, foreign ministry spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli told The Associated Press in Berlin. 'Given the circumstances, he's doing well,' Chebli said. She would not comment on what led to his release or on reports that a ransom had been paid, beyond saying 'the German government cannot be blackmailed.' A German spokeswoman would not confirm that money was paid for the freedom of Michael Scott Moore and U.S. policy prohibits paying ransoms . The U.S. military in Africa refused to comment on whether the American military was at all involved in the case or if it would be involved in transporting Moore back to the United States. The Somali pirates negotiated with Somali intermediaries acting on behalf of Germany, Bile Hussein, a pirate commander in the coastal town of Hobyo, told AP. He said pirates grew tired of holding Moore and were increasingly concerned the U.S. would attempt to use force to secure the journalist's freedom. A special German Foreign Ministry crisis group and German federal police had worked 'very closely' with U.S. authorities to win Moore's freedom after he was kidnapped on Jan. 21, 2012 . Just four days after Moore was kidnapped in the northern Somali town of Galkayo as he was driving from the airport, U.S. Navy SEALs rescued an American and a Dane in a nighttime raid while killing all nine of their guards. The two had also been kidnapped in Galkayo, on Oct. 25, 2011. Moore had freelanced for Germany's Der Spiegel. He holds both German and American citizenship and is a native of Redondo Beach, California . Chebli said Moore was at the German Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on Wednesday. German officials there denied Moore was present.","German spokeswoman would not confirm money paid for Michael Scott Moore's freedom and U.S. policy prohibits paying ransoms .

"Mother of collaboration: Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon invented collaborations with her 1916 collection for Sears, Roebuck & Co . Phillip Lim sparked a retail frenzy this past weekend with his ode to cheap clothes at Target. But while the collection may have disappeared from store shelves, the concept of design collaborations has deeper roots than fast fashion may imply. The institution was actually started in London in 1916 by Titanic survivor Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon, whose couture house Lucile changed the landscape of fashion for the modern era. While little-known outside of fashion historian circles, Lady Duff-Gordon’s contributions to the fashion industry far exceed her limited notoriety. The house of Lucile, revered for its feminine Edwardian glamour, defined the era’s aesthetic with clothes that overflowed with frills, florals, and sweet colors. It was the go-to label for British aristocracy, as well as gentries in the United States and France. But Lucile was not simply just a purveyor of hyper feminine clothes. It was a game-changer in the realms of fashion business practices, as well as marketing. Lady Duff-Gordon (who often went by Lucile, professionally) created the first-ever designer collaboration with a two-season run for Sears, Roebuck & Co. She was also one of the first designers to stage runway shows, release a branded perfume, and issue coupons in magazines as a way to draw customers into her handful of international boutiques. Lucile was founded in 1893 according to Randy Bryan Bigham, author of the self-published book Lucile- Her Life by Design, as a way to support herself in the aftermath of her first marriage. Lady Duff-Gordon built Lucile’s name on attention-grabbing antics. She was the first designer to utilize celebrity culture as a method for attracting public recognition. Lady Duff-Gordon’s sister, the novelist and film producer Elinor Glyn, offered the designer an inside track to famous entertainers and the more renowned members of the Ziegfeld Follies, whom she dressed in a time when performers were still considered painted lady-type figures. Haute couture: Lucile's designs epitomized the Belle  Époque era's hyper feminine aesthetic and overflowed with frills, florals, and sweet colors . Lady Duff-Gordon’s many publicity stunts . earned her label a certain sense of notoriety—one which was tempered by . her lofty social title, which she earned in her second marriage to . Scottish landowner and Olympic fencer Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon. ‘How she presented herself went a long way in the business, the whole idea that she was aristocratic allowed her to be so suggestive,’ said Beth Dincuff, a fashion history professor at Parsons, The New School for Design. It also paved her foray into the lingerie industry—a move that is well marked with cultural transgressions. While Lady Duff-Gordon did not reinvent lingerie garments, she did revolutionize underpinnings by ushering the then-utilitarian objects into the decorative arena. Her undergarments were sold out of a boudoir in her atelier named The Rose Room, an environment where women were meant to feel comfortable shopping for lingerie with risqué style names like 'Dawn's Gentle Whisper'. She also named her ready-to-wear designs with monikers like ‘Climax’ and ‘The Garden of Love’. Famous fans: Lucile often created custom designs for performers, including famous members of the Ziegfeld follies, making it the first label to capitalize on celebrity culture . ‘She allowed respectable women to shop . for lingerie—if Lady Duff-Gordon is saying it’s OK to buy it, then it’s . OK,’ Dincuff continued. Says . April Calahan, a research associate in FIT’s special collection . archives, ‘In some ways she reminds me of [Imitation of Christ designer] . Tara Subkoff, because she has done that collaboration with Easy Spirit . and is infamous for pulling publicity tricks.’ 'Lucile . definitely had a keen mind for publicizing herself. She was really . interested in promoting her brand through the force of her own . personality' Lady Duff-Gordon even reportedly used mirrored . runways in her shows, allowing front-row patrons an especially premium . view—up the models’ skirts. ‘Quite similarly [to Subkoff] Lucile . definitely had a keen mind for publicizing herself, she was really . interested in promoting her brand through the force of her own . personality,’ Calahan added. Lady Duff-Gordon’s influence hit its peak in . the Belle Époque era, a time when ruffled extravagance was de rigeuer . among the world’s wealthy. But when the First World War hit, a need for . simplified elegance suddenly arose. Catwalk ready: Lucile was one of the first brands to stage runway shows for its clients, as shown in this photo where models present themselves in the brand's newest designs . Tasked with maintaining her relevance, Lucile decided to expand her potential reach to the everyday person. In 1916, two years after the war began, Lady Duff-Gordon teamed up with then mail order-only business Sears, Roebuck & Co. on a small co-opted collection. The designs--which included daywear, special occasion items, outerwear, and even suits--were ‘very close to her couture aesthetic, super feminine with lots of ribbons, lots of layers, lots of lace, and sumptuous material like velvets, chiffon, and silks,’ said Calahan. With inflation, the garments (priced from $25 to $40), would cost between $500 and $900, which Calahan says is ‘very comparable to the cost of high-end ready-to-wear today.’ The designs, which were still custom-tailored (customers had to fill out forms with their full-body measurements), were remarkably less expensive than Lucile’s couture pieces that, with inflation, would run in the ballpark of $5,000. Self-promotion: Lady Duff-Gordon was a trailblazer for fashion marketing, as seen in this early advertisement which promotes one of her standalone stores . Influential: Lucile's couture, seen in an advertisement (left) and on a model (right) was favored by aristocratic women who enjoyed her plush outlook on feminine attire . The collaboration lasted two seasons. There is very little documentation that charts its financial success. Dincuff . says that the collection likely received ‘an even stronger reaction to . the one we had in this age to Karl Lagerfeld for H&M.’ 'Maybe she did lose a few high-end customers. The Newport person wasn’t reading Sears & Roebuck - that was for the staff' Elaborating, she said: ‘Maybe she did lose a few high-end customers. The Newport person wasn’t reading Sears & Roebuck, that was for the staff.’ While Lucile’s attempt at widening her audience likely worked, her label ultimately did not manage to adapt itself to the vast cultural changes of the early 20th century. ‘Once you have Chanel and Vionnet on the scene you just have a different idea about what fashion could be,’ Dincuff said. ‘Lucile is not about simplicity and I really stress that the First World War started modernity, it’s simpler.’ Reinvented: Lucile's great-great-great granddaughter Camilla Blois has restarted the brand, using its feminine archives as inspiration . The new Lucile look: The designs, which are handmade in England, retail between $140 and $400 . Lucile continued to design into the . Twenties, but ‘she didn’t groom a successor, at that time once a . designer would pass away the whole business would close. Those who had . diversified later on, like Chanel, made sure there was someone to take . over the business,’ Dincuff added. The house of Lucile entirely dissolved by 1933, and . lay dormant until 2005 when her great-great granddaughter . decided to reinvigorate the house for the modern era. Camilla . Blois, 43, now oversees the house of Lucile, which operates as a . lingerie-only label. She grew up playing dress up in the label’s archive . of relics, ‘cutting them up and remaking them for our dolls and our . dogs,’ she told MailOnline. Along . with two other employees, Blois has re-established Lucile, pulling . inspiration from her great great great grandmother’s original designs . and sketchbooks. ‘The fashion has changed but the color ways and the . essence has not,’ she said of the new Lucile. While Blois would not release sales . figures, she stressed that the label has found success in specialty . boutiques. The designs, which are hand cut and hand sewn in England, . retail between $140 and $400. Fashion frenzy: Target's recent collaboration with 3.1 Philip Lim sparked a retail storm and racks in store were cleared by eager customers nationwide . Can't get enough: H&M's designer collections have been equally popular, with young fashionistas grabbing armfuls of designs from last year's Marni collaboration at a London store . ‘I . think the ultimate goal is to have boutiques in London, Paris, New . York, and Chicago and to reinstate the brand as it was 100 years ago,’ Blois said of her aspirations for the label. In . the meantime, fashion historians are eager to bring Lady Duff-Gordon’s . original legacy into the public spotlight. In the last decade her work . has been commemorated with retrospectives at the Victoria & Albert . Museum as well as the Museum at FIT. ‘I think when historians look back on today, one of the hallmarks of this period will be all of the high-low collaborations,’ said Dincuff. ‘When they look for the precedent and see that it is Lucile, I think that is what she will be remembered for.’ Says Calahan, ‘She deserves a more thorough investigation for her contributions, she was a line-crosser and there are definitely people who would be interested in her story.’","Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon's high-end label Lucile created two collections for Sears, Roebuck & Co .

Murray is in Dubai to take part in the championships and won his first-round tie against Luxembourg's Gilles Muller on Tuesday. Murray said of the victory: 'I made him work very hard on his service games. That was something I wanted to try to do from early on. 'The end of both sets I didn't serve so well but apart from that, I didn't give him any opportunities really.'

However, she poked fun at herself the next day when she rocked up to Andy's next game in a jumper which read: 'Parental Advisory, Explicit Content.' Murray later defended Sears' actions saying in an interview that she had been 'whipped up,' by the media storm surrounding his match. The day after being caught on camera swearing during one of Andy's tennis matches Kim was spotted wearing this parental advisory jumper . Murray said at the time: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal.' He added: 'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' It was recently confirmed that Murray and Kim have set the date for their wedding as April 11. They will wed in an intimate ceremony at Cromlix House, a hotel in Scotland owned by Murray himself.","Former Wimbledon champion was paid special attention by the dancer .

"An Afghan police officer turned his gun on NATO troops at a remote checkpoint in southern Afghanistan before dawn Sunday, killing four American service members, according to Afghan and international officials. It was the third attack by Afghan forces or insurgents disguised in military uniforms against international forces in as many days, killing eight troops in all. Recent months have seen a string of such insider attacks by Afghan forces against their international counterparts. The killings have imperiled the military partnership between Kabul and NATO, a working relationship that is key to the handover of security responsibilities to Afghan forces as international troops draw down. Scroll down for video . Night patrol: Infantry men from the 1st platoon, Delta company attend a briefing prior to embarking on night patrol in Kandahar province . Meanwhile, according to Afghan officials, airstrikes by NATO planes killed eight women and girls in a remote part of the country, fueling a long-standing grievance against a tactic used by international forces that Afghans say causes excessive civilian casualties. Villagers from a remote part of Laghman province's Alingar district drove the bodies to the provincial capital, claiming they were killed by NATO aircraft while they were out gathering firewood before dawn. 'They were shouting 'Death to America!' They were condemning the attack,' said Laghman provincial government spokesman Sarhadi Zewak. Seven injured females were also brought to area hospitals for treatment, some of them as young as 10 years old, said provincial health director Latif Qayumi. NATO forces at first said that about 45 insurgents and no civilians were killed in the attack but spokesman Jamie Graybeal stressed later that they took the charge of civilian deaths seriously and were investigating the allegations. An Infantry man from the 1st platoon walks in front of a tactical mine-resistant vehicle in Kandahar province . 'Protecting Afghan lives is the cornerstone of our mission and it saddens us when we learn that our action might have unintentionally harmed civilians,' Graybeal said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the airstrike and said a government investigation had been opened. The recent violence also comes amid an international uproar about an internet video mocking the Prophet Muhammad that many fear could further aggravate Afghan-U.S. relations. The video has sparked protests throughout the Muslim world and the Afghan government blocked the YouTube site that hosts the video and its parent company, Google, over the weekend in a move to prevent violent protests. So far, protests in Afghanistan have remained peaceful. Infantry men on night patrol: The latest attack means that so far this year, Afghan security personnel have shot dead at least 47 NATO soldiers . Details of Sunday's attack were slow to come out because it took place in a remote area, said Graybeal, the NATO forces spokesman. 'The attack took place in the vicinity of an outpost in southern Afghanistan. It is my understanding that it was a checkpoint,' said Graybeal. International forces often work with Afghan police to man checkpoints as part of the effort to train and mentor the Afghan forces so that they can eventually operate on their own. The goal is to turn over all security responsibility for the country to the Afghans by the end of 2014, though numbers of NATO forces have already been reduced in many areas. Two NATO soldiers were shot dead today by a man believed to be a member of a controversial Afghan police force in southern Afghanistan . Graybeal said one police officer was killed in the clash with NATO troops but that the other officers at the site fled and it was unclear if they were involved in the attack or not. Two international troops were wounded and were receiving treatment, Graybeal said. He did not say how serious the injuries were. Afghan officials said the checkpoint in Zabul province's Mizan district came under attack first from insurgents sometime around midnight. American forces came to help the Afghan police respond to the attack, said Ghulam Gilani, the deputy police chief of the province. It was not clear if some of the Afghan police turned on their American helpers in the middle of the battle with the insurgents, or afterward, or were somehow forced into attacking the American troops by the insurgents, Gilani said. 'The checkpoint was attacked last night. Then the police started fighting with the Americans. Whether they attacked the Americans willingly we don't know,' said Gilani. Continuing unrest: Afghan protesters set fire to a U.S. flag and shout slogans during a demonstration in Kabul . He said all four of the dead were American. A U.S. official speaking on anonymity because the information had not been officially released confirmed that the four killed were American. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said the police who attacked were not affiliated with the Taliban insurgency. 'But they are Afghans and they know that Americans are our enemy,' Ahmadi told The Associated Press. In an emailed statement, he said the police who fled have joined up with the insurgency. The coalition said in a statement that they were investigating what happened. So far this year, 51 international service members have died at the hands of Afghan soldiers or policemen or insurgents wearing their uniforms. At least 12 such attacks came in August alone, leaving 15 dead. On Saturday, a gunman in the uniform of a government-backed militia force shot dead two British soldiers in Helmand district in the southwest. 'Death to America': Afghans burn an effigy of President Obama during a protest in Khost, south-east of Kabul . Britain's defense minister said the two soldiers, from 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, were killed at a checkpoint shooting in Nahri Sarraj district of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban have their strongest roots. NATO said earlier that the gunman was wearing a uniform used by the Afghan Local Police, a village-level fighting force overseen by the central government. That strike came a day after insurgents wearing U.S. Army uniforms attacked a military base, killing two American Marines, wounding nine other people and destroying six Harrier fighter jets, military officials said. Fourteen insurgents were killed. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack and said that it was revenge for the video insulting Prophet Muhammad. In the capital on Sunday, several hundred university students chanted 'Death to America!' and 'Long life to Islam!' over several hours to protest the video. Riot police cordoned off the area and the protest ended without incident in the early afternoon. A smaller protest went forward in the western city of Herat.","Third attack against international forces in as many days by insurgents disguised in military uniforms .

"A British bomb-maker on the run with the widow of a London 7/7 bomber is believed to have been killed in a gun battle in Somalia. Habib Ghani, 28, was ambushed along with one of America’s most wanted terrorists in a dawn raid after falling out with commanders from militant group al-Shabab. The fanatic – who also called himself Osama al-Britani – was a key ally of Muslim convert Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, who was married to King’s Cross bomber Jermaine Lindsay. Killed: Habib Ghani (left) is believed to have been shot dead in Somalia. He has been on the run with Samantha Lewthwaite (right) since 2011 . The so-called ‘White Widow’, who is the world’s most wanted woman, has been on the run in East Africa after police foiled a Christmas bomb plot against Western tourists in the coastal resort of Mombasa in 2011. Police believe the soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, had been working with Ghani for several years, although she was not thought to have been present when gunmen struck early yesterday. Ghani, from Hounslow, west London, and Omar Hammami, also called al-Amriki (The American), are thought to have been shot by gunmen from al-Shabab, who overpowered their bodyguards in a village where they had been in hiding since fleeing the terror group in June. 'Dead': Militants in Somalia have claimed that . American jihadist Omar Hammami has been killed.

Popular: Hammami was voted president of his Sophomore class and dated one of the most popular girls in school . Residents in al-Baate village in southern Somalia said their bodies were dragged away by rebels. ‘This morning al-Amriki and his comrades were attacked by well-armed fighters,’ said Hussein Nur. Convert: Soldier's daughter Samantha Lewthwaite pictured at school . ‘After a brief fight, al-Amriki and his two colleagues were killed. Several of their guards escaped.’ The al-Shabab gunmen struck at 5.30am, just after morning prayers, capturing the jihadists unawares. Sources said the gunmen had lain in wait for several days, posing as camel herders. Ghani and Hammami were allies of Somali Islamist Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who split from al-Shabab in June, causing a rift in the group’s ranks. Since the split, al-Shabab has been hunting down and killing allies of Aweys. Al-Amriki was on the FBI’s Most . Wanted terror list and a $5million (£3.1million) bounty was offered for . information leading to his capture. Ghani . was born in the UK to a Pakistani father and a Kenyan mother. According . to police sources, he left his home in Hounslow several years ago and . gained bomb-making experience in Pakistan. Last night details emerged about Ghani’s secret life in Somalia where he was also known locally as Sheikh Towfiq. Target: One of Americas most wanted terrorists, Omar Hammami (left), was killed alongside Ghani. Lewthwaite and Ghani had been on the run since 2011 when police swooped on another extremist, Jermaine Grant (right) The bearded Briton was living with his Somalian wife Habibo and two children, a boy aged three and a baby girl just a few months old, in the remote town of Hawalbarbar which has no electricity. He owned a small kiosk, where he charged phone batteries with his solar-powered adapter for a fee. Ghani and Lewthwaite were said to have fled Kenya in December 2011 as police swooped on a third and unconnected British extremist, Jermaine Grant, who was living on the other side of Mombasa. Police feared she and Ghani were planning to unleash a terror attack as the tourist season got under way but she managed to slip the net. Lewthwaite is believed to be a vital conduit between Al Qaeda groups in Pakistan and East Africa.

She was seven months pregnant when Lindsay, a Jamaican convert from Huddersfield, killed 26 people when he blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train in July 2005. Since her disappearance, Lewthwaite has been linked to a spate of grenade attacks in Mombasa, including one which killed three people. Ghani’s family, who live in a modest £270,000 terraced house in a quiet suburban street, refused to speak to reporters last night. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Somalia and are looking into this.’ Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been on the run for nearly two years.

"The Siberian parents who rejected heroic U.S. Paralympic star Jessica Long as a new born baby have emerged to salute her achievements. Until a few days ago they had no idea that the 20-year-old record-breaking swimmer was the disabled child they gave up to an orphanage as teenage parents. Her biological Russian family had even watched her on TV at the 2012 Paralympics without knowing who she was. Paralympic hero: Swimmer Jessica Long holds up one of the five gold medal she won at the London 2012 event . Jessica Long pictured taking her first swimming lesson as a young child . 'I got scared': Jessica's biological Tatiana was a teenager when she gave birth . Jessica was adopted aged one by American couple Beth and Steve Long from an orphanage in Bratsk, some 2,350 miles east of Moscow, and she grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. Born without fibulas, ankles, heels, and most of bones in her feet, Jessica's lower legs were amputated when she was just 18 months old and she soon learned to walk with prostheses. Her adoptive parents showered her with love and enabled her to reach remarkable heights, she has become one of the United States' most inspirational sportswomen having won a dozen gold medals in three Paralympics. After her latest clutch of golds in London, Russian journalists tracked down the Siberian parents Natalya and Oleg Valtyshev of Jessica Long, who on Friday was one of the Olympian and Paralympian stars hosted at a White House reception by President Barack Obama. Deeply emotional, Natalia, now 38, Jessica's real mother, stumbled as she tried to find the words to explain on Russian television how she felt two decades ago, at the age of 18, after giving birth to a seriously disabled daughter, reported The Siberian Times. 'I feel so sorry,' she said. 'At that time - there was some fear, I got scared. I had to leave her behind. But I did think that I would take her back. 'Of course I was against leaving her in the hospital but because of the circumstances we had to do so. In my heart I did want to take her home, and thought I would take her back later.' She stressed: 'I was alone in Siberia, without my mother and father. Where would I go with her, if I had taken her? Doctors told me to leave her behind - said that I could not help her... I called her Tatiana, after my elder sister.' Proud father: Jessica Long's biological father Oleg . Jessica, then called Tatiana, in a Siberian orphanage . Family resemblance: Jessica (left) and her biological mother . Her then boyfriend - now her husband - said the couple felt pressurized by doctors to make the decision to give her up. He was only 17 when she was born, and the couple - who have since had three more children including another disabled daughter, Dasha, 13, born with a similar condition to Jessica, who they care for at their village home. 'What could I have said? I couldn't say anything because I was not ready for this. I was very shocked with the whole thing,' he says now. 'I don't want to say anything bad about the doctors. They said: ""The girl has deformities and you are young, it's going to be hard"".' He recalls that 'of course' he and Natalia wanted to take little Tatiana (now Jessica) home, but seemed to find recalling this moment too painful to find words to explain it fully. He did, though, express his deep pride over Jessica's life and achievements in America, and very much wishes to meet a daughter he only even saw for a few minutes in the maternity hospital. 'Of course I'm happy that we found her, glad for her and I am proud. And of course I want to meet her,' he said. Winner: Jessica Long puts her prosthetic legs back on after winning the women's 100m Freestyle S8 event during the London 2012 Paralympic Games . Jessica's Siberian sister Dasha was born with a similar disability . Jessica Long's mother Natalia, right, and aunt Tatiana, left, after whom she was named at birth . Natalia said she was convinced she would be able to go back for Jessica later, despite signing away her parental rights in the days after her baby's birth. 'On 6 July 1993 I gave birth to my second daughter Nastya, and on the 9 July American parents adopted her,' she said. 'Babies are normally kept in the baby orphanage until the age of three, and I was sure nobody would adopt her. I was getting information about my daughter, that she was growing up pretty, that everybody loves her. 'And then I got information that she was being adopted to America.' That Natalia suffered emotional turmoil over what happened is clear from a story Jessica's real-life sister Nastya - or Anastasia - has told. When she was eight, Natalia confessed to her that she had an older sister who no longer lived with them. Nastya - now 19 - said her mother was too traumatized to speak about the missing child further. 'I was very surprised. Mama said that she was very beautiful. She said that it was hard for her to talk about it, and I should not ask questions. But sometimes I thought of her. I thought that when I grow older and get a job, maybe I'll find her,' she said. Adoptive mom: Beth Long raised Jessica as her daughter in Baltimore, Maryland . Champion: Jessica Long has won 16 medals at three Paralympics, including 12 gold medals . Brave little girl: One of Jessica's first attempts to put on her prostheses after having her lower legs amputated when she was 18 months old . It emerges that before giving her up Natalia named her Tatiana, after her own sister. Her name was changed to Jessica in the US, but the swimmer's real-life aunt - Tatiana Rusanova, who had watched her in the Paralympics, not knowing her true identity - defended Natalia over giving up her disabled child. 'I want to support my sister. Our lives were difficult. Our fate took us in different directions. Natalia was 15 when she had to go to Irkutsk region. I stayed in Kursk region. We lived a poor life. We had a stepfather. Our mother liked to drink vodka. 'Natalia was like an orphan. There was nobody around to help her. She wrote to us, telling us she had given birth to a disabled baby girl. We worried about her. We did not hope for anything good.' The family resemblance of Jessica to her blood relatives is striking. Jessica's first home was an orphanage in Bratsk, Siberia after her teenage Russian parents gave her up at the maternity hospital . Adoptive dad: Steve Long raised Jessica to grow up a happy child and later develop her skills and shine on the world stage . Jessica's feelings on the discovery of her Siberian family are not known, but she has been quoted saying: 'I would like to go to Russia just after the Paralympics to find my Mom. I don't know anything about her besides the fact that her name is Natalia and she was 16 when she left me in the Irkutsk orphanage. 'I'm not angry with her. I just want to meet her. I think we have a lot in common. I know that one day I will have a family and I will have kids, and you know what, I would like to call my daughter Natalia, the name of my Russian mother who gave birth to me.' At the weekend she Tweeted: 'Thank you for all the love and support from Russia!' But it is now known if this relates to the discovery of her family or something else. She has spoken frequently about her Russian background once saying: 'Who would have ever imagined that a girl with a ""disability"" from an orphanage in Siberia would be where I am today? I'm living proof that you can accomplish your dreams, no matter how great or small.'

"A Korean man kidnapped and killed numerous pet dogs in his Argentine neighbourhood so he could sell their meat to a local supermarket, it is claimed. The 70-year-old allegedly swiped family pets off the streets of Buenos Aires and fed them for several days to boost their size.

"The Obama administration has been accused of repeatedly ignoring warning signs over the past two years that showed a growing number of unaccompanied children from Central America were crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. Agencies like the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as politicians north and south of the border were all ‘ringing alarm bells’ about the federal government’s capacity to manage the situation, according to a report presented to the Department of Homeland Security in March. The 41-page report was compiled by a team from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Scroll down for video . The Obama administration has been accused of repeatedly ignoring warning signs over the past two years that showed a growing number of unaccompanied children from Central America were crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. In August 2013, the researchers had discovered a makeshift transportation depot manned by Border Patrol agents at the Fort Brown station in Brownsville, Texas. Thirty agents were assigned to perform such tasks as washing the children's clothes, driving them to offsite showers, and making them sandwiches. The White House was even directly involved in efforts to care for immigrant children in early 2012 when it helped negotiate a temporary shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. Yet the Obama administration considered the problem a ‘local’ one. Protesters gather outside the Mexican Consulate in Austin, Texas, on Friday: Agencies like the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement were 'ringing alarm bells' about the federal government's capacity to manage the situation, according to a report presented to the Department of Homeland Security in March . ‘There were warning signs, operational folks raising red flags to high levels in terms of this being a potential issue,’ an anonymous former senior federal law enforcement official told The Washington Post. Obama’s domestic policy adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, has denied that the administration was slow to react and said the current crisis is 'off-the-charts different.' 'It was not the same pattern,' she said. 'We assumed a significant increase, but this was not the same kind of trend line.' The Border Patrol has since revised their original estimate of 60,000 children for the year to 90,000 illegally entering the country by the end of September. Last month, Obama ordered an emergency . response overseen by the National Security Council and the Federal . Emergency Management Agency, and asked Congress to approve $3.7 . billion in emergency funds. The UTEP report also claims that warnings came from outside the federal government as well. The first ladies of Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico cited 'worrisome statistics' showing an upswing in unaccompanied minors in April 2012. The same month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry wrote a letter informing the president that the number of unaccompanied Central American minors crossing the border was up 90 percent from the previous year. He criticized the Obama administration for 'perpetuating the problem' by its inaction. 'Every day of delay risks more lives,' wrote Perry. 'Every child allowed to remain encourages hundreds more to attempt the journey.' A group of immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are stopped in Granjeno, Texas . During the president's 2012 reelection campaign he announced plans to defer the deportations of certain immigrants brought to the country illegally as children before June 2007. Critics now argue that the administration chose to ignore reports about the growing number of immigrant children and instead focused on trying to push his reform bill through Congress. 'Was the White House told there were huge flows of Central Americans coming? Of course they were told. A lot of times,' one former government official told the Post. 'Was there a general lack of interest and a focus on the legislation? Yes, that’s where the focus was.' The flood of children crossing the Mexican border illegally and without their parents has slowed down in recent weeks, two senior Obama administration officials said on Friday. Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas have found fewer than 500 children crossing the border illegally this week, the officials said. Last month, agents arrested as many as 2,000 child immigrants a week. The Obama administration has been struggling to deal with a flood of more than 57,000 children traveling alone since Oct. 1. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said earlier this month that as many as 90,000 unaccompanied child immigrants could be apprehended by the end of the budget year in September. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and El Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren will meet with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden on July 25. Demonstrators hold signs and flags outside the Mexican Consulate in Houston: The Obama administration has been struggling to deal with a flood of more than 57,000 children traveling alone since Oct. 1 . Biden has been the point person for contacts with these Central American leaders. He last spoke to them by phone on July 9 and was in Guatemala for meetings on June 20. The U.S. has been urging those governments to take steps to stem the exodus of children and warning that the U.S. will take steps to send them back promptly. The volume of child immigrants has significantly taxed resources at the Homeland Security and Health and Human Services departments in recent months and prompted President Barack Obama to ask Congress to approve an emergency $3.7 billion spending bill to deal with the situation he has called an ""urgent humanitarian crisis."" The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the latest trends in border arrests, said Friday it's too soon to know what has led to drop in border arrests. They said illegal border crossings along the Mexican border tend to slow during the summer. Prospects for action on the U.S.-Mexico border crisis faded on Thursday as lawmakers traded accusations rather than solutions, raising chances that Congress will go into its summer recess without doing anything about the tens of thousands of migrant children streaming into South Texas . Customs and Border Protection has launched a public relations campaign to warn would-be immigrants and their families in Central America that the trip to the U.S. border is dangerous and immigrant children will face deportation after they are apprehended. But since the trip through Mexico can take weeks or even months, recent border crossers are unlikely to have seen much of the campaign. Along with dealing with the flood of children traveling alone, the Border Patrol has also arrested more than 55,000 people traveling as families, mostly mothers with young children. Because of a lack of detention space many of those people have been released with a notice to report back to immigration authorities at a later date. The Obama administration has repeatedly declined to say how many people have been released and how many have reported as ordered. In recent weeks the Homeland Security Department has opened a family detention center with space for as many as 700 people center in Artesia, New Mexico, at the Border Patrol's training facility. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Friday that a detention center in Karnes County, Texas, would be converted to house families starting in the next few weeks. That facility currently has space for 600 people.","Border agencies were 'ringing alarm bells' during the past two years about about the federal government's capacity to manage the immigration issue .

"A mother has told how she made the heartbreaking decision to stop her young daughter’s cancer treatment for her to enjoy a pain free last Christmas. Terminally ill three-year-old Isabella Coomber has been battling a rare brain tumour since she was one. She was due to start a final cycle of chemotherapy last month to help extend her life. But chemotherapy treatment left the little girl from Charlton, South London, so sick that her mother pleaded with doctors to end it, so Isabella would be well enough to have fun at Christmas. Jolene Hale said: 'Thanks to the amazing support we received after our story appeared we were able to make our daughter's dream come true just in time' This Christmas will be her last, which is why her mother Jolene Hale is determined to make it the best ever for Isabella and her sisters Rebecca, seven, and Sophia, 18 months. Ms Hale, 32, said: ‘There will be no tears while Isabella is here. We are lucky enough to have another Christmas with our darling girl and I want to create happy memories that we can cherish forever. ‘Cancer has ruined every Christmas she has been old enough to know about so far, but not this one. This year she will have fun like other children. ‘The treatment will not cure Isabella so what is the point of continuing if it makes her quality of life so poor she can’t enjoy herself? ‘She may not have long left so the time we have together is too precious to waste being sick. My little girl deserves some laughter and happiness at Christmas.’ Ms Hale is now desperately fundraising to fulfil her daughter's final Christmas wish to visit Disneyland. Isabella has been battling a rare brain tumour since she was one . Previous rounds of chemotherapy left Isabella so sick that her mother pleaded with doctors to end it, so she would be well enough to have fun at Christmas . The little girl asked Father Christmas if instead of a present she could go and see her favourite characters again, after fundraisers sent the family to Disneyland Paris last year. Ms Hale said: ‘I nearly had a heart attack when she told me she had asked Father Christmas if she could go back to Disney. She had the absolute time of her life there last year, I have never seen her so happy. ‘I had no idea that’s what she was planning to ask for at Christmas. But there is no way I can afford to take her. ‘It will break my heart not to be able to give her what she has asked for when I know this will be her last Christmas with me so I’ve started fundraising to see if it is possible. ‘The best I can do is try like any mum in my shoes would.’ Ms Hale, with her daughters Isabella, Rebecca and Sophia, said: 'Cancer has ruined every Christmas Isabella has been old enough to know about so far, but not this one. This year she will have fun like other children' Isabella was born seemingly perfectly healthy on September 30th 2010. Her mother first feared something was wrong when she was five months old. She explained: ‘I noticed she didn’t push her legs down like Rebecca had done as a baby but my GP told me not to worry and assured me all babies developed differently.’ By the time Isabella was ten months old, Ms Hale was pregnant again, but still concerned for her baby who was unable to sit unsupported. She was referred to the Royal Marsden in London for tests and on December 16 2011 Isabelle had a brain scan which revealed a large tumour. Ms Hale said: ‘No mother expects to hear those words, I was shaking and sobbing.’ Her mother said: 'The treatment will not cure Isabella so what is the point of continuing if it makes her quality of life so poor she can't enjoy herself?' Isabella's mother says her daughter . 'deserves some laughter and happiness' At the time the tumour was thought not to be cancerous but still needed to be removed within days. Isabella's mother hastily brought Christmas forward for her little girls to enjoy the big day before their sister returned to hospital for surgery. She said: ‘Thankfully they never guessed it wasn’t really Christmas. We had Turkey and crackers and lots of presents but in the back of my mind all I could think about was the operation.’ Days later Isabella underwent surgery and spent the real Christmas Day recovering on the ward. But during the eight- hour operation surgeons were only able to remove 80 per cent of the tumour. The rest was wrapped around a main blood vessel and too dangerous to remove. As she recovered, she was nicknamed the Little Lion by nurses for her courage and bravery. But there was bad news when tests revealed the tumour was in fact an extremely rare cancer. Isabella started chemotherapy immediately and three months later in March 2012, Ms Hale gave birth to Sophia but unfortunately separated with the girls’ father Chris. Ms Hale said: 'We wouldn't wish this on anyone. But the love and support from strangers who read our story has been humbling and for that we cannot say thank you enough' She said: 'Isabella loved being a big sister and I hoped the new baby would give her something else to fight for.’ But she wasn't responding to treatment as hoped, so her family began fundraising for pioneering proton treatment in America. Last Christmas she battled through more chemotherapy and the family prayed it would work. But in September this year doctors broke the terrible news that Isabella would not survive and had just ten months left to live. Ms Hale said: 'I will never ever forget those words. They told me my little girl would never grow up and in that moment my heart shattered forever. In September this year doctors broke the terrible news that Isabella would not survive and had just ten months left to live . ‘But I knew I could not cry, not while I still had Isabella in my arms, because instead of fighting for her life, I now had to fight to ensure she had the best possible time while she was alive.’ Chemotherapy was arranged to try and prolong the her life but the first round left her so sick and weak her mother spoke to doctors about ending treatment. She said: ‘I couldn’t bear to see the precious time she had left wasted being ill on hospital wards. She’d been through so much already and I felt it was time for her to start enjoying life. ‘Christmas was coming and she was so excited. I didn’t want it ruined by treatment that couldn’t save her.’ Isabella's consultant agreed that her quality of life would be so poor the treatment should be stopped for her to have some fun. He also advised the family not to waste their time going to America for treatment. Ms Hale is now fundraising to try and make her daughter's last ever Christmas wish come true . Instead it was agreed that the tens of thousands that had been raised by well wishers to send her to America should instead help other children with cancer. The cash was used to purchase a caravan which is now available for free holidays to families who need them most. It was named the Little Lions Den after Isabella. So when Isabella revealed her Christmas wish this year, it meant her mother had to start fundraising again. She is now hoping the public will get behind her one last time to make her daughter's last ever Christmas wish come true.

"She's the daytime TV treasure with a serious passion for high street fashion and a loyal following of stylish women of a certain age. So it came as little surprise that ITV presenter Lorraine Kelly was snapped up as a brand ambassador for JD Williams in July. So successful was the 54-year-old's first foray into fashion that she's been unveiled as the face of the retailer's Christmas campaign ahead of designing her own SS15 range for them. She's back! Lorraine Kelly has been unveiled as the star of JD Williams' Christmas campaign and wows in a sequin-embellished dress . The campaign aims to showcase fashion designed specifically for women who struggle to find clothes that fit and flatter their figures on the high street. The advert - a multi-million pound campaign by JD Williams - is focused around the brand's party collection, featuring key pieces chosen by Lorraine herself. The advert - set in Addington Palace in South London - looks in on a glamorous group of ladies and gents of all ages, socialising at a subdued Christmas party. There is a sense of boredom and discontentment. As a waiter passes by, the leading lady gets caught in a conventional waltz. Behind the scenes with Lorraine: The 54-year-old Scottish TV star was hired by the brand to help select an edit of clothes for women who feel forgotten by the high street . The music tempo dramatically switches, and the atmosphere changes instantly and guests begin enthusiastically dancing as Lorraine Kelly arrives in a dazzling embellished dress. A spokesperson for the brand said: 'We wanted to produce a Christmas campaign that would hold its own alongside other major high-street fashion retailers own festive adverts. 'We wanted to convey how JD Williams can ""put the fun back into shopping and fashion"" with the strapline: looking good has never felt so good – based around the JD Williams guarantee of clothes that fit and flatter the mature figure. 'These key messages came from customer insight - we wanted to reflect our shoppers’ celebratory attitude to life, their innate need for fashion that makes them feel fabulous, and of course feature our brand ambassador Lorraine - whom our customers relate to and look up to as a role model.' Getting into the swing of it: In the advert, which begins at a down-beat party, viewers hear the music tempo dramatically switch and see partygoers enthusiastically dancing as Lorraine arrives in a dazzling embellished dress and joins in . Having fun with fashion: Speaking about landing the campaign, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'I'm thrilled that JD Williams have asked me to be an ambassador and you know what, I'm 54 and I absolutely love fashion' Leading lady: JD Williams quizzed their customers on whose style they loved and Lorraine was the unanimous winner, with British men and women both saying they 'trusted' the presenter so she was unveiled as their face in July . Lorraine added: 'I absolutely loved filming the Christmas advert, because I enjoy the festive season so much, and there is nothing that makes you feel more fabulous than a glam party dress. 'I really enjoyed all the dancing and the women I filmed with were a joy to work with and looked utterly stunning in their gorgeous frocks.' JD Williams quizzed their customers on whose style they loved and Lorraine was the unanimous winner, with British men and women both saying they 'trusted' the presenter. Since being snapped up to front the brand in July, Lorraine has helped boost sales dramatically. Speaking at time, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'I'm thrilled that JD Williams have asked me to be an ambassador and you know what, I'm 54 and I absolutely love fashion. 'My mum is 74 and she loves fashion, my daughter is 20 and she loves it too. I've always said it's an area that we've neglected and shame on us.' Lorraine mused: 'These women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic, it doesn't matter what size or age they are, we have neglected them. I know this from my own experience, from talking to my mum and my viewers. The people that watch the show, I hope, will want to wear the clothes.'

"Timothy Giles, 46, sent this photo of a random pilot - who is not connected to the . case - to various lovers to convince them he worked for Qantas airlines . An unemployed toilet cleaner used a random photo of a pilot he found online to convince women that he worked for Qantas airlines - so he could con the victims out of money. Timothy Giles, 46, from Blunsdon, near Swindon, swindled would-be lovers by spinning a series of elaborate tales about his apparent high-flying jobs. He downloaded a picture from the internet of a pilot . which he believed looked like him and sent it to his . various lady friends, pretending it was him at work. The fraudster even sent one victim a picture of the Indian Ocean which he had also downloaded, claiming it was the view he was looking at. Once he had tricked the women with his fake life story, the real-life Catch Me If You Can fraudster - described in court as a 'ladies' man' - then persuaded the 'vulnerable women' to give him money. Giles covered his lies by creating back stories about his past, sending the women 'photos' of his latest working environment and even pretending that he lived in a house which he did not own. The court also heard how he raised money for charity through a sponsored cycle ride, but handed over less than half of the total amount. Giles' tale has echoes of Frank Abagnale, who was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in the Steven Spielberg film Catch Me If You Can. But on New Year’s Eve last year, Giles' fake identities were exposed when he was arrested at one of his victim's homes in East Devon. The unsuspecting 40-year-old victim had believed Giles - who stole money from her - was a Qantas airline pilot. During a hearing at Exeter Magistrates' Court, Giles admitted seven charges of fraud and theft between July and . December last year. The court heard he had already been convicted in December 2013 of posing as a policeman in Somerset - but was back conning more victims just months later. At . the same time he was pretending to be a pilot while dating another . woman in Kingsteignton. He had also previously duped another woman into . believing he was a fireman. Now one of his victims has spoken out as a warning to other women who may fall for his lies. Giles, from Blunsdon, near Swindon, swindled money out of women he met online by . pretending he had a series of high flying jobs, including being a pilot, a policeman and a fireman . The mother-of-two, who was convinced he worked for Australian airline Qantas, revealed how she was conned into giving Giles £200 after a four-month romance. She said: 'His story was that he was an airline pilot working for Qantas and had been doing for ten years. 'He said his parents lived in Australia where he used to work but he had moved to the company’s English base. 'He then moved to Devon and would stay at mine a lot and leave at silly o’clock to say he was driving back to Heathrow. I now know he was going to see another woman. One of his victims, who believed he was an airline pilot for Qantas, . said he had 'an answer for anything and everything' and had 'a complete . life mapped out' 'He had details about his job, parents, house and past life. He had a complete life mapped out but it was all just a fabricated mess. 'He would send me photos of where he was in the world. He would text me his ‘current view’ of a hotel or beach in the Indian Ocean. 'But it was all just downloaded off the Internet - just like the photo he initially sent me in a pilot’s uniform.' The woman, who does not want to be named, said they chatted online for a long time before they met. Giles, . pictured outside Exeter . Magistrates' Court, kept up his disguise by creating back stories about . his past, and sending women photos of the foreign cities in which he was . allegedly based - which he downloaded from the internet . She said: 'He kept coming around and . worked on getting to know my children. He became very close to my son . and they bonded over a love of planes. 'It all seemed to slip into place. I felt so happy that I went along with it all. He just won me over. 'But . he stole £400 from my home and I lent him £200 as he claimed to have . left his bank card in a hotel in Australia and couldn’t access his money . over Christmas. I trusted him and thought I would get it back a few . days later. 'He was here at . Christmas and was in all the photos with my children. I thought he was . becoming part of the family. I am so angry he has been allowed to do . this. 'I never suspected anything, he seemed so genuine. He had visited my family and told them the same story. 'I had started to think a few things were not quite right but I still believed at the time he was arrested he was a pilot and lived in this house in West Hill. 'He had details about his job, . parents, house and past life. He had a complete life mapped out but it . was all just a fabricated mess' One of Timothy Giles' victims . 'He had shown me his home and we had pulled up outside. He told everyone we met he lived there and nobody suspected anything different. He had an answer for anything and everything.' During the hearing, Exeter Magistrates' Court heard that Giles targeted vulnerable woman that he met through online dating agencies by posing as a career man. Prosecutor Lindsey Baker said he took cash from a female victim he met through a dating agency who lives in east Devon. She said: 'He was targeting vulnerable women while pretending to be someone that he is not. Giles admitted seven counts of fraud and theft when he appeared at Exter Magistrates' Court. He is due to be sentenced at a later date . 'One lady parted with money because he said he was an airline pilot and was a safe bet for the money to be repaid. 'He met her through a dating agency. He misled into forming a relationship claiming to be someone he was not for his own gain.' Miss Baker said Giles also pocketed money he had ‘raised’ for the Children’s Hospice South West. He only handed over £65 from the £190 he had been donated from the sponsored cycle ride. He had also helped himself to the fuel provided by his company, a toilet firm, she said. The magistrates said the offences passed the custody threshold and ordered an all options report. Giles, who was bailed before sentencing, told the court he could not appear for sentencing in August because he was jetting off on holiday with his latest lady friend, who was in court with him.","Timothy Giles, 46, from Blunsdon, near Swindon, described as a 'ladies' man'

"John Emery, 36, was ordered to pay back just £154,412 within six months - that would see him avoid a further two and a half years in prison . A fraudster involved in a £60 million 'Wolf of Wall Street' worthless share scam has been ordered to pay back just £154,000. Jon Emery, 36, from Romford in Essex, was part of team of conmen who set up an elaborate scheme in Madrid to sell over-valued or even worthless shares in companies. The deception - similar to the type orchestrated by Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort - played by Leonardo di Caprio in the Hollywood film - allowed the fraudsters to live a life of luxury, with yachts, private jets and a huge portfolio of plush mansions across the world. Emery was convicted last year of conspiring to defraud investors by dishonestly making, causing or permitting false representations between March 2003 and August 2007 and was jailed for five years. But he was ordered to pay back just £154,412 within six months - that would see him avoid a further two and a half years in prison - following a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Southwark Crown Court. The scheme was the brainchild of Australian Jeffery Revell-Reade, 49, and Anthony May, 48, who spent the cash on a lavish lifestyle including private jets and yachts. Revell-Reade set up the business, under which sales entities operating from Madrid sold shares in US-listed companies on a fraudulent basis. It was deliberately set up in Madrid as it was outside the immediate control of UK authorities and the Financial Service Authority. Investors in the companies bought shares that had restrictions on their resale for a 12 month period. Following a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Southwark Crown Court (pictured), Emery was ordered to pay back £154,412 within six months . When the investors came to sell the shares after the expiry of this period, they often found that they were unable to do so as they were worthless, and that the shares were in shell companies or companies that were not operating at all. Revell-Reade and May recruited Emery, Daniel Gooding, 39, Gooding's sister, Emma Farmer, 40, Philip Morris, 38, Ian Hughes, 33 and Shaun Rumsey, 33, to reel in clients through hard-sell, cold-calling techniques. The six fraudsters telephoned potential buyers in the UK to trick them into investing in the worthless companies. The deception by the conmen was similar to the type orchestrated by Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort - played by Leonardo di Caprio in the Hollywood film . In June this year, Revell-Reade and May were jailed for nine years and six months and seven years six months respectively for conspiracy to defraud. Last year, their six salesmen were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for a total of 29 years. But their convictions were only revealed this year when reporting restrictions were lifted. The defendants were arrested between 2007 and 2009 and were charged in 2010. Last week, one of the six conmen, Hughes, was ordered to pay back £8,000 within six months or face a further five months in prison.","Jon Emery, 36, was part of a team of conmen who set up an elaborate scheme in Madrid to sell over-valued or even worthless shares in companies .

"A chef has created burgers that taste like human flesh using first hand accounts of cannibalism to get the flavour as close as possible. James Thomlinson designed his burger using gory testimonials describing the taste of human flesh, mixing veal, chicken livers, bone marrow and pork to make the macabre meal. The chef, working in partnership with fellow food creative Miss Cakehead, will be giving away the controversial cannibal burgers at a secret pop-up restaurant in east London to mark the forthcoming fifth series of hit TV show The Walking Dead. Scroll down for video . Culinary cannibalism: A chef has created burgers that taste like human flesh using first hand accounts of cannibalism to get the flavour as close as possible . Inspiration: James Thomlinson designed his burger using gory testimonials describing the taste of human flesh . 'My food is inspired by flavor combinations and fresh produce, so it was a little odd to be inspired by the words of cannibals instead,' Mr Thomlinson told website Horror Talk. The burgers were inspired by the season four finale of FOX TV series The Walking Dead, in which lead character Rick Grimes, played by British actor Andrew Lincoln, discovered human remains which looked to have been eaten by zombies, or 'Walkers'. Without having ever tasted human flesh, Mr Thomlinson, who runs culinary company London Mess, researched accounts of cannibalism - including by 1920s New York Times journalist William Seabrook who had persuaded a medical student to give him a chunk of flesh from a man who had died in an accident. Series: The burgers were inspired FOX TV series The Walking Dead, starring British actor Andrew Lincoln (right) as Rick Grimes . Ingredients: Mr Thomlinson mixed veal, chicken livers, bone marrow and pork to make the macabre meal . Sampling: One brave food tester takes a bite of Mr Thomlinson's controversial burger . In his book, Jungle Ways, he said: 'It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. 'It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal.' Another 'inspiration', infamous cannibal killer Issei Sagawa, a Japanese man who murdered a Dutch woman named Renée Hartevelt in 1981 had described human meat as being like tuna fish. Study: Without having ever tasted human flesh, Mr Thomlinson, who runs London Mess, researched accounts of cannibalism to see what the burgers should taste like . Macabre mix: The ingredients are mixed up ready to add to the burgers . He said it had 'melted in my mouth like raw tuna at a sushi restaurant.' Mr Thomlinson will offer up free burgers next Tuesday afternoon at his secret pop-up Terminus Tavern, which aims to recreate the show's creepy Terminus location. Fans will need to follow Mr Thomlinson on Twitter, and use the #terminustavern hashtag in order to find out the secret location. Season Five of The Walking Dead starts on Monday, October 13. Garnish: Cheese is added, perhaps to make the burgers a little more palatable to the squeamish .

"Sergio Aguero turns to his young son Benjamin and cracks a joke that only the Spanish-speaking members of his entourage and our interpreter can appreciate at first. So just how angry was Manuel Pellegrini after Manchester City’s shocking Champions League defeat at home to CSKA Moscow in midweek? ‘Even little Benjamin was angry,’ says Aguero, turning to the five-year-old who sits adoringly by his side. ‘And he told me I dived to try and win a penalty!’ Sergio Aguero continued his rich vein of form by scoring the winner in Manchester derby . But the striker could not prevent Man City slipping to Champions League defeat in midweek . It is less than 24 hours after City’s flagging European campaign sank to a new low and Aguero is putting on a brave face. Pellegrini’s team can still qualify for the knockout stage despite languishing bottom of Group E without a win from four games. And the man who will for ever be remembered for firing City to their first Premier League title in the most dramatic way imaginable is not giving up. For those supporters who might not be feeling so optimistic, Aguero has this message in response to the suggestion that he might be forced to go elsewhere in search of Champions League glory. ‘Not only will I stay the four years to make it eight here in total,’ says Aguero, who signed a new contract in August, ‘I’ll stay beyond that — until we win it.’ In the meantime, City fight on despite lengthening odds and growing criticism. They have lost three of their last four games in all competitions. Talk of Pellegrini carrying the can is dismissed with a polite smile, however. ‘It’s easy for everyone to suddenly decide it’s the man at the helm who is to blame, but I would say in situations like this, when we haven’t played well as a group, we are all in it together,’ says Aguero. Sergio Aguero raises a smile with store staff at his book signing session at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday . ‘The Champions League group table is not what we would have expected. We are not seeing the real City playing in Europe at the moment, but we still have these last two games when we hope the real City will turn up. ‘I guess that if we don’t turn it around, you would consider it to be the worst Champions League campaign the club have had. But I have spent a lot of years in football and am aware that these things can happen, you get bad runs. And I am also aware that you work your way out of those bad runs and come out the other side positively.’ Aguero’s own battle against adversity is documented in his autobiography Born to Rise, from an impoverished upbringing in the slums of Buenos Aires to a place among Argentina’s football royalty as the husband of Diego Maradona’s daughter Giannina (they separated when Benjamin was three). The events of May 13, 2012 feature prominently, ‘Agueroooooo’ scoring the second of City’s two injury-time goals against Queens Park Rangers to snatch the title from Manchester United and spark scenes of delirium at the Etihad as the hero disappeared beneath a pile of players. ‘You f*****g idiot, I love you big b*****ks,’ is revealed as Mario Balotelli’s contribution to the celebrations. Aguero signs a copy of his new book for a fan at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday . The iconic photo of Aguero twirling his shirt in the air hangs on his wall at home, and he has kept the boots he wore that day. The memories will return this evening when City face QPR at Loftus Road. ‘Whenever you mention the words “Queens Park Rangers” it always comes to mind,’ says the 26-year-old. ‘That will remain etched on my memory for ever. I’ve watched it back loads and loads of times, as you can imagine.’ It is the most significant of Aguero’s 87 goals in 137 games for City since he joined from Atletico Madrid for £38million in 2011. The latest, a winner in last Sunday’s Manchester derby, makes him the Premier League’s top scorer ahead of Chelsea’s Diego Costa. No wonder Pellegrini believes the striker is capable of challenging his best friend Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or. Aguero, however, accepts that he must match Messi and Ronaldo on the European stage before he can be considered a serious contender. ‘It’s great to be mentioned in the same breath as those players,’ he says. ‘But when you mention Messi and Ronaldo, for me those guys are from another planet in football terms. Maybe I need to put in some good performances in the Champions League in order to be considered seriously to win the Ballon d’Or. If we don’t do well in the next two games and get knocked out, the only way I’m going to win that award is by scoring 70 goals in the Premier League this season.’ Even in these darkest of days, you wouldn’t put anything past Aguero.

"Caught: John Donald Cody, aka Bobby Thompson, at a court hearing in May, after his arrest . The trial of a one-time fugitive starts today where he is being tried on charges of masterminding a $100 million multi-state fraud scam under the guise of helping Navy veterans. The defendant referred to as himself as Bobby Thompson throughout his years on the lam, but authorities later identified him as Harvard-trained lawyer and former military intelligence officer John Donald Cody, 67. He was arrested last year in Portland, Oregon, after two years on the run. It was later discovered he had been evading the FBI since 1987. He's charged with defrauding people who donated to a reputed charity for Navy veterans, the United States Navy Veterans Association based in Tampa, Florida. The alleged fraud spanned 41 states, including up to $2million in Ohio. Authorities said little, if any, of the money collected by the charity was used to benefit veterans. The defendant showered politicians, many of them Republicans, with political donations. His defense team had sought to force testimony by recipients to show his actions were legal, but a judge rejected the move last week. His attorney said any fraud involved solicitors, not his client. Authorities said the defendant used his VIP political connections to encourage donors to give to his charity. While on the run, investigators tracked him through Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington and West Virginia.

During his law career in Arizona, he became the subject of an investigation over claims he was stealing money from his clients but Cody skipped town before he could be apprehended and since 1987 has been a fugitive from the FBI. According to a federal warrant, dated May 4, 1987, out of the Eastern . District of Virginia, Cody is charged with interstate transportation of . fraudulent traveler’s checks from probate estates’ bank accounts, false . statements to an investment brokerage firm, and false statements on loan . applications.

Once again, he abandoned his identity and set off on a cross-country . journey using numerous aliases to evade police. From June 2010 to May 2012, investigators believe he hid out in Massachusetts, Arizona, New . Mexico Rhode Island, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Washington and ultimately Portland, Oregon - where he was finally caught.

Investigators . also discovered his storage unit, where he had suitcases full of cash, . totaling $981,000 - a far cry from the $100 million that is unaccounted . for. 'This was one of our most challenging fugitive . investigations to date,' U.S. Marshal Peter Elliott stated at the time of Thompson's arrest, according to a statement. 'Our investigators followed up leads all over the nation. Their diligence and dedication directly led to the arrest in Portland. I am . proud of everyone that worked on this investigation and their efforts have . brought this scam artist to justice,' he added. But the elusive suspect remained shrouded in mystery even after his arrest. He wanted only to be referred to as Mr X, leaving investigators baffled as to his true identity. He also showed off his legal prowess in the courtroom, daring officials to try and discover who he truly was. Elliott, the agent who was key in apprehending Cody, began to research the man - conducting simple Google searches of cold case fraud fugitives and looking for any connections to the man that had been arrested. He spotted the FBI photos of Cody, from the 1987 charges, and noticed a physical resemblance to Thompson, in addition to striking similarities in their MOs. A positive fingerprint match confirmed that Thompson was in fact Cody. The 65-year-old faces the 1987 charges, combined with the 2010 charges from the charity scam and is also wanted for questioning in connection with a FBI espionage investigation. The FBI has not yet provided more . details into the espionage case but it's believed Cody's former career as an intelligence officer could be involved. Additionally, he had lived in Sierra Vista, Arizona  - which is located next to Fort Huachuca, a major intelligence hub for the military.","Trial of accused conman and fugitive John Donald Cody, who has been wanted by the FBI since 1987, starts today .
Cody practiced law in Sierra Vista, Arizona in the 1980s, when he was accused of stealing money from his clients but he fell off the grid .
Under the alias of Bobby Thompson, he operated a fraudulent charity, raising over $100 million and rubbing shoulders with D.C. power players .

"More than 60 Cleveland police officers involved in an unauthorized car chase in which 137 shots were fired, killing two unarmed people, have been suspended. A panicked driver and passenger fleeing police were shot dead in November following a 23-minute pursuit in which more than 60 cruisers sped through residential neighborhoods. While only two police cars are allowed to . give chase, dozens of cruisers joined the pursuit . because they believed the two victims were armed. Tragic: Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30, were shot dead by police in November following a 23-minute chase through Cleveland. The pair had fled a traffic stop and were speeding, but were unarmed . Police Chief Mark McGrath announced today that 63 . of the 104 officers involved will be suspended for up to 10 days, while . 13 directly involved in the shooting could face criminal charges. The police union said it would appeal the decision. Last year's shocking chase began about 10.30pm when an officer thought he heard a gunshot from a car speeding past the police and courts complex in downtown Cleveland. Jumping into his patrol car and radioing for help, the officer pursued driver Timothy Russell, 43, and passenger, Malissa Williams, 30, who allegedly refused to stop. Police don't know why the pair didn't pull over, but it is believed they panicked. About 60 cars joined the November 2 pursuit 'without the sector supervisor’s knowledge or permission', according to a state investigation of the incident. Only two police vehicles are allowed to be involved in a chase. During the pursuit, which reached speeds of 125mph, many of the officers had reportedly not followed instructions about switching their radios to the main communications channel and did not hear orders to discontinue the chase. Officers claimed they joined the chase because they . thought Russell and Williams were shooting at police and believed 'a . police officer was in trouble.' The chase went through crowded residential neighborhoods, then reversed course, heading east onto the busy I-90 and through parts of Cleveland and East Cleveland. Victims: This is the bullet-riddled car of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30, after November's fatal police chase . Frightening: Police opened fire on the pair outside Heritage Middle School in East Cleveland in November . As the chase ended near a school, Russell allegedly rammed a patrol car and drove toward an officer on foot. That's when gunfire erupted, with 13 officers firing 137 rounds at the car. Russell was shot 23 times and Williams . 24 times in what civil rights groups described as an 'execution-style . killing'. The pair was unarmed. While officers believed shots had been . fired from Russell's car, investigators now say it was the sound of the . 1979 Chevy backfiring. Russell . had a criminal record including convictions for receiving stolen . property and robbery, while Williams had convictions for drug-related . charges and attempted abduction. McGrath said, following an 11-month investigation, 63 officers will be suspended totaling 178 days. The longest suspension is 10 days. He said the officers are being disciplined because of excessive speed, insubordination and failure to request permission to join the pursuit. 'Under a stressful, tactful situation, it’s more important to follow your rules and procedures than ever before, or you may have some type of chaos or problems,' McGrath said, according to cleveland.com. Discipline: Cleveland authorities including (left to right) Director of Public Safety, Martin L. Flask, Police Chief, Michael McGrath, and Mayor Frank Jackson, announced 63 officers have been suspended for breaking rules during a deadly chase last November . Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said county prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring criminal charges against the 13 officers directly involved in the shooting. He said 'justice was not delayed for the victims', even though the investigation had taken 11 months. He said his office was 'not throwing officers under the bus for political reasons and we're not covering anything up.' However, Jeff Follmer, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association, said the union will challenge the suspensions through arbitration. 'The suspensions are not consistent with what other officers received after similar chases,' Follmer said, according to cleveland.com. 'I think the department is responding to public pressure in this case.' Nine Cleveland police department . supervisors were suspended, two demoted and one fired due to the way . they handled the incident, McGrath said. Last year's shoot-out sparked outrage within Cleveland's black community who argued the pursuit was racially-motivated and violated the victims' civil rights. 'The people who live in the inner city . in Cleveland, the black people in this community, feel that this was an . assault on the whole community,'  Paul Cristallo, an attorney representing Russell's family, said at the time of the shooting. After the families of both victims and civil rights groups demanded a federal investigation, the U.S. Justice Department launched a review of Cleveland police policies in March over the possible use of excessive force by officers.","Cleveland police have suspended 63 officers involved in fatal car chase in November .

"A 96-year-old Illinois man wrote a song about his wife of 75 years and when he sent the heart-wrenching ode into a singer-songwriter contest, they decided to produce it for him. When Fred Stobaugh talks about his wife Lorraine now, it’s hard for him to hold back tears after the life they led together he says was ‘like a dream.’ After she died, he was sitting alone in the Peoria home they once shared and for the first time in his life he decided to write a song. 'She was the prettiest girl ya ever saw': 96-year-old Fred Stobaugh lost his wife of 75 years and wrote a song about her . ‘It just fit her,’ Stobaugh said. After penning ‘Oh Sweet Lorraine,’ he saw an ad in the local paper for a singer-songwriter contest. Though he was neither of those things, he decided to send in the ballad. ‘I’ll just send a letter,’ he remembered thinking, though the contest rules asked for a video of the songwriter entrants actually performing their song. ‘Send it all in. Never thinking I’d get an answer or nothing.’ Heartbreaking: Stobauch says thinking back on his 75 years with Lorraine is like a dream and he still can't believe she's gone . 'It meant so much to him': Jacob Colgan's company Green Shoe Studio received entry and were so touched they decide to record it . ‘Oh Sweet LorraineI wish we could doThe good times All over again . Oh sweet LorraineLife only goes aroundOnceBut never again . Oh sweet LorraineI wish we could doAll the good times all overAgain . My memories will always Linger onOh sweet LorraineThe memories willAlways linger on . But when the contest runner received just one giant manila envelope in a sea of emailed entries, they took notice. They never expected anything quite like what Fred sent them. ‘In fact,’ said Jacob Colgan of Green Shoe Studio, who ran the contest, ‘on the actual envelope itself, it says “I don’t sing, I would scare people, haha!”’ Nonetheless, the emotion behind the lyrics was enough convince the studio they wanted the song. When Stobaugh talks about his late wife, he gets a faraway look in his eyes. ‘She was the prettiest girl ya ever saw,’ he said. ‘She gave me 75 years of her.’ Jacob decided his company would have ‘Sweet Lorraine professionally recorded. When Colgan contacted Stobaugh to tell him the good news, the bereaved husband welled up with tears. ‘Why would you want to do that?’ he wondered. But to Colgan and his crew at Green Shoe, the answer was obvious. ‘Your song touched us,’ Colgan told Stobaugh. They set to work, collaborating with Stobaugh to craft a that would do Lorraine justice. When the song was finished, though, Colgan had reservations about letting Stobaugh have a listen. Producing: Stobaugh worked with the folks at Green Shoe Studio to perfect his song . ‘Because it meant so much to him it meant so much to me,’ Colgan said. ‘I was actually nervous.’ He need not have been. Stobaugh could barely hold back his emotion as the songs final refrain, ‘the memories will always linger on,’ finished playing. ‘It’s wonderful,’ he said. ‘Just wonderful.’ Stobaugh's touching dedication to his wife of over seven decades is available on iTunes. Touching: Fred Stobaugh has become the oldest artist to have a U.S. chart hit with a song about his late wife .",Fred Stobaugh never thought he'd get an answer but the contest runners could not ignore his touching ode .
"It is easy to imagine that these vividly-coloured damselflies are on a romantic insect date as they look as if they are holding hands. The adorable images were taken by a photographer as he walked across a flood plain early one morning. Photographer Alberto Ghizzi Panizza, 38 from Palma, Italy, took the photos of the big-eyed insects near the River Po in the Po Valley. These vividly coloured damselflies show they are best buddies, looking like they're holding hands as they cuddle up on a flower.  Photographer Alberto Ghizzi Panizza, 38, spotted the insects in the dew as he walked across a flood plain early one morning . Adult damselflies (pictured) eat flies, mosquitoes, and other small insects, while some larger tropical species have been known to feast on spiders. Damselflies rest their wings together, on both sides of their bodies, while dragonflies have wings that are spread apart, even while resting . Like all odonates, damselflies have a very interesting breeding system. Before mating, males and females spend some considerable time in physical contact with one another, which scientists believe is to assess their potential mate. Once they are pretty sure they have made the right choice, the male grabs hold of the thorax of the female and with a set of 'thumbs' at the end of his abdomen, to see if they fit the 'sockets' of the female. The female decides how well the thumbs fit and therefore if the male is a good match for her. If she accepts the male, mating occurs, but if not she goes in search of another partner. Struck by their cute poses, he took shots of the damselflies shortly after dawn as they rested on wild flowers. Mr Panizza said: 'I found these cute insects' expressions very funny. 'The morning was cold and wet but they seemed to like being perched on the branches and flowers. 'The funniest photo is where they seem to hold hands and says to the observer: 'This is my partner'. 'I like to call this shot 'Meet Sally', inspired by the famous film When Harry Met Sally. Struck by their cute poses, he took the shots shortly after dawn as they rested on wild flowers. The insects measure approximately three centimetres long and have large eyes of around one millimetere . The look of love? Photographer Mr Panizza said the damselflies have 'lovely big eyes and it is sweet to think they are two close friends' 'They have such lovely big eyes and it is sweet to think that they are two close friends.' Mr Panizza said butterfly numbers in the Po Valley area have dropped this year, but damselflies have risen.

"More than 100 children have been rescued from the clutches of pedophiles after a massive U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency raid. The ground-breaking investigation - named 'Operation Sunflower' - was executed America-wide between November 2012 and the first week of December, and resulted in 245 arrests. A total of 123 sexually exploited children were identified by ICE agents working with Homeland Security Investigations by targeting people who own, trade and produce child pornography. Of those, 44 victims were rescued from their abusers and another 55 were saved from being exploited by people they knew outside the home. Another 24 victims were identified as adults who were preyed on as children. Scroll down for video . Abuse: On November 15, special agents arrested Stephen Keating, 52, of Jesup, Georgia, pictured, and rescued three abused children, two girls ages 2 and 6 and a 12-year-old boy . 'The sexual abuse of young children, . often at the hands of people they trust, is a particular wrong,' said . ICE Director John Morton. 'Whenever . our investigations reveal the production and distribution of new child . pornography online, we will do everything we can to rescue the victim . and prosecute the abuser even if it takes us years or around the world . to do it. A relentless fight against child exploitation is the only . answer.' Of the 123 . victims, five were under the age of 3; nine were ages 4 to 6; 21 were . ages 7 to 9; 11 were ages 10 to 12; 38 were ages 13 to 15; and 15 were . ages 16 to 17. The remaining victims are now adults. Seventy were female and 53 were male. Authorities arrested 245 people during the operation, which spanned 19 states. The arrests include Bradley Vaine, 26, of Fresno, California, a convicted sex offender who has been been . charged with distribution and possession of child pornography after ICE . agents rescued a 7-year-old mentally disabled girl from his home. According to court records, Vaine is in federal custody and has not yet entered a plea. Arrested: Mickell Close, pictured left, of Ohio, and Jeremy Michael Edwards, right, were arrested last year and for child pornography offenses . On . November 15, special agents arrested Stephen Keating, 52, of . Jesup, Georgia, and rescued three abused children, two girls . ages 2 and 6 and a 12-year-old boy, after the HSI's Cyber Crimes Center tracked an internet service connection used to upload child abuse material to the Jesup residence. In Columbus, Ohio, Mickell Close, 31, was arrested after he . secretly videotaped three girls between the ages of 7 and 9 years in a . bathroom in order to create still photos and videos that he used to . trade on the internet for other images of child pornography. In . November, HSI agents identified a 6-year-old victim, which led to the . arrest of 51-year-old Gerald Roberts of Pageland, South Carolina, who . allegedly abused the girl to produce child porn. Roberts has pleaded not guilty to federal charges. Michael . Wioskowski, 54, of Eastpointe, Michigan, was arrested on November 27 on . charges of possession and receipt of child pornography after . investigators found a video in his home of two underage girls showering . at his house. Wioskowski, a court security officer and former reserve . police officer, hasn't entered a plea yet. Another two men were arrested in California - Samuel Gueydan, 48, of Clovis, and Michael Lindsay, 53, of San Francisco. Child abuse: Samuel Gueydan, 48, of Clovis, pictured left, and Ann Marie Piper, right, are among those arrested . The . probe was named in honor of an 11-year-old girl rescued in Kansas a . year ago thanks to a sunflower-shaped road sign in the background of . images showing her being abused. ICE . special agent James T. Hayes Jnr. told MailOnline that the agency had . had a lot of success in identifying and tracking down victims by . engaging the public, through Facebook and Twitter as well as local news . stories and broadcasts. However, he said it was still an 'incredibly difficult' process, given the nature of the photos they have to rely on. 'It . is incredibly difficult because often the images we have are not . suitable for public viewing,' he said. 'Also, most of them are taken in . cheap hotel rooms or dark places, which are hard to identify even if we . know the victims.' Hayes added that agents were often working to find victims from a single image. He . said some of the children rescued are being looked after by foster . families while those who suffered abuse at the hands of relatives other . than their parents or people they know in the community are getting . support from non-profits such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Still on the loose: ICE agents are still appealing for help in identifying these John and Jane Does, pictured left and right . 'Organizations such as NCMEC do a fantastic job to help victims and their families recover,' Hayes said. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children CEO John Ryan also applauded ICE for their worldwide work in identifying the victims of child sexual exploitation and for helping to remove them from extremely dangerous situations. 'We know that there's more work to be done. Anyone could know these victims, not knowing that they're being harmed,' he said. 'They could be your neighbors' children, your child's classmate, or even your own child. We thank Director Morton and everyone at ICE for their strong commitment to rescuing the most vulnerable of victims.' Morton also announced arrest warrants for two unidentified adults charged in Los Angeles with molesting a girl who appeared in online photos to be about 13 when she was abused. The man and woman were identified only as 'John Doe' and 'Jane Doe' and authorities believe they may have been in the San Fernando Valley area north of Los Angeles when they abused the girl. Operation Sunflower is named after the first case conducted a year ago under ICE's Victim Identification Program. The Sunflower case began in November 2011 when Danish law enforcement officials shared with HSI their discovery of material and posts on a chat board indicating that a 16-year-old boy was planning to rape an 11-year-old girl. The suspect was soliciting advice on a pedophile board and posting images of the girl. One image held a clue that proved to be invaluable to investigators: a yellow road sign visible from the window of a moving vehicle. The road sign depicted a sunflower graphic that was unique to the State of Kansas. For days, HSI special agents drove in pairs along Kansas highways, seeking a comparison between the images in the photos and the actual locations. Just 13 days after receiving the material, and by combining sophisticated photo forensics with traditional law enforcement methods, special agents located the residence in a small Kansas town. These efforts made it possible for law enforcement to intervene and rescue the girl before she suffered further abuse. Operation Sunflower commemorates the one-year anniversary of this first successful rescue under the new program.","A total of 123 sexually exploited children were identified by ICE agents under Operation Sunflower in November and December 2012 .

"She was an attractive blonde 40-something woman, but now acid attack victim Patricia Lefranc describes herself as a 'monster'. The mother-of-three who was repeatedly splashed with sulphuric acid by her spurned lover Richard Remes in 2009 has publicly spoken for the first time of the horrific attack that has left her physically and emotionally scarred for life. During the incident her nose and eyelids were melted away and she also lost a finger, sight in one eye and hearing in one ear. She also came close to death, as the corrosive substance nearly burned through her heart and lungs, but incredibly her breast implants stopped further deterioration. Patricia Lefranc with daughter Marie after Richard Remes was found guilty of attempted murder . After enduring 86 operations and with a further 30 skin-grafts to go the 48-year-old remains in chronic pain but says the thought of seeing her children one day happy and married keeps her going. Speaking to Closer magazine about her horrific ordeal following her attacker's sentencing on March 22, Patricia said: 'He turned me into a monster. Some days, I just cry. 'People stare at me and mock my appearance. It's a life sentence for me, so why shouldn't it be for him.' Patricia, who previously worked as a janitor first met Remes, 57, while they were living in the same apartment block in Brussels in December 2008. Before and after: Patricia Lefranc was seriously disfigured in the attack carried out by her ex-lover . Richard Remes insisted that he didn't realise the sulphuric acid would have such devastating consequences . After a brief conversation in the lift he asked her out for a drink and more dates ensued. But . after several meetings she was devastated to learn that Remes was . married with five children and called off the relationship. She added: 'I was shocked and said we should just be friends - we hadn't slept together and I wasn't about to break up a family.' But Remes was determined for the relationship to continue and the pair soon started meeting twice a week and Patricia's flat. At one point his wife found out about the tryst and threw him out but Remes returned to his family while continuing to meet with Patricia in secret. It was only on a holiday in Egypt in 2009 that Patricia became aware of Remes's dark streak when he started talking about violent films that involved torturing women and when they returned home she refused to see him again. Brave: Patricia Lefranc (right) with her lawyer Daniel Spreutels (left) said her former lover 'destroyed her life' It was this event that triggered his increasingly obsessive behaviour and he was even spotted by locals wearing a T-shirt printed with a picture of Patricia's face and the words 'I love you' shortly after. She alerted the police, but they told her to move house and four-days later she was visited at her flat on suburbs of Molenbeek-Saint-Jean by Remes who was disguised as a parcel courier. As soon as she answered the buzzer he splashed a container of acid all over her face and upper body. She said she was convinced she would die, but neighbours in a nearby building heard her screams and managed to get her to the burns unit of a nearby hospital, where she lay in a coma for three months. Her children, Laetitia now 28, Marie, 18, and Joey, 13, kept a vigil at her beside and Remes was arrested thanks to an eye witness. Speaking on the first day of his trial for attempted murder in Belgium last month, Patricia said she . was 'determined to look him in the eye and show the jury what he has . done to me'. She added: 'I . hope to convince the court that he did indeed want to murder me.' And she succeeded as Remes was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempted murder. During the trial he insisted that he didn't realise the sulphuric acid he sprayed would have such devastating consequences. In court Patricia said her son’s school . friends now regularly mock her appearance, adding: 'Remes has also . ruined my life as a woman. Who once to deal with the monster that he . made me?

"Erin Kathleen Queen, 27, had sex with her 17-year-old student and gave him vodka in 2012 . A 27-year-old teacher from Sand Springs, Oklahoma who was charged with raping her 17-year-old student back in 2012 was given just a 'slap on the wrist last week.'Erin Kathleen Queen's charges were dismissed last week and she was given three years probation, a $600 fine, and an order to surrender her teacher's license after confessing to another crime related contributing to delinquency of a minor.Shasta and Adam Belty, the boy's parents, are outraged and want to rally to change Oklahoma State law, reports Tulsa World. Queen, a former English teacher at Charles Page High School was arrested on March 17 in 2012 after the 17-year-old's parents were worried about where their son might be.After probing him, the boy's parents discovered he was at the Candlewood Suites near 71st Street and Mingo Road at 5:30 AM.Belty said she discovered the inappropriate relationship with one phone call to her son. 'He was reluctant to tell me but then he told me he was with Ms. Queen, Erin Queen. And I thought that name sounds familiar. And he said mom, 'It's my 5th hour English teacher.'. And I died as a parent, said Belty, who is perplexed as to how the woman who raped her son is allowed to roam free.Back in 2012 Queen was booked into Tulsa Jail on a first degree rape complaint and she was later charged with second degree rape and a misdemeanor charge causing delinquency of a minor. The misdemeanor was related to allegations that she'd given the boy vodka. Queen was a teacher at Charles Page High School where she met her 17-year-old victim . Queen's charges were dismissed when she pleaded guilty to a new case contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 'It’s very frustrating to us that she basically got a slap on the wrist,' Shasta Belty told Tulsa World. 'I cussed. I cried. I totally disagreed with it,' Shasta said. '(Prosecutor Amanda Self) was under the impression that we were OK with a conviction as long as she never taught again. Well, we were OK with a conviction – of the second-degree rape … or something that represents the sexual misconduct.' According to Title 21, Section 1115 of the Oklahoma Statutes, sex may be considered rape if '...the victim is at least sixteen (16) years of age and is less than eighteen (18) years of age and is a student, or under the legal custody or supervision of any public or private elementary or secondary school, junior high or high school, or public vocational school, and engages in sexual intercourse with a person who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and is an employee of the same school system.' The Beltys believe that Queen was given a lighter treatment because she is a woman, reports ABC. The teacher and the boy had sex at Candlewood Suites near 71st Street and Mingo Road at 5:30 AM .","Erin Kathleen Queen, 27 at the time of the crime, was arrested on March 17 2012 after she raped her 17-year-old student .

"The Government is set to force manufacturers to add folic acid to white bread in a bid to cut the number of babies being born with spinal defects. Health minister Earl Howe yesterday gave the clearest indication yet that action will be taken, following a survey into the country’s diet and nutrition. Making folic acid - a B9 vitamin - a compulsory ingredient in bread could prevent at least 300 babies a year developing spina bifida and other birth defects, it is estimated. The Government is set to force manufacturers to add folic acid to bread in a bid to cut the number of babies being born with spinal defects . Debate has raged for more than two decades over whether the Government should introduce compulsory fortification of flour, but there has been growing pressure from scientists and nutritionists to tackle the issue. Experts have said flour fortification with folic acid would be one of the single most effective public health measures the UK could take. Earl Howe said the Government would announce its decision in the ‘next few days’ but hinted that ministers would make fortification mandatory. Debate has raged for more than two decades over whether the Government should introduce compulsory fortification of flour . Shadow . health minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath told him at question time in . the House of Lords ‘It is clear and the Government has already briefed . out that it is going to agree to this. ‘We . are going off on a very long Easter recess and joy would be unconfined . if you told us now what the Government has agreed to. Why don’t you come . clean on it?’ Lord Howe replied: ‘Because I have been told I can’t.’ Women wanting to start a family, and in early pregnancy, are advised to take folic acid supplements to prevent birth defects . Women wanting to start a family, and in early pregnancy, are advised to take folic acid supplements to prevent birth defects, but uptake is low. Fewer than one in three women do so before becoming pregnant, according to research earlier this year, and there is a lack of the vitamin in their diets. The Food Standards Agency has advised the Government that mandatory fortification would prevent most cases of disabilities such as spina bifida. There have been concerns that such a policy might promote ‘mass medication’ of the population, and it could be harmful to some. It may mask a vitamin B12 deficiency . in the elderly, which can seriously damage the nervous system, and it . may be linked to bowel cancer. Lord . Howe said the Government had been waiting for information on the . ‘folate status’ of the population from the national diet and nutrition . survey, which would report how much B9 people absorb naturally. He . said the results of the survey had been ‘significantly delayed’ but the . Government would press ahead and make a decision on the issue by . Easter. Labour’s Lord Rooker, a former minister and chairman of the Food Standards Agency and a leading supporter of compulsory fortification, urged the Government not to wait any longer. He said ‘At the present time the congenital anomaly register shows that on average in England and Wales there are 13 pregnancies terminated every week due to neural tube defects and three live births with spina bifida and other conditions, two thirds of which tragedies could be avoided by fortification.’ He said the United States had fortified flour since 1998. Lord Howe said ‘It is right that the . Government balances both the risks and the benefits of a policy that . would see the mandatory fortification of a staple food and I think that . is a responsible course to take.’ Fewer than one in three women  take folic acid supplements before becoming pregnant, according to research, and there is a lack of the vitamin in their diets . He added: ‘It is worth us remembering that no other country in the European Union has taken the decision to fortify flour with folic acid. ‘We need to do this evaluating the risks and benefits using the most up-to-date data we can get.’ But Lord Patel, an independent crossbench peer and retired obstetrician, told him: ‘You said no other European country has adopted fortification. ‘Will you agree that none of the other European countries have the same incidence of neural tube defect as we in the United Kingdom have. It is far, far greater in the UK?’ Lord Howe said that was an issue that would be ‘weighed up.’ Charities including the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (ASBAH) have called on the Government to take swift action.","Health minster Earl Howe hints flour fortification will be made mandatory .

"Warning: Pregnant women who eat too much - or too little - risk having a fat child, scientists have warned . Pregnant women who eat too much – or too little – risk having a fat child, scientists have warned. Babies of women who do not gain enough weight are as likely to be obese as those whose mothers gain too much, they said. And surprisingly, the risk is higher for women who are a normal weight at the start of their pregnancy. With obesity taking up to nine years of a person’s life and sowing the seeds of a host of health problems, British experts said it is imperative that women are given clear advice on how much weight to gain during pregnancy. The U.S. researchers tracked the health of more than 4,000 pregnant women and their children. Overall, some 20.4 per cent of boys and girls born to women who put more weight than advised in pregnancy were overweight or obese between the ages of two and five. This is similar to the 19.5 per cent of children born to women who gained less than the recommended amount of weight – and more than the 14.5 per cent among women who stuck to the guidelines. The figures for women who went into pregnancy at a healthy weight were particularly striking, the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology reports. A slim woman who ate too much in pregnancy was 80 per cent more likely to have a fat child than one who ate the right amount. And one who ate too little was 63 per cent more likely to have a child who was overweight or obese. The finding that the children of slim women were particularly affected suggests that genes cannot be completely blamed for the effect. Risk: The risk is higher for women who are a normal weight when they become pregnant, they said (file picture) Instead, it is thought that conditions in the womb programme the unborn child’s metabolism for years to come. For instance, there could be long-lasting consequences for the unborn child’s appetite control or storage of fat. Researcher Dr Monique Hedderson, of the Kaiser Permanante Division of Research in Oakland California, said: ‘Gaining either too little or too much weight in pregnancy may permanently affect mechanisms that manage energy balance and metabolism in the offspring, such as appetite control and energy expenditure. ‘This could potentially have long-term effects on the child’s subsequent growth and weight.’ Dr Geeta Nargund, of the Create fertility clinic in central London, said the study adds to increasing evidence that conditions in the womb can have long-lasting effects on the child’s health. She added that it emphasises the importance of providing advice to women before and during pregnancy. Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation, said it is imperative that the UK follows the US’s lead in issuing clear advice on weight gain. The NHS simply advises that weight gain in pregnancy ‘varies greatly’, with most women putting on between 22lb to 26lb. In contrast, the U.S. advises how much women of different weights should gain. For instance, a woman who goes into pregnancy at a normal, healthy weight, should put on 11 to 20lb.","Pregnant women who eat too much, or too little, risk having a fat child .

"It is a question to challenge some of the finest legal minds in the land: when is a cake not a cake, and a biscuit not a biscuit? Two judges solved it today by letting their taste buds decide – after testing a plateful of Snowballs, a chocolate and coconut covered marshmallow treat that has been popular with the sweet-toothed masses for generations. Verdict: Snowballs are cakes. And that means the snack’s manufacturers are in line for a £2.8million rebate from the taxman after a lengthy legal wrangle over whether Snowballs should attract VAT (which biscuits do) or be zero-rated (as a cake). Two brand-leading confectioner companies had each been ordered to pay the tax after HM Revenue and Customs insisted Snowballs do not enjoy the same exemption from VAT as tea cakes. Cake or biscuit: The makers of the celebrated Snowball (being enjoyed by Emily Jack) will enjoy a £2.8m VAT rebate after judges decided it was a cake - based on its taste, texture and when it's eaten . Tunnock’s and Lees of Scotland refused to accept that their bite-size classics - devoured in their millions each year by Britons - are ‘standard- rated confectionery’. So the sticky issue was decided instead by the might of a First-Tier Tax Tribunal - and the combined culinary wisdom of judges Anne Scott and Peter Sheppard. At a hearing in Edinburgh, they were presented with a plate of Jaffa Cakes, Bakewell tarts, tea cakes, Lees Snowballs, Waitrose meringues and mini jam snow cakes as they deliberated. Later they also sampled some Tunnock’s snowballs. ‘We found that the plate looked like a plate of cakes,’ Judge Scott observed dryly. ‘We tasted all of them, in moderation, either at the hearing or thereafter. A Snowball looks like a cake. It is not out of place on a plate full of cakes. A Snowball has the mouth feel of a cake. Everyone agreed that a Snowball is certainly not a biscuit.’ Comparison: The judges ate Snowballs, bakewell tarts, teacakes and other sweet treats and said it had the characteristics of a cake not a biscuit . Through further explanation, it immediately became clear that the landmark decision was not reached without considerable research. ‘Most people would want to enjoy a beverage of some sort whilst consuming a Snowball,’ she concluded. ‘It would often be eaten in a similar way and on similar occasions to cakes - for example to celebrate a birthday in an office.’ The tribunal was ‘wholly agreed’ that a Snowball is a ‘confection to be savoured but not whilst walking around or, for example, in the street’. ‘Most people would prefer to be sitting when eating a Snowball and possibly, or preferably... with a plate, a napkin or a piece of paper or even just a bare table so that the pieces of coconut which fly off do not create a great deal of mess. Although by no means everyone considers a Snowball to be a cake, we find that these facts, in particular, mean that a Snowball has sufficient characteristics to be characterized as a cake.’ The ruling comes after a similar decision recently that Jaffa Cakes should be VAT free. Lees and Tunnocks both insisted their snowballs should also be exempt - and were appealing against a 2012 decision that rejected their claims for a £2.8million rebate. Philip Simpson, for the companies, contended that the titbit should be VAT exempt. But Luke Connell, for HMRC, insisted the taxman should be allowed to take his bite. After digesting all the evidence, the tribunal ruled that the appeals should succeed.","Court battle was between Tunnocks and Lees and HMRC over tax bill .

"President Barack Obama said during a Thursday press conference that his administration doesn't have a plan worked out yet for defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Syria. 'I don't want to put the cart before the horse,' Obama said at the White House. 'We don't have a strategy yet.' 'We need to make sure we've got clear plans, and we're developing them,' he said. 'At that point I will consult with Congress and make sure their voices are heard.' 'What I've seen in some of the news reports suggests that folks are getting a little further ahead of where we're at than we currently are,' Obama cautioned. Scroll down for video . No strategy: Obama said Thursday that he hasn't settled on a direction in Syria as ISIS solidifies its bases there despite losing ground to US airstrikes in Iraq . Taking over: This undated image posted on a militant website shows fighters from ISIS marching in Raqqa, Syria . He mentioned four times his intention to seek advice from Capitol Hill before deploying more military assets in the Middle East, likely in response to concerns from members of the House and Senate that he was unconstitutionally freezing them out. But 'there's no point in me asking for action on the part of Congress,' Obama told the press corps, 'before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done.' The president, clad in a muted tan suit that drew as many comments on Twitter as the content of his remarks, emphasized that he is mainly focused now on pushing back ISIS in Iraq, where American military jets and drones have executed more than 100 airstrikes this month. But he boasted that America could put down the ISIS threat in Syria – at least in the short-term – at a time of his choosing. 'As I've said before – I think I said it in the previous press conference,' he said, 'our military is the best in the world.' 'We can rout ISIL on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily, he insisted, referring to ISIS by the White House's preferred name. 'But then as soon as we leave, the same problems come back again.' 'My priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that ISIL made in Iraq are rolled back and that Iraq has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself,' the president said. The vicious terrorist group has its most comfortable stronghold in Syria, leaving open the possibility that defeating them in Iraq could leave them more entrenched one nation to the west – in a country that shares a hotly contested border with Israel, a key U.S. ally. The administration has green-lighted surveillance flyovers across portions of eastern Syria in recent days to assess ISIS's numbers and evaluate potential military targets. White House aides have leaked to a variety of news outlets the idea that Obama is considering striking ISIS in Syria despite objections from the country's dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Syria is in general disarray as rebels from a range of moderate and militant Islamist groups have fought a civil war for more than three years with the aim of taking over the country. ISIS is among the groups that oppose Assad. Crushing them could strengthen the barbaric regime in Damascus, and vice versa. Horror: Video emerged Thursday showing ISIS militants marching 250 Syrian soldiers, lad only in their underwear, to a mass execution near the key northern Tabqa air base . Gathering strength: ISIS captured this munitions warehouse in Raqqa, Syria on Sunday . Dealing with that conundrum 'is going to be a long-term project,' Obama said. 'It's going to require us to stabilize Syria in some fashion' but identifying moderate Sunni Muslims who can govern the country. Expanding his Iraq campaign to a second country, though, could highlight his administration's failure to intervene a year ago after Obama warned Assad about the consequences of crossing a 'red line' by deploying chemical weapons against the rebels. He said Thursday that he has directed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff 'to prepare a range of options' for him. A Pew Research Center poll released Thursday found that 54 per cent of Americans believe Obama isn't tough enough with foreign adversaries. They rank ISIS among the top foreign threats to the U.S. 'While overall his job rating has remained stable this year (currently 42% approve, 50% disapprove),' Pew reported, 'he gets his best rating for handling race relations and more negative ratings for handling policy toward Israel, the situation in Russia and Ukraine, and Iraq.' Nearly half of Americans, 48 per cent, told pollsters that America 'is a less important and powerful world leader than it was 10 years ago,' according to Pew. Just 15 per cent said its importance globally has grown during the Obama administration, a number that is near a 40-year low.","Questions loom about what the White House will do to combat ISIS terrorists in Syria even it the US defeats them in Iraq .

"Russia has conducted an exercise designed to test the transport of nuclear weapons near Europe, according to US officials. The drill was the largest of its kind in two decades and was carried out as part of larger military drills last month. It is said to have sparked concern inside the Pentagon and US European Command but a Defence spokesman played the incident down. Worrying: Russian nuclear forces have carried out their biggest tactical exercise in two decades (file picture) Lt Col Wesley P Miller said that there is 'nothing to be . concerned about because the Russians, like us, have routine exercises . and inspections.' But a US source said that the scale of the exercise and the number of weapons being moved was worrying, according to the Washington Free Beacon. The official added that it comes at a time when the US nuclear complex is in urgent need of an upgrade with defence cuts looming. But Lt Col Miller said that the US government is still committed to providing an effective nuclear deterrent. The drills took place between February 17 and 21 and follow an increase in strategic bomber flights by Russian forces off the US Pacific island of Guam and simulated bombing runs against Alaska and California last June and July. No discussions: US Secretary of State John Kerry, pictured, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in berlin following the exercise but are said not to have discussed the matter . The exercise is said to have involved the secretive 12th Main Directorate of the Defence Ministry, known as 12th GUMO. Although specific details of what took place are classified, officials say that a large number of nuclear weapons were taken from munitions depots to storage sites. It is not known whether the Russians notified other forces of their strategic exercises or how the weapons were moved. But according to the Russian Defence Policy website the drills began with orders for forces to go to 'higher states of combat readiness and carry out combat training missions'. Russian army General Valery Gerasima said that the exercise involved several hundred pieces of equipment, 7,000 troops, and 48 aircraft. The drills also involved moving forces to exercise areas far from normal deployment locations. Soldiers are said to have 'performed well'. According to US intelligence there are three large storage facilities close to Europe, one is close to the border between Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Two other smaller storage sites are said to be close to Belarus and Ukraine. US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in berlin following the exercise but are said not to have discussed the matter.

"When un-retouched photographs of, what appeared to be, a L'Oreal campaign starring Beyonce leaked last night the internet was sent into a tail spin and the unflattering pictures went viral. The unflattering images of the usually flawless star, which show bumpy-looking skin and harsh make-up, were tweeted, blogged, Instagrammed and re-grammed thousands upon thousands of times. But while some have been cruel about the appearance of the singer's complexion, the majority of  have been quick to support the singer, jumping to her defence. Scroll down for video . When photographs of Beyonce, thought to be from her L'Oreal make-up shoot leaked online people were quick to register their shock at her less than flawless look . In fact, users took to Twitter to criticise those who had expressed their shock at the images and one user named @liannefielding said: 'If you are shocked at the leaked pictures of Beyonce then please take a long hard look at yourself.' Another named @Kicka**_bonet said: 'I don't care for Beyonce but I'm glad those pictures leaked. She's an actual person & it's deceiving of the media to retouch for perfection.' One named @MelanieCoMcCoy said: 'So Beyonce is actually a human being, Shocking! She's still beautiful. We all have blemishes. Leaking those photos was in very poor taste.' Meanwhile,  FEMAIL readers told us they feel empowered by seeing images of Beyonce with her flaws on show. Sophie Herman, 29, told us: 'It makes me feel amazing to know that she doesn't have a defined jaw line and, if anything, a little angry that this whole time I've been looking in the mirror hating mine, when it's obviously a problem even she has. 'Also, her make-up looks like end-of-the-night make-up, which I think is reassuring as it shows the power of retouching. Maybe we all look like Beyonce at the end of an evening. The images, which have been shared thousands of times show Beyonce with pimply skin and neck lines . Some users took to Twitter to post mean comments about the leaked pictures of Beyonce . But Sophie also said that she doesn't feel tricked by Photoshopping as she knows it's part of advertising: 'I don't even really mind about her skin, I could guess that that was probably glossed over to make the pictures look a little more smooth.' And Isabelle Broom, 37, from London, agreed: 'I think it's a good thing that the pictures leaked. Girls need to realise that women are real and not dolls. And she still looks great anyway.' The images, however, did stir up a sense of resentment at the celebrity culture of doctoring pictures. She said: 'Perfection on those airbrushed terms is simply un-achievable, and it's wrong that we're led to believe that flawlessness equals greatness.' Women took to Twitter to react to the Beyonce photo leak with one saying that those who were shocked needed to take a long hard look at themselves . Gemma Cardle, 35, said: 'Although it can be refreshing to see that even women with all the money in the world to spend on their appearance, still suffer from 'real' problems like bad skin, it's not a reason to  gloat about it. 'No one enjoys having their spotty pictures put out in the world and if this was on Facebook any of us would immediately click 'de-tag'. 'Here, the lighting seems so harsh that anyone's skin would look bad under it, and the make-up itself just doesn't suit her - the red lipstick looks sticky, the eye-liner makes her usually beautiful eyes look small and a bit squinty. 'Ultimately Beyonce is one of the most stunning women in the world and a bad photo isn't going to take that away from her.' Olivia Rose, a photographer from London, said: 'The fact that we all care so much is the sad thing. I don't re-touch my images but I light them in a flattering way, to me it just shows how much these photographers rely on post-production to make an image nowadays.' In this shot the singer shows off her natural beauty but many have pointed out that the photographic light will not have been flattering for her skin . Fans have said that they don't feel let down by Beyonce because they expect her to be airbrushed and they think she looks great in the pictures anyway . We also spoke to Claire Culley the editor of The W Review a positive, honest online community for women. She said: 'Unfortunately in the modern society that we live in, retouching is considered the norm. So much so that when a photo is leaked of a un-retouched image it's front page news. 'At the end of the day each and every woman, has something about their body that they aren't happy with or that they wish they could change. 'Instead of focusing on a muffin top or a double chin, or in Beyonce's case her face, we should be focusing on their achievements.' In a L'Oreal advert from 2013 Beyonce is seen with flawless skin which looks like it has been Photoshopped . Claire continued: 'The women who are retouched in the media aren't just models, they are career women who have achieved brilliant success. 'Be it actresses, designers or women in business. When we look at these images they should feel inspired by their accomplishments, not distracted at how shiny their hair looks or how smooth their skin is. 'In reality, all women are a little bit lumpy and bumpy. So instead of airbrushing that out we should instead be embracing the real woman that has worked her socks off to even be in that magazine in the first place' Photographer Nik Pate, who doctors photographs himself said: 'Everyone needs to be reminded that more often than not the imagery that we see on a daily basis is hyper-real and has seen many hours of Photoshop. 'We have become numb to this and our demand for flawless perfection puts pressure on those in the media, we shouldn't be shocked by these unedited images - it's nice to be reminded that everyone is human.' In 2010 Britney Spears sanctioned the release of these images of herself by the company Candies, the images show how different advertising shots can be from the originals . In the before and after images Britney shows how her image has been altered with her bum made smaller and her cellulite removed . Of course this isn't the first time that a celebrity has fallen foul of a leak like this. And in some cases they have even encouraged companies to show off their unedited pictures. In 2010 Britney Spears Candies release edited and unedited images of herself, clearly showing how her image had been altered. Despite being naturally slim in one set of after pictures where Britney is facing the camera the singer was given a smaller waist as well as slimmer thighs, she also had her bruises removed. In an after shot where she has her back to the camera she has had her tattoo removed, her bum made smaller and her cellulite removed. In the final poster for King Arthur Keira Knightly had had her breasts considerably enlarged . When Keira Knightley starred in the film King Arthur the poster for the movie had given her with considerably larger breasts than she has in real life. Keira wasn't that concerned that her body had been altered but she didn't like  the shape of her breasts. She said: 'I was only angry when they were really droopy... For King Arthur, for a poster, they gave me these really strange droopy tits. I thought, well if you're going to make me fantasy breasts, at least make perky breasts.' Most recently an unretouched picture of original supermodel Cindy Crawford was published on Twitter, showing her in a set of lingerie. It was first thought it was for the April 2015 issue of Marie Claire magazine but then have since revealed it was taken from a shoot done in 2013. The magazine then released a statement in which they praised the model saying: 'It is real, it is honest, and it is gorgeous.' They went on to say, 'It's an enlightenment—we've always known Crawford was beautiful, but seeing her like this only makes us love her more.' Similarly Twitter users praised Cindy with one woman named @Lind82 saying, 'She looks amazing, why can't magazines just show women as they are? 'Cindy Crawford Photo Leak.'' Whilst another named @Tracey_lou said, 'bravo to Cindy Crawford for releasing her untouched photos. Brave and beautiful #women #advertising' Lady Gaga, Madonna, Katy Perry and Lena Dunham have all also had pictures leaked. When Katy covered Rolling Stone in 2010 they appeared to give her larger breasts. And when Gaga shot a campaign for Versace in 2010 they significantly smoothed out her skin. Airbrushing is commonplace within the media and fashion industries where women and men are often portrayed to have flawless skin and bodies. Yet for someone, the release of their undoctored pictures just make them look even better. When Petra Nemcova posed for the new Ultimo underwear collection, the picture of her posing in a bra pre-Photoshop revealed just how flawless the model really is.","Photographs of Beyonce from a make-up photoshoot leaked online .

"When Belle Gibson was given the shocking news five years ago that she had terminal brain cancer, she quickly decided conventional medical treatments were taking a heavy toll on her body. After undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, the Melbourne mother decided to try something less invasive and harsh and starting using holistic medications and whole foods. The move not only prolonged her life, but inspired her to design a food and lifestyle app, called The Whole Pantry, which proved so popular  she was flown out to Silicone Valley where she was told her app was to be included on the Apple Watch, unveiled last week. Belle Gibson founder and developer of The Whole Pantry app revealed she's spent the last month working on the Apple Watch in California . 'It didn’t take me long to notice the stress conventional medicine was putting on my body so I started looking for an alternative,' Ms Gibson told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was lying there one night and I read an article about how lemon in water can act as a natural detox something clicked and that's when I changed the way I ate and lived.' Ms Gibson only eats foods that are free from genetically modified organisms, gluten, dairy and sugar. It was the cancer that pushed her to develop the world's first health, wellness and lifestyle app, The Whole Pantry, which encourages healthy eating and has community groups to help those looking to live more wholesome lifestyles. The app launched in August 2013 and was downloaded 200,000 times in the first month. Its success led Apple to come knocking when the tech company went looking for hip new apps to include on its newest must-have item, the Apple Watch - developed in the highest secrecy before its launch last week. A month ago, Ms Gibson received a phone call from Apple HQ asking her to fly to Silicon Valley to work with them on a secret project. Ms Gibson collapsed at her sister's birthday party for 40 minutes. Episodes like this are a harsh reminder of her cancer . Only then was it revealed the secret project was the Apple Watch. The app's icon is featured front and centre on the Apple Watch's face. 'The fact that Apple have supported me and The Whole Pantry is huge considering how small our team is and the fact it is our first app,' Ms Gibson said. The app developed by Ms Gibson and co-designer Alex Benevento helps make the Apple Watch more user-friendly and hands-free. She is now 25 and the mother of a three-year-old son, Oliver. The tumour in her brain is still there, and regular seizures act as painful reminders of her condition. 'At Oli's party I collapsed in pain and had multiple seizures over the following 40 minutes. This is the worst I've ever been with them. I have seizures often as a result of my brain cancer, but nothing ever this long or intense,' she said. She refers to the app as an entry-point for people wanting to start a more wholesome way of life. It is loaded with recipes, product recommendations and tips. It has also become a community of supporters and people who share her philosophy of only putting natural things into her body. Ms Gibson was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and only given four months to live in 2009, today she is a leading app developer encouraging people to lead more wholesome lives via her app, The Whole Pantry . The green, doubled-leaf Whole Pantry app icon features front and centre on the new Apple Watch, just to the right of the 'play; icon . Just a month after it's release the app already had 200,000 downloads. Belle Gibson the founder donates 95 per cent of the profits to charities and organisations . Cook Mode is the new feature which the Apple Watch will be helpful with as you will be able to have a recipe to swipe step-buy-step from without taking up any bench space. Another new feature that will be coming soon is one where the Apple Watch will be able to detect what items you need off your The Whole Pantry shopping list and remind you to buy them when near a grocery store. 'It makes shopping for recipe items that much easier if the experience is hands-free.' The app will be relaunched in a few months so that it can be compatible with the new and current devices and will have 450 new recipes. The wholefoods movement is based around getting back to basics and eating unprocessed or refined food . The app is no ordinary recipe app, it encourages people to make changes within their lives. 'We are not trying to convert people from one diet to another. We are just tying to encourage people to eat more whole foods and move their bodies.' A book carrying the same name as the app will be launched through Penguin in October. 'I just got the first hard copy of the book and I'm so excited Ms Gibson said, 'I just am forever grateful to my team and my online community who I wake up for every morning.' The Whole Pantry app developer Belle Gibson will soon release a book featuring 80 new recipes and a starter guide to a wholesome lifestyle .","A 25-year-old Melbourne woman's app is a core feature of the new Apple Watch .

"A former beauty queen has undergone an incredible surgery where a quarter of her skull was removed and stored in her stomach while she recovered from a devastating head injury. Surgeons removed the rear quarter of Jamie Hilton's skull and placed in her abdomen so that the bone would remain sterile and nourished as her brain swelling subsided. When the mother-of-three and former Mrs. Idaho woke up from the operation she found the large, hard lump in her stomach and a portion of her head missing. The skull remained in her abdomen for 42 days until it was re-attached in a successful operation and now, three months after her near death experience the 36-year-old has returned home. Accident: Jamie Hilton, who was Mrs Idaho 2009, slipped during a fishing trip and hit her head on a boulder. As he brain swelled, doctors took out part of her skull (right) for more than a month to protect the brain . Writing on a blog post about her near death experience, Jamie, who won Mrs. Idaho in 2009 and competed in the Mrs. America beauty contests, said: 'NOTHING in this world really matters to me today other than I AM HERE. I am on this GLORIOUS earth with my unbelievable family. 'I can snuggle my kids, kiss my husband, hang out with my mom, and LIVE. My heart feels like it could explode with GRATITUDE. My cup is running over with joy and happiness. Is everything in my life perfect? No. But today I AM ALIVE!' Jamie's brush with death came after . she joined her husband Nick and brother-in-law Greg on a salmon fishing . trip to Hell's Canyon in Idaho in June. As Jamie tried to reel in her first fish she lost her footing and fell 12ft on to a boulder. Her husband scrambled down to his wife and found her unconscious, without a pulse and not breathing. Safe: The skull was put in her stomach to keep the bone nourished for after the brain swelling went down . In hospital: After 42 days, the piece of skull was then put back into Jamie's head in a successful operation . When Nick lifted her, she began breathing again and nearby Forest Ranger called for emergency services. Jamie was airlifted to Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise where doctors found her brain had swollen. With her family warned that the next 72 hours would decide if she lived or died, they took the decision to remove a quarter of her skull until the brain swelling went down. The skull portion remained in her abdomen for 42 days until it was removed and placed back on her head. As she came round from the operation she called the doctor over to her and said: 'Thank you for what you have done. You have saved my life!' On her blog site where her recovery was detailed Jamie, from Boise, Idaho, spoke about the moment her skull was replaced. On the mend: Hilton, 36, has been blogging about her progress and has returned to work . Support: Jamie, who was Mrs Idaho in 2009, has three children with her husband Nick, pictured . 'Surgery went as well as expected! My skull is back in my head... really weird to say ;),' she said. 'Stitches this time, not staples! They are scheduled to come out August 3rd. yeah! So for now the only possible problems, are infection, or my body rejecting the skull being back in my head. 'Your prayers are FELT and APPRECIATED! Never in my life have I FELT the prayers and faith of others in my behalf. What a marvelous experience. THANK YOU!' Jamie posted a photo of the skull in her abdomen on her blog page entitled 'Miracles believe in them' as well as a photo showing a scar running the length of her head. Since recovering she has returned to work in the family taxi business as she attempts to clear a six figure medical bill for her life saving surgery.","Jamie Hilton, 36, slipped and hit her head on a rock during a fishing trip .

"Manchester United misfit Anderson is being pursued by clubs in Brazil who believe he can leave Old Trafford early on a free transfer.

'Gremio showed no interest. Gremio had its chance and still have it, but now its a matter of Gremio's board. I've been close to go to Gremio before, but the board didnt want me.'

"Living on the coast offers people tranquillity and beautiful views. But for residents along this stretch of the English channel at the top and the bottom of the White Cliffs of Dover had a lucky escape when a huge chunk of chalk fell into the sea. Tonnes of rock fell onto the shoreline along a part of the cliff face at St Margaret's Bay between Dover and Deal in Kent. The rock came off the famous landmark just feet away from a house once owned by Bond creator Ian Fleming. Landslide: Tonnes of chalk were left piled on the Kent coastline after part of the White Cliffs of Dover collapsed . Rock bottom: A large part of the cliff face at the Kent landmark came off and rumbled onto the shore . Dover Coastguard said a bench and . fencing which sat on the cliff-top were also sent tumbling to the base, . prompting warnings to coastal walkers. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The . collapse is thought to have been caused by a combination of high winds . and rain freezing after being absorbed into the chalk and then . expanding, causing the cliff to weaken. A similar collapse saw a chunk of the cliff-face slip in March last year. A . Dover Coastguard spokesman said: 'There was a similar fall in 2012 but . this one is smaller than that one. A bench and fence have gone down with . it. Terror cliffs: The fallen rocks were dangerously close to several homes on the coast of the English Channel . Warning signs: The collapse happened in St Margaret's Bay between Dover and Deal in Kent where the National Trust warns of cliff falls . 'Coastguard rescue officers were tasked to make an assessment of the area and take some pictures which were sent off to the relevant authorities. 'The cliff-fall extends about 150 yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea at ground level, and the fall is about 15ft to 20ft high.' On a clear day you can see right across from the Dover cliffs to the cliffs on the French coast at Cap Gris Nez, proof of the continuous strata of chalk. About 70million years ago this part of Britain was submerged by a shallow sea. The sea bottom was made of a white mud formed from the fragments of coccoliths - the skeletons of tiny algae which floated in the surface waters of the sea. This mud became the chalk. It is believed to have been deposited very slowly, probably only half a millimetre a year. In spite of this, up to 500 metres of chalk were deposited in places. The coccoliths are too small to be seen without a microscope but if you look carefully you can find fossils of some of the larger inhabitants of the chalk sea such as sponges, shells, ammonites and urchins. (Source: Dover Museum) The National Trust, which owns the land, were told of the collapse and have put up signs warning walkers to beware. A National Trust spokesman said: 'This . cliff fall is part of a process of natural regeneration that happens on . this world famous stretch of the Kent coast, helping to keep this . special place, recognised by millions across the world, so distinctive. 'We’ve installed signs and information to help keep access open to this British icon. 'Throughout the year we closely monitor how the elements affect the chalk cliffs, helping us to manage the coastal footpath.' The Kent landmark, immortalised by Dame Vera Lynn’s wartime song The White Cliffs of Dover, has suffered large falls before, and is thought to recede by around half an inch each year. Experts believe that the cliffs could move up to 200 yards further away from France by the end of the century. Parts of the cliffs are now supported by concrete. The chalk cliffs have stood over dramatic moments in English history, including the first arrival of the Romans and the return of British forces rescued from Dunkirk in the Second World War. They are also home to a rich array of wildlife such as the Adonis blue butterfly and peregrine falcons, Kent’s only kittiwake, and plants including oxtongue broomrape and sea carrots. Last year, the National Trust, which owns five miles of the white cliffs, successfully raised money to buy a mile of the coastline from a private owner in a campaign backed by celebrities including Dame Judi Dench, singer Joss Stone and chef Rick Stein. More than 16,000 people and organisations backed the appeal, which was launched in June last year and saw an average donation of £40.21, including Gift Aid, from members of the public. Rubble: The National Trust, which owns the stretch of land said that the collapse was smaller than a similar one last March .

"There was a moment when David Beckham had just joined LA Galaxy that he decided to take a wander into town. An amble around your new surroundings, especially those as glitzy as Los Angeles, would be commonplace for most people. For Beckham, it can potentially cause hysteria. At LA Galaxy they were still unsure, at the time of his arrival, just how big Golden Balls would be in America. David Beckham's move to LA Galaxy in 2007 paved the way for Premier League stars crossing the Atlantic . The reaction was ginormous as hundreds of reporters and photographers turned up to LA for him . Beckham thought he would gauge the reaction and told a member of club staff he was popping out for a bit. ‘Don’t you think you should take that off?’ they asked, wide-eyed with surprise and pointing to his LA Galaxy training top. Beckham smiled. ‘Yes, this is what I’m going to get recognised for…’ the most famous face on the planet jokingly replied. For Major League Soccer, Beckham was just the start. Back when he signed, in July 2007, Beckham was surprised by the comparatively low-budget hotels and flights, when he had grown accustomed to exclusive accommodation and private jets. But his move paved the way for Thierry Henry, Robbie Keane and Tim Cahill, amongst many other global names, and change is in the air stateside. When Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard cross the Atlantic this summer, the league is a very different one to when Beckham blazed the trail eight years ago. MLS has a long way to go until it is as big as American Football in the US, but Lampard, set to join New York City, and Gerrard, on his way to LA Galaxy, will carry on Beckham’s crusade when they arrive. Beckham made 118 appearances for LA Galaxy in his five years at the club, scoring 20 goals . Beckham's (left) move lead Premier League stars like Robbie Keane (right) to move to the MLS . Chicago Fire manager Frank Yallop, who was in charge of LA Galaxy when Beckham brought the circus to town, explains: ’Everyone’s got a football team in England. Over in the US, everyone’s got an American Football team. It’s huge, the biggest sport. That’s like the Premier League in England. ‘Lampard and Gerrard coming over is massive. It will get people supporting clubs. They’re watching them in the Premier League on a Saturday morning on TV, now they can go watch them live. Then when they travel to another city the fans there can watch Lampard and Gerrard play live. It’s only going to help. ‘It’s part of the package they bring. These teams can really generate some interest with them. They’re great players, but they’ve got great names. It’s a big move. ‘We just need to get the American general public really interested, like they are in England. It’s coming. LA Galaxy captain Keane (second left) presents President Barack Obama with a Galaxy jersey . Another addition to the MLS after Beckham was Thierry Henry, arguably the Premier League's greatest player . ‘It’s getting to that point when it’s going to take off, like when Sky got involved with the Premier League in the 1990s.’ The MLS are seeking that big-money TV deal and there are rumours that Sky might be bidding to screen MLS games live to the UK. There is a long, long way to go to get anywhere near the £5.1billion deal recently reached over here, but names like Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard carry obvious allure for the English market. Even so, the pair may have to get used to slightly lower than the premium standards they have become accustomed to at their clubs since they were teenagers. ‘I think Beckham was surprised by the level of hotel, the level of travel,’ Yallop, who played more than 300 games for Ipswich Town and has won the MLS Cup and coach of the Year twice, says. Henry joined New York Red Bulls in 2010 and played his final game for the club in December 2014 . Frank Lampard followed suit by announcing he was joining New York City after being released by Chelsea . ‘It was what we were used to. When he came, it opened our eyes up, we realised if we want to move this up a level we needed to start getting serious. Now everything is top notch. ‘It’s not always first class, but it’s always good flights. Some teams charter once in a while. Hotels are excellent.’ Yallop was shocked just how big Beckham was when he signed. For a long time, they would have 300 television cameras, from all parts of the globe, at each press conference. During games, the usual few photographers dotted on the side of the pitch were swamped by 250. ‘The league wasn’t quite ready for what David brought,’ Yallop admits, ‘which was huge interest from outside of football, too. ‘It’s very good, but for our team it was crazy for a bit. David’s getting pulled all over for interviews and commercials. The team’s exposed to a bunch of stuff they’re not used to, Hollywood-type stuff. It was fun, but a real crazy, difficult to coach and manage time.’ Now, it is a different story. ‘They’re ready for Lampard and Gerrard,’ he adds. Lampard, currently on loan at Manchester City, will join up with his new teammates in the summer . Steven Gerrard announced he will exit Liverpool at the end of the season and will also join LA Galaxy .","Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard head to the MLS in the summer .

State police and the park service are conducting a joint investigation into the blaze, whose cause hasn't been determined, the park service said. Park staff completed an initial inventory on Saturday and said that, in addition to the flag, the losses included a handful of personal items of passengers and crew, DVD copies of the annual commemoration ceremony and meetings of the Flight 93 National Memorial Federal Advisory Commission, and about 100 tribute items left by visitors since 2001.

The plane, which was traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco, went down in a reclaimed strip mine after passengers fought back against its hijackers. All 33 passengers and seven crew members were killed along with the hijackers. A memorial plaza was completed in time for the 10th anniversary of the attacks in 2011. There are plans for a 93-foot-tall tower with 40 wind chimes. Officials have said they hope construction of the visitors center will be finished by June.

"The floppy blond wig and fake glasses are more Austin Powers than James Bond. But Russian intelligence services say they have trapped a CIA ‘spy’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent. Diplomat Ryan Fogle was thrown down and handcuffed in a night-time sting by the FSB secret service – formerly the KGB. He faces expulsion from Russia. Scroll down for video . Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit . Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer . Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . He had a rudimentary espionage kit . containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, . three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and . an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read . remotely, Russian intelligence sources said. The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the . political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared . Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials. Unusually, the FSB made its coup . public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue . checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and  baseball cap, along with images of . him in detention. Last night spy sources said Fogle was . caught after a lengthy covert operation. US ambassador Michael McFaul – . who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s . foreign ministry. Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB . Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help  change one's appearance,' according to the FSB . Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine . Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia . The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S. In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot. Meanwhile, US secretary of state John . Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are due to meet in . Sweden today after successful talks earlier this month. Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said.

"Australia secured their place in the final of the 2014 Four Nations Series - and confirmed England’s exit - with an emphatic 44-18 win over Samoa in Wollongong. Full-back Greg Inglis and scrum-half Cooper Cronk both scored two tries as the Kangaroos set up a showdown with New Zealand in Wellington next Saturday, when they will have the chance to atone for their surprise 30-12 defeat in the group stages in Brisbane. Samoa, who pushed both England and New Zealand all the way in their first two games on their tournament debut, needed a win by more than eight points to reach the final while a smaller margin of victory would have opened the door for England.

Slender English and Samoan hopes suffered a blow within two minutes of the kick-off after man of the match Inglis broke clear to get Cronk over for the first of Australia’s eight tries and the South Sydney full-back then went over twice in 15 minutes to establish a stranglehold on the game. The physical Samoans were punished heavily for their indiscipline, conceding five penalties in the first 15 minutes, but full-back Tim Simona pulled a try back and replacement hooker Pita Godinet had one disallowed as they briefly rallied, to the delight of the 18,456 crowd at WIN Stadium.

"On his way to Europe? Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell is set to be offered another top job by David Cameron after the pair 'buried the hatchet' following the 'Plebgate' row . David Cameron hosted a Chequers lunch for former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell last Sunday and offered him the chance of taking a top EU post. They agreed to ‘bury the hatchet’ after claims Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after No 10 bungled an investigation into an allegation that he called a Downing Street policeman  a ‘f****** pleb’, a charge he vehemently denies. And the Prime Minister told Mr Mitchell he was ready to propose him as a £250,000-a-year European Commissioner. It would mark a dramatic comeback for the former Minister, who was convinced  he was the victim of a police conspiracy after it emerged a ‘killer email’ accusing him of swearing came from another No 10 policeman who was not present at the incident. Mr Cameron and wife Samantha had lunch at the PM’s official country residence in Buckinghamshire with Mr Mitchell and his GP wife  Sharon. They were joined by two Tory-supporting friends of Mr Mitchell – the historian Andrew Roberts and Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher’s biographer. Afterwards, Mr Cameron took Mr Mitchell to The Plough pub in Princes Risborough, where the PM famously left his daughter behind last year. Mr Cameron told Mr Mitchell he was considering putting  him forward as an EU Commissioner when Baroness Ashton, appointed by Gordon Brown, finishes her term as EU Foreign Affairs envoy next year. The Prime Minister wants Britain to have an economic post, such as Trade Commissioner, formerly held by Lord Mandelson, or Internal Market Commissioner, to give the UK more financial muscle. ‘The PM believes Andrew is ideal for the job,’ said a well-placed source. ‘He won considerable respect worldwide for his negotiating skills as Secretary of State for International Development, he knows about finance through his banking background, and his record in the Whips Office shows he is not scared to bash heads to get a result.’ Mr Mitchell’s candidacy is also backed by the Foreign Office. ‘Baroness Ashton has been a bit of a disappointment,’ said a diplomat. ‘Andrew could bring considerably more style and commitment.’ It is understood Mr Mitchell told Mr Cameron he would ‘seriously consider’ the suggestion. Mr Cameron made the offer to Mr Mitchell after lunch at Chequers with wife Samantha . Initially, it was thought that Cambridge-educated Mr Mitchell would be offered a new seat at the Cabinet table, possibly his old job as Chief Whip. But Mr Cameron wants to avoid another reshuffle. Moreover, he believes Mr Mitchell’s ‘steely charm’ would make him a big success in Brussels. Mr Mitchell believes he will be vindicated by the results of  a police inquiry into ‘Plebgate’. No 10 was accused of not properly investigating the claims against Mr Mitchell. A report by MPs blamed Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood for failing to check the police log or CCTV and not devoting enough time to the matter.","Former Chief Whip set to take European Commissioner role .

"A Mormon doctor accused of murdering his wife with a cocktail of prescription drugs so he could continue an affair with the nanny allegedly boasted to inmates that no one could prove he killed her. As Martin MacNeill's murder trial began on Thursday, prosecutors painted him as a liar and a cheat who was determined to make his wife have a facelift so that he could poison her during her recovery. Michele MacNeill, 50, was found slumped in her bathtub in Pleasant Grove, Utah in April 2007 by her six-year-old daughter. Hours later, the mother-of-eight was pronounced dead. On Thursday, prosecutor Sam Pead said that MacNeill, a one-time doctor who also taught Sunday school at his local Mormon church, told inmates after his arrest that his wife was a 'b****'. Scroll down for video . On trial: Martin MacNeill appears in court in Provo, Utah on Thursday as opening statements in his murder trial begin. He is accused of forcing his wife to have a face-lift so he could kill her with a cocktail of drugs . Together: His wife Michele, a former beauty queen, was found dead at their home in April 2007 . He told them that he was glad that she had died and that authorities would never be able to prove that he had killed her, Pead said. Prosecutors said the killing was . the climax of a twisted plot by MacNeill to continue an affair with his . children's nanny, Gypsy Willis, whom he invited to his wife's funeral . and soon . asked to marry him. They said he acted erratically the day Michele died, yelled that she had wanted the surgery and later said he was glad his wife was dead, Pead told jurors. Even his own lawyers did not paint him in a flattering light on Thursday. 'Martin . has made poor choices in his life. He had affairs during his marriage,' Susanne Gustin said. 'Shortly . after his wife passed away, he brought [his mistress] into his home. We may think he's a total jerk and disgusting. And that's . natural. But decide this case on the facts rather than the emotion.' Opening statements: Defense lawyer Suzanne Gustin, pictured, said the jury may believe her client is a 'total jerk' for cheating on his wife and inviting his mistress to her funeral, but that it does not mean he's a killer . Testimony: Dr. Scott Thompson, who performed Michele's facelift, said he gave her a different selection of drugs to what he usually gave patients because her husband was a doctor whom he trusted . Tense: MacNeill, a former Sunday school teacher, listens to witness testimony on the first day of his trial . Prosecutors . said they would try to prove that MacNeill made a plastic surgeon to . prescribe a powerful set of neurological drugs for her recovery that . left her comatose in the bathtub. MacNeill, 57, was charged in August 2012, nearly five years after his wife was found in the couple's Pleasant Grove home. Medical examiners couldn't determine how 50-year-old Michele MacNeill died. They initially ruled she died of natural causes, possibly from a heart disorder, then changed the finding to undetermined. The uncertainty was one reason it took so long to prosecute Martin MacNeill on the murder charge. Von Welch, a doctor who examined Michele before cosmetic surgery, said her husband was eager to 'get things going' and was surprised the couple rejected his advice to put it off until she got her high blood pressure under control. Dr. Scott Thompson, who performed Michele's . facelift, also testified on Thursday and recalled how MacNeill joined his wife at her . consultations and on the day of the procedure. Emotion: Michele's relatives listen to testimony as MacNeill's trial begins; it is expected to last six weeks . Sadness: Rachel MacNeill, pictured outside the courtroom ahead of the trial, has long been vocal about her belief that her father killed her mother. The couple had eight children together . He . told the court that MacNeill requested extra medications for his wife . outside what is usually prescribed as he was concerned whether she . could handle the pain. He . went on to prescribe seven medications to Michele, including two pain . medications, a sleeping pill, anti-nausea medication, valium, a steroid . for swelling and an antibiotic. Dr . Thompson added that he usually did not prescribe the combination of . medications that he gave her - but that he did so because he know . MacNeill was a doctor, and he trusted him. In . his opening statements, Pead added that MacNeill told his daughter he . 'probably over medicated' Michele the day after she had a facelift and . that he disposed of the pills Michele had been taking within a few hours . of the death. The . MacNeills had eight children, and their oldest daughters have been . outspoken in their belief that their father killed their mother.

"Fake tan has come a long way since the days of streaky orange ankles and hard-to-use lotions that delivered an artificial pumpkin hue. Nowadays an abundance of sophisticated products promise smooth, fast, fuss-free application and achieve an extremely realistic result. Such advances have also attracted a more discerning and stylish customer – step forward Kate Moss, the face of leading brand St Tropez’s new range, for which she appeared nude in a series of upmarket publicity shots. As she says: ‘St Tropez does it so well that you do look natural. You don’t have that fear, which I always did, of going streaky.’ But there has been growing disquiet in the scientific community about the safety of so-called fake bakes – specifically about their key ingredient: DHA. It is this chemical, dihydroxyacetone, that reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce the brown ‘suntan’ colour. It is also this compound that gives fake bakes their characteristic – often described as biscuity – smell. Flawless: Kate Moss as the face and body of spray-tan brand St Tropez . Last year, a panel of American medical experts reviewed scientific studies on DHA for ABC News. They reported that tests on live animal cells had shown the chemical could cause DNA damage, which is linked to cancer, and toxicologists voiced their concerns about the possible risk. Dr Chris Flower, Director General of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), admits that such concerns are leading companies to lower concentrations of DHA. And many new products claim to be completely free of the chemical. But with a third of UK women and one in ten men using these products in an industry worth £100 million a year, the question remains: Is DHA safe or not? RISE OF THE BOOTHS . The cosmetic use of DHA in tanning creams and gels was first approved by the American Food and Drug Administration – still the best international benchmark of safety and quality – in the 1970s. Since then, however, sunless tanning techniques have changed almost out of recognition. While mousses, lotions and creams are just smeared on to the skin, the spray methods now in common use apply the concoction through the use of an aerosol. Spray-on tan:The cosmetic use of DHA in tanning creams and gels was first approved by the American Food and Drug Administration in the 1970s (file picture) There are three main types of spray tan. The simplest is the manual turbine spray, an ‘airbrush’ held by the beautician. The second, known as a third-generation spray booth, consists of a closed compartment – similar to a shower cubical – in which, after a short countdown, three rows of nozzles spray a product on to the entire body. Turning around is not necessary as  the whole body is enveloped in fine mist. The fourth-generation spray booth, in contrast, is open and contains two vertical rows of nozzles. The customer stands and turns around to allow the other side of the body to be sprayed. These techniques give a faster, more even result – but they also increase the risk of absorbing DHA through inhalation and by contact with mucous membranes in the eyes and mouth. It is this absorption that may  be dangerous. At the time of last year’s study, Dr Lynn Goldman, Dean of the School of Public Health and Health Services at George Washington University, said: ‘The substance seems to have a potential for what they call creating mutations, or changing DNA in living cells, which is  a serious problem and needs to  be further investigated, yet  hasn’t been.’ Although this is based only on lab tests on individual animal and bacterial cells, rather than observations in humans, she warned: ‘What we’re concerned about is not so much the reaction that creates the tanning, but reactions that may occur deeper down  with living cells – which might then change DNA, causing a mutation – and what the possible impacts of that might be. I’d be very concerned of the potential for lung cancer.’ Dr Rey Panettieri, a toxicologist and lung specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, also urged caution, saying: ‘The lungs have a huge surface area and these compounds could get into the bloodstream and promote the development of cancers. ‘[Regular inhalation] could potentially lead to cancer or the worsening of asthma or other lung disease.’ The risk would be most significant for those visiting salons frequently or for staff who spray the tan on to customers. Fake tan: Products have moved on since the days of streaky orange ankles . STILL SAFER THAN THE SUN . Dr Nick Lowe, a consultant dermatologist in the UK, believes the chemical to be safe – though he advises against inhaling it – and points out that his opinion is shared by most scientists. ‘Organisations such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the Canadian Dermatology Association state quite clearly that it is a safer method of acquiring a tan than intentional sunbathing or the use of tanning beds,’ says Dr Lowe. ‘There is no direct evidence DHA increases the risk of cancer but there is evidence that sunbathing does.’ WHEN FAKING IT, TAKE PRECAUTIONS . While the American Food and Drug Administration has approved DHA in traditional self-tanning creams and lotions, it states unequivocally that its use as a spray has not been approved, due to a lack of data. The FDA recommends people protect their eyes, mouth and nose and do not inhale the spray. These recommendations echo a report in 2010 from the Danish Toxicology Centre, which advised using nose filters and eye protection in fourth-generation booths. Safer option: The American Academy of Dermatology and the Canadian Dermatology Association have said fake tan is safer than sunbathing . Yet when The Mail on Sunday contacted six leading UK tanning salons, all providing DHA-based spray tans from leading brands such as St Tropez and Mystic Tan, not one recommended or even provided any form of protection from inhalation or absorption. Indeed, the idea was discouraged because, as one beautician said, it would ‘leave you with  an outline’. DIY IS BEST, BUT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS . ‘It’s important to follow instructions on the packet and the most important thing for spray-tan is to use the product in a well ventilated place,’ says Dr Flower. ‘We’ve heard that people have been wheezing and coughing, but that happens with any aerosol product and we suspect that a few people have used too much  in a small room. Some people apply it in the shower, where there is no fresh air, and that is not a good idea as it could make you cough and sneeze.’ THE COCKTAIL EFFECT . So just how safe is your fake bake? Well, experts seem to agree that DHA is not harmful unless  it gets inside the body. So as long as you take precautions and don’t plan on eating your fake bake instead of putting it on your skin, it needn’t be a problem. There are some dissenting voices. Elizabeth Salter Green, Director of Chem Trust, a UK organisation that investigates the safety of man-made chemicals, argues there could be a ‘cocktail effect’. While ingredients may be well tested on their own, daily life exposes us to a huge variety of chemicals at once, with potentially unforeseen consequences. These concerns, however, have been widely dismissed as scare-mongering. Dr Emma Meredith, Head of Scientific and Technical Services at the CTPA, says: ‘DHA has recently been reviewed by the European Commission’s independent scientific committee, which oversees the safety of cosmetic ingredients and confirmed it is safe in cosmetic products.’ Nonetheless, devotees of spray tan booths might want to think carefully – or even, if you dare, abandon the fake tan altogether and embrace the pale and interesting look.","There has been a growing disquiet about the safety of 'fake-bakes'

"Scientists in Japan have created nearly 600 exact genetic copies of one mouse after 25 rounds of cloning. The perfectly cloned mice could pave the way for milk and meat from 'super' animals created in the lab, scientists say. Experts successfully cloned the successive generations of mice using the same techniques used to create Dolly the sheep. Attack of the clones: Scientists in Japan have created nearly 600 cloned mice after 25 rounds of cloning . The rodents live a normal lifespan and the process can be carried on indefinitely through successive generations. The cloned mice showed no signs of growing old prematurely and appeared mentally and physically perfect. Dr Teruhiko Wakayama said: 'This technique could be very useful for the large scale production of superior quality animals, for farming or conservation purposes.' In an experiment that began eight years ago, the researchers used 'somatic cell nuclear transfer' (SNCT) to produce almost six hundred mice from one original 'donor' after twenty five consecutive rounds of cloning. The technique shot to fame in 1997 when Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, was unveiled to the world. Scientific breakthrough: Experts successfully cloned the successive generations of mice using the same techniques used to create Dolly the Sheep (pictured) It creates an embryo by taking the nucleus, which houses the genetic material of a cell, from one cell and putting it into an unfertilised egg that has had its own genetic material removed. The resulting embryo is then an exact genetic copy of the cell from the animal or person that donated the nucleus. It has been used successfully in laboratory and farm animals but, until now, scientists had not overcome the limitations of low success rates and the few times mammals could be recloned. Attempts at recloning cats, pigs and mice more than two to six times had failed. Dr Wakayama, of the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology, Kobe, Japan, said: 'One possible explanation for this limit on the number of recloning attempts is an accumulation of genetic or epigenetic abnormalities over successive generations.' An animal inherits its genetic code from its parents along with the machinery for unlocking it, a process known as epigenetics. The epigenetic changes in the cell control what parts of its DNA are expressed and how. It is the method by which a liver or skin cell knows its specific function because of the genes that are switched on or off. So to prevent these potentially devastating alterations the researchers added a naturally occurring chemical called trichostatin. This increased cloning efficiency up to sixfold, according to the findings published in the journal Cell Stem Cell. By improving each step of the procedure, they were able to clone the mice repeatedly without seeing a reduction in the success rate. The 581 healthy mice obtained in this way were all fertile, gave birth to healthy pups and lived for about two years, similar to mice conceived in the normal way. The researchers said: 'Our results show there were no accumulations of epigenetic or genetic abnormalities in the mice, even after repeated cloning.' Dr Wakayama's work hit the headlines in 2008 when his team created clones from the bodies of mice that had been frozen for sixteen years, again using SNCT.","Scientists used the same techniques to create Dolly the sheep .

"An off-duty Florida sheriff’s deputy shot a 49-year-old man he caught having sex with a woman in the pool of his West Boca apartment complex Saturday. The cop confronted Tony Ribeiro and a woman he claims were engaged in a sex act just before 12.30am and told them to leave the pool area. The angry man then returned to the scene in a threatening manner and was shot by the off duty officer who lives in the building, authorities said. The deputy identified himself as a law enforcement official and asked the man and woman, who did not live in the housing complex, to leave the Reflections at Boca Del Mar complex's private pool, according to WPTV. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: Gunfire erupted poolside at this Boca Raton, Florida, apartment complex where an off-duty sheriff's deputy shot a man whom he caught having sex with a woman in the water . The incident took place at Reflections of Boca Del Mar, where the Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy is a resident . The couple reluctantly complied, but a short time later the boyfriend returned and approached the deputy in a threatening manner as he was sitting in a lounge chair by the pool, according to a report by the Palm Beach County's Sheriff's Office cited by the station. The two men got into a dispute, which escalated when the suspect allegedly tried to hit the officer with a wine glass or a champagne bottle, officials said.

"Weary Alaskans today woke up to another heavy snowfall as Anchorage experiences its snowiest period since records began, causing more headaches in coastal areas already struggling to dig out. The snow started falling shortly before midnight last night and meteorologists warned Anchorage residents that the heaviest snowfall - up to 16 inches - could come later on Thursday. About 150 miles to the southeast, the Prince William Sound community of Cordova, which has already been buried under 172 inches of snow since November, could get another 7 inches today. Assistance: Alaska National Guardsmen clear a building roof in Cordova as they help shovel what has been the biggest snowfall in decades in the area . Digging out: The Prince William Sound community of Cordova, which has already been buried under 172 inches of snow since November, could get another 7 inches today . Moving slowly: Russian-flagged tanker Renda transits through the Bering Sea with U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy's assistance, on its way to Nome, Alaska . The picturesque fishing community has had so much snow that National Guard troops helping clear roads are running out of shovels. ‘The scary part is, we (have) still three more months to go,’ said Kathryn Hawkins, a veterinarian who lives in nearby coastal community Valdez, which has seen 318 inches, or 27ft, of snow. It has been difficult to keep up with the shovelling - and 8ft walls of snow line either side of her driveway. After snow fell off her roof she cannot see out either the front or back of her house. ‘I look out and go: “Oh my gosh, where can it all go?”’ she said. In the ice-choked frozen waters of the Bering Sea, a Russian tanker loaded with 1.3million gallons of fuel is inching toward the iced-in community of Nome. It is following in the path being painstakingly ploughed by a Coast Guard icebreaker. Thick ice, wind and unfavourable ocean currents had the vessels making little progress. Covered: Snow envelopes the high school in the fishing town of Cordova, Alaska. Dozens of National Guard troops are helping Cordova dig out from massive snows . Big effort: The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Sycamore are seen, left, as they shovel snow in Cordova, and the Coast Guard Cutter Healy is seen, right, as it breaks ice around the tanker Renda south of Nome, Alaska . Pathway: A planned fuel transfer safety zone, identified by stakes in the Nome Harbor, left, and an Aeryon Scout unmanned aerial vehicle at the Nome causeway, right, used to help guide a Nome-bound Russian fuel tanker . Map: Alaska has seen huge amounts of snowfall in Anchorage and areas around 150 miles away . But conditions improved on Wednesday and a Coast Guard spokesman said the tanker and the icebreaker were 78 miles from Nome. The city missed its final pre-winter delivery of fuel by barge. That was because a big storm swept the region last autumn. Without the delivery, Nome could run short of fuel before a barge delivery becomes possible in late spring. The weather has put a strain on the state, which deployed the National Guard to Cordova this week. If it keeps up, Anchorage is on track to have the snowiest winter ever, surpassing the previous record of 132.8 inches in 1954-55, meteorologist Shaun Baines said. The weather service counts a snow year from July to June. From July 1 through to Tuesday, Anchorage has received 81.3 inches of snow. That makes it the snowiest period for Anchorage ever. Anchorage schools were open on Thursday, but some school bus routes were cancelled because of whiteout driving conditions. ‘I think people were girding their loins . for a long winter,’ said local police Lieutenant Dave Park. He hasn't . seen a crime upsurge, but ‘by the end of March, there might be a few . frustrated people.’ Expert: Greg Walker, with the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, prepares an unmanned drone to gather aerial photos and video of daily ice conditions in preparation for the planned Nome fuel transfer . Getting through: The crew of the Sycamore are seen, left, as they shovel several feet of snow from piers in the Cordova harbour, and a snow machine is inspected at the Air National Guard Armory in Nome . Tricky drive: Vehicles attempt to move down snow-covered streets in the fishing town of Cordova . In Cordova, shovel-makers were making . emergency shipments to help. There are plenty of standard shovels, but . they're lacking a version with a scoop that can push a cubic foot of . snow at a time. 'We have the National Guard right now using the standard shovel, and they're getting pretty trashed everyday - not the shovels but the Guardsmen themselves' Tim Joyce, Cordova city spokesman . The new shovels cost about $50 each - and the city is paying for them with its emergency funds. The Yukon ergo sleigh shovels, with a 26-inch scoop, have a huge advantage over regular shovels. ‘Trying to lift snow all day with those is pretty backbreaking,’ city spokesman Tim Joyce said. ‘We have the National Guard right now using the standard shovel, and they're getting pretty trashed everyday - not the shovels but the Guardsmen themselves,’ he added. The warmer temperatures - about 35F midday on Wednesday - brought another hazard to the Prince William Sound community of 2,200 people - avalanche danger. Getting ready: U.S. Coast Guard Lt. William Albright and Lt. Nicole Auth, right, prepare to mark the planned fuel transfer safety zone in the Nome harbour . Slippage: A man stands on a house buried in snow in Cordova. Some people have been trapped in homes . Christmas card scene: A house is buried in snow and icicles are seen hanging in the fishing town of Cordova . Elsewhere: An American Airlines jet is de-iced while waiting to depart O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, on Thursday, as wind, rain and snow blanketed much of the Midwest and Northeast . There is one road leading out - and it was closed though it could be opened for emergency vehicles. 'The scary part is, we have still three more months to go' Kathryn Hawkins, Valdez resident . The city also is warning people not . to stand under the eaves of their houses to clear snow off the roof for . fear the snow will come down on them. ‘There's a real high potential that if it does slide, they'd be buried,’ Mr Joyce said. So far, four commercial buildings and two homes have been damaged from snow accumulation on roofs. A 24-unit apartment complex also had to be evacuated. The current storm system is expected to be gone by Friday, but then colder temperatures will arrive. High temperatures this weekend should top out from 0 to 5F, with lows about 10F below.","Prince William Sound community of Cordova has had 172 inches of snow .

"Owners of Seacrest Wolf Preserve in northern Florida have been raising their wolves to become accustomed to humans - and for a $25 fee, visitors can mingle with a pack. Cynthia and Wayne Watkins' preserve is billed as the largest such facility in the Southeast. It lets wolves become ambassadors for their species, they say, and helps people become advocates for wolves. Cynthia Watkins kisses a wolf inside the Seacrest Wolf Preserve in Chipley, Florida . 'We offer one of the rarest opportunities in the world for humans to see wolves up close and personal,' Cynthia Watkins says. The Watkinses estimate that Seacrest, near the small town of Chipley, gets 10,000 visitors a year. But some wolf experts worry that Seacrest may be allowing wolves and humans to get too close. Dave Mech, a senior research assistant with the U.S. Geological Survey who has spent decades studying wolves, says allowing visitors to enter a wolf pack enclosure isn't safe. 'They are still unpredictable because they are wild animals,' he said. 'Wolves are not like dogs. Dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years and that unpredictability and wildness is taken out of them because of the breeding.' A worker was attacked and killed by a pack of wolves in 2012 at a wildlife park in Sweden. A Canadian biologist was killed by wolves at the Haliburton Forest & Wild Life Preserve in 1996. Wayne Watkins kneels near a wolf inside the Seacrest Wolf Preserve - home to 30 gray, Arctic and British Columbian wolves . Seacrest requires visitors to watch an educational video before they interact with the wolves, has trained wolf handlers on hand during every tour and doesn't allow children under six to take the tour, Watkins said. 'We are not some little roadside zoo,' she added. The Seacrest preserve grew out of her passion for raising huskies, the sled dogs with a wolf-like appearance. That evolved into providing a home for wolves in need of relocation and later into a captive breeding program. The 30 gray, Arctic and British Columbian wolves, with names including Utah, Rio, Liberty and Spirit Prince, are separated into packs. Each pack has several acres to roam. On a recent afternoon, Cynthia Watkins sat on a log bench surrounded by seven howling gray wolves. Watkins joined in their howling and pet and kissed each of them. A wolf rests inside the Seacrest Wolf Preserve in Chipley, Florida - visitors can get up close and personal for $25 . 'Little Red Riding Hood was wrong and the wolf is not the bad guy but indeed a very important keystone species,' she said. Seacrest also provides wolves to education programs around the country. Pat Goodman, curator of Wolf Park in Battle Ground, Indiana, has worked with wolves for more than 40 years, and said Seacrest has a good reputation for raising healthy wolves that serve as ambassadors for their species in places around the country. Cynthia Watkins . In Florida, thousands of miles from many of the wolves' native habitat, Seacrest uses spray misters, large ponds and lots of shade inside the wolves' densely wooded enclosures to help the animals deal with the heat and humidity. The preserve is still recovering from a major flood in late April when heavy rains burst a dam on the property, washing out the wolf enclosures. The flood led to the death of one British Columbian wolf that escaped from its enclosure. It was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy after an extensive search for the animal led by Florida's Fish and Wild Conservation Commission. Stan Kirkland, a spokesman for Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said the deputy shot the wolf out of concern for public safety after officers spent days tracking the animal and trying to trap it without killing it. He said officers couldn't get close enough to use a tranquilizer dart. 'You are talking about a 90 to 100-pound wolf escaping and we really were out of options,' Kirkland said. The Watkins are petitioning Gov. Rick Scott to start an investigation into the death of the wolf. The preserve has finished the most-crucial repairs needed to ensure the safety of the wolves, but more work needs to be done, she said. Seacrest has received donations and messages of support from around the world for the $100,000 rebuilding effort. 'All I could do was cry when I looked at how beautiful each enclosure was and how well thought out it was,' Watkins said. 'The flood was extremely devastating.'","The preserve is home to 30 gray, Arctic and British Columbian wolves .

"Christmas spirit is in short supply in Denham Springs, Louisiana where a woman has been forced to take down her holiday lights after neighbors complained about the not very subtle message she was sending them. Sarah Henderson, a mother of four children aged between 4 and 16,  admits she deliberately fashioned her light display to look like a human hand ‘flipping the bird’. Henderson says the middle finger salute was a message to some of her neighbors whom she has been involved in a year-long dispute with. Christmas may be over, but Sarah Henderson wants to continue with her 'rude' lighting display to get her own back a neighbor . Henderson now says the display was a message to a neighbor who she believes stole her dog . 'They put themselves into affairs of mine that they had no business in,’ she told WBRZ. ‘They spread vicious lies throughout the neighborhood.’ Henderson agreed to remove the offending display after she received a visit from Denham Spring Police. Corporal Shawn Perkins informed Henderson that her display was in violation of obscenity laws and that she faced the possibility of a $300 or $400 fine. Henderson says she could have fought the request, but she decided to take the lights down out of respect for her mayor and city council. One local neighbor, Gemma Rachel told WBRZ that while she hasn't have anything personal against Henderson, she didn’t think the lights were an appropriate symbol for young children to be exposed to. ‘Christmas lights should be something for kids to enjoy’ she told WBRZ. Since taking down her lights, Henderson has received support from the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. Henderson has twice removed the lights from her roof, but with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana she is attempting to sue the city, its mayor and police . Marjorie Essman, executive director at the ACLU, has sent a letter to the Denham Springs chief of police saying the city has no right to 'restrict Henderson's expression purely because it, or Henderson's neighbors, finds it vulgar or offensive.' In the letter, Esman wrote: 'The Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeal, which presides over Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, has specifically commented on the protected expressive nature of a middle finger extended in defiance or protest: ""The thumbed nose, the projected middle finger, the Bronx cheer, the grimace and the smile are all conduct intended to convey a message that is sometimes made even more expressive by its bold freedom from a garb of words."" Davis v. Williams.' Henderson has said she is thinking about replacing the extended finger with a swastika. Traditional display: Henderson's neighbor Gemma Rachel said Christmas lights should be something wholesome for children to enjoy .

Strabismus is a term used to describe the abnormal positioning or direction of the eyeball. Normally, the eyeball is held in place and moves from side to side and top to bottom under the influence of small muscles which attach directly to the eyeball. Occasionally one muscle may be longer or stronger than the muscle located on the opposite side. This causes the eyeball to veer off in an abnormal direction. One or both eyes may be affected. If both eyes deviate towards the nose, the pet is referred to as cross-eyed. This is common in Siamese cats and is called medial or convergent strabismus. The eyeballs may deviate away from the nose, just the opposite of being cross-eyed, and this is called divergent strabismus. Source: Petmd.com . 'Daria was a volunteer at the time and she agreed to foster him for Saving Grace Rescue while he was treated so that he wouldn't be euthanised at the shelter. 'He captured Daria's heart and was permanently signed over to her after being neutered.' Despite his tempestuous early years, Jarvis doesn't appear to hold any grudges. 'He is so happy-go-lucky!  He has always had a zest for life, even when he was tiny and sick. He's cuddly, playful, mischievous and very friendly,' said Daria. 'I often use him for introductions to new fosters because he is so personable and non-threatening.' After spending over 30 years working in the music industry it was inevitable that Ms Kelly would name one of her pets after a rock star. However, after fostering almost 200 cats, a few dozen dogs and one tarantula in the last 12 years, the time has now come for her to change careers and study to become a veterinary nurse herself. Ms Kelly, who believes this new job has always been her destiny, said: 'In my youth I was always going to be a vet, but life happened and I took a detour.

"Eight women have died and more than 60 are in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in central India. Tubectomies were carried out on 83 women by a single doctor in a government-run 'family planning camp' in the Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh state on Saturday. Dozens fell ill shortly afterwards, and although health officials deny negligence, local media reports that all women had been operated on within a five hour window. Eight women have died and more than 60 are in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in central India . An Indian woman who underwent sterilisation surgery is carried on a stretcher for treatment at the CIMS hospital in Bilaspur, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh . 'Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery,' said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district where the camp was held. 'Since Monday eight women have died and 64 are in various hospitals.' Television footage showed women on stretchers being rushed into hospital with anxious relatives by their side. The Indian Express Daily said the surgeries in Chhattisgarh were carried out by one doctor and his assistant in around five hours. 'There was no negligence. He is a senior doctor. We will probe (the incident),' the chief medical officer of Bilaspur R.K. Bhange told the newspaper.

Relatives mourn the death of women who died after undergoing sterilization surgeries. Local media reports that all the women involved had been operated on within a five hour window . Authorities in eastern India came under fire last year after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation. The women had all undergone surgical procedures at a hospital that local officials said was not equipped to accommodate such a large number of patients.

"Many people wonder what the secret to long-lasting love is but hours of soul searching might be a waste of time if new research is to be believed. Whilst mutual trust, loyalty and a shared love of Breaking Bad might spring to mind, Harvard mathematicians have revealed three rather more humble questions to determine whether a couple have real potential. And wait for it...they are: 'Do you like horror movies?' 'Have you ever travelled around another country alone?' and 'Wouldn’t it be fun to chuck it all and go live on a sailboat?' Scroll down for video . According to US experts, a shared interest in films - particularly horror - is a sure sign of compatibility amongst couples . Happy couples can test their compatibility by asking just three quirky questions, say Harvard mathematicians . The four experts who cam up with these questions are responsible for building dating website, OK Cupid, the fastest-growing dating website. In an interview for the book The Art of Doing: How Superachievers Do What They Do and How They Do It So Well, the site’s four founders offer insight into what they believe makes a relationship work. And it seems they do have the knowledge because as Harvard mathematicians they are very keen on data and wanted to build a ‘compatibility algorithm’ site based on survey questions, according to website Barking Up The Wrong Tree. And these three questions above all others seemed to determine if you and someone else have long-term potential. 'Have you ever traveled around another country alone,' and 'Would you pack it all in to go and live on a sailboat,' are two questions that determine whether you and your partner are compatible. Share exactly the same answer and you could be perfect for each other . According to the, if you find someone that answers all three of the questions the same way you do, the two of you are a perfect match. They also revealed the most successful online dating poses and what turns users off immediately. Apparently, when it comes to messaging, reply rates plummet if there is bad spelling and bad grammar. Interestingly, buzzwords such as ‘awesome’ and ‘fascinating’ prove much more popular than physical compliments like ‘sexy’ and ‘beautiful.’ The best pose for men is 'mysterious and sexy,' looking off camera and not smiling, whereas women who hold the camera above their head and look coy and flirty receive more hits. Women looking away from camera, as if they are flirting with someone else, get the least interest, say the experts. And another question men should always ask? Whether his prospective date likes the taste of beer. According to the mathematicians, if she says yes then she is 30% more likely to sleep with him on the first date than women who say no.","Mathematicians reveal what you should ask if looking for love .

"For years they have been unfairly regarded as the sole preserve of maiden aunts and respectable ladies of a certain vintage. But thanks to fashionable fan the Duchess of Cambridge, among countless other celebrities, pearls are replacing diamonds as a staple of the fashion set. Elegant pearl earrings - as worn by the former Kate Middleton on her royal tour of Australia and New Zealand - have become a wardrobe must-have - and prices are going through the roof. Girl with the pearl earrings: The Duchess of Cambridge has long championed pearls and it seems that, as always, she is setting a trend (here she wears Annoushka Baroque Pearl earring drops, which retail at £295) So popular have they become that classic sets of the gems are being sold for huge sums by one of the world’s leading auction houses. Bonhams believes natural pearls are now hitting record prices because of their rarity - overfishing and pollution mean the supply of new natural pearls is waning - coupled with the influence of celebrities. Seventy-five pearls, fastened with a diamond clasp, made up the most valuable lot in the sale - a single-strand natural saltwater pearl necklace dating from circa 1910. The necklace sold to a buyer on the telephone for £194,500. Two more pearl necklaces shone among the top five prices. A single row pearl necklace composed of 70 pearls captured the heart of one determined telephone bidder who secured the necklace for a staggering £110,500 – more than ten times its £7,000-9,000 pre-sale estimate. A three row necklace of natural saltwater pearls quadrupled estimates to sell for £92,500. A natural pearl and diamond ring near tripled its £15,000-20,000 estimates as it sold for £47,500. The single natural saltwater pearl on an intricately engraved band, is delicately set throughout with diamonds. It’s not just British royalty who are pearl fans. America’s First Lady Michelle Obama is often seen wearing her favourite double-stranded pearl necklace and fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker has long been a fan of pearls. Big fans: Lady Michelle Obama is often seen wearing her favourite double stranded pearl necklace, left, while Sarah Jessica Parker has long been a fan of pearls . Royal seal of approval: The Duchess of Cornwall, left, and the Queen often wears pearls - Bonhams believe natural pearls are now hitting record prices because of their rarity . She wore an eye-catching strand of pearls at the launch of her pop-up shop in New York in February and regularly accessorises her outfits with pearls. Thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge and Sarah Jessica Parker, pearl wearers are becoming younger and championed by the fashion faces such as Rihanna and Cara Delevingne . Other pearl fans include singer Katy Perry, Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Johansson. Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams said: 'Pearls were once seen as a bit dated - perhaps the preserve of an older generation, but we’ve seen a complete change in how they are viewed. 'A younger fashion set is now completely at home wearing classic pearl earrings and you’re as likely to see them in nightclubs and premieres as you are at Ascot or the Epsom Derby.' Cool factor: The gem has suddenly become cool and worn by the likes of Jessie J, left, and Rihanna . Bonhams says investors are increasingly snapping up rare natural pearls because of their increasing rarity. Really good examples of natural pearl - based on size, uniform shape, lustre and blemish-free skins - do not appear on the market as often as they used to. Miss Ghika added: 'They are a rare commodity and it is often very difficult to find good quality examples. Quite simply, the supply of natural pearls is not going to increase. 'Long-term, they will become more of a rarity and therefore even more highly prized. As a result, pearls that have some age, or were part of a historic collection, can be highly appealing to potential buyers and investors.' The auction house has recently recorded record sales of natural pearls, including a pair of natural pearl and diamond earrings which sold for £290,500 in April - double their estimate. Through the ages: Long-term, they will become more of a rarity and therefore even more highly-prized, said Bonhams of the gem loved by Princess Diana, left, and heiress Huguette Clark in the early 1900s . They also auctioned a single natural pearl measuring 11.5mm mounted as a ring, which sold in April for £30,000, ten times the upper estimate and a long single strand of graduated natural pearls measuring 5.5mm-8.5mm, which sold for £87,600 in April 2012, more than double the pre-sale estimate. A rare pearl worn as one of a pair of earrings for years has just sold at auction for a world record £811,000. It was worn as jewellery by a lady who had no idea how much it was worth and two large round pearls made up the earrings that had been given to her as a gift by her husband. He later showed them to experts who identified one of the gems as a natural pearl. A pearl is produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusc. Pearls that occur spontaneously in the wild - or 'natural pearls' - are rare but extremely valuable and are made up of nearly 100 per cent calcium carbonate and conchiolin. They come in a variety of shapes but, the rounder they are, the more valuable. Cultured pearls, however, are the result of the a piece of mantle tissue from a shell being transplanted into another shell. The only way to differentiate between natural and cultured is via X-ray at a gem-testing laboratory - a cultured pearl will show a different structure. Imitation pearls are made of mother-of-pearl, coral or conch shell. £2.19m is one of most expensive pearls to be auctioned at Christie's.","Pearls fetching far above estimate prices at auction .

Action man: Mr Putin embarking on his dive at the underwater archaeological site at Phanagoria on the Taman Peninsula, Russia in August . But his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview shown Tuesday on the Dozhd TV channel that the jugs had been found earlier by archaeologists and placed there for Mr Putin. 'Look, Putin didn't find down there jugs that had lain there for many thousands of years. It's obvious,' Mr Peskov said in response to questions from the interviewers. 'Of course, they were found in the course of an expedition several weeks or days earlier,' he said. 'Of course, they were left there or placed there. It's completely normal. There's no reason to gloat about this and everything else.' Mr Putin is noted for his habit of appearing . in vigorous and adventurous settings, including fishing and hunting . while stripped to the waist and riding with leather-clad bikers.

Rugged outdoorsman: Left, Putin attends a meeting of motor bikers at their camp at Gasfort Lake near Sevastopol in Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula. Right, he fishes in the Yenisei River in Siberia . Mr Peskov's comments were an unusually candid glimpse into the cultivation of Mr Putin's image as a tough man of action. Previous appearances, which have shown Mr Putin hunting, riding horseback and admiring a tranquilised polar bear, have boosted his popularity, but have also prompted bitter comments on blogs and social media. Mr Peskov's rare interview with a television station that has been critical of the government could reflect authorities' concerns about a negative attitude to Mr Putin's re-election bid among the nation's intellectuals and middle class.

He and President Dmitry Medvedev announced last month they had agreed that Mr Putin would run for the presidency and Mr Medvedev would be named prime minister.

"A rugby coach and father-of-three has died after apparently suffering an allergic reaction shortly after being stung by wasps. William Lay, 43, had been getting tools out of his garage when he was stung by the insects. The popular man from Oxford was rushed to hospital where doctors battled to save his life, but his reaction to the sting was so severe that he fell into a coma and died four days later. Coma: Father-of-three William lay died four days after being rushed to hospital with wasp stings . In a statement, Oxford Rugby Club, wrote: 'Will was stung by wasps while getting tools out of his garage and suffered a major allergic reaction. 'He will be remembered for his enthusiasm and calm demeanor - two traits ideally suited for coaching children. 'The club wishes to pass on their deepest sympathy to his immediate family, especially his three children, Matt, Ollie and Tilly, two of whom played for Oxford. 'This has come as a huge shock, not just to the age group that Will coached, but to the club as a whole. He was a very popular and hardworking club member. 'Not only did he give up a considerable amount of his time in his role as a coach, but he was also fully involved in any social or fundraising events held by the club. 'He will be sorely missed and our thoughts are with his family at this sad time.' South Central Ambulance Service spokesman Michelle Archer confirmed that ambulances were called just before 8.15am on July 30 to the house in Netherton, near Fyfield, Oxfordshire, following reports of a man in a 'life-threatening condition'. Emergency: Mr Lay was rushed to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, but doctors were unable to save the father-of-three . The air ambulance, a road ambulance and a rapid response car were sent to the scene. Paramedics treated Mr Lay at the scene and he was then taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in the road ambulance with a doctor from the air ambulance helping paramedics. Fyfield Parish Council chairman John Watts said he believed Mr Lay had an epipen with him at the time of the sting. This allows those with a history of anaphylaxis - a severe type of allergic reaction caused by things such as wasp stings and nuts - to inject adrenaline into themselves. Mr Watts added: 'I know he was stunned and then went into shock. They tried to revive him, but it didn’t work.' Mark Ainsworth-Smith, a consultant practitioner with South Central Ambulance Service, said that an epipen will buy an extra five minutes. He added: 'It’s life-threatening unless treatment is given fairly quickly, which is why patients are given epipens to buy them time. 'Usually a reaction to a sting will start within minutes, and can be fatal after five minutes.' Mr Lay’s funeral will be held at St Nicholas Church, Fyfield, on Monday. Deadly: People can suffer an allergic reaction to wasp stings which can prove fatal if they do not receive medical treatment quickly enough .","Village mourns the sudden death of a father-of-three after sting .

"Former Liverpool director of football Damien Comolli believes his Anfield legacy should be gauged on the burgeoning career of Jordan Henderson rather than the scars left by the Andy Carroll saga. Comolli was instrumental in buying Carroll for £35million in the January transfer window of 2011 - still the highest fee ever paid for an Englishman - only to see the striker score just 11 goals in 58 appearances in all competitions before being offloaded on loan initially and then permanently to West Ham for £15million. However, Comolli was also responsible for taking Henderson from Sunderland to Anfield for around £20million and the England midfielder and Liverpool vice-captain is tipped to take the armband full-time when Steven Gerrard leaves for the United States at the end of the season. Damien Comolli played a major role in bringing Jordan Henderson and Andy Carroll to Anfield . Former Liverpool director of football Comolli was sacked by the Premier League club in April 2012 . Andy Carroll - £35million . Stewart Downing - £20m . Craig Bellamy - Free . Jordan Henderson - £16m . Luis Suarez - £22m . Jose Enrique - £5m . Charlie Adam - £9m . Sebastian Coates - £7m . A defiant Comolli believes the Carroll episode should be consigned to history, saying: 'The decision was made in a conference call between the owners, myself, Kenny Dalglish (the manager at the time) and the commercial director at the time who is now chief executive, Ian Ayre. 'We made the decision collectively, knowing exactly the money we would lose if it did not work out, and they said they were happy to go ahead with the transfer. 'I will stick to what I have always said about Andy Carroll. When he is fit, he is unplayable. When he has been fit at West Ham, he has shown what he can do, scoring goals, making assists, being a constant threat. 'When people say we made a mistake, I'm still not convinced we made a mistake. It's just we haven't seen the best of Andy Carroll because of all the injuries.' Henderson, pictured with Brendan Rodgers, is expected to replace Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain . Comolli insists the success of Henderson at Anfield, plus the development of winger Raheem Sterling and full back Jon Flanagan, only highlights the need for the continuity and stability he believes is provided by a director of football. The 42-year-old, who was also director of football at Tottenham and who was passing on his experience this week to future sporting directors in a lecture at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'Nothing is guaranteed. 'What we do is try to lower the risk in the decision-making process. But we are dealing with human beings. It is not as though we are buying shares or property. 'Sometimes things work out, sometimes they don't. Sometimes life gets in the way of talent, sometimes there are injuries, sometimes the player doesn't adapt to one place. Comolli helped Liverpool conclude a deal for then Ajax striker Luis Suarez in January 2011 . 'I don't think I have to justify whether Carroll was a good decision or a bad decision. Look at it as a whole. When people talk to me nowadays about Liverpool, they say what a fantastic job you did in bringing players like Luis Suarez and Jordan Henderson to the club. 'The issue I have got is when a group of owners approach somebody like me and say we want to invest for the long term, we want you to sign young players, we want you to put together a squad which has a future for the next three to five years, we want you to work with the academy and we start to do all this and after a few months or a few years they say: ""Sorry, it's not working out"". 'You cannot say you have to focus on the future and at the same time say the young players are not ready to compete at the top level. 'When I left Liverpool, the owners told me Henderson was a massive mistake. Now he's turned out to be the next Liverpool captain and he's a regular in every game.' The two-year Masters in Sporting Directorship course was launched in 2014 at Manchester Metropolitan University and prepares candidates from across sport for a strategic role at a club or in a league.

'But his entry into the vehicle was delayed by his friends arguing with heavily-armed Gendarme, while a woman tried to act as peacemaker so the man could get medical attention quickly. 'It was a chaotic scene. A lot of drinking has taken place. It has to be said the vast majority of Everton fans have been well-behaved and there are families there too. But there is also a belligerent minority who are not making things easy, though the police will also have to look at themselves and ask if they have been too heavy-handed. 'Despite a warning from Everton's official Twitter feed, hundreds of their supporters remained in the square this afternoon.' The mood seemed relaxed and jovial as the 7,000-strong Everton faithful looked forward to the game before an act of aggression seemed to spark riot police into action. Everton say the trouble started when a plainclothes officers went to arrest a supporter who was misbehaving. Everton fans thought it was local Lille follower giving the man hassle and retaliated. He ran from police and it sparked the confrontation which led to CS gas and pepper spray being used. The supporter, who was taken off to hospital in an ambulance, had a  bloodied gash above his left eye that came from a a CS Gas canister that was fired by police. Back in the square, a loud bang rattled through the area as the police let off the first of three tear gas bombs. With shields covering their bodies, the police move aggressively through a group of Everton fans, knocking one to the ground as the second tear gas bomb was released. Fans were left rubbing their eyes and sneezing, and they attempted to flee the scene as bottles flew across the square. Several fans seemed extremely shaken by the events and the majority  felt they had been victims of another unprovoked attack. One fan shouted, 'they've got rubber bullets', which the police reportedly used to stem any further aggression from either set of fans, although there were no Lille fans in sight. The away support certainly seemed to be the victims as the mood in the square had been a pleasant one for the majority of the afternoon.

"Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside and former manager Sammy Lee have appeared in court to face allegations of perjury in relation to the £1million transfer of Gavin McCann. They were among nine defendants – including Bolton secretary Simon Marland, agent Jerome Anderson and former Bolton director of football Frank McParland (now at Brentford) - who appeared at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday morning. The private prosecution has been brought by agent Tony McGill, who claims Bolton and Sports Entertainment Media (SEM) cut him out of the deal which saw McCann move to Bolton from Aston Villa in 2007. Phil Gartside, the Bolton  chairman leaves Newcastle Magistrates Court having appeared in court with other senior football figures to face perjury charges relating to a legal battle over a £1 million transfer deal . McCann – who is now retired - did not attend but will appear next week on four counts of perjury and one of fraud by false representation. Former England international Lee – now on the coaching staff at Southampton – was in charge of Bolton at the time. No pleas were entered and the case has been sent to Newcastle Crown Court where it will be heard on March 11. Mr McGill lost his original case last September when he tried to sue Bolton and SEM for £300,000. However, the judge at Manchester civil justice centre described him as ‘credible’ and the outcome of his legal battle as ‘unfortunate’. Former Bolton manager Sammy Lee leaves Newcastle Magistrates Court . That gave him the determination to fund the private prosecution himself, which Sportsmail understands already totals more than £500,000. Lisa Judge, representing the defendants from Bolton Wanderers, said: ‘There will be an application to dismiss forthwith.’ Each of the defendants stood up and gave their name, date of birth and address at the beginning of the hearing.

Just married: The soldier's bride is seen leaving the registry office after their wedding ceremony . Friends and family who attended the wedding had to give in their phones to make sure photographs of the happy couple weren't leaked. The couple have signed a photo deal with Hello! magazine for an undisclosed sum. Dressed in full military uniform, the 33-year-old soldier arrived for the ceremony just before 11am via a back entrance. The waiting media didn't catch a glimpse of 27-year-old bride-to-be Mallissa's arrival as she was also ushered into the venue through a side entrance. Further efforts were made to keep Mallissa's dress under wraps when she left after the hour-long service.

Newlyweds: The couple, seen on the red carpet at an event in November, are thought to have been dating for two years . Dressed in full military uniform, the 33-year-old soldier arrived for the ceremony this morning via a back entrance . But she was glimpsed wearing a long, . black velvet cape to cover her flowing lace wedding dress as she got . into a white Rolls Royce at the back of the building. Cpl Beharry left in a separate car minutes later as the wedding party made their way to a further ceremony at the Queen's Chapel of the Savoy, also in London, by coach. The bridesmaids were dressed in long, red strapless gowns and the flower girls wore powder pink dresses with white fur shrugs. Colourful: Ms Noel's bridesmaids (left) wore floor-length red gowns for the ceremony in London . Johnson Beharry was born one of eight children on the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1979. He moved to Britain in 1999, joining the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 2001, serving first in Kosovo then Northern Ireland. On 1 May 2004, Beharry was driving an Armoured Vehicle in Iraq when it came under fire from rocket propelled grenades. Beharry was forced to open his hatch to steer his vehicle, exposing his face and head to attack. He gallantly steered the crippled Warrior through the ambush, leading five other Warriors to safety. He then rescued wounded comrades from the vehicle, all the time exposed to enemy fire. He received the Victoria Cross, the highest honour in the British and Commonwealth armed forces, for twice saving members of his unit from ambushes on 1 May and again on 11 June 2004 at Al-Amarah, Iraq. It was in his second rescue that he sustained serious head injuries. Beharry became the first recipient in 2005 of the Victoria Cross since the Falklands War of 1982. He is one of only six living recipients of the VC. Wedding guests were seen arriving . from 10.30am, including Cpl Beharry's brother Jade, who was dressed in a . black suit, red tie and grey waistcoat. Ben Duncan, a former Celebrity Big Brother contestant and close friend of Beharry's, also attended. The couple got married in the Blue Room at the registry office which holds up to 30 guests. It is believed the newlyweds were due to be serenaded later by the Army Wives Choir during a bash in the Senate House at University College London. Mallissa, who is from Cpl Beharry's native Grenada, first appeared by his side at a charity bash in London last November. It is thought the pair have been dating for two years. Speaking after the wedding, Michael Noel, Mallissa's brother, said: 'It's a happy day. 'They have been together for two years and I wish them a long and happy life together,' said Mr Noel. The bride's brother said guests had travelled from Grenada and Miami to be with the couple on their big day. 'We're just relieved it isn't snowing or raining,' he said. 'It's a lovely day for a wedding.' The union is Cpl Beharry's second marriage. He split from first wife Lynthia in 2005, blaming the trauma of his war experiences.

Cpl Beharry was the first VC winner in over 30 years, and the first living one since 1969. Hero: Cpl Beharry was presented with the Victoria Cross in March 2005 . The medal was awarded for two acts of bravery when he was a private with 1st Battalion, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 2004. The first came in May when he led an ambushed patrol to safety, despite coming under heavy fire in a Warrior armoured vehicle. One month later, Cpl Beharry saved eight more soldiers despite suffering serious face and brain injuries when a grenade exploded inches from his head.

"This is the photo taken seconds before a safari tourist was seriously injured by a rhino - after she was allegedly urged to stand closer to the animal by a wildlife expert. Chantal Beyer, 24, was visiting the South African nature park with her boyfriend when they stopped to look at some rhinos. Afrikaans-language newspaper the Beeld reported that guide Alex Richter then advised them to stand a little closer seconds before the animal gored her from behind. Attack: Chantal Beyer, 24, pictured standing next to a rhino seconds before she was gored at a wildlife safari park in South Africa . He allegedly told a group of visitors to get out of their vehicle to take photos and even encouraged the rhinos to come closer with food. The photograph shows them only feet away from two white rhinos which can weigh up to two tons and stand as tall as 1.8metres. Just after the picture was taken, a huge bull rhino attacked, and its horn penetrated Ms Beyers' chest from behind, resulting in a collapsed lung and broken ribs. Injuries: Ms Beyer is understood to be in the intensive care unit at Krugersdorp hospital after being gored by the rhino . Ms Beyer, a bachelor of commerce student from Johannesburg, is now in an intensive care unit at a Krugersdorp hospital where she is said to be in stable condition, according to the Daily Telegraph. Mrs Beyer's uncle and family spokesman Thom Peeters told the Beeld: 'There were quite a few young people on the vehicle and they probably felt they could trust Richter, who was an adult.' South Africa's Aloe Ridge Hotel and Nature Reserve, where the incident took place, declined to comment today. On the resort's website it lists rhinos as one of a number of animals which visitors can see 'at close range'.","Chantal Beyer, 24, was attacked after getting out of her safari vehicle .

"A number of former soldiers have spoken out against the move because of the tough logistical life of fighters on the front line, even though many outsiders see Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's decision to lift the ban on women serving in combat positions as a progressive move. Some have spoken out about how the move ignores some of the realities of war, like disgusting unhygienic conditions and the way that soldiers are sometimes forced to change in front of one another, in favor of gender equality. One wrote a letter in the Wall Street Journal describing the conditions he faced on the front line when he was involved in the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003. Up . to 25 Marines at a time were packed into an amphibious assault vehicles . intended to hold only 15, with the Marines sitting ontop of one another . for long periods of time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fully integrated: The removal of the ban that will allow women to serve on the front line has been met with criticism from some former soldiers who believe that the close quarters of war may prove challenging . Should women soldiers be able to serve on the frontline? Should women soldiers be able to serve on the frontline? Now share your opinion . ‘Many Marines developed dysentery from the complete lack of sanitary conditions. When an uncontrollable urge hit a Marine, he would be forced to stand, as best he could, hold an MRE bag up to his rear, and defecate inches from his seated comrade's face,’ Ryan Smith wrote in the opinion piece. He went on to say that they were unable to change out of their chemical protective suits for nearly a month, and once they secured Baghdad, they finally changed out of the suits which were caked in blood and human filth at that point. ‘My unit stood there in a walled-in . compound in Baghdad, naked, sores dotted all over our bodies, feet . peeling, watching our suits burn. Later, they lined us up naked and . washed us off with pressure washers,’ he wrote. Welcoming: Mr Panetta said that women play an integral role in the combat mission . The . historic change, which was recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, . overturns a 1994 rule prohibiting women from being assigned to smaller . ground combat units. It will . be up to the military service chiefs to recommend and defend whether . women should be excluded from any of those more demanding and deadly . positions, such as Navy SEALs or the Army's Delta Force. The services . will have until January 2016 to make a case to that some positions . should remain closed to women. The change won't take place overnight: . Service chiefs will have to develop plans for allowing women to seek the . combat positions, a senior military official said. ‘My unit stood there in a walled-in . compound in Baghdad, naked, sores dotted all over our bodies, feet . peeling, watching our suits burn. Later, they lined us up naked and . washed us off with pressure washers' -Ryan Smith, former soldier . Some jobs may open as soon as this year, while assessments for others, such as special operations forces, may take longer. Some insiders remain hesitant about the move, saying that while it may seem progressive to incorporate all, it may not be the most efficient way to run an army. 'Every female troop I know (over the . age of 25) says publicly, ""Sure, open them up!"" And privately, ""But not . for me personally. I know I don't have the brute strength required and I . would be crushed to let down my colleagues -- so, no way, no thanks,""' an anonymous female Army officer told ABC News. Women's rights advocates say that concerns about female soldiers urinating or dealing with menstrual cycles while on the front lines are problems that have already been addressed. Nancy Duff Campbell, the co-president of the National Women's Law Center, told MailOnline that female soldiers already undergo a specific training course dedicated to discussing gender-specific hygiene issues. As a result, many use a tool called a Female Urinary Diversion Device (which effectively has a small tube that runs down one's pant leg) would allow women to urinate into a container if they were kept in a tank for a long period of time. Equality: Others see the lifting of the ban as a way to catch up with the progressive times . They also cover a number of ways to address their menstrual cycles by either taking daily menstruation suppressant pills. 'This isn't something new; part of this is a response to what has been going on for a long time,' Ms Duff Campbell said. 'I'm not particularly concerned about . the hygienic concerns. There might be privacy concerns that you'd like . to have but you cant have in a battle environment.' There long has been opposition to putting . women in combat, based on questions of whether they have the necessary . strength and stamina for certain jobs, or whether their presence might . hurt unit cohesion. But as news of Panetta's expected order . got out, many members of Congress, including the Senate Armed Services . Committee chairman, Democratic Senator Carl Levin announced their . support. ‘It reflects the reality of 21st century military operations,’ Levin said. Objections were few. Jerry Boykin, executive vice president of the Family Research Council, called the move ‘another social experiment’ that will place unnecessary burdens on military commanders. ‘While their focus must remain on winning the battles and protecting their troops, they will now have the distraction of having to provide some separation of the genders during fast moving and deadly situations,’ said Boykin, a retired Army lieutenant general. He noted that small units often are in sustained combat for extended periods of time under primal living conditions with no privacy. Panetta's move comes in his final . weeks as Pentagon chief and just days after President Barack Obama's . inaugural speech in which he spoke passionately about equal rights for . all. The new order expands . the department's action of nearly a year ago to open about 14,500 combat . positions to women, nearly all of them in the Army. Support: United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice expressed her support for the measure . Changing qualifications: Senior defense officials say Pentagon chief Leon Panetta is removing the military's ban on women serving in combat . In an afternoon press conference confirming the news alongside Joint Chiefs chairman General Martin Dempsey, Mr Panetta said that not everyone can meet the qualifications to be a combat soldier. But, he said, everyone is entitled to the chance. He said the qualifications will not be reduced, and with women playing a broader role, the military will be strengthened. Former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch calls it good news for the U.S. military that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says women can serve in combat roles. The West Virginia resident says women have long been integral to victories in the fight for freedom. Lynch was 19 when she was captured after her Army unit took a wrong turn and came under attack in Iraq in 2003. She was rescued after nine days in captivity. Lynch urges Americans to support military men and women, and to push U.S. officials to ensure they have proper training and equipment. In addition to questions of strength . and performance, there also have been suggestions that the American . public would not tolerate large numbers of women being killed in war. Under . the 1994 Pentagon policy, women were prohibited from being assigned to . ground combat units below the brigade level. A brigade is roughly 3,500 . troops split into several battalions of about 800 soldiers each. On the front lines: The move lifts a ban that was put in place in 1994 . Historically, brigades were based farther from the front lines, and they often included top command and support staff. The . necessities of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, propelled women . into jobs as medics, military police and intelligence officers that . were sometimes attached — but not formally assigned — to battalions. Problem solver: The inclusion of women is believed it may help decrease the ever-growing number of problems within the military, like sexual harassment and sexual assaults . So while a woman couldn't be assigned as an infantryman in a battalion going out on patrol, she could fly the helicopter supporting the unit, or move in to provide medical aid if troops were injured. And these conflicts, where battlefield . lines are blurred and insurgents can lurk around every corner, have . made it almost impossible to keep women clear of combat. Still, . as recent surveys and experiences have shown, it will not be an easy . transition. When the Marine Corps sought women to go through its tough . infantry course last year, two volunteered and both failed to complete . the course. And there may not be a wide clamoring from women for the . more intense, dangerous and difficult jobs, including some infantry and . commando positions. 'I know, . you still hear: ""It’s a man’s military."" But we are all service . members,' Terri Kaas, an Air Force veteran who served in Germany and . Bahrain, told The Today Show. 'Look . at the Marine Corps — they have equal standards of fitness for both . genders. If the men can’t respect women for the job they’re doing maybe . these men shouldn’t be in the military.' Two . lawsuits were filed last year challenging the Pentagon's ban on women . serving in combat, adding pressure on officials to overturn the policy. Military services have been studying the issue and surveying their forces to determine how it may affect performance and morale. The Joint Chiefs have been meeting regularly on the matter and they unanimously agreed to send the recommendation to Panetta earlier this month. A senior military official familiar with the discussions said the chiefs laid out three main principles to guide them as they move through the process. Those were to maintain America's effective fighting force, preserve military readiness and develop a process that would give all service members the best chance to succeed. Women comprise about 14 per cent of the 1.4 million active military personnel. More than 280,000 women have been sent to Iraq, Afghanistan or to jobs in neighboring nations in support of the wars. Of the more than 6,600 U.S. service members who have been killed, 152 have been women. The senior military official said the military chiefs must report back to Panetta with their initial implementation plans by May 15.","Ex-soldiers tell of how they often have to relieve themselves inches away from one another inside cramped tanks .

"A three-year-old girl may have had Winnie The Pooh ruined forever after she caught a woman and a man in a Tigger costume having sex in a public toilet. The man, dressed as the beloved children's book character, and the woman, who was naked, had retreated to a public bathroom in Dawlish, Devon, when the little girl accidentally walked in on them. The couple  then allegedly slammed the door shut so quickly, the three-year-old's hand was caught and the girl bruised her fingers. The wonderful thing about Tiggers: The three-year-old girl caught a man wearing a Tigger costume and a naked woman having sex in this public toiled in Dawlish, Devon . The couple had been spotted in the area earlier in the day, with the woman allegedly dressed as a leprechaun, celebrating Halloween with a large group of people. The three-year-old and her mother were in a public bathroom in Dawlish, a town with a population of just under 13,000, as the couple were having sex in the baby changing room. The little girl's grandmother flagged up the incident on the neighbourhood police's Facebook, saying she was 'disgusted' that the event had taken place.

"A chemical used in foam cups and disposable food containers may cause cancer, scientists have warned. Styrene can be 'reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen', the National Research Council in the U.S. said yesterday. The conclusion was reached by a team of 10 experts in toxicology, chemistry and medicine. Styrene - the chemical used in foam cups and disposable food containers - can be 'reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen', the National Research Council in the U.S. said yesterday . '[However] 'I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a hazard . assessment,' Dr Jane Henney, who chaired the research council's . committee of experts, told Newsday. The declaration means there is 'scientific evidence . suggesting that styrene causes cancer, but there may be alternative explanations, such as chance, bias or confounding factors', explained Dr Henney, who led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration during the Clinton era. 'Our report says this chemical could be a problem, but a full . risk-assessment on dose, exposure, quantification and further . characterization of the risk would need to be done before one would . think about regulation in this area,' she added. Dr Henney also stressed that the term  'reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen', was far from emphatic - unlike, say, factors such as tobacco. And that the Council's latest ruling was in the line of that three years ago, when concerns were raised about the possible links between styrene and cancer. But industry experts say regulatory agencies have deemed polystyrene safe for use in contact with food and drink . The National Research Council is a major policy body and . division of the National Academies, which includes the Institute of . Medicine, the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of . Engineering. The American Chemistry Council has previously defended styrene, saying: 'Polystyrene plastic has been used in foodservice products - foam coffee cups, salad bar takeout containers, cutlery - for more than five decades. 'Polystyrene has been reviewed by regulatory agencies that have deemed it safe for use in contact with food. 'For example, polystyrene meets the stringent standards of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission/European Food Safety Authority for use in packaging to store and serve food.' Earlier this month British scientists . warned that more than 170 dangerous chemicals - including styrene - are legally used in the . production of food packaging. The Food Packaging Forum warned the toxic substances, which were . found to cause cancer and inflict changes on genes, could end up in the . food they contain. But the Food Standards Agency moved to . reassure consumers, explaining all food packaging falls within European . standards and the presence of the chemicals are of no concern if they . are used within the 'limits or restrictions' set for their use. The study, published in the journal Food Additives and Contaminants, discovered around 175 chemicals with varying affects. They . found the substances interfered with sperm production, caused genital . malformations and disrupted hormone production in the body.","Styrene can be 'reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen'

"Three years of observations show that the Antarctic ice sheet is now losing 159 gigatonnes (159 billion tonnes) of ice each year - twice as much as when it was last surveyed in 2012. A team of scientists from the UK Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, led by researchers at the University of Leeds, have produced the first complete assessment of Antarctic ice sheet elevation change. They used measurements collected by Esa's CryoSat-2 satellite mission, which carries an altimeter, an instrument to measure altitude, specially designed for this task. A survey from 2010 to 2013 by Esa's CryoSat-2 satellite shows that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is now losing 159 Gigatonnes of ice each year, enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 millimetres per year. Colour scale ranges in this image from -1 to +1 metres (3.3 feet) per year . In sharp contrast to previous altimeter missions, CryoSat-2 surveys virtually the entire Antarctic continent, reaching to within 135 miles (215 kilometres) of the South Pole. This has  enabled a fivefold increase in the sampling of coastal regions where today's ice losses are concentrated. 79.5 trillion laptops . 2.27 trillion people . 14.5 billion Hubble Space Telescopes . 381 million International Space Stations . 3.06 million Titanics . 430,000 Empire State Buildings . 397 times the world’s human population . 32 teaspoons of neutron star . 22% of the mass of carbon stored in Earth’s atmosphere . Overall, the pattern of imbalance continues to be dominated by glaciers thinning in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. However, thanks to the improved capabilities of CryoSat-2, problem areas such as the rugged terrain of the Antarctic Peninsula can now also be surveyed. On average West Antarctica lost 134 gigatonnes of ice, East Antarctica three gigatonnes, and the Antarctic Peninsula 23 gigatonnes in each year between 2010 and 2013 - a total loss of 159 gigatonnes each year. The polar ice sheets are a major contributor to global sea level rise and, when combined, the Antarctic losses detected by CryoSat-2 are enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 millimetres each year alone. The largest loss of ice is occurring at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, with the Pine Island Glacier shown here. West Antarctica is losing 139 gigatonnes of the total 159 gigatonnes every year, which is double the rate of ice loss from 2005 to 2010 . In West Antarctica, ice thinning has been detected in areas that were poorly surveyed by past satellite altimeter missions. These newly-mapped areas contribute additional losses that bring altimeter observations closer to estimates based on other approaches. But the average rate of ice thinning in West Antarctica has also increased, and this sector is now losing almost one third (31%) as much ice each year than it did during the five year period (2005 to 2010) prior to CryoSat-2's launch. Lead author Dr Malcolm McMillan from the University of Leeds said: 'We find that ice losses continue to be most pronounced along the fast-flowing ice streams of the Amundsen Sea sector, with thinning rates of between 4 and 8 metres [13 to 26 feet] per year near to the grounding lines of the Pine Island, Thwaites and Smith Glaciers.' This sector of Antarctica has long been identified as the most vulnerable to changes in climate and, according to recent assessments, its glaciers may have passed a point of irreversible retreat. Launched in 2010, CryoSat carries a radar altimeter that can 'see' through clouds and in the dark, providing continuous measurements over areas like Antarctica that are prone to bad weather and long periods of darkness. The radar can measure the surface height variation of ice in fine detail, allowing scientists to record changes in its volume with unprecedented accuracy. ESA¿s Earth Explorer CryoSat-2 mission (artist¿s illustration shown) was launched on 8 April 2010 and is dedicated to precise monitoring of changes in the thickness of marine ice floating in the polar oceans and variations in the thickness of the vast ice sheets that blanket Greenland and Antarctica . Professor Andrew Shepherd, also of the University of Leeds, who led the study, added: 'Thanks to its novel instrument design and to its near-polar orbit, CryoSat allows us to survey coastal and high-latitude regions of Antarctica that were beyond the capability of past altimeter missions, and it seems that these regions are crucial for determining the overall imbalance. 'Although we are fortunate to now have, in CryoSat-2, a routine capability to monitor the polar ice sheets, the increased thinning we have detected in West Antarctica is a worrying development. 'It adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are underway in this part of our planet, which has enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than a metre [3.3 feet]. 'The challenge is to use this evidence to test and improve the predictive skill of climate models.' And Professor David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey said: 'The increasing contribution of Antarctica to sea-level rise is a global issue, and we need to use every technique available to understand where and how much ice is being lost. 'Through some very clever technical improvements, McMillan and his colleagues have produced the best maps of Antarctic ice-loss we have ever had. 'Prediction of the rate of future global sea-level rise must begin with a thorough understanding of current changes in the ice sheets - this study puts us exactly where we need to be.' And finally Dr Ian Joughin at the University of Washington, author of a recent study simulating future Antarctic ice sheet losses, concluded: 'This study does a nice job of revealing the strong thinning along the Amundsen Coast, which is consistent with theory and models indicating this region is in the early stages of collapse.'","Esa's CryoSat-2 mission has provided new data on the Antarctic ice sheet .
It surveyed the region from 2010 to 2013 and found losses had doubled .
In total the ice sheet is losing 159 gigatonnes (159 billion tonnes) each year .
That is twice the rate of ice loss found in the last survey from 2005 to 2010 .
And just this loss alone will raise sea levels by half a millimetre a year .
But sea levels will rise much more when other factors are considered ."
"Police are hunting thieves who stole the bronze statue of a Second World War soldier from a memorial in a military town. The one-off statue, commissioned for the garrison town of Tidworth, Wiltshire, was taken by two men to sell on as scrap metal. Grainy CCTV footage shows two crooks taking 40 minutes to remove the sculpture from its plinth. They then carry it to their light-coloured car before speeding off. Disgusting: The Tidworth war memorial was paid for with £15,000 from the Royal British Legion but it has now been stolen for scrap metal . It is estimated the 4ft-high memorial, which was made 13 years ago and stands outside the Royal British Legion building, is worth £10,000. Its loss is the latest in a series of metal thefts up and down the country which have seen historic buildings targeted as well as power and rail companies. Legion secretary Ann Green said the callous theft was ‘unbelievable’. She said: ‘I think someone knew exactly what they were doing and exactly how much they would get for it when they took it. ‘I don’t think we will get it back now and Remembrance Sunday is in just two weeks. That means we will have a service around the plinth it was on. After: A double rainbow hangs over the stone plinth where the bronze statue of a World War II soldier used to stand . Saddened: Ann Green, the secretary of the Royal British Legion in Tidworth, holds a miniature bronze replica of the statue which had been the focus of memorial ceremonies in the Wiltshire town . ‘It was a statue of a Second World War soldier with his kit bag. ‘It . is meant to be that he has just come back from a battle. It is very . important to the community – we are a very strong military town. Everyone here is in complete disbelief – no one can believe that someone . would steal a remembrance statue because of what it is. Scrap metal theft across the UK has hit almost epidemic proportions. Some councils have reported the theft of manhole covers, wheelchair ramps and even children's playground equipment. Britain's railways and power supply companies are some of the hardest hit as metal prices continue to attract thieves looking for fast cash. Rail companies are having power and signalling equipment stolen on a daily basis across the network with British Transport Police admitting number of thefts 'is huge'. As police admit they are failing to keep up with the thefts around the country sparked by the global rise in metal prices there is growing pressure on the government to reform the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act. The coalition is considering licensing scrap metal dealers, banning them from dealing in cash and giving police powers to close rogue traders down. Minister are considering the crackdown on the industry worth £5bn a year to the economy. It is thought that more than 15,000 tonnes of metal is stolen in the UK each year. ‘I . think the motive was to steal it for scrap and get the money. We paid . £10,000 for it in 1998 but now I think the bronze will be worth more . than that.’ The . statue, by sculptor Vivien Mallock, was insured for £10,000, but the . rising price of metal means this will not cover the cost of replacing . it. The theft occurred on October 17, between 2.40am and 3.19am, with the thieves heading north on the A338. Sergeant Mark Freeman, from Wiltshire Police, said: ‘The statue is a one-off commissioned sculpture with a monetary value of £10,000, but its actual worth to the community is much more as a tribute and war memorial.’ The theft comes just a day after a bronze plaque was reported stolen from a war memorial in London. The plaque, measuring two feet by three feet, was taken from Radnor Gardens, Twickenham, last week. It shows a naval scene with two officers surveying the horizon while a rating works on the lower deck. Council leaders have vowed to replace it and have erected temporary CCTV cameras at the site. Leader of Richmond Council, Lord . True, appealed for its return saying: 'It is appalling that thieves have . damaged the war memorial so close to Remembrance Sunday. 'Anyone who knows who is responsible . and has any feeling for those in our armed forces still putting their . lives on the line should turn these people in.' Also last week, the lead roof of one of the most significant medieval ecclesiastical ruins in Britain was stolen. Police are investigating how thieves managed to remove 64 square feet of lead from the roof of the Bishop’s Palace in Lincoln. Lincolnshire Police have appealed for . witnesses to the audacious theft and have confirmed that the lead was . marked and therefore should be able to be identified and traced. English Heritage officials, who look . after and maintain the palace, have warned that the 'current theft . epidemic is one of the biggest threats to this country's heritage.' The organisation has already increased security measures at the medieval palace following metal thefts earlier this year. As far back as July, thieves stole a . huge bronze statue from Victoria Pier in Hull. ‘Voyage’ stood 6ft tall . and weighed nearly 50 stone. Footage: CCTV shows the moment that the bronze statue is taken, with the pair of thieves circled in red . In the summer the popular tourist attraction, Blackpool's model village, was targeted. A spokesman for the town's civic trust said at the time: 'The small lead roof tiles on the miniature houses were stolen. The metal thieves are taking everything, I've never known anything like it.' Almost a quarter of the county of Hertfordshire was cut adrift from its broadband connection last year because of the theft of telecoms cable. Meanwhile Lambeth Council in London had to close a library after it was flooded in heavy rain because it's copper roof had been stripped by theives. In June James Sorby, 22, was burnt so badly . that his daughter was unable to recognise him. He had been trying to . take cabling from an electricity sub-station in a disused Post Office . sorting room in Leeds, West Yorkshire. But before he could even touch the cable, a massive charge jumped a gap to his . body and he suffered severe . burns to his face and hands, a weakened heart, lost partial sight in his left . eye and lost movement in one of his hands. Thieves stole a two and a half ton bell from a cathedral in San Francisco. A spate of metal theftshas swept the city and the rest of the US thanks to the hike in global metal prices. The bell, five feet in diameter weighing in at 5300 pounds was expected to be sold off for scrap after being taken from The Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption in the city. Church officials believe the bell is worth $75,000 but it on the open market as scrap metal it mayonly fetch a fraction of its worth, perhaps for as little as $10,000. Metal prices have soared in recent months sparking a rise in thefts in the UK and the US. If the bell were fully made of copper and not its copper and tin mix it would fetch $19,000 at currentinflated copper prices. Investigating officers are still puzzled as to how the massive bell was moved.","Crooks caught on CCTV footage carrying statue to waiting car .

"Arsene Wenger will step up his search for holding midfielders in the wake of the defensive debacle against Monaco — but the club fear that they will be unable to prise Christoph Kramer from Bayer Leverkusen. Arsenal identified Kramer, Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin and Lars Bender, also at Bayer Leverkusen, as transfer targets. Germany international Kramer is top of their list — but the 24-year-old extended his deal at Leverkusen until June 2019 in December. Arsenal are looking to try and sign Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Christoph Kramer . Kramer is on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach and has never actually played of Leverkusen . Curiously, Kramer has never played for Leverkusen, having been on loan at Vfl Bochum and Borussia Monchengladbach, where he played so well he was selected for Germany’s World Cup- winning squad, starting in the final. But having been ignored by Leverkusen until now, it will be politically embarrassing for him to leave the club in a £20million deal without ever playing for the first team. When he signed his new deal, Leverkusen announced that he would return to them next season and be a key player. Inquiries will be made as to whether the club would sell, though the new contract makes any negotiation difficult. The 24-year-old could cost up to £20 million, and recently signed a new contract with the club until 2019 . Kramer's form while on loan last season earned him a place in Germany's World Cup winning squad . The holding midfielder started the World Cup final, but was taken off early on because of an injury . Kramer’s return to Leverkusen may, however, open the way for Arsenal to sign Bender. If Kramer returns and is not for sale, Arsenal will hope that the Bundesliga club will be willing to let Bender go and he could provide an alternative — and Arsenal might be able to sign him for around £15m. Southampton, meanwhile, would hold out for £25m for Schneiderlin. Arsenal’s lack of world-class players in that position means that recruitment is a necessity this summer. Francis Coquelin is expected to sign a new four-year deal in the coming weeks but there is a recognition at the club that it will become increasingly hard for club captain Mikel Arteta to maintain his position in the starting XI when he returns from injury. If Kramer proves to be unavailable Arsenal could look at his Leverkusen club-mate Lars Bender (centre) Southampton star Morgan Schneiderlin (right) is another option that Arsene Wenger is considering . Likewise, Mathieu Flamini, who has one year left on his deal, is regarded as a squad player rather than a first-team starter. Meanwhile Wenger has reacted to Jose Mourinho’s latest barb by implying that Arsenal, who take on Everton today, are not wholly out of the title race. Mourinho went on TV last week to say that Wenger had a ‘dream job’ but that he didn’t understand why the team wasn’t challenging Chelsea and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table. Wenger said: ‘Leave Mourinho out of here, it would be much better. Let’s wait until the end of the season, we have 48 points today. We will see at the end of the season.’","Arsenal hoping to sign Leverkusen holding player Christoph Kramer .

"A report reveals anti-cholinergic drugs - used to treat asthma, high blood pressure, insomnia, dizziness and diarrhoea –- even affect everyday activities such as eating and getting dressed . Many drugs prescribed to the elderly could be to blame for a decline in their mental and physical abilities, warn doctors. A report reveals anti-cholinergic drugs – used to treat asthma, high blood pressure, insomnia, dizziness and diarrhoea – even affect everyday activities such as eating and getting dressed. Up to half of the UK’s elderly population are prescribed at least one medication with anti-cholinergic properties, which include antidepressants, antihistamines, sleeping pills and antipsychotics. The heart drug digoxin, the blood thinner warfarin and the painkiller codeine have a mild anti-cholinergic effect. Those with more severe effects include the antidepressant Seroxat, a drug for an overactive bladder called oxybutynin and schizophrenia drug clozapine. Others are sold over the counter, such as some hay fever and heartburn remedies. These medications affect the brain by blocking a key chemical messenger called acetylcholine, which has a range of functions. As a result the drugs may trigger side-effects including dizziness, sedation, confusion, delirium, constipation and blurred vision, which although uncomfortable for young users may aggravate existing health problems in the elderly. The research, by a number of centres including the University of East Anglia and the Regenstrief Institute in the US, will be published next month in Age and Ageing, a journal of the British Geriatrics Society. It looked at 46 worldwide studies that included 60,944 patients who had taken anti-cholinergic medications for up to ten years. Two-thirds of studies were carried out in care homes, the remainder in hospitals. A number of studies found the drugs were linked to a deterioration in physical function, while others showed a ‘negative effect’ on cognitive function. The higher the dose of anti-cholinergic medication, the lower the physical functioning, which could be a cause of falls. The drugs may trigger side-effects including dizziness, sedation, confusion,  and blurred vision. File picture . Dr Chris Fox, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, said: ‘This is the first research to show a significant decline in physical, as well as cognitive, function. ‘This means patients could become less and less able to carry out everyday activities like walking around, feeding themselves, washing and getting dressed. ‘This is likely due to the direct effect on cholinergic neurons compounded by an increase in the blood-brain permeability. ‘We have also seen the type of drug may be important, and more research needs to be done to ascertain which types are more dangerous than others.’ The researchers advise that rather than taking sleeping pills with anti-cholinergic properties, people could skip naps, limit evening exercise and remove distractions from the bedroom. Meanwhile, hospitals and nursing homes could work to keep older folk awake and stimulated during the day, naturally encouraging sleepiness, they said.","Antidepressants, antihistamines, sleeping pills among common medicines .

"World champion sprinter Richard Kilty has rejoined Linford Christie’s training group in a move he hopes will see him break the 10 second barrier for 100 metres for the first time. Kilty, who won a surprise 60m indoor gold in Sopot last year, had been coached by the former Olympic Champion in 2012 but was forced to leave Christie after his Lottery funding was cut for a short time. He relocated to Loughborough to work under Rana Reider but the American coach left British Athletics last year and Kilty, who has set his sights on becoming the first white Briton to break the 10sec barrier, will return to London to work with Christie.

James Ellington is going to be there as well. They need that hard work atmosphere.’ Kilty, nicknamed The Teeside Tornado, began the 2015 indoor season at the Glasgow International Match on Saturday but was disqualified for a false start. ‘It was a tragedy for him but stuff happens,’ said Black, ‘I think he dealt with it well. He is learning, developing and maturing as a person all the time and has more to come as an athlete.’ Richard Kilty (centre) is disqualified in the Men's 60m during the Glasgow International Match on Saturday .

Olympic heptathlon Champion Jessica Ennis-Hill will almost certainly be among their number. The 28-year-old is working hard in the gym and on the track following the birth of her first baby, Reggie. ‘I truly think that she believes and wants to recapture that greatness,’ said Black, ‘She certainly knows it is not going to be easy, but I think there is a genuine desire to go back and see what she can do and do it again.’","Previously worked with former Olympic Champion Linford Christie  in 2012 .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is among the best performers aged 23 or under in the world and a few Barclays Premier League youngsters are keeping him company in a new star-studded list just revealed. CIES Football Observatory have compiled the top 12 for rigour, take-ons, recovery, chance creation, distribution and shooting - using statistics to analyse and narrow them down. Juventus starlet Pogba features in three of the six categories and is joined by  familiar names, such as Barcelona's Neymar, Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane and Liverpool's Raheem Sterling. Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is currently among the best performers aged 23 or under . Pogba has been showing those at Old Trafford what they're missing out on at Italian club Juventus . Here are how the CIES Football Observatory Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) work: . Shooting: ability to take advantage of goal opportunities through accurate shooting . Chance creation: ability to put team-mates in a good position to score . Take on: ability to create dangerous situations by successfully challenging opponents . Distribution: ability to keep a hold on the game through efficient passing . Recovery: ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through proficient interception work . Rigour: ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling . Pogba has been letting those at Old Trafford know what they missed out on after Sir Alex Ferguson allowed the France international to leave in 2012. Yet the 21-year-old fails to make the top five, despite featuring for distribution (12th), take-ons (12th) and shooting (11th). In terms of chances created and shooting, two players represent the Premier League in the best five. Tottenham's Kane is second only to Barcelona's Neymar for shooting, while CIES Football Observatory find Liverpool's Sterling is fourth for chances created. The top creator of chances is Real Madrid's Isco as the 22-year-old fights for his place at the Bernabeu alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. 1. Isco (Real Madrid) 2. Yunus Malli (Mainz) 3.

Staying on attack-minded players, Arsenal will be glad to see Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain top the list for take-ons. The 21-year-old last featured for Arsene Wenger's side in a 2-0 win over Premier League champions Manchester City at the Etihad and was substituted after 66 minutes. Sneaking in at fifth is Sterling, hot on the heels of Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, Paris Saint-Germain's Lucas Mourinho and Palermo's Paulo Dybala respectively. In terms of distribution, PSG's Marco Verratti tops the list but in third is Tottenham's Christian Eriksen. Not only has the 22-year-old scored winners against Sunderland and Leicester City, and  single-handedly got Tottenham to the Capital One Cup final, he has the distribution to match. 1.

"When young soldier Pan Zhishan was torn apart from his new wife amid the chaos of war 70 years ago, he never gave up hope that he would see her again. He married Zhang Suiyu while preparing to take on the invading Japanese forces in south-eastern China's Fujian province. The pair were forced apart when the conflict ended and Pan was ordered back to his parents' home in another province, where they had arranged an approved marriage for him. But Pan, now 90, and Zhang were never able to forget each other - and now seven decades later they have been reunited after an astonishing internet tracking triumph by local netizens. Together again: Veteran Chinese soldier Pan Zhishan is reunited with his wife Zhang Suiyu 70 years after being torn apart by their families following the Second Sino-Japanese War . Came from traditional families: The couple (pictured with their grandson) were forced apart when Pan was ordered back to his parents' home in another province, where they had arranged an approved marriage for him . 'What took you so long?' asked Zhang, now 88, when the pair finally met up in Fujian province on China's Valentine's Day at the weekend. 'I know. I am so late,' said Pan as the pair embraced. Pan added: 'We both came from traditional families and we knew it was forbidden to marry without their permission - but we both expected to be dead at any moment so we snatched what joy we could from life.'

'I got on with my new life, but I never forgot my first love. 'Some years after I'd left she'd sent me a picture of herself and of our son. I was shocked and always kept the pictures with me wherever I went.' By 2003, the urge to rediscover his first family was too much and Pan disappeared from his family to track down Zhang. 'Her village was gone and all the people in it had left years ago. It was one frustrating dead end after another and I thought I'd left it too late,' he said. But last weekend the pair were finally reunited, along with their grandson, after an internet campaign by local media. 'I can't believe we're together again,' said Pan.

"Sci-fi fans have long dreamed of having a robotic assistant like R2D2 or Rosie the housecleaning robot in The Jetsons. And while some of the droid’s functions may be a few years off, a new generation of helpful robots have arrived and can act as everything from personal assistants to camera operators. While they may be designed to do different jobs, a handful of the robots featured at the RoboBusiness conference in Boston have one thing in common – they are designed to follow their leader. Scroll down for videos . A robot called Budgee is designed to follow people to carry heavy items, such as shopping (illustrated). It is able to carry 50lbs (23kg) of shopping and follows at a comfortable distance from its owner .

Made by Five Elements Robotics, the robotic assistant looks friendly and features a netted basket. To make Budgee follow, its owner will wear a small device and uses an app to set the distance between them and the following robot. The helpful droid will be able to tail its owners at speeds of up to 2.4mph (3.9kph) and send them a text if it can’t keep up. Sensors prevent it from falling down steps or bumping into obstacles. Budgee will come in different sizes, be able to be folded up and weighs 20lbs (9kg), while it will be capable of carting around 50lbs (23kg). It will go on sale in January from $1,400 (£879).

The AirDog has a flight time of up to 15 minutes, and can reach speeds of 40 mph. Take-off and landing is completely autonomous, and the AirDog has preset flight modes to track different sports - including surfing, motocross, wakeboarding and skateboarding. The firm say the key to the drone is the algorithm it uses to track people. 'It took a year and countless caffeine-fuelled hours, that were spent hacking intelligent flight code algorithms,' said Edgars Rozentals, CEO and founder of Helico Aerospace Industries, who came up with the $995 (£625) drone which could be pre-ordered via Kicktstarter. Following drones are also useful in industrial settings. Harvey, a bot made by Harvest Automation, can work in groups to tend plants in nurseries, for example. A real drive-thru: In a chinese reaturant, robot waiters follow tracks painted on the floor to carry food to tables from the kitchen, where they collect dishes prepared by a robotic chef that are placed on a conveyor belt . ‘Strings’ of bots follow patterns marked out on the floor, using a Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) to work out humans to follow and obstacles to avoid. While the following system is more precise, Lidar is expensive and the robots cost $30,000 (£18,837) each. More simple following technology is already been used in everyday settings. For example,  robotic waiters carry food to hungry diners by following lines painted on floors in restaurants in China. There are even inexpensive toys that can follow lines marked on floors, using basic light sensors.","Following robots were on show at the RoboBusiness conference in Boston .

"Eight educational and conservation projects in California's Big Sur area will get $1.4 million from a settlement reached with ex-Facebook president Sean Parker — and he'll also have to perform an unusual and high-tech sort of community service. The California Coastal Commission and Parker  reached a $2.5 million settlement after the Napster co-founder failed to obtain permits for his lavish $10 million wedding in an ecologically sensitive area of Big Sur. Parker, 33 — who married singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas, 24 in June — has agreed to create a mapping app to help beach-goers navigate the tricky routes around private properties in the area, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

'We’re now working with his technical team, which is orders of magnitude beyond what we would be able to summon in terms of technical expertise within our agency,” spokeswoman Sarah Christie, of the California Coastal Commission, told the newspaper. 'It was a creative resolution ... that will ultimately benefit public access,' she added. About $345,000 will go to the San Francisco-based Save the Redwoods League, which will rebuild a section of the popular Pfeiffer Falls Trail after afire damaged it in 2008, according to the Chronicle. Grants will range from $75,000 to more than $340,000 to increase public access to Big Sur and help marginalized families on field trips to the area. Some of the money will support several local groups for at-risk youth. The rest will pay for fines against the Ventanna inn and Spa, where the wedding was hosted. 'This was a creative, collaborative way to resolve a Coastal Act violation, and we are pleased that the Parkers are committed to supporting the good work of these important organizations,' said Charles Lester, the executive director of the Coastal Commission, in a statement. Forest: The wedding took place in Big Sur, among the ecologically sensitive redwoods . Damage: Parker was hit with a $2.5 million fine for the construction, pictured . Investigation: The Coastal Commission checked out the area on May 1 and 2 after receiving a tip about the construction in late April . Photographs released by the California government have shown the over-the-top stone bridge, fake ruins and waterfalls  Parker illegally constructed in the ancient redwoods of Big Sur for his $10 million fairytale wedding. The images, contained in California Coastal Commission documents, show Parker allegedly built a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dancefloor in the ecologically sensitive area near ancient redwoods and a stream with endangered steelhead trout. He also allegedly built a gateway and arch, an artificial pond, a stone bridge, multiple event platforms with elevated floors, rock walls and fake ruined castle walls. And despite the fact the wedding venue was already in a forest, he allegedly planted 125 trees and other plants and flowers. In some pictures, the movie-like set appears to damage the beloved redwoods. Others appear to show a bulldozer moving dirt and materials around the forest floor. Stunning: Singer-songwriter Alexandra, 24, looks radiant in this photograph taken by a friend . In one image, a bridge created from stones and lined with plants is seen with port-a-potties scattered around. Parker allegedly had exclusive use of the campground for several months to construct the wedding venue, all without any coastal development permits. Officials were tipped off about Parker's lavish $10 million wedding construction when neighbors complained, prompting a county investigation into the construction. When staff inspected, they found the temporary structures had already been built, but allowed the wedding to proceed anyway. The commission started negotiating a settlement with Parker and his representatives for the violations instead of shutting the event down.

"Teetering precariously over the edge of the bridge, a truck carrying ten brand new lorry cabs sits just millimetres from tipping into the valley below. Fortunately, nobody was injured when the heavy load smashed over a safety railing and came to a halt on the edge of the bridge in Kaili city, in China's Guizhou province. Despite being faced with a sheer drop, the driver and his passenger managed to clamber from the cab of their vehicle and climb back over the top of the truck's load to the safety of the bridge. On the edge: A trailer loaded with brand new trucks hangs precariously over the precipice of a bridge in Kaili, in the Guizhou Province of China . Left hanging: The accident happened when the lorry driver was forced to give way to another driver and couldn't avoid crashing through the safety barrier . No one hurt: Fortunately, the driver and his passenger managed to scramble from the vehicle unhurt following the crash . The incident happened when the driver of the truck was forced to swerve to avoid another driver who cut him up. Despite his best efforts to avoid the precipice, the driver was unable to stop the truck careering towards the safety barrier and partially crashing through it. The men inside the cab made it safely back on to the bridge before calling emergency crews. The road remained closed for several hours while recovery crews hauled the truck and its load back from the edge and on to an even bigger trailer to be towed away. Recovery operation: The road was closed for several hours while the load was secured and then dragged back onto the bridge, and then the safety rail needed to be put back in place . Once the lorry was recovered, further delays were caused when the bridge's safety rails had to be replaced. A police spokesman said: 'Another few centimetres and the whole lot would have gone over, it was a lucky escape.' Although the driver and his passenger were given a scare by the incident, they probably had a slightly less terrifying escape than a truck driver in the Gansu Province of China last autumn. He was left dangling upside down over a 30ft drop when his lorry flipped and landed on the edge of a bridge. Close call: A police spokesman described the fact that the trucks didn't tumble over the edge as 'a lucky escape' Lucky escape: The two men in the lead truck were faced with a sheer drop and had to clamber back over the load to safety . With his right leg wedged between the . truck and the bridge, Driver Dong Yinan's landing saved him from a . deadly fall to the ground. Passers-by looked on as Mr Yinan flailed as he hung on to ropes with his legs split in midair. The truck, carrying 30 tons of coal, threatened to topple over the edge leaving Mr Yinan holding on for dear life. Firefighters . had the tricky task of reaching him safely from under the teetering . truck and it took them three hours to rescue the driver.","The driver and his passenger managed to scramble free from the lorry in Kaili city, Guizhou province .

"If Lupita Nyong’o had a night to remember at the Oscars then the same can surely be said of her brother Peter who accompanied her to the ceremony and not only got a name check during her emotional acceptance speech but also audaciously photobombed the star-studded selfie that has become the most retweeted ever. The epic selfie that broke Twitter features the crème de la crème of Hollywood royalty including Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep and Bradley Cooper - and there rubbing shoulders with them all is Peter Feliz Anyang' Nyong'o, a first year student at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida. Peter, a younger brother and one of the Oscar-winning actress' five siblings, has without a doubt just had a weekend that he will never forget after accompanying his sister on Sunday night's red carpet.

"Bowe Bergdahl is reportedly refusing to speak with his family, despite getting a letter from his sister, as he recovers in an Army hospital in Germany. This comes as officials in his hometown Hailey, Idaho, canceled a homecoming celebration for the American prisoner of war. Officials cited several death threats his parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl have gotten since the controversial release of their son, who was freed in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees. Many in Hailey suspect the celebration was also canned because of a massive backlash, both national and local, over reports that Bergdahl deserted his post in Afghanistan before he was captured. The FBI is investigating . death threats that Mr and Mrs Bergdahl have received from . people furious about the deal that saw him released from captivity. Fueling the anger is Mr Bergdahl's use of both Pashto and Arabic . language during a White House press conference with President Barack . Obama. Bergdahl has told military officials that he was kept locked in a shark cage in total darkness for weeks at a time and tortured as punishment for twice trying to escape his Taliban captors. Threats: Federal authorities have confirmed that threats have been made against Bob Bergdahl and his wife Jani following their son's controversial release . Moment of release: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was shown struggling to adjust his eyes to the light at the moment he was released in a video released by a Taliban website. Former colleagues accused him of being a deserter . Bergdahl said his captors kept him in a cage for weeks on end in total darkness (stock photo) The Wall Street Journal reports that Bergdahl doesn't yet want to speak with his parents on the phone. The New York Times quotes military sources as say he has gotten a letter from his sister, but has so far declined to respond. He also does not have access to news media and does not know the political controversy that his release has caused in the U.S. Military officials are planning a re-union with his family at a medical facility in Texas, though they say he is not yet psychologically ready for such a reunion. The Times reports that Sergeant Bergdahl has begun opening up about his ordeal to a team of doctors and psychologists that are caring for him. 'It’s safe to assume he was held in harsh conditions. These are Taliban, not wet nurses,' one senior official said. Among the revelations is that he was locked in a shark cage for weeks at a time as punishment, military sources told the newspaper. Bergdahl said he tried to escape at least once, possibly twice, during his five years being held by the Taliban and later the extremist Haqqani network in Afghanistan. As their son recovers, Mr and Mrs Bergdahl have kept out of the public eye after getting several death threats. Officials won't describe the nature of the threats, but acknowledge that threats have been made. The Bergdahl have not been seen publicly since announcing with President Barack Obama that their son had been freed. 'We are working jointly with our state and local . partners and taking each threat seriously,' FBI Special Agent William . Facer told CNN in an e-mail on Saturday. The threats come in the wake of controversy . coming from the families of soldiers who were killed while supposedly . looking for Bergdahl, who is said to have deserted his post, which is what led to his capture by Taliban forces in 2009. Swap: Sgt Bergdahl, 28, was handed over to U.S. special forces in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees . Emotional: Bob and Jani Bergdahl wept as they spoke of their love for their son in another press conference . Accusations: Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for TheBlaze, said the Taliban was thrilled . The family also was the center of . controversy after Mr Bergdahl thanked Allah during the White House . announcement about Bergdahl having been freed. Conservative commentator and former Republican Congressman Allan West said Taliban was 'thrilled' by Mr Bergdahl's use of Arabic and that he had 'claimed the White House for Islam' by thanking Allah in his press conference with President Obama. The father of the freed . soldier - who former soldiers in his unit claim was a deserter - said he was . speaking Arabic and Pashto because his son's English was poor after five . years in captivity. But . conservative commentators accused him of giving the Taliban a priceless propaganda . tool, with one saying extremist sources in Pakistan were delighted. Mr . Bergdahl spoke at the White House after 28-year-old Bowe - the only . American prisoner of war in Afghanistan - was freed in exchange for five . Afghan detainees held by the U.S. Introduced by the President in the rose garden, he spoke mostly English with some Arabic and Pashto. 'I'd like to say to Bowe right now, who's having trouble speaking English, bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,' he said. 'I'm your father, Bowe. The people of Afghanistan, the same. 'To . everyone who effected this... throughout the whole of American . government and international governments around the world, thank you so . much.' The Arabic phrase . bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim appears prominently in the Koran and means . 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful'. Sara . Carter, senior Washington correspondent for conservative news site TheBlaze, said her Taliban sources were 'thrilled' at the phrase being . used. She told TV commentator Glenn Beck: 'He definitely was, in a way, consecrating the area. 'He was reaching out. It's an Islamic phrase... And when I contacted my sources in Pakistan who have direct links with the Taliban, they were actually thrilled, the Taliban was actually thrilled that the father did this.' She added: 'This is incredible, he's gone way way beyond just a father reaching out to his son. Divisive: Bob Bergdahl said he studied Arabic to understand his son's captors . 'He’s actually putting so many lives in danger, and he’s giving a propaganda tool to Mullah Omar, who is the leader of the Taliban who the U.S. has been looking for for years.' Others, however, said there was nothing so sinister in the former UPS delivery man's speech. After his son was captured by the Taliban in June 2009, Mr Bergdahl said he immersed himself in the language and culture of Afghanistan chiefly so he could understand the captors, and speak to them from afar. He said in a previous interview: 'I'm trying to learn a little Pashto so that I can speak to people... I'm trying to write or read the language. 'I probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history.' Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, added to CNN: 'Wouldn't you try and connect with the people that had your child? 'Bob and Jani did everything possible they could to ensure Bowe's safety. And if Bob was trying to connect with them, it was to keep his son safe, I'm sure.' Yesterday a public homecoming parade for Bergdahl featuring Grammy-winning singer Carole King was abruptly cancelled in his tiny hometown of Hailey, Idaho. The official reason given was a concern for public safety - but MailOnline learned that a row erupted between Mayor Fritz Haemmerle and former US Army Platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy, who lives in the town. In . an email to Mayor Haemmerle, who wanted to hold the celebration, Kennedy said: ‘If Individual members of the . community wish to hold sedate, private celebrations to commemorate Bowe . Bergdahl's homecoming, they are of course free and welcome to do so. Cancelled: A homecoming parade for Bergdahl was abruptly called off in his home town of Hailey, Idaho . Political firestorm: Senator John McCain - who was a POW for more than five years in North Vietnam - speaks to reporters yesterday. President Obama has been accused of putting a price on an American life . 'It would be, however, a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony, financed by public money, were to be held. ‘It would be more monstrous still if this ceremony were to, in any way, heap undeserved adulation on Bergdahl, or to adopt the sickly hue of ostentatious jingoism that all too often colors such occasions.’ He added: ‘Until he is cleared of the charges against him, this man deserves no applause. For now, the only appropriate response is silence.' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel phoned Bergdahl's family yesterday to update them on his condition. In the 10-minute call Hagel wished the family well and told them the Defense Department will continue to support the soldier's medical care, along with the process known as reintegration. An official said Bob and Jani Bergdahl expressed their gratitude. Earlier Wednesday, Hagel told reporters that the rush to judgment about Bergdahl is 'unfair' to his family. Footage: A video on the Voice Of Jihad Website was confirmed to show Sgt Bergdahl on the day he was freed . Released: Since he was taken back by the U.S., Bergdahl has been in debriefing with military psychologists . To freedom: The soldier was shown in the video being patted down by his own colleagues before boarding . The POW's exchange for five Guantanamo detainees has provoked a storm of controversy. Many accused President Obama of negotiating with terrorists and allowing a clear price to be set on an American life. And . while the soldier has been hidden from public view, being debriefed by . military psychologists, many of his former colleagues have accused him . directly of desertion. Some claim six servicemen died in the search for the POW, and a Facebook group called Bowe Bergdahl is NOT a hero! has attracted more than 13,000 members. Its description reads: 'Bowe Bergdahl has been made out to be a hero, deserving of praise. 'However, the media and government have lied to the public and covered up the facts. 'I and many of my former battle buddies have first hand knowledge of what took place on that hill in Afghanistan. 'We are here. We will be heard. Bergdahl will be held accountable for his actions.'","Bob Bergdahl and his wife Jani have received unspecified threats, federal authorities confirm .

"Neighbours say the rich parents of children at one of Australia's most expensive schools are 'abusive' and 'think they own the place'. Parents at Scots College Preparatory School, in Bellevue Hill, in east Sydney, have come under fire for their 'uncontrollable unsafe behaviour' involving their flashy cars outside the gates. Even some of the parents told Daily Mail Australia others are 'narcissistic' and 'above the law'. The traffic piled up out the front of Scots College on Friday afternoon . In this photo shown in court, large black car drives up a footpath behind a woman and two children near Scots College in Sydney . Children filter out from the school gates to waiting vehicles . Six local residents  objected the proposed changes to Scots College Preparatory School . The ‘risky and/or illegal’ behaviour of parents with cars such as Mercedes, BMWs, Audis and huge black Range Rovers has seen the school have its planning permission application to expand rejected in court. Scots bought a house nearby in Kambala Road for $4.8 million in 2009 and wanted to turn it into an early learning centre but Woollahra Council refused, the Sydney Morning Herald reported this morning. When the case appeared in the NSW Land and Environment Court, Senior Commissioner Tim Moore blasted parents and their problematic parking, which he called 'dangerous parental activities'. ‘A significant number of parents dropping off and/or picking up children from the preparatory school pay no regard to the law, child safety or the instructions given by the preparatory school,’ Mr Moore said in a damning statement. As the expensive cars rolled up to the pick-up point at the school on Friday afternoon, most cars were well behaved under the watchful eye of the Director of Early Learning, Gay Entwhistle, who was supervising in an orange glow vest. Janet, a mother of three boys, told Daily Mail Australia some of the Four Wheel Drives other parents used to pick up their children were 'frightening'. 'If any of the littler children run out, it can be really dangerous because (the drivers) just can't see them.' Maria, a mother of two young boys, said the residents should get 'real' and were 'horribly unfriendly'. 'The school has been here 105 years,' she said. 'And the school ain't moving.' 'When it's hectic like now, what are you going to do?' Helen, another mother, said: 'It's not the parking, it's the speed at which some of them are driving.' One of the pictures used as evidence in the court judgement shows residents trying to leave their house but apparently being blocked by vehicles in the service road. A car drives up the service road as residents cross the footpath outside their house near the school . A four wheel drive car is parked next to a 'no stopping' sign in one photo . A large silver BMW is also parked by a red 'no stopping' sing in another photo . Another shocking picture shows a car driving down a footpath where a woman is walking with two children. In a court hearing from 22 to 24 September 2014, an inspector said he was given evidence, informally, by six local residents 'who objected to the proposed change of use'. He was also given 'pictorial and graphic materials presented in support of that oral evidence'. Scots College principal Ian Lambert told the paper he was ‘extremely’ disappointed with the judgement. ‘The safety and wellbeing of our boys is always our primary concern,’ he said. Scots College is an independent Presbyterian day and boarding school for boys that has around 1800 students. The prestigious private school does not make their fees public, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 a year. Notable former students at the school include Olympians such as water polo player Thomas Whalan, film director Peter Lindsay Weir, and the former Governor of New South Wales Admiral Sir David James Martin.","Neighbours say rich parents 'think they own the place'

"Former England captain Jamie Peacock is urging the Rugby Football League to give Steve McNamara the opportunity to finish the job of turning England into world-beaters. The first batch of England players began the journey home from New Zealand on Monday following the team's failure to reach the final of the 2014 Four Nations Series. Narrow back-to-back defeats at the hands of Australia and New Zealand, who will contest Saturday's final in Wellington, resulted in an all-too familiar outcome for the national team, who lost in the last 20 seconds of the World Cup semi-final 12 months ago and have not won a major series since Great Britain thrashed a weakened Kiwis touring team in 2007. Jamie Peacock is urging the Rugby Football League to give Steve McNamara the opportunity to finish the job . Although McNamara remains under contract for another 12 months, his position has been undermined by a record of just one win in nine matches against the southern hemisphere heavyweights since he succeeded Tony Smith in 2010. Another former national captain, Garry Schofield, has called for McNamara to stand down, with Castleford's Daryl Powell his choice to take over, while Wigan's Shaun Wane and Brian McDermott, of Leeds, have been touted for the job. However, Peacock, who won 30 caps for England and Great Britain before retiring from the international game in 2012, is convinced McNamara remains the right man for the job after laying the foundations for success and believes the visit of New Zealand for a three-match Test series next autumn can help him prove it. 'It's an exciting time for that team when you look how many players are world class and how many are on the cusp of being world class,' Peacock said. 'That's testimony to the environment that Steve McNamara and his coaching staff have created over the last five years to enable players to reach their potential. 'As a coach, you've got to get the performance right and I feel this team is as competitive with the southern hemisphere sides as any we've had over the last 15 years. 'I came back from the 2008 World Cup with a sense that we were a million miles away and also when I looked at the team in 2010 I thought England were some way away from beating New Zealand and Australia. 'Now that clearly isn't the case any more. 'We were 20 seconds away from a World Cup final and a finger tip away from beating Australia. There's a fine line, we're not a million miles away. 'The squad will be a year older and a year wiser against New Zealand next year and I think that is a series Steve needs to win. 'This team is going to flourish. There is an opportunity, especially with Australia being in transition, for England to become a great side in the next five or six years.' McNamara has been tasked with the job of turning England into world-beaters . McNamara reverted to being part-time after last year's World Cup and was re-appointed despite taking a job as assistant coach at Sydney Roosters. The RFL has been widely criticised over that decision but Peacock believes there are advantages to having a Sydney-based England coach, especially with seven members of his 24-man squad also plying their trade in the NRL. 'The England job is a part-time role and I think it's good that they've got a coach behind enemy lines, analysing what the Australians do,' he said. 'Both the New Zealand and Australian coaches are part-time and we've got the advantage over them with a performance director in Jon Roberts who is based in England but working closely with Steve.' Peacock, who returned for pre-season training with Leeds on Monday, worked as pundit for the BBC on the Four Nations Series and would like to see organisers capitalise on its success and in particular the impact made by debutants Samoa. Sam Tomkins (left) taking a hit during England's 16-14 Four Nations defeat against New Zealand on Saturday . 'It's been a fantastic tournament, going into the last round of games with all four teams able to qualify for the final,' Peacock said. 'Samoa played a full part in that and they need to keep that momentum up by maybe playing Australia when we're playing New Zealand but I'd like to see England go and play Samoa in the middle of the year as part of the build-up to the New Zealand series.' Peacock says an England-Samoa clash could be held Down Under on the weekend of the Anzac Test next May, which will mark the centenary of the 1915 Gallipoli landings, and believes Super League clubs should throw their weight behind it. 'There is a ruling out there that you have to go and play international football if you are selected,' he said. 'The players are spread out among different clubs now and they would just have to cope that weekend without those players. There would be several of them playing in the NRL any way. 'It would be a cracking fixture. The international board needs to be pro-active and make it happen.'","England lost 16-14 against New Zealand in the Four Nations .

"They held him hostage in the Philippines for 472 days... but they were so incompetent they couldn't read, write or count. An Australian who was held to ransom by terrorists for 15 months has told how he screamed at his bumbling captors for them to kill him after witnessing them make one of many stupid mistakes. 'Why don't you f...... kill me?' Warren Rodwell, now 56, recalled screaming at his captors midway through his imprisonment. 'You pricks don't know what you're doing!' Scroll down for video . Warren Rodwell was held captive by militants in the Philippines for 15 months. Picture: YouTube . A disheveled Mr Rodwell speaks during a hostage video released by his captors. He is holding a recent edition of a newspaper in the Philippines. Mr Rodwell (right), with Dr Bob East (left) and Dr East's wife Maria (centre), is well on the way to recovering from his ordeal in the Philippines. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia before the release of a new book about his experience at the hands of Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaeda linked militant group, Mr Rodwell shed new light on the disastrous incompetence of the mostly young guards who kept him prisoner. In that instance, one of his captors had sat on his hammock, sending it crashing to the ground. But the terrorist organisation's problems ran far deeper than that, Mr Rodwell said. 'They were not only illiterate, they were innumerate.' 'They thought one million pesos equaled one million dollars, so let's double it (the ransom).' He remembered one of the up to 100 guards who watched over him was particularly incompetent. 'He was completely empty in his head, he had no initiative.' 'He climbed trees and made noises like an animal.' After a lengthy time in captivity, he said he felt there was little his captors could do to hurt him as he had nothing left. Free at least: Warren Rodwell smiles in March 25, 2013, following his lengthy period of captivity in the Philippines as a prison of Abu Sayyaf. Mr Rodwell lost around 30kg during his time in captivity and dropped to a body weight of 55kg. He said when he lay down to sleep late in his captivity he could feel his ribs touching his hip bones. Doctors told him upon his return to Australia in March 2013 that he likely would only have held out three to six months more in captivity eating small meals. Mr Rodwell's remarks come as an independent researcher, Dr Bob East, prepares to release a new details about Mr Rodwell's kidnapping in 472 Days Captive of the Abu Sayyaf: The Surivival of Australian Warren Rodwell. Another expert in the region, Dr Peter Sales, wrote in the book's forward that spy agencies were engaged in 'spooky' activities in the region and criticised the Australian Government's response to Mr Rodwell's kidnapping. 'Rodwell survived his ordeal, but he was poorly served by local officials and by his own government, which is capable of great dissembling and has been too willing to deal with the worst rascals in Mindanao (a province in the Phillippines). 'We are also playing clandestine games there, earning much local resentment and fuelling some nascent anti-Australian resentment. 'There are many (im)pertinent questions yet to be asked about spooky activity by intelligence agencies throughout the southern Philippines,' wrote Dr Sales. The title of independent researcher Dr East's book, which is scheduled to be published around October by Cambridge Scholars Publishers. Another still from a hostage video shot while Mr Rodwell was being held in captivity. Mr Rodwell is well on the path to recovery nearly 18 months after his release. He had to have his right index finger amputated last September because of damage caused when his abductors shot him in the hand. He is now living in Brisbane and has spent extensive time with doctors, psychologists and physiotherapists. Mr Rodwell spent time in a wheelchair when he returned from the Phillippines because his legs were so atrophied from a lack of use. Dr East told Daily Mail Australia Mr Rodwell had survived an ordeal which was sometimes 'harrowing'. 'The other thing I'd have to say about Warren is he's a fairly tough man... He's very shy in a lot of the ways he talks.' 'When I write about him at the book where he's completely lost his cool and screamed out great volume of obscenities to his captors - that's not his nature, you know. 'He (was) just at breaking point.'","Forthcoming book reveals new details about kidnapped Australian Warren Rodwell's 15 month ordeal as a captive of terror group .

"A young mother has told how she saw a mysterious silver object hovering in the sky above her house this morning. Elyse O'Neill, 26, took these photographs on her smart phone after spotting what she described as a car-sized, silvery object above her back garden in Wallis, Pembrokeshire, early today. The mother-of-one said she watched as the UFO split into two, reconnected, and then flew off. Scroll down for video . Elyse O'Neill, 26, says she saw this bright object hovering above her garden in Wallis, Pembrokeshire, today . She said: 'I was standing in the garden at 6.45am smoking a cigarette when this thing shot across from the moor over on the right, and stopped right in front of me. 'It was so bizarre, it took my breath away. 'I ran inside to get my phone. There wasn't enough battery left to film it, but there was enough to take pictures, so I started snapping away. 'It was hovering, spinning like a top, and as I watched it, it split up vertically into two pieces.' She added: 'I'm a country girl and I know what sheep sound like, but the sheep in the field beyond were making a horrible, high pitched sound all the time it was there. 'Slowly, the two pieces joined back together and then about 15 seconds later it just shot off straight up into the sky - in the blink of an eye. 'I've never seen anything move so . fast. I've seen a shooting star before and it was faster than that - . there's no way it could be man-made, it moved too fast. Miss O'Neill, pictured with daughter Elliemae, says she doesn't believe in aliens but can't explain what she saw . 'As soon as it went, the sheep fell silent. It was chilling.' Miss O'Neill, who works as a horse-trainer, showed her photographs to relatives, who told her that her own aunt and grandmother had experienced unexplainable sightings over the same moor, thought only at night. But she remains skeptical about what she saw. 'I can't explain it,' she said. 'It moved too fast to be of this earth, but I don't believe in aliens.' UFO sighting: Miss O'Neill saw the mysterious object hovering above her home in Wallis, Pembrokeshire . Nick Pope, an expert on UFOs and a former government adviser on unexplained phenomena, said: 'This is truly bizarre and what makes it particularly mysterious is the description of the way the object moved from a hover to a high speed in an instant. 'This rules out most of the conventional explanations such as aircraft lights, a meteor/fireball, or a Chinese lantern. 'Perhaps it was some new secret, prototype spy plane or drone, but if not, it's a genuine mystery. It would be fascinating to find out if anything unusual was tracked on radar.' Yesterday schoolgirl Georgina Heap, 16, told how she saw a mysterious black ring in the sky above Leamington Spa. Miss Heap, who videoed the ring on her phone as she watched it with friends, said it floated 'like a cloud' before disappearing.

"Researchers have revealed the 'superlanguage' they believe Ice Age people living in Europe 15,000 used to communicate. The University of Reading study shows many of the words, such as  I, you, we, man and bark are still in use today - and found there was even a word for mother. The researchers even show that complete sentences could still be understood today. Where Europe's language came from: The 'common words' point to the existence of a linguistic super-family tree that unites seven major language families of Eurasia., shown here . The first common Language? Researchers found these common words could be used across Europe 15,000 years ago . Researchers believe the findings show a linguistic 'common language' allowing different groups to communicate. Using statistical models, Professor of Evolutionary Biology Mark Pagel and his team predicted that certain words would have changed so slowly over long periods of time as to retain traces of their ancestry for up to ten thousand or more years. 'We discovered we could predict a rate of evolution for words,' Professor Pagel told MailOnline. 'There was a small subset of words that evolved so slowly over time they might last up to 20,000 years. 'You realise, golly, I might be able to predict words that link these families, and we found these 23 words that have a common ancestor.' The 23 words, which include Mother, Fire, to spit and worm, would have sounded very different, says Professor Pagel. 'The words would not sound exactly the . same, but they would be recognisable, or in a form that we could easily . learn to recognisable. 'The words for mother, for instance, sound like mama or something similar. 'If we were to sit round a campfire, we could have a basic conversation.' Previously linguists have relied solely on studying shared sounds among words to identify those that are likely to be derived from common ancestral words, such as the Latin pater and the English father. A difficulty with this approach, the team said, is that two words might have similar sounds just by accident, such as the words team and cream. To combat this problem, Professor Pagel's team showed that a subset of words was used frequently in everyday speech, are more likely to be retained over long periods of time. The team used this method to predict words likely to have shared sounds, giving greater confidence that when such sound similarities are discovered they do not merely reflect the workings of chance. 'The way in which we use a certain set of words in everyday speech is something common to all human languages,' said Professor of Evolutionary Biology Mark Pagel from the University of Reading. 'We discovered numerals, pronouns and special adverbs are replaced far more slowly, with linguistic half-lives of once every 10,000 or even more years. 'As a rule of thumb, words used more than about once per thousand in everyday speech were seven to ten times more likely to show deep ancestry in the Eurasian super-family. 'The research shows they each probably stem from a common language ancestor. 'As words evolve they change, such as P to F transition, which change over time.' Professor Pagel called for more research into common languages. 'The fact we can find these ancient links should encourage us to do more of it. 'We can test interesting questions about human migration and evolution through these links.' A common language: The tower of Babel, which led to humanity being forced to speak different languages, according to the Bible. Researchers now say they have reconstructed an early common European language . In addition to Indo-European, the language families shown in the map above include: . Professor Pagel's previous research . on the evolution of human languages has built up a picture of how our . 7,000 living human languages have evolved - with the 'proto-Eurasiatic' language that was the common ancestor to about 700 contemporary . languages that are the native tongues of more than half the world’s . people. Professor Pagel . and his research team have documented the shared patterns in the way we . use language and researched why some words succeed and others have . become obsolete over time. This is done by using statistical . estimates of rates of lexical replacement for a range of vocabulary . items in the Indo-European languages. 'The search for ever deeper relationships among the World’s languages . is bedeviled by the fact that most words evolve too rapidly to preserve . evidence of their ancestry beyond 5,000 to 9,000 years,' the . researchers wrote. 'On the other hand, quantitative modeling indicates that some . 'ultraconserved' words exist that might be used to find evidence for . deep linguistic relationships beyond that time barrier. 'Our results suggest a remarkable fidelity in the transmission of some words and give theoretical justification to the search for features of language that might be preserved across wide spans of time and geography.'","Researchers uncovered language Ice Age people used to communicate - with many of the words still in use today .

"A professional female fighter says she hopes she can be a role model for other women and inspire them to take up the combat sport. Joanne 'Jojo' Calderwood, 28, from Kilmarnock, Scotland, is taking part in the first women-only season of BT Sport's The Ultimate Fighter - a reality TV series where she will compete against other female fighters from around the world. Jojo has been practising mixed martial arts (MMA) from a young age and is delighted to have the opportunity to take part in the show. The winner will walk away with a six figure contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (the world's biggest MMA organisation) and will become a world champion. Scroll down for video . Ready for combat: Joanne 'Jojo' Calderwood said people are often surprised when she tells them she's a professional fighter . The brunette told MailOnline that people are often surprised when she tells them about her day job. She said: 'I don't tell people straight away. I usually say I work in the gym and then I'll see how the conversations goes. Then I might go on to tell them I'm a professional fighter. People are always surprised. 'They say I'm too sweet or too quiet and innocent to be a fighter.' She added that she gets told 'all the time' that she shouldn't be a fighter because she's a woman. 'People say ""your face is too pretty to be getting hit"". I just laugh. I train hard every day so that I don't get hit in the face!' she said. Although some may be shocked at Jojo's vocation because of her gender, she said there's no such sexism within the fighting industry. She said: 'Luckily, I've been in an environment where I've never been treated badly. My fans like me because I'm a good fighter, not because I'm a woman. Occupational hazard: The brunette is often told 'your face is too pretty to be getting hit' In action: Jojo, left, had her first professional fight at the age of 18 . 'The men in the gym just see me as another fighter, not as a girl. As long as you keep your head down and work hard, no one is ever going to judge you or treat you differently because you're a woman.' Jojo added that her friends and family are extremely supportive and watch all her fights. She said: 'My mum always does my hair before my fights if I'm fighting locally. She always winds me up and says that I should be doing a beauty pageant, not a fight. But she's been there since day one. She was the one who took me to my first class. 'She knows how much I love it and how dedicated I am, and she just wants me to be happy. My brother and sister love it too. They will all watch it - even my sister who is a school teacher and doesn't have a violent bone in her body. They support me and they know I love what I'm doing.' The athlete said she feels extremely lucky that she has been able to turn a sport she loves into a career. She said: 'Even if I wasn’t fighting professionally, I would be doing it as a hobby because I love it so much. Loves the sport: Jojo says mixed marital arts is a great workout for your body and mind . 'I'm not doing it for the money or for anything else; I'm doing it because I love it. Everything else is just a bonus. I'm so grateful that I've managed to make a living out of the sport I love. It just shows you that, if you work hard and you put your mind to it, you can achieve what you want in life.' She first tried the combat sport Muay Thai when she was 13 and went on to have her first professional fight she was 18 before focussing on MMA. She'd love it if more women would follow in her footsteps. 'It would be good to see more women taking up MMA. Everyone I meet, I try to get them to try it. MMA is an outlet for things. It's like going to the gym but it's so much better because you're not just going there, running on the treadmill and leaving, but you're training your body in different ways,' she enthuses. Winning mentality: Her goal is to become UFC strawweight champion . 'You have to switch off from the world. If I've heard bad news or I've had a bad day, I'll go to the gym and two hours later I'll leave and feel so much better about things. I get lost in the moment. MMA lets you look at things in a different, more positive way.' She added: 'My goal for now is to be the UFC strawweight champion and all the stuff that comes along with that is just a bonus. During that journey I would like to think I could touch people. I'd like to be a role model for young girls and boys.' Aside from encouraging more people to take up the sport, she also hopes The Ultimate Fighter Show will encourage more people to watch live fights. 'For people who have never seen a UFC fight, you can't even describe the atmosphere,' she said.

"The Queen is doing a wonderful job but needs to start taking things easier says a new survey that looked at British attitudes toward the monarchy. 75 per cent said they agreed or strongly agreed that the Queen has done a wonderful job over the last 60 years, while 69 per cent said it was time for the Queen to lighten her schedule - a sharp rebuff to former Labour deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who recently said the Queen should abdicate and 'consider enjoying a long and fulfilling retirement.' Despite the imminent abdication of the Netherland's Queen Beatrix, those close to the Queen say she is unlikely to follow suit. Popular: Two thirds think the Queen does a great job while one in 10 look to her for moral guidance . Instead, they say, more duties will be . given to the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, which will . certainly please the 80 per cent who would like to see more of the third . in line to the throne. The findings come in the wake of a health scare for the Queen, which saw her rushed to hospital with a bout of gastroenteritis. The poll of 2,000 people, which was commissioned by Hello! magazine, also found that 62 per cent were happy to see the Queen team up with the Duchess of Cambridge for some of her engagements. Veteran BBC Royal Correspondent, Nicholas Witchell - famously described as 'that awful man' by Prince Charles - said that he was unsurprised by the results. 'Her recent brush with gastroenteritis has reminded us that even the most robust constitution cannot be immune to illness. 'She will never retire - that's one point on which we can be absolutely categoric - but after 61 years on the throne, one senses there is an acceptance of the need to lighten the load a little, both for her own sake and her husband's.' Duty: 69 per cent said the Queen should lighten her workload and pass on some duties to younger royals . Busy: Both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge have begun to take on more work in recent months . Indeed, it is the 91-year-old Duke of Edinburgh who become increasingly frail in recent years, who has given the Queen the most cause for concern. Most recently, the much-loved senior royal was forced to pull out of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations after succumbing to a serious bladder infection. Both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge have stepped up their schedule of engagements in recent months as they attempt to support the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, although according to Witchell, Prince William could take on more. 'The hardest person to persuade of the need to slow down will be her [the Queen] but William in particular must realise we're at the point where royal duty will have to take precedence over his military career.'

"Geoffrey Prime, aged 44, was jailed for 38 years in 1982 . As a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, Geoffrey Prime would have been delighted if the vile organisation had won its campaign to legalise sex with children. It might have meant that this evil child molester — who also betrayed Britain’s secrets to the Soviet Union during the Cold War — would never have come to the notice of the police and subsequently been jailed for ruthless and calculated attacks on young girls. Prime was one of many paedophiles who no doubt felt their repellent activities were validated as a result of the Paedophile Information Exchange’s (PIE) affiliation to the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) at a time when Harriet Harman, Patricia Hewitt and Jack Dromey had key jobs with the civil rights group. Indeed, after Prime was jailed for 38 years in 1982 (for passing highly-sensitive British national security secrets to the KGB over a period of 14 years while working for the RAF and GCHQ), the Old Bailey was told that several magazines issued on behalf of PIE were found by police in his garage. Yet amid all the furore at the time — with questions being asked in Parliament about whether other members of PIE posed a threat to national security or were under surveillance — there is no record of the NCCL, or the Labour trio, expressing any regret for their links with PIE and its association with perverts such as Prime. He was unmasked as a spy only after he left GCHQ, where he worked as a Russian-speaking linguist intercepting Soviet communications and was privy to the most sensitive national security secrets. While a taxi driver in Hereford, he was arrested by police investigating a series of complaints from parents that a dangerous and predatory ‘sex pest’ had been targeting young girls. He then confessed to his wife about his sex crimes and spying for Moscow. He had used skills he’d learnt from his KGB handlers to amass 2,287 index cards about schoolgirls in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Written in code on each slip of paper was the child’s address, what she wore, her number he’d found in a telephone book and the time that her parents were likely to be out. The cards, along with a collection of PIE contact magazines containing material that called for paedophiles to be given equal rights to homosexuals, were found among an array of Soviet espionage gadgetry. Scroll down for video . Prime was one of many paedophiles who no doubt felt their repellent activities were validated as a result of the Paedophile Information Exchange¿s (PIE) affiliation to the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) It was in 1978 (before Prime launched his sex attacks) that Harman wrote a submission to Parliament about the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography . Prime’s case went to the Old Bailey in November 1982, when Patricia Hewitt (right) was still the NCCL’s general secretary. Jack Dromey had sat on the NCCL executive committee for almost a decade from 1970 to 1979 . Last night, retired Detective Chief Inspector Peter Picken, now 72, who played a key role in securing Prime’s confession, told us how the paedophile had subjected his girl victims to a series of prolonged and frightening attacks in 1981. ‘They suffered a horrendous ordeal. Coming from isolated, rural locations, they would have felt very vulnerable,’ he said. Mr Picken recalled how Prime, then 44, scoured local newspapers for pictures of girls wearing their school or Brownie uniforms or photographed at an award ceremony for sporting or musical success. He would then track down his target, get their phone number from directory inquiries and call their family home, pretending to be a workman. His first victim was just 11 when, in 1980, she received a call from a breathless Prime pretending to be a plumber. Within five minutes of establishing that the girl was alone, he went to her address, knocked on the door and conned his way in. Having pulled a hood over his head, Prime threatened his young victim before sexually assaulting her. The Old Bailey heard how the girl was left ‘crying, shaking and very distressed’. The following year, Prime stalked a 13-year-old girl with phone calls before visiting her address when her parents were out. Prime was charged with spying for Moscow and with three sex offences in 1982. The court heard that he had admitted being attracted to girls aged ten to 15 . He pretended to be a decorator offering an estimate for painting work. The girl was horrified when he asked to photograph her, telling her that she had ‘grown up’ so much since her parents had employed him as a babysitter. Angered by her refusal to obey his demands, he tied a handkerchief over his face and grabbed her by the neck as she tried to flee. He flung her on the bed and threatened to hurt her if she did  not co-operate. Although the terrified girl again tried to flee, he attacked and sexually assaulted her. A year later, still untraced by police, Prime pestered a 14-year-old girl in a series of calls during which he pretended again to be a decorator wanting access to the property to give a quote for work. When he called round and finally persuaded her to let him in, he threatened her by flipping open the blade of a bottle opener, then sexually assaulted her. The girl’s screams eventually forced Prime to flee, but only after he had asked her if she knew of any other girls likely to be on their own in the area. With a huge police manhunt under way, parents around Hereford were alerted to the attacks and Prime’s distinctive two-tone Ford Cortina was spotted. It wasn’t long before police tracked him down to a cottage he shared with his wife. Geoffrey Prime at Hereford Court where he was charged with spying. Sentencing Prime to 38 years in prison, the judge condemned him as a 'calculating and rationally motivated spy' Prime's case went to the Old Bailey in November 1982, a time when Patricia Hewitt was still the NCCL's general secretary and Harriet Harman had only just left the organisation . Prime, known for his arrogance, denied the allegations. However, after police left, his devout Christian wife Rhona quizzed him further, and he confessed to his predilection for under-age girls, his links with PIE and his spying activities. She contacted the police, who then searched his home — finding notepads with secret messages to relay to the KGB, writing paper with invisible ink and cash deposits. During three days of interviews at Gloucester prison, DCI Picken, of the West Mercia force, secured the dramatic confession that Prime was a Soviet spy. Prime was charged with spying for Moscow and with three sex offences. The court heard that he had admitted being attracted to girls aged ten to 15. PIE — with its affiliation to the NCCL — had waged a long-running campaign for paedophiles to be accepted in society as ‘child lovers’ and to abolish the age of consent. Prime’s case went to the Old Bailey in November 1982, a time when Patricia Hewitt was still the NCCL’s general secretary and Harriet Harman had only just left the organisation after working for more than three years as its legal officer. Jack Dromey had sat on the NCCL executive committee for almost a decade from 1970 to 1979. It was in 1978 (before Prime launched his sex attacks) that Harman wrote a submission to Parliament about the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. Harman began by saying that the NCCL ‘deplored the exploitation of children’. But she argued that the Bill should be watered down, to reduce the sentence for anyone merely in possession of offensive photographs of children. She also wanted a prosecution to be made more difficult, urging that a picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered. Sentencing Prime to 38 years in prison, the judge condemned him as a ‘calculating and rationally motivated spy’. He added: ‘Your ruthlessness is demonstrated not only by what you did with this country’s secrets, but by what you did to those girls.’ Not surprisingly, the Prime case stunned the British public and led to questions in Parliament about whether other PIE members were under police surveillance. Despite this intense focus on PIE, it continued to be affiliated to the NCCL for some time. Prime was released early from his sentence, in 2001, and received £80-a-week income support and various other welfare benefits. Now 76, he lives in sheltered housing in a suburb of South London. He receives meals on wheels and is cared for by nurses. It is deeply ironic that he takes money and support from the state that he once betrayed so happily to its enemies. Neighbours told us that a few years ago he often visited a leisure centre to swim and work out. But now he rarely leaves the house. There is a children’s centre with a playground and small park just yards from the four-storey building where he lives — which acts as a haunting reminder of the time in the Seventies when Harman & Co, like it or not, were legitimising the activities of evil men such as Geoffrey Prime.

"Police defended the actions of a father who infamously beat a man into a 'bloody puddle' after walking in on him sexually molesting his 11-year-old son as the suspect made his first court appearance Monday. Raymond Frolander, 18, was taken to a hospital before being taken to the closest police station, and his still-swollen face has shown very few signs of healing from the merciless beatdown he received only days ago. Frolander was conscious, but still covered in bruises and with a swollen face as he pleaded not guilty to sexual battery on a child after he admitted to molesting the boy for years. Scroll down for audio of 911 call . Beaten down: Raymond Frolander was barely recognizable in his first court appearance after the savage pounding . The father has not been charged with a crime, and police sound as if they believe his actions were justified. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood told WFTS. 'You have an 18-year-old who has clearly picked his target, groomed his target and had sex with the victim multiple times.' A subsequent mugshot showed that . Frolander had been badly beaten around the face, leaving him with . swollen lips and eyes, bruising and lacerations. When the 911 responder asked the father if any weapons were involved, he said: 'My foot and my fist'. The 35-year-old man, who has not been identified, told a 911 dispatcher in the early hours of Friday: 'I just walked in on a grown man . molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a . bloody puddle for you right now, officer.' Police arrived at the Daytona Beach home in Florida to find Frolander unconscious. Raymond Frolander, 18, (pictured in his mugshot) was beaten to a pulp by the father of the 11-year-old boy that he allegedly caught his sexually assaulting at a home in Daytona Beach, Florida . 'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' the father said. 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.' The dispatcher asked: 'Is he still unconscious?' to which the father responds: 'Yes... I hit hard, sir.' He said that Frolander was a 'damn lucky boy that I love my God'. The father added: 'He stood up and his pants were around his ankles and nothing else needed to be said. I did whatever I got a right to do except I didn’t kill him.' The father had left his home around 1am to pick up some food and when he returned, heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, police said. He pushed open the door and allegedly found Frolander with his pants down performing a sex act on the child. Frolander, 18, admitted to the abuse on the 11-year-old, according to his arrest affidavit. He is being held without bail on charges of sexual battery . The boy told investigators he had been playing video games with friends but when they left, Frolander took him to a back room and pulled down his pants. He also said Frolander had been abusing him for three years. Daytona Beach police chief Michael . Chitwood told MailOnline today that Frolander had a close family . connection to the alleged victim. The chief said the young boy was intimidated and told by Frolander that terrible things would happen if he revealed the abuse. Chief Chitwood said: 'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this.' The father was not charged in the suspect’s beating, police spokesman Jimmie Flynt said. Frolander was taken to Halifax Heath Medical Center where he was treated for his injuries. The arrest affidavit said that Frolander admitted the abuse. The teen was charged with sexual battery on a child under 12 and is being held without bail. It was not known whether he's hired a lawyer.","The 35-year-old father told a Florida 911 dispatcher: 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one'

"Anyone who has ever regretted a haircut knows it can seem like an age before the offending trim grows out. But help is at hand – in the form of a shampoo that claims to boost hair length with every wash. Scientists behind Fast, or Fortified Amino Scalp Therapy, say their product can grow hair by as much as two inches in just one month – double the usual rate. Demand: The makers of FAST shampoo and hair conditioner claim it can make hair grow by up to two inches extra a month . And tests suggest the rate of growth increases the longer a person uses the products. Recovering cancer patients who have lost their hair through chemotherapy are among the shampoo’s dedicated customer base in Canada, where it was formulated. It is so popular across the Atlantic that it sold out within 24 hours of its launch. There is already a 5,000-strong waiting list for the shampoo and conditioner, which goes on sale in the UK on January 23. Science: The shampoo, made from ¿natural herbs and organic amino acids¿, works by stimulating growth in the follicle . The shampoo, made from ‘natural herbs and organic amino acids’, works by stimulating growth in the follicle. But while it helps those whose hair has fallen out through cancer, the shampoo is not a remedy for baldness because it cannot stimulate new hair growth, only promote the growth of existing hair. Clinical trials have been carried out over the past 12 months on 1,000 men and women, who were asked to wash their hair with the shampoo and conditioner daily. They had their hair dyed, photographed and measured for growth every six weeks. After the first six weeks, the hair of half the subjects tested showed increased growth – on average 17 per cent more than normal. However, after another six weeks’ use of Fast all the men and women’s hair had increased growth. On average, after 12 weeks, hair grew 30 per cent faster than usual, although one subject experienced a 99 per cent boost in hair length. The shampoo and conditioner will cost £24.99 together when they go on sale in Boots. A Fast spokesman said: ‘We’ve worked hard to find a hair growth solution which is accessible to everyone, including chemotherapy patients.’ Breast cancer sufferer Shirley Huggett, 56, of Tenterden, Kent, tried the shampoo after losing her hair following a course of chemotherapy. ‘My hair started growing again, but I was embarrassed to go out because it was so short,’ she said. ‘I was given a sample of Fast and my hair growth has been unbelievable. ‘It has grown more than two inches in under four weeks.’","Huge demand for Fast meaning Fortified Amino Scalp Therapy .

"The captain of a sinking oil tanker off the coast of Japan is missing and four other crew members are in hospital with serious burns after the vessel caught fire and erupted in flames off the coast of Japan. Thick smoke billowed from the 1000-tonne Shoko-Maru, 450km west of Tokyo. The ship had just unloaded its cargo at a port near Hyogo prefecture. Emergency crews used hoses to douse the fierce blaze, which started when a spark from a grinder ignited oil on board on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Thick smoke seen billowing from the ship went 100 metres into the air . A Coast guard vessel attempted to douse the burning ship 450km off the coast of Tokyo . The tanker had just unloaded most of its cargo at a port in the west of the country . Four crew members were taken to hospital with severe burns, while the remaining three were being assessed for injuries. The Coast Guard said it held 'grave fears' for the captain, who is still missing. Akihiro Komura, an official from Hiroshima-based shipping firm Syoho Shipping, said seven of the eight Japanese crew were accounted for, but the fate of the captain was not yet known. 'The ship unloaded crude oil at a port in Hyogo prefecture and the tanker was virtually empty when the accident occurred,' he said. 'I heard that a crew member was using a grinder to remove paint and that seems to have triggered the blast, which we believe could have occurred when the remnants of the oil caught fire.' All the crew were Japanese nationals, he said. News of the incident caused Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to interrupt debate in parliament. 'In waters off Hyogo (prefecture), a tanker has exploded and is currently in flames,' he told lawmakers.

"A flop sportscar has started a new life as a super pick-up truck that can go from nought to 60 in five seconds. Two motor enthusiasts bought a 1989 Ferrari 412, usually regarded as one of the Italian car maker’s least desirable models, for £5,000 and then spent the next six weeks creating the first Ferrari pick-up truck. London Motor Museum boss Elo and his mechanic friend Will Trickett removed a foot (30cm) of the roof and shifted everything forward to create a four-and-a-half feet load bed at the back. Copying yachts, the back of the pick-up truck uses teak wood to panel the rear bed .

"Today's teenagers are less likely to drink, smoke and take drugs than their predecessors making them the most sensible generation for a decade, according to statistics. Department of Health figures also show that the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped dramatically over a 40-year period - with abortions in recent years also showing a decline. Government officials have claimed the downward trend could be explained by a changing demographic, as there are far more young Muslims in the UK today, who do not drink, smoke or have sex. Some believe the behaviour shift is party a result of social media - as many teenagers spend more time interacting online through Facebook and Twitter than they do in person (picture posed by models) Table shows a dramatic decline in teenagers drinking, smoking and taking drugs as well as a significant fall in girls under 18 becoming pregnant and having abortions . Others believe the behaviour shift is partly a result of social media - as many teenagers spend more time interacting online through Facebook and Twitter than they do in person. This leaves less time for young people to experiment with alcohol, smoking, drugs and sex. Speaking to the Sunday Times, Richard de Visser, a specialist in young people's behaviour and health at Sussex University, said: 'More socialising can now happen at a distance. 'You can do social things that don't involve going out in the park drinking or trying to get into the pub.' Teenage pregnancy rates are at their lowest since the 1970s. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that the number of pregnancies in women under the age of 18 plummeted from 45,000 in 1969 to just over 30,000 in 2011. From 2012 to 2013 abortion rates for under 18s fell from 12.8 per 1,000 girls in 2012 to 11.7 in 2013. Over the same period, the abortion rates for girls under the age of 16, dropped from three in every 1,000 to 2.6. Alison Hadley, director of the Teenage Pregnancy Knowledge Exchange at Bedfordshire University, believes that today's young people are not abstaining from sex, but that more are using contraception. She said 'Levels of sexual activity seem to be pretty consistent. There was a lot of work by the previous government on young people's health. 'We should welcome the fact that if you give young people the right kind of support they will look after themselves.' Teenage Pregnancy Knowledge Exchange say progress made reducing teenage pregnancies will also have a positive impact on child poverty and infant mortality rates - which they say disproportionately affect children of teenage parents. Department of Health statistics also highlight a steep decline in teenagers who describe themselves as regular smokers with a 2003 figure of 9 per cent falling to 3 per cent last year. Similarly, figures over the same ten-year period show that the proportion of teenage school pupils who had tried drugs fell from 30 percent to 16 per cent. Jane Ellison, the public health minister, commented: 'Trends in the drinking, smoking and teenage pregnancy rates for young people are very encouraging. 'Figures show pregnancy in under-18s is at its lowest rate for 40 years and the numbers of young people drinking and smoking are also falling. 'We know that we can't be complacent though. Young people who adopt healthy lifestyles early on can use them as a building block for success, using that resilience to get on in life.'","Government figures show teenage pregnancies fallen by a third since 1969 .

"The White House officially said Thursday what Twitter and MailOnline knew days beforehand: that President Barack Obama would travel to Colorado and Texas this week for a series of fundraisers. The events weren't part of the president's public schedule, but they became common knowledge after enterprising reporters obtained copies of exclusive invites for events with the president and shared them online. The omission from Obama’s public schedule wasn’t an anomaly. The president and his administration have made a habit out of telling reporters at the last minute about previously scheduled out-of-town trips, fundraisers and speaking engagements. Today President Barack Obama had lunch at the White House with a group of teachers. The luncheon was one of the few events included on the president's public schedule today . Every president has a private daily . schedule that a limited number of his staff are privy to, . containing details of all the president's activities throughout the day, including even his designated workout schedule and golf tee times. Reporters usually don't find out about those outings until they are happening, and the public is only informed that the president has left the White House if someone from the White House press corps writes about it or a bystander posts photos online. As Yahoo News pointed out today, Items like the president's . recent lunch with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are often . included on the secret, detailed copy of the president's schedule but . are left off his public itinerary if they're considered part of his . private life. Neither the . public nor the press would have ever known about that meeting if Clinton . hadn't told a reporter from People magazine, who in turn tweeted – and deleted – a note and a picture related to the . secret encounter. The White House is not required to tell the public about the president's whereabouts but it sometimes opts to announce events the president holds at the White House as part of his presidential duties . The purpose of the president's secret schedule is to give him a modicum of privacy. But the current administration regularly keeps events Obama attends or holds in his . capacity as President of the United States off the schedule it makes . available on the White House website. The move is meant to stop members of Obama's cabinet, Congress, representatives from allied groups, and . even the public from crashing events to which they weren't invited. It's especially meant to keep aggressive reporters from asking questions . about meetings or events the White House wants to keep secret. Which presidential activities are made available to the press is completely up to his handlers. No law requires the executive branch to release any details at all about the president's whereabouts. And his schedule isn't subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. A . comprehensive analysis of the president's public schedule versus events . Obama was photographed at in 2009 completed by Politico just before the . 2012 election found that the White House kept secret at least one-third of . the events the president held or attended until after they had . happened. 'I would say the daily schedule they hand out is on the shallow side . compared to presidents past,' longtime White House reporter Ann . Compton of ABC News told Politico at the time.anniversary . The White House listed this May 7, 2014, Shoah Foundation event in Los Angeles, California, on the president's public schedule, but it did not mention that Obama would be rubbing elbows with director Steven Spielberg, second from left, and Bruce Springsteen, right, at the dinner . Little has changed in the time since Politico published its report. If anything, the president has went off-map more often. Last week press found out the president would be giving remarks on the economy at a tech startup in downtown Washington, D.C. after the president had already left the White House. On another recent occasion the president snuck off with Vice President Joe Biden to have lunch with construction workers at a downtown D.C. Shake Shack. The White House still hasn't published details on the president's travel to Los Angeles, California, later this month, even though The Hollywood Reporter revealed in June that Obama would appear at fundraisers there on July 23 and 24 on behalf of the Democratic National Committee. THR is also responsible for making public the president's fundraisers in Texas. It wasn't until a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest last Monday about the alleged trip to the Lone Star State that the White House confirmed the president's plans. The White House didn't send out details about Obama's travel to Denver, Colorado, tomorrow night until this morning – three and a half weeks after The Denver Post reported it. As the midterm elections draw nearer, the president is expected to attend a long series of events benefiting his political party but the public is most likely to find out about those events, too, as they occur – or by happenstance.","The White House maintains a private schedule for the president that it gives out sparingly .
It is not required to provide the public with any details at all about the president's whereabouts, but traditionally it lists events the president holds or attends in his capacity as an elected official on the White House website .
This administration regularly fails to inform the press or the public about many of Obama's activities, however ."

"In nature, it is very rare to find a David versus Goliath situation where the former emerges victorious. But that's exactly what happened when a solitary tiny spider from the Negev desert in Israel took down an ant four times its size. And this wasn't just a one-time event - the fearless Zodarian cyrenaicum regularly hunts down and kills creatures bigger than itself, proving it's not just size that matters in the natural world. This first image in an incredible sequence shows the moment a juvenile Zodarian cyrenaicum spider attacked and killed a worker ant up to six times its own size. Here the juvenile approaches its prey and gets ready to unleash its paralysing venom . The spider . measures a measly three millimetres (0.12 inches) on average, but it routinely attacks ants up to 17 millimetres (0.7 inches) in size - and it actually prefers . to fight the 'goliaths' as opposed to picking on creatures its own size. Juvenile spiders of the species Zodarion cyrenaicum climb on the dorsal side of an ant. Here they deliver an immobilising venomous bite to the abdomen, thus avoiding . retaliation by the immediately helpless prey. The venom glands of adult ant-eating spiders are more than 50 times larger than those of the juveniles. However, it only takes about twice as long for the venom of the younger spiders to take effect. This suggests that this spider species possesses very potent venom already at the juvenile stage. Details about how it attacks and kills its prey with a venomous bite were published in the journal The Science of Nature. The study was led by Stano Pekár of Masaryk University in the Czech Republic. Pekár's team observed the natural prey and predatory behaviour of the minute ant-eating Zodarion cyrenaicum spider in the field, and in the laboratory. This spider feeds almost exclusively on the Messor arenarius ant. There are two versions (or morphs) of the ant in the wild - a large and a small one. But . surprisingly it was found that the spider at the juvenile stage . deliberately chooses to hunt Messor arenarius above all other ant . species present in the sand dunes. This is in contrast to other Zodarion . spider species where juveniles select small ants that are comparable to . their own size and, as they develop, switch to larger ant species. In this next image the attacked ant is standing in a C-shaped position with venom clearly taking effect. The spider is biting its hind leg to immobilise it and move in for the kill. The venomous bite avoids retaliation by making the prey paralysed and helpless . In this final image the ant is taken down by the juvenile spider. It is seen here feeding on the gaster (part of the abdomen) of the paralysed ant. The venom glands of the adult ant-eating spiders are more than 50 times larger than those of the juveniles, but the latter is still enough to take down an ant . The researchers suggest that this active selection is likely because the spider is able to recognise a specific component of a pheromone, a chemical substance, produced by the ant. Pekár's team also found that the adult female spiders generally capture the large morphs, while the tiny juvenile spiders catch smaller ants. In all cases, though, the spiders were much smaller than their prey. The giant ants were always captured by a single individual, and immobilised with a single bite. Other spiders of the same species such as Zodarion styliferum (pictured) prefer to pick on smaller ants that are comparable to their own size and, as they develop, switch to larger ant species. Pekár's team also found that the adult female spiders generally capture the larger ants . Previous work done by Pekár showed that the capture strategy of female adult spiders includes a fast attack from behind, followed by a retreat to avoid counter-attacks by the ants. In the present study, he noted that the tiny juveniles' attack strategy differs from that of the females. Thanks to their tiny size, they are able to climb on the dorsal side of an ant and deliver an immobilising bite to the abdomen, thus avoiding retaliation by the immediately helpless prey. The venom glands of adult ant-eating spiders are more than 50 times larger than those of the juveniles. However, it only takes about twice as long for the venom of the younger spiders to take effect. This suggests that this spider species possesses very potent venom already at the juvenile stage. The greater success of adult spiders in capturing prey is most likely because they are able to inject more venom into their prey. 'Specialized capture combined with very effective venom enables this ant-eating spider to capture giant prey,' Pekár concludes.","A spider from the Negev desert in Israel is seen taking down a giant ant .
The 'David versus Goliath' battle saw the juvenile spider emerge victorious .
The fearless Zodarian cyrenaicum routinely fights bigger creatures .
It uses venom to immobilise its prey before it moves in for the kill .

"A family watching a dolphin from their boat were shocked when it dropped them off a cod supper for dinner. The group were enjoying watching the mammal frolic in the water when it suddenly dived down and caught the cod before placing it near to Lucy Watkins, 14. The dolphin then then resurfaced and began nudging the fish towards the stunned teenager. Fish supper: Lucy Watkins proudly holds the 10lb cod given to her by a friendly dolphin off Combe Martin in Devon . Lucy and her grandparents wondered whether they should pick up the fish in case the dolphin wanted it for tea. But the dolphin then appeared seconds later with his own fish, this time a seabass, and began tucking in. The family gratefully scooped up the cod, which weighed a massive 10lbs, before taking it home to nearby Combs Martin in Devon to cook for their dinner. Lucy said: 'He definitely wanted me to have his fish. He first dropped it 20ft away but then pushed it to within 5ft of my kayak. 'Everyone was watching on the beach and we caused quite a stir when we paddled in with the cod.' Grandmother . Nina added: 'It was as if he was saying to Lucy ""Don't worry, now I've . got a fish to play with and so have you. This is mine for my tea, you . have that one for yours."" 'He was just so playful and content to be around us. Lucy was dangling her fingers in the water and he seemed to be attracted by that. Just call me Dave: A photo of the dolphin which is making waves with locals in Combe Martin . 'If I hadn't seen it myself I'd never have believed it. My theory is that he was lonely and wanted human company. He was with us for about two hours. 'It seemed rude to refuse him so we took the fish and had cod and chips for supper. 'It was massive - I've still got half in the freezer.' Lucy was paddling off Combe Martin Bay with Mike and Nina, both, 52, when they encountered the dolphin. The animal has become so popular with locals who have christened him Dave. Nina, a swimming club coach, said the July 25 sighting was the highlight of Lucy's school holidays. She said: 'We feel so privileged to have been there. Lucy loves dolphins and has always wanted to swim with them. 'Well she didn't get to swim with this one, but it is the first time she has seen one out of captivity. 'With the crystal clear water, it was such an experience.' A spokesman for Whale and Dolphin Conservation said: 'This is a very interesting account. 'There are many examples worldwide of dolphins interacting with humans. We would just make our usual appeal for people to generally keep their distance. 'Dolphins can sometimes become distracted by humans, lose their awareness of nearby motor boats and sustain injuries.'","Lucy Watkins, 14, was admiring the dolphin with her family in Devon .

"A two year-old boy raised mainly by goats has been taken into care by social workers in Russia. The malnourished wild child named Sasha T was kept in a room with the animals by his mother Marina, 40, in Rostov region and has not learned how to speak, eat or use a potty. 'He played and slept together with goats, which lived in the same room,' said life.ru news website. Wild child: The malnourished two-year-old named Sasha T was kept in a room with the animals by his mother and has not learned how to speak, eat or use a potty . 'When we came in, Sasha's mother was absent,' said Irina Bochkova, deputy head of social work in the town of Shakhti. 'He was sitting in the ice cold room, undressed. Every hour could have become his last. 'It was incredibly cold, dirty and smelly in that house. We just grabbed him and rushed him to the city hospital. Disturbing: The boy is reported to have lived in the same room as the goats . 'Doctors said that because of how lived, his brain has not developed properly.' The 'Mowgli' boy weighs a third less than a typical child of his age. Children's doctor Natalya Simonina said: 'He refused to sleep in the cot. He tried to get underneath and sleep there. He was very scared of adults. 'He tried to break everything he saw - windows, furniture. 'He could not speak or hold a spoon. He had no idea about what to do with toys, and didn't even try to play with them.' Moves have begun to deprive the mother of her maternal rights, making Sasha an orphan. Sasha is not the first case of a child being raised by animals. In 2009, a five-year-old girl was found in a flat in the Siberian city of Chita, dressed in filthy clothes, barking at people. Known only as ‘Natasha’, she had been shut up in a flat for five years with only cats and dogs for company and she could not even speak her native language. Andrei Tolstyk was discovered in 2004, aged seven, after being abandoned by his parents when he was only three months old. His family's guard dog looked after him as if he was a puppy. But as a consequence he walked on all fours like a canine, sniffed at food and was known to bite people.","The malnourished wild child named Sasha T was kept in a room with the animals by his mother Marina, 40 .

"A couple have been arrested for allegedly stealing food and cleaning products – after a trail of washing powder led straight to their house. Thieves swiped an estimated £1,300 of supplies from the Atherton & Leigh Foodbank in Greater Manchester last weekend. But volunteers spotted a trail of detergent leading to a nearby address. Police later arrested a man, 42, and woman, 38, on suspicion of theft. Thieves swiped an estimated £1,300 of food and cleaning products from Atherton & Leigh Foodbank (not pictured) and volunteers spotted a trail of detergent leading to a nearby address . The food, which was stored in a container behind St John the Baptist Church in Market Place, Atherton, was stolen some time between Saturday evening and Sunday morning. Foodbank secretary Dave Hughes said: 'This is a theft from the people who have donated items as well as people who are in crisis.' 'They are probably the type of people that we are there for and serve in emergencies. It may well be that we have helped these people in the past. 'It makes you wonder why they are so desperate for the money — and there have been a lot of break-ins in Atherton in the last two weeks by the sounds of it.

"Two British tourists who woke the morning after the night before to find a penguin in their room have been fined. In a scene that could have come out of the movie Hangover, the Welshmen admitted to a court on Queensland's Gold Coast that they could not remember much about what had happened the night before, when they had been drinking heavily. Former UK marine Rhys Owen Jones, 21 and bricklayer Keri Mules, 20 both from Cardiff, were each fined $1,000 (£640) and were told by magistrate Brian Kucks that they were lucky they had not fallen into the polar bear enclosure or the shark tank when they broke into the Sea World theme park near Surfers Paradise. Fined: Rhys Owen Jones  (left) and Keri Mules (right) were on a working holiday in Australia when they got drunk and stole the penguin . Trip of a lifetime: The pair pose up with two female friends before their arrest . 'You could have found yourselves in a morgue,' he told them. The court was told that the pair, who are on working holidays in Australia and staying in a flat on the Gold Coast, drank 1.5 litres of vodka between them before deciding to have a close look at Australia's marine life. Breaking into Sea World, they set off a fire extinguisher in the shark tank and swam with the dolphins before taking Dirk the penguin, police told the court. The Gold Coast Bulletin reported that the Welshmen were located after a Facebook friend read about their boasts - they had posted photos of themselves with Dirk in their flat before they passed out from the alcohol they had consumed. Back home safe: Dirk the penguin safely back in his enclosure after being stolen by drunken Brits and then dumped in a waterway at risk of shark attack . When they woke the next day, the court heard, they saw the penguin in the flat but they could not remember stealing it. In . a panic, they released it into a nearby waterway, not realising the . small bird was at risk of being attacked and killed by a bull shark. The hand-reared penguin's . disappearance resulted in a large search by  staff - before a local . couple saw it near a pier and called the authorities.

"A Kinemacolour camera is to be sold at auction later this year and is expected to fetch £20,000. Above, one of the earliest projectors which used the technology . A film camera is expected to fetch £20,000 at auction at Newbury, Berkshire later this year. The Kinemacolor changed cinema on its launch in 1908, allowing the capture of moving footage in colour. The camera, one of the oldest surviving pieces of equipment, will go under the hammer later this year after being put up for sale by a private owner. Previously Kinemacolour projectors have sold for around £4,000 at auctions held by Christies in London. In 2012, footage taken using the cameras emerged, with sharp moving images of London in the early 1900s shown in colour for the first time. The scenes, screened at the Science Museum, ranged from roughly 5 to 40 seconds and showed a parrot, a London street scene, and three smiling children sitting around a table covered with a burgundy cloth batting at a goldfish bowl with large sunflowers. The clips had long been considered failed prototypes and were consigned to an archive. The process came about after years of tireless work by inventor Edward Turner. When he died, a colour system he had devised to record moving pictures was passed on to American Charles Urban. Urban teamed up with film pioneer George Albert Smith to develop it further, with the pair reaching success eventually in the early 20th Century. Turner had established that by combining the three primary colours (red, blue and green), film makers would be able to depict any other hues. Urban and Smith withdrew blue from the wheel after deciding an adequate palette could be reached using just red and green. Their happy discovery in 1906 was described in account given by Smith years later. 'It took about thirty seconds to make the exposure on a specially prepared negative film after which we went into Smith's small darkroom to develop the results in absolute darkness. 'Within two hours we had dried the negative, made a positive print of the 50 feet length, developed and dried it - and then for the grand test. 'Even today - after seventeen years, I can still feel the thrill of that moment, when I saw the result of the two-colour process - I yelled like a drunken cowboy - ""We've got it - We've got it""'. It was another two years before the pair were able to unveil the technology to audiences for the first time.","The Kinemacolour allowed film to be shown in colour for the first time .

"Scandal: Ex leader of the Paedophile Information Exchange, Tom O'Carroll, was jailed for child sex offences, and claimed today that 'Harman and co' made no effort to remove him or other members . Fresh questions emerged today about how influential a despised paedophile group were in the civil liberties organisation that Harriet Harman helped run before she became an MP. The former leader of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) said the Labour Deputy Leader and the National Council of Civil Liberties (NCCL) made 'no attempts' to 'kick out' his group. Tom O'Carroll, who has been convicted of a number of child sex offences and was described as 'one of the most infamous perverts on Earth', sat on the NCCL's  gay rights sub-committee in the late 1970s. In the eight years PIE was given affiliate status, O'Carroll said he spoke at the NCCL's 1977 Spring conference, two years after he helped lead a campaign to cut the age of consent to as low as ten. Today he told the BBC that Ms Harman and . Patricia Hewitt, then general secretary of the NCCL, and later a Labour health secretary, 'didn't even try' to remove him or other members because they 'didn't want to rock the boat' to protect their own careers. 'Really they didn't do much to oppose PIE's presence in my view because . there were these other liberal forces, or radical forces, within NCCL,' he told the Today Programme. 'The . support didn't come from Harman and co but it was there. The gay . liberation front was very radical and at that time Harman and Patricia . Hewitt couldn't just kick out PIE, well they could both try but they . didn't even try and the reason they didn't try is they didn't want to . rock the boat because their careers within NCCL depended on them not . rocking the boat too much.' Scroll down for video . Questions remain: Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman arrives in Oxford today for a media convention . Scandal: After six days of questions over her links to a paedophile group, Labour's Harriet Harman has finally expressed regret but not a full apology . He told the programme he never met Ms Harman or her husband Jack Dromey, who was on the NCCL's executive, but he met Ms Hewitt briefly at a conference in Sheffield in 1978. He said: 'I spoke to her when we were just going up a floor or two in a lift and she was somewhat frosty. 'I . said something to her, I think as a pleasantry, and she didn't take it . that way. She said that I'd been rude to her afterwards, which I hadn't . been. 'My impression was that she simply had great distaste for being in the same lift as me.' His comments were rubbished today by people including, Jack Dromey, who said the convicted paedophile has no credibility. Mr Dromey said in a statement: 'Quite simply, no one will believe a man like Tom O'Carroll.' Big players: Harriet Harman once legal officer . of the NCCL, now Labour Deputy Leader and husband Jack Dromey, right, a . Left-wing firebrand, now a shadow minister . O'Carroll was not the only prominent member to find themselves in court charged with appalling sex offences. They . included David Joy, a member of its governing committee, prosecuted for . indecent assault, child rape and possession of 1,129 indecent images of . children. Patricia Hewitt: General Secretary of the NCCL. O'Carroll said he met her in a lift but never met Mr Dromey or Ms Harman . They also . included Andrew Sadler, a prep school teacher and PIE organiser jailed . in Romania for sexual corruption and sex with a minor; Steven Smith, a former . chairman, who was jailed for possessing indecent images; and Morris . Fraser, a co-founder. Harriet Harman belatedly expressed ‘regret’ yesterday that the vile paedophile group was allowed to forge links with the National Council for Civil Liberties. But she still refused to apologise over the NCCL’s extraordinary relationship with the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. Labour’s deputy leader has repeatedly resisted calls to comment on the Mail’s revelations that she, her MP husband Jack Dromey and former health secretary Patricia Hewitt held key roles in the pressure group that granted ‘affiliate’ status to PIE, a group of predatory paedophiles who openly campaigned to legalise child sex. On Monday evening, Miss Harman dismissed the revelations as a ‘politically-motivated smear campaign’. But hours after a disastrous BBC Newsnight appearance she abruptly changed tack. Faced with questions over why she found it so difficult in the interview to condemn the link with PIE – who wanted the age of consent to be four – Miss Harman issued a statement yesterday through her spokesman, who said: ‘She regrets the existence of PIE and she regrets their involvement with NCCL before she joined, although it was immaterial to her work.’ Document: This is the cover page of the NCCL's submission to Parliament on the 1976 Sexual Offences Act held at the LSE library, which suggests that the age of consent be lowered to 14 . Damning: On page six of the document it is argued that 'a person aged 14 or over should be legally capable of giving consent' and the age of sexual consent cut to ten 'if the child understood the nature of the act' Former culture secretary Tessa Jowell has said Ms Harman had been a . lifelong feminist and 'wasn't chasing wacky causes' during the 1970s. She . told Today: 'Harriet, Jack Dromey, were completely consistent in their . opposition to the vile influence of the Paedophile Information . Exchange.' Ms Jowell said there was 'not one shred of evidence that they gave any comfort to this revolting organisation'. She . added: 'There's no question of post-hoc justification here. The . evidence shows how vigorous Jack Dromey was in his attack on the . Paedophile Information Exchange. 'Harriet's work at NCCL didn't bring her into contact with them at all.' 1978 briefing: The NCCL legal officer Harriet Harman wrote this briefing paper on the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. She argued that it would lead to an 'increase in censorship' Argument: The second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed . Recommendations: Miss Harman's briefing went on that the NCCL would argue that the Bill to protect children should be amended . Signed: The Labour Deputy Leader's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered . Jack Dromey has spoken out for the first time and said he is 'proud' of his support for a controversial civil liberties organisation in the 1970s. He also said that he led the fight to stop paedophiles having any influence in it. Mr Dromey said he chose to stay within the civil liberties organisation and led the fight against paedophile attempts to infiltrate it. He said: 'I took them on and defeated them. They published a leaflet denouncing me.' Asked why he didn't simply resign from the NCCL when the Paedophile Information Exchange became involved, he said he believed it was important to stay and fight them. 'I stayed and took them on. 'I'm proud of the stand that I took. They are loathsome. And I'm proud of the stand that I took taking them on. 'So the idea that we should allow these . sinister men, and they were sinister, to infiltrate the NCCL and then we . should walk away - that was not appropriate. 'NCCL did outstanding work. That includes the early foundations of work on children's rights. On women's rights. On gay rights. On trade union rights.' The Mail revealed . that during the 1970s and 80s, the NCCL described PIE – . granted formal ‘affiliate’ status from 1975 to the mid-Eighties – in . glowing terms as ‘a campaigning/counselling group for adults attracted . to children’. AGM minutes: This page reveals how the PIE was represented at an NCCL AGM at the University of Lancaster. Below the list of organisations present is Jack Dromey's name, after he was re-elected to the executive committee of the NCCL in 1977 . The NCCL – . now the respected Liberty – filed a submission to Parliament claiming . that ‘childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult, . result in no identifiable damage’. NCCL lawyers also acted for PIE members who were questioned by police over their disgusting behaviour. Ms Hewitt was general  secretary of . the NCCL from 1974-83. Miss Harman was a newly qualified solicitor when . she became its legal officer in 1978 until 1982, when she entered . Parliament. Mr Dromey sat on the NCCL executive committee from 1970 to . 1979. Police are . investigating PIE as part of Operation Fernbridge, launched after the . Jimmy Savile affair, with one source saying there is evidence that PIE . members were abusing children ‘on an industrial scale’. The . Home Office is also carrying out a ‘thorough, independent . investigation’ into shocking claims that the Labour government of the . 1970s may have helped finance the notorious group. Ever . since December, when The Mail first investigated the NCCL’s links to . the paedophile lobby, we have been sending detailed questions to Miss . Harman, Miss Hewitt and Mr Dromey about their links to PIE and whether . they now regret supporting such a group.","Convicted child abuser Tom O'Carroll led PIE and sat on gay rights committee of National Council of Civil Liberties .

"A professional skydiver has redefined 'extreme sports' after becoming the first person to complete five of the blood-pumping activities in just one day. Chuck Berry, from Queenstown in New Zealand, managed to skydive, snowboard, mountain bike, bungee jump and take a ride in a jet boat in no more than an hour in July this year. The 47-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that the whole experience left him feeling 'like James Bond'. Scroll down for video . Chuck Berry, from Queenstown in New Zealand, skydived, snowboarded, mountain biked, bungee jumped and took a ride in a jet boat in one day . It took the 47-year-old only one hour to complete all five activities . 'It was just wonderful. I'm an adventurer by trade so being able to combine all these sports is something I've always dreamt of doing,' he said. 'As far as I know, no one else has ever done it…I couldn't take the smile off my face for days afterwards.' Mr Berry's extreme day was designed and planned right down to a tee. It began with a helicopter ride to Mount Hyde in Queenstown near the Skippers Canyon where he skydived down onto the mountain peak in his snow boots from 10,000 feet in the air. It began with a helicopter ride to Mount Hyde in Queenstown near the Skippers Canyon . Mr Berry jumped from the chopper at 10,000 feet while wearing his ski boots . He landed just nearby his snowboard which he then rode down the mountain side . The professional extreme sportsman landed right beside his snowboard which he rode down the mountain, where he was again picked up in the same chopper. He was then dropped off at Vanguard Peak where he mounted a bike that was attached to the side of the helicopter, and proceeded to mountain bike mostly downhill to the historic Skippers Bridge. From here, Mr Berry bungee jumped off the edge of the 75 metre high bridge before being lowered down to a jet boat which took him on a thrilling ride down the river. The professional skydiver re-boarded the chopper at the bottom of the mountain which took him to Vanguard Peak . After a quick footwear change, he Mr Berry mounted a mountain bike attached to the side of the chopper and rode mostly downhill along an old mining trail . 'Skydiving is something I'm extra passionate about it and it's not every day that you get to land a parachute on top of a mountain, but the snowboarding was just delicious,' Mr Berry recounted. 'It was buttery, creamy snowboard conditions and that was just wonderful. 'But it was the jet boat ride at the end of it all, when I had the camera helicopter behind me, that was close to being the best part - that was really when I felt like Bond.' He arrived at the Skippers Bridge where he proceeded to bungee jump off . The thrill seeker was lowered from the 75 metre high bridge into a jet boat which then took him on a ride down the river . Mr Berry said the experience left him feeling 'like James Bond', adding 'I couldn't take the smile off my face for days afterwards' Although he may have been the first person to conquer all five sports in one day, Mr Berry will certainly not be the last.

"Some people may think that grammar doesn't matter anymore, but there is clearly a quiet army out there of those who disagree. In the wake of a council's decision to remove apostrophes from street signs, an anonymous guerrilla grammarian is going around using a marker pen to correct the punctuation. Signs with missing punctuation, such as that at Scholars Walk, have seen the correct apostrophe inserted overnight. On the same sign in the town's East Chesterton area, an apostrophe has also been added to Pepys Court. Grammar check: The Scholars Walk road sign in Cambridge where someone has added in missing apostrophes with a black marker after the council removed them . Marker: Someone has used a black pen to add in two missing apostrophes to a road sign in Cambridge . The local authority in Cambridge has . been accused of 'dumbing down' in the great university town over its . decision to remove punctuation from street signs. Kathy Salaman, director of the Cambridge-based Good Grammar Company, praised the covert operation - although denied being the person responsible. She said: 'I am very pleased that someone or some people have taken it in their hands to correct this dumbing down. 'It is further proof of how much people have been affected by this idea of getting rid of something as important as our grammar. 'Cambridge is famous for the university and for people coming from other countries, such as scholars or business people, the signs without correct punctuation would give a very bad impression. 'I have heard that the signs have been vandalised by the marker pen but to me it was the language that has been vandalised by removing the apostrophes.' Apostrophe row: Scholars Walk in Cambridge is at the centre of a row over a missing apostrophe . The council argues it is simply following guidelines from the National Land and Property Gazetteer, where all new street names are registered. They argue that apostrophes are said to lead to mistakes – particularly among emergency services. Councillor Tim Ward, executive director of planning, said: 'I think people would be more unhappy if an ambulance was unable to find their street.' Cllr Ward admitted that the decision could be reversed the 'next time we refresh our policy' if national guidelines change. But he added that the punctuation of street signs was currently a low priority issue for the local authority following a raft of budget cuts. The Cambridge News has reported that Cambridgeshire's police and fire services, as well as the East of England Ambulance Service, have no objections to punctuations in road names but Cllr Ward said the local authority would adjust its policy according to national guidelines. The naming policy also bans street names which would be 'difficult to pronounce or awkward to spell' and any which 'could give offence' or would 'encourage defacing of nameplates'. Existing street names are not affected by the policy.","Local authority has removed punctuation marks on street signs in the town .

With vast swathes of America's male . population having joined the fighting, the War years saw women filing into factories, shipyards and steelworks to . take on what - until then - had been traditionally regarded as 'men's . work'. Safety officials decided the country's newly fledged female labour force needed more than just goggles and gloves to protect them from potential injury as they performed manual tasks. Safety at work: Two women show off a new uniform - including a plastic 'bra' - designed to help prevent occupational accidents among female war workers in Los Angeles in 1943 . The sturdy undergarment, named the SAF-T-BRA, is believed to have been designed by Willson Goggles, a Pennsylvania firm that manufactured safety equipment for manual workers. In the 1940s, as World War II rumbled on, a generation of women rolled up their sleeves to keep shipyards, factories, steelworks and railroads moving. This series of black and white photographs are taken from the archives of the Women's Bureau, which was established as part of the U.S. Department of Labor in 1920. The Bureau was tasked with formulating 'standards and policies which shall promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment'.

"One in seven pregnant women in Ebola-hit West African countries could die in childbirth because hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to treat them, leading aid charities warned this morning. The rate of women dying while giving birth in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia is soaring due to inadequate medical facilities and a fear of contact with bodily fluids preventing people helping them. The United Nations Population Fund estimates that 800,000 women in those three countries alone over the coming 12 months - with aid charities warning that some 120,000 of them could face life-threatening complications if there are not dramatic improvements in emergency care. Scroll down for video . Outbreak: The world's worst Ebola epidemic, which emerged  in March, has infected more than 13,000 people and killed almost 5,000 in the three worst-hit countries - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia . Threat: One in seven pregnant women in Ebola-hit West African countries could die in childbirth because hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to treat them, leading aid charities have warned . Tens of thousands of women could die in childbirth in West Africa over the coming year due to medical facilities being overwhelmed by the Ebola crisis, according to the DEC group of 13 leading UK charities, including Save The Children and ActionAid. Korto Williams, head of ActionAid in Liberia, said many women were being left to give birth alone because stigma and a lack of information meant midwives feared catching Ebola and stayed away. Too many women have died because of lack of care, she said, adding video clips on the internet show women giving birth in the streets of Monrovia with no one helping. She said the 'horrendous prediction' of one in seven women dying in childbirth was a 'worst case scenario' but added: 'We have to do more to ... stop this coming true.' 'We have to ensure that pregnant women get the care they urgently need or we will see the rate of maternal deaths skyrocket,' Ms Williams added. Poverty: Tens of thousands of women could die in childbirth in West Africa over the coming year due to medical facilities being overwhelmed by the Ebola crisis. Pictured is the Clara Town slum in Monrovia, Libreville . Spread: Global health specialists have warned that with clinics overwhelmed with thousands of Ebola cases, West Africans with other diseases like malaria or tuberculosis are also likely to suffer . The world's worst Ebola epidemic, which emerged in Guinea in March, has infected more than 13,000 people and killed almost 5,000 in the three worst-hit countries. Global health specialists have warned that with clinics overwhelmed with thousands of Ebola cases, people with other diseases like malaria or tuberculosis, and those with conditions needing medical care, are likely to suffer. 'Ebola is having a huge impact on wider health issues like maternal healthcare,' said Save the Children's chief executive Justin Forsyth. 'No children have gone to school since March and pregnant mums are avoiding health clinics and hospitals,' he added. Not protected: A young child is pictured in the Ebola-ravaged Clara Town slum in the Liberian capital Monrovia . At risk: A young boy scavenges among rubbish in the Ebola-hit Clara Town slum in Monrovia, Liberia . In a joint statement released this morning, the 13 charities said speeding up the creation of more Ebola-focused treatment centres so that other health facilities can function normally would be essential to avoiding the feared rise in maternal deaths. The group also called for more protective and sanitation equipment to be provided, as well as treatment units specifically for health workers, to enable midwives to work safely and without unnecessary risks. There have been reports of a drop in the numbers of new Ebola cases in Liberia, but Médecins Sans Frontières is warning against complacency, saying the outbreak is far from over. New hotspots are emerging around the country all the time, said MSF and in Guinea, where there were two significant dips in cases, the numbers have risen again. The Spanish nurse who survived Ebola said she will demand £120,000 compensation from the government for putting down her dog Excalibur. Teresa Romero, 44, spent a month in isolation after becoming the first person outside Africa to contract the disease while she was caring for a missionary. But she said the worst part of her ordeal was leaning her mixed breed dog had been put down, claiming 'he was not given a chance'. Teresa Romero, 44, spent a month in isolation after becoming the first person outside Africa to contract Ebola . Lawyers for Mrs Romero say the decision to put the animal down last month as she battled the killer disease was 'improvised and taken against medical advice'. Health chiefs in Madrid obtained a court order to sacrifice Excalibur despite an online petition to save it signed by more than 300,000 people. Riot police clashed with protestors outside her home near Madrid so they could take the animal away to incinerate it. As well as demanding compensation for her dog through the courts, the nurse is also planning to sue Madrid health chief Javier Rodriguez for defamation.

While Teresa was battling to save her life he accused her of hiding information from the doctors who treated her before she was admitted to hospital.

Amid controversy over the training given to health professionals treating the two Spanish missionaries with the disease he claimed on TV: 'You don't need a Masters degree to explain to someone how to put on or take off a suit.'

"The Edinburgh home where the Harry Potter author wrote four of her best-selling novels has been snapped up after just three weeks on the market, fetching far more than her original asking price. James Whitson, of estate agents Rettie & Co. said: ""This was an iconic house in Edinburgh and it was a privilege to be entrusted with its sale.' He told Mail Online the house had been bought by 'a local Scottish businessman', adding: 'There is a shortage of quality supply in Edinburgh and when any property is correctly priced in a prime location, it will attract significant interest.' House of inspiration: The Edinburgh house where Harry Potter author JK Rowling wrote at least four of the seven book has been sold for more than £2.25m . Scenic home: The house - which has been bought by a local Scottish businessman - was the author's home with her husband and children until she moved out in 2009 . Scene of her writing: The view from the patio at the rear of the house looking out into the garden . Change of fortune: JK Rowling was a single mother living on benefits before her Harry Potter novels made her millions . The 19-century mansion in Abbotsford . Park was bought by the popular author in 1999 and she lived there with . her family - her husband Neil, daughters Jessica, 19, and Mackenzie, . seven, and son David, nine, - for 10 years.[related] . The stone-built house features eight . bedrooms, landscaped gardens and original cornices and fireplaces and . lies in what the estate agent called 'one of Edinburgh's most exclusive . conservation areas'. Built on two floors, the house boasts . landscaped gardens and several outhouses as well as a detached . split-level office. Since the author moved out, to Barnton in the . north-west of Edinburgh in 2009, it has been refurbished and decorated . with neutral colours. The new owner will be able to enjoy . off-street parking and a double garage which can be accessed from a . cobbled lane at the rear of the house. Although the house has gone for well over £2.25m, JK Rowling is worth around £560 . million according to the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List. Details of her old home attracted more than 16,000 hits on the estate agent's website.  Asian and American fans were . especially keen to see where their favourite author lived, but the . prospective buyers who visited the property were exclusively wealthy . businessmen looking for a base in the Scottish capital. The 47-year-old literary whiz . originally owned the top half of the house, but bought the remainder of . the property from her neighbours and converted the mansion into one home . after her wizarding franchise took off. But she had already written at least four of the seven books in the 19th century, ivy-clad building where she lived with her husband Dr Neil Murray and her three children. Space: the kitchen of the eight-bedroom Merchiston home boasts an abundance of space and natural daylight . Emptied out: The house has been completely refurbished since the author and her family moved out in 2009 . The gardens are walled and the property comes with an advanced alarm security system - this is not . surprising as the author has previously spoken in the past of how . difficult she found the scrutiny of the press. Last year she told the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards that she and her family were driven out of their home . and deterred from taking family holidays because of the constant . presence of photographers. Home office: The house is situated in what the estate agent called 'one of Edinburgh's most exclusive conservation areas' Period features: The house retains many period features including huge sash windows, shutters and cornicing . Period home: The 19th century building is made of stone and spans two floors . The author and her family now live in a different home that is worth £2million . Miss Rowling, 46, bought her current . home, a 17th century mansion for more than £2 million in 2009 when she . reportedly fell in love with it after viewing just two of its 31 rooms. She lives there with her husband, their two young children and her 18-year-old daughter . Jessica, from her first marriage. The property has been dubbed ‘Fortress Rowling’ by some because of its security fences and reinforced doors. Giant trees were lifted by crane over the garden walls to give the author and her family more privacy. Secure: The house has an intercom for secure entry - JK Rowling has previously spoken of how difficult she found life with paparazzi outside her home . Last year JK Rowling got planning permission to flatten a £1 million 1970s style house next door to make her garden larger. She also got approval to build a summer house that critics said looked like the stone hut inhabited by Hagrid, the giant groundsman from her best-selling novels. In July JK Rowling's husband applied for planning permission for two huge interlocked treehouses at her new home in Barnton. Portfolio: As well as landscaped gardens, the property comes with several outhouses . Spacious: There are three different exits from the grounds of the impressive house . But even by JK Rowling’s standards . the 40ft high, two-storey tree houses planned for the back garden of her . mansion are something spectacular. The Hogwarts-style towers - estimated to cost around £150,000 - are so big that they need planning permission. Each wooden tree house is to be built . on stilts and boasts balconies, carvings and turrets that wouldn’t look . out of place in a Potter adventure. The towers are linked by a rope bridge and can be approached by a secret tunnel hidden underneath a raised wooden walkway. Place to work: The house also comes with an office building, which could be where JK Rowling penned her famous novels . Spacious: The office building is detached and is split-level, a world away from the cafe when the author penned her first book . Plans lodged with the City of . Edinburgh Council reveal the houses are intended for Miss Rowling’s two . youngest children David and Mackenzie. Although she has completed the Harry . Potter series, her first adult book, The Casual Vacancy, which is set in . a fictional English village, was published earlier this year. Wealthy: Daniel Radcliffe is pictured as Harry Potter. Creator JK Rowling is worth around £560 million according to the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List . Small change: The Rowling fortune is estimated to be at £560m so the price tag of the Scottish home is relatively small to the author . On a bigger scale: An outhouse in the grounds of the home - in her new house JK Rowling has commissioned a pair of £150,000 tree houses for her two youngest children .","Writer and family lived in smart Merchiston home until 2009 .

"People with no religious affiliation now make up the third-largest global group in a new study of the world's faiths - coming after Christians and Muslims but just before Hindus. The study, based on extensive data for the year 2010, also showed Islam and Hinduism are the faiths most likely to expand in the future while Judaism has the weakest growth prospects. It showed Christianity is the most evenly spread religion, present in all regions of the world, while Hinduism is the least global with 94 per cent of its population in one country, India. Number one religion: Christianity has the largest following around the world with 2.2 billion adherents, according to a new study . Overall, 84 per cent of the world's inhabitants, which it estimated at 6.9 billion, identify with a religion, according to the study entitled 'The Global Religious Landscape' issued by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life on Tuesday. The 'unaffiliated' category covers all those who profess no religion, from atheists and agnostics to people with spiritual beliefs but no link to any established faith. 'Many of the religiously unaffiliated do hold religious or spiritual beliefs,' the study stressed. 'Belief in God or a higher power is shared by 7 percent of unaffiliated Chinese adults, 30 per cent of unaffiliated French adults and 68 percent of unaffiliated U.S. adults,' it said. Pew Forum demographer Conrad Hackett said the 2,500 censuses, surveys and population registers used to compile the report did not allow a further breakdown to estimate the world population of atheists and agnostics. 'It's not the kind of data that's available for every country,' he said. 'A census will typically ask what your religion is and you can identify a number of particular affiliations or no religion. 'An age breakdown showed Muslims had the lowest median age at 23 years, compared to 28 for the whole world population. The median age highlights the population bulge at the point where half the population is above and half below that number. 'Muslims are going to grow as a share of the world's population and an important part of that is this young age structure,' Hackett said. Half of the world's Buddhists live in China, with 13.2 per cent in Thailand and 9.4 per cent in Japan . By contrast, Judaism, which has 14 million adherents or 0.2 per cent of the world population, has the highest median age at 36, meaning its growth prospects are weakest. Hackett noted that Israel, which has 40.5 percent of the world Jewish population, had a younger age structure than the United States, where 41.1 percent of the world's Jews live. Global Christianity's median age is 30 and Hinduism's 26. With a median age of 34, the growth prospects for religiously unaffiliated people are weak, the study showed. The study estimated Christianity was the largest faith at 2.2 billion adherents or 31.5 percent of the world's population. The Roman Catholic Church makes up 50 per cent of that total, with Protestants - including Anglicans and non-denominational churches - at 37 percent and Orthodox at 12 percent. There are about 1.6 billion Muslims around the world, or 23 per cent of the global population. 'The overwhelming majority (87-90 percent) are Sunnis, about 10-13 per cent are Shia Muslims,' the study said. Among the 1.1 billion unaffiliated people around the world, 62 per cent live in China alone and they make up 52.2 percent of the Chinese population. Japan comes next with the second largest unaffiliated population in the world with 72 million, or 57 percent of the national population. After that comes the United States, where 16.4 percent of all Americans said they have no link to an established faith. The world's Hindu population is concentrated mostly in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Half of the world's Buddhists live in China, followed far behind by Thailand at 13.2 per cent of the world Buddhist population and Japan with 9.4 per cent. The study found that about 405 million people, or about 6 per cent of the world population, followed folk religions such as those found in Africa and China or among Native American and Australian aboriginal peoples. Another 58 million, or nearly 1 percent of the world population, belonged to 'other religions' including Baha'i, Taoism, Jainism, Shintoism, Sikhism, Tenrikyo, Wicca and Zoroastrianism. Most were in the Asia-Pacific region.","Christianity is the largest faith with 2.2 billion adherents or 31.5 per cent of the world's population .

"The Mulberry handbags that provided one of the first controversies of England’s doomed 2018 World Cup bid are now under scrutiny by FIFA investigator Michael Garcia. New York attorney Garcia, who is leading the FIFA ethics probe into the shadowy bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, is understood to have asked the FA for the receipts for the designer accessories. The fashion bags, which cost £239 - within the bid guidelines - were given to the voting FIFA executive members on a visit to London in October 2009 as gifts for their wives. Former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner had complained that England hadn’t handed out goody bags at a Leaders in Football conference, as Australia and Qatar had done. Under scrutiny: FIFA investigator Michael Garcia is understood to have asked the FA for receipts for the Mulberry handbags handed out to FIFA executives back in October 2009 . Ironically Warner, who has since resigned from all football positions in disgrace following his involvement in the cash-for-votes scandal surrounding Mohamed bin Hammam’s aborted bid for the FIFA presidency, returned his wife Maureen’s Mulberry handbag a month later. He said he felt ‘derided, betrayed and embarrassed in its presence’. The FA did not comment on Monday. ............................................................................. The bizarre scattergun approach to Michael Garcia’s investigation into the World Cup bids is demonstrated by him not interviewing England 2018 ambassador David Dein, one of football’s great global networkers. He addressed the Caribbean Football Union dinner in Trinidad in 2010, for which England 2018 picked up a £35,000 tab that is under investigation by Garcia.

"Mormon leaders have finally admitted that the church's founder and prophet, Joseph Smith, took as many as 40 wives, some already married and one only 14 years old. Smith, who wrote the Book of Mormon and established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had been portrayed in church materials as a loyal partner to his loving spouse Emma. The church's acknowledgement is part of an effort to be more open about its history as members increasingly encounter claims about the faith on the internet. Scroll down for video . Polygamous: The Mormon church has admitted that its founder Joseph Smith (right) had 40 wives - including 14-year-old Helen Kimball (pictured left much later in life) 'Difficult': An essay published by the church describes Smith's reluctance to engage in plural marriage - and says the process was 'excruciating' for his first wife, Emma, depicted above . Many Mormons, especially those with polygamous ancestors, say they were well aware that Smith's successor, Brigham Young, practiced polygamy when he led the flock in Salt Lake City, The New York Times reports. However, they did not know the full truth about Smith. 'Joseph Smith was presented to me as a practically perfect prophet, and this is true for a lot of people,' said Emily Jensen, a blogger and editor in Farmington, Utah, who often writes about Mormon issues. She said the reaction of some Mormons to the news was similar to the five stages of grief, 'this is not the Joseph Smith I love'. According to the church, Smith was unlikely to have had sexual relations with all of his wives, as some were 'sealed' to him for the next life. But the multi-marriages were said to be 'an excruciating ordeal', for his wife. Most of Smith's wives were between the ages of 20 and 40, but he married Helen Mar Kimball, a daughter of two close friends, 'several months before her 15th birthday.' According to 'careful estimates', the church said Smith had 30 to 40 wives. Smith also wed women who were already married, some to men who were his friends and followers. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon Church is formally known, has posted 12 essays on its website over the last year on contentious topics. Public admission: The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints had stayed silent on the issue of Joseph Smith's polygamy for years. Pictured is a statue of Smith and his first wife, Emma, in front of the church's Salt Lake City headquarters . Elder Steven E. Snow, the church historian and a member of its senior leadership, has reportedly said, 'There is so much out there on the Internet that we felt we owed our members a safe place where they could go to get reliable, faith-promoting information that was true about some of these more difficult aspects of our history. 'We need to be truthful, and we need to understand our history,' Elder Snow said. 'I believe our history is full of stories of faith and devotion and sacrifice, but these people weren't perfect.' The essay on 'plural marriage' in the early days of the Mormon movement in Ohio and Illinois says polygamy was commanded by God. It goes on to say it was then revealed to Smith and was reluctantly accepted. Abraham and other Old Testament patriarchs had multiple wives, and Smith preached that his church was the 'restoration' of the early, true Christian church. An essay published by the church describes how Smith said he was visited three times by angels between 1834 and 1842 who commanded him to marry more women, despite him already having a wife, Emma. The third time, the essay says: 'The angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.' Ban: Polygamy was outlawed by the Mormon church in 1890. Pictured are church leaders around that time, including Wilford Woodruff, the leader who ended the practice . Other writings posted by the church in the past couple of years have addressed sacred undergarments worn by devout members; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy; and the misconception that Mormons are taught they'll get their own planet in the afterlife. The articles about Smith's wives during the 1830s and 1840s in Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo, Illinois, comes about 10 months after the church acknowledged polygamy was widely practiced among its members in the late 19th century. 'As a collection, these are remarkably revealing articles, continuing the new open and transparent philosophy of historical writing,' said Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University. The information will be surprising to many Latter-day Saints who either didn't know or were encouraged to dismiss speculation as anti-Mormon propaganda, Mauss said. Splinter groups who call themselves fundamentalist Mormons still practice plural marriage, including Warren Jeffs' sect on the Utah-Arizona border. Latter-day Saints began practicing polygamy after Smith received a revelation from God. He took his first plural wife in 1830 in Ohio, three years after he married his first wife, Emma, an earlier article revealed. He and his first plural wife separated, but he renewed the practice a decade later in Illinois, which is where he married the teenager. The essay noted that while inappropriate by today's standards, marriage among teen girls was legal at the time. The article acknowledges that many details about polygamy in early Mormonism are hazy because members were taught to keep their actions confidential. But research has indicated that Smith's marriage to the young girl might not have involved sex. 'Remarkable, revealing': Experts have commented that the decision to address such issues is an unusually transparent move by the church's leaders. Pictured is Salt Lake Temple, the Mormon faith's most important church . Some plural marriages were designed to seal the man to the woman for eternity only, and not life and eternity as Mormons believe, the article says. Those types of marriages didn't seem to involve sex. Little is known about Smith's marriages to the already-married women, the article says. They also might have been the type of unions that didn't involve sex. Plural marriage was an 'excruciating ordeal' for Emma Smith and confounding for some men, too, the article says. Some people left the faith, and others refused to take multiple wives while remaining Latter-day Saints. When Latter-day Saints trekked cross-country to Utah in 1847, nearly 200 men and more than 500 women were in plural marriage, it says. 'Difficult as it was, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed 'raise up seed' unto God,' the article says. 'A substantial number of today's members descend through faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage.'","Church admits for the first time how many wives founder Joseph Smith had .

"St Helens captain Paul Wellens believes there is a bright future for the England team despite their failure to reach the final of the 2014 Four Nations Series. England's 16-14 defeat by New Zealand, followed by Australia's 44-18 triumph over Samoa, in the last round of matches eliminated Steve McNamara's team from the tournament. The near-misses down under followed England's agonising World Cup semi-final defeat by the Kiwis 12 months ago but Wellens, who has been part of McNamara's coaching staff for the last two years, insists the good times are not far away. Paul Wellens believes England will become a force in Rugby Union, despite the disappointing Four Nations exit . George Burgess is blocked off by the New Zealand defence in England's 16-14 Four Nations defeat on Saturday . Jason Taumalolo holds off the England players, as New Zealand and Australia winning sent England out . 'It's an exciting future, given the average age of the squad,' Wellens said. 'There are some good, young players like Dan Sarginson, who showed what he is capable of in this tournament, and Joe Burgess who unfortunately didn't get a run but I'm sure will develop into a great player for his country as well. 'The signs are there. Although it was a disappointing end to the tour this time around, I certainly think there is a better future ahead. 'As a team, we've really put a stamp on world rugby. We've showed we are more than competitive and, moving forward, it promises to be a really exciting three-match series against New Zealand next year. The last two games against the Kiwis have been extremely close and I expect it to be very similar next year.' Wellens, who won the last of his 31 international caps for Great Britain and England in the 2008 World Cup, says he has been blown away by the professionalism of the current set-up. 'I was five years out of the England set-up and the change in that time has been remarkable,' he added. 'It was quite clear to me that there's been a lot of hard work done behind scenes to put a stamp on this England team, to bring these people together. Wellens believes Steve McNamara (above) can shape England into a dangerous  team on the world stage . 'Quite often people talk about the two-team mentality where players come from their respective clubs and really buy into what we are trying to achieve with England and this has shown with how they get on together in the England camp. 'The attitudes are fantastic, it's clear to see they enjoy their time with each other and they're making some huge strides.' The 34-year-old Wellens, who went straight from St Helens' Grand-Final triumph into the Four Nations Series, will report back for pre-season training with his club later this month ahead of what is expected to be his final season as a player. He is tipped to join Keiron Cunningham's coaching staff at Langtree Park and is also set to remain part of the England set-up if, as seems likely, McNamara remains in charge for the visit of the Kiwis next autumn. Wellens has tipped Joe Burgess (centre) to grow into an important England player in future years . 'It's been an unbelievable experience for me personally,' he said. 'I suppose I'm quite unique in that obviously I'm still playing but I've made no secret of the fact that I would like to get into coaching when I hang up my boots and this experience has been beyond my wildest dreams. 'Not many coaches get the opportunity so early in their career to become involved with some of the best players in the world and I consider myself very fortunate.

"With two goals in five second-half minutes against Motherwell in midweek, Mikael Lustig has taken over John Guidetti’s mantle as the most deadly Swede currently residing at Celtic Park. However, the fit-again defender has his sights set on emulating another well-known compatriot. As a youngster, Lustig grew up in Umeå in northern Sweden watching Old Firm matches which featured his idol — a certain Henrik Larsson — putting Rangers to the sword. After moving to Parkhead in January 2012, however, circumstances have dictated he’s had to wait over three frustrating years for his first chance to face the Ibrox side. After making his first appearance in a Celtic jersey since Aberdeen on November 9, the 28-year-old — who came on at half-time on Wednesday — insists he is more than ready for next weekend’s League Cup semi-final. It is, as he knows from his formative years watching on television, an occasion where heroes can emerge. Mikael Lustig has had to wait over three years to get his first shot at an Old Firm Derby . ‘When I was younger, I watched Scottish league games on television, especially the Old Firm games because of Henrik Larsson and Johan Mjallby,’ recalled Lustig. ‘So I’ve seen them and, of course, it’s a good time to be a hero. ‘I’ve been here three years now and not played in one. But I always knew I wanted to be at Celtic for a long time, so I knew I would play them at some point. I am ready for it! ‘I’ve been to a couple of the games. I sat in the stands at Ibrox and at Celtic Park. I was injured for the home game and I was in the squad at Ibrox (but didn’t make the bench). ‘The occasion was still unlike anything I had experienced. The atmosphere was brilliant. We’ve not had it for a while.’ Henrik Larsson celebrates after scoring against Rangers in a Scottish Cup tie in 2004 . Lustig insists everyone within the Celtic dressing room is aware of the significance and importance of the upcoming League Cup and Europa League ties against historic foes Rangers and Inter Milan respectively. But he believes the uninitiated — like Virgil van Dijk, Jason Denayer and Stefan Johansen — won’t truly understand the occasion until they walk into the searing white heat of Hampden Park for the semi-final a week tomorrow. ‘We play for Celtic and everyone here knows how important these games are,’ said Lustig, whose side faces Ross County in Dingwall in a lunchtime Premiership kick-off today. ‘I don’t go out much. After training I go back to my house and spend time with my kids but still I know how important these games are for the fans. ‘But it’s hard to tell someone about these kind of games if they have not experienced it yet. ‘I always remember hearing that the Champions League nights at Celtic Park were unbelievable. But then when you actually experience it, I remember being like “woah!”. Lustig wants to emulate his idol Larsson by scoring against Celtic's fierce rivals Rangers . ‘I think you need to experience it for yourself. If you love football you should be watching an Old Firm match. ‘When we drew them (Rangers) we were all talking about it. I’m not going to lie. You miss the atmosphere. Of course it is a big game. But it’s tight in the league just now and that means we can’t just focus on the cup and the European matches like we did the last two years. ‘Before we could put the league on the side a little bit. But now we need to be focusing on every game and that has been quite good for us, I think. ‘We play Ross County today and as well as needing the three points it’s a chance for players to play their way into the Rangers match.’ Lustig’s two second-half goals were headers but he was left ruing ‘blowing’ his big chance to grab a hat-trick in the 4-0 rout of Motherwell. He does not expect to be adding to his tally in Dingwall today or rivalling Leigh Griffiths, Anthony Stokes, Stefan Scepovic and Guidetti at the end of the season. Celtic take on Rangers next weekend in a League Cup semi-final showdown . ‘They were my first goals in years so I’d be quite stupid to start boasting about it,’ he smiled. ‘Of course, it’s not every day you score two goals. And one of them was probably the best goal I have ever scored with my head. But maybe not my best-ever goal, because I got some decent ones at Rosenborg. ‘But, let’s be honest, I don’t think I’ll be up there at the end of the season. ‘I actually had a chance to get a perfect hat-trick. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. But I blew it! I have maybe scored a hat-trick when I was really young. I used to play up front when I was a boy but never in senior football. ‘Is there a goal of the season competition developing between our full-backs? Absolutely, although I don’t think Emilio (Izaguirre) is in the competition yet. But Adam Mathews’ against Hamilton was really good, a screamer. ‘It’s good playing in this Celtic team because that’s three games in a row now the full-backs have scored goals. I don’t think we are going to score in every game. But it is always nice to feel like you have the opportunity to go forward.’","Mikael Lustig has had to wait over three years to play an Old Firm Derby .

Larsson, 43, started coaching smaller teams in Sweden after retiring as a player in 2009. Most recently he coached top-flight debutant Falkenberg. Former Celtic striker Henrik Larsson has been appointed as the manager of Helsingborg in the Swedish league . Widely considered as one of Sweden’s greatest footballers, Larsson started and finished his high-level career in Helsingborg. In between, he played for Feyenoord, Celtic and Barcelona. He also joined Manchester United on a three-month loan in 2007. Helsingborg has not placed better than fifth since winning the Swedish league in 2011. The team finished a disappointing ninth in the recently ended 2014 season, 23 points behind winner Malmo. In his playing days, Larsson wore the shirts of clubs like Feyenoord, Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United . Larsson shared an emotional farewell with the Helsingborg fans when he retired as a player in October 2009 . The Swede will now take charge of his old club, replacing Roar Hansen in the manager's seat at Helsingborg .","Henrik Larsson was named as Helsingborg manager on Monday .

"FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said a men’s World Cup could be played on artificial turf 'sooner rather than later'. Valcke was responding to the criticism of FIFA’s decision that means next year’s women’s World Cup in Canada will not be played on grass. A number of leading women players have filed a legal challenge to the decision to play on third-generation synthetic pitches, and a major part of their argument is that men would not be expected to contest a World Cup on anything other than grass. Gareth Bale playing for Wales against Andorra last month... on artificial turf in a 2-1 win . Valcke said FIFA understands that players want 'the best conditions to perform well' but stressed any organiser of any of its tournaments is entitled to propose artificial turf. Valcke insists FIFA would only accept pitches 'of the highest quality', and added: 'It could well be that sooner rather than later the men’s World Cup will also be played on artificial pitches.' He told FIFA’s website that Canada’s decision to offer artificial pitches was 'due to the extreme climate in the host country', a problem that looks set to also arise when the men’s 2022 World Cup is played in Qatar. Valcke added: 'As has already been explained, this is not a question of money, or of differences between men’s and women’s events, but it is a matter of the natural conditions in Canada: we want to guarantee consistent top-level playing conditions for all 24 teams during the event, both in the official stadiums and at the training sites. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke says a men’s World Cup could be played on artificial turf soon . 'This has been the sole reason behind the decision to play on artificial turf from day one.' Artificial pitches are not allowed in England’s Premier League and Football League, but the latter may soon give the go-ahead to their reintroduction in League One and League Two, with club chairmen due to vote on November 6. Such surfaces will be permitted at Conference level from next season, and this season a rule change means artificial pitches are allowed at any stage of the FA Cup. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told German magazine Sport Bild the world governing body will listen to all pitch suggestions, saying men could play a World Cup on a synthetic surface 'maybe even tomorrow'. Blatter said: 'We are open to proposal from the local organisers, and this has been possible for years in accordance with the FIFA regulations. Artificial turf is the future of football.' England famously lost to Russia in qualification for Euro 2008 on artificial turf in Moscow .","FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said a men’s World Cup could be played on artificial turf 'sooner rather than later'

"Federal scientists investigating an unusually high number of dead bottlenose dolphins washing up on the East Coast said on Thursday the carcasses are showing up at a rate that is seven times higher than usual. More than 120 dead animals have been discovered since June from New Jersey to Virginia, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries Service said. Federal scientists have declared it an 'unusual mortality event' and are investigating the cause, said Maggie Mooney-Seus of NOAA Fisheries. Scientists are working to unravel the cause of a surge in the number of dolphin deaths as a number of stranded mammals have been found beached along East Coast US states . Volunteers load a deceased male dolphin onto a metal stretcher on the beach in Virginia. The public are warned not to approach stranded animals because they could be infectious . A number of things can cause dolphins to strand, including harmful algal blooms, infectious viruses, injuries due to ship strikes, pollutants and human-made runoff, NOAA said. Although the cause has not been determined, early tissue analysis showed that one suspect could be morbillivirus, a disease similar to measles, said Teri Rowles, national marine mammal stranding coordinator for NOAA Fisheries. Marine stranding response centers are collecting information on the deaths and necropsies are being performed, but it could take several weeks to determine what led to the deaths, the NOAA said. In this month alone, 28 dolphins were found dead along the shores of the East Coast. Early tests suggest that morbillivirus, a disease similar to measles, could be the cause . In 1987, more than 740 animals died of morbillivirus on the coast from New Jersey to Florida . It has been 25 years since the last large die-off of dolphins along the U.S. coast. In 1987, more than 740 animals died of morbillivirus on the coast from New Jersey to Florida.

"The river of flames that has been making its way downslope on Hawaii's big island since June 27 is speeding up as it heads straight for a town of 1000 residents. The continued lava flow from the summer crater eruption at Puu Oo was last clocked at a steady 705 feet per day.Now the progress has been measured at a far brisker 890 feet per day. While the flow has now bypassed Kahoe homestead, directly in its currently path is the town of Pahoa. The Hawaii County Civil Defense posted to its website: 'Currently the flow does not pose an immediate threat to area communities and area residents will be given adequate notice to safely evacuate should that be necessary.' heading straight for town: The river of flames that has been making its way downslope on Hawaii's big island since June 27 is speeding up as it heads straight for a town of 1000 residents . Speeding up: Moving at its current speed, scientists said the 300-foot-wide flow could reach Kaohe in close to two weeks . That could, however, change at any moment. Thankfully, due no doubt to the wet and dense vegetation 'there is no brushfire threat at this time and all burning is limited to the vegetation that is in direct contact with the flow.' As of Tuesday, experts estimated that the flow was 19 days away from the main drag of Pahoa. However, that was at the previously measured speed. Now the lava could hit the town in closer to 15 days. Residents and lawmakers fear that, beyond the main town road, the thick molten rock could reach Highway 705, which could cut off virtually all access to and from Hawaii's Puna District, notes the Star Advertiser. Workers continue to prepare unpaved roads to be used as alternate routes in case lava crosses the highway. Path of destruction: The lava was moving at 890 feet per day as of Wednesday, leaving a path of destruction behind it. But scientists said surround forest was not burning . Residents and lawmakers fear that, beyond the main town road, the thick molten rock could reach Highway 705, which could cut off virtually all access to and from Hawaii's Puna District, notes the Star Advertiser .

Unpredictability is a problem: The flow emerged June 27, but went underground for quite a while before returning to the surface in late August, with several disappearances and re-emergences since then. The direction and speed of the flow have also shifted slightly — though not for the better — since scientists began monitoring it. Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said lava has covered other major Big Island roads in the past, like a state highway in Kalapana and Chain of Craters Road which is partially in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The part of Highway 130 that could be cut off is used by 7,000 to 11,000 vehicles per day, he said. Ghost town: Downtown Pahoa, Hawaii.

In another letter to . the Deputy Prime Minister, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws says . mandatory minimum sentences are ‘too blunt an instrument’ and he is also . ‘unwilling’ to support the proposed change in the law. Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling has drawn up plans to legislate so that . offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed, . according to senior sources. The . review is understood to have been prompted by alarming evidence that . thugs are escaping jail despite repeatedly flouting the law by carrying . knives. Currently, around . four out of five of those convicted of a knife crime do not go to . prison. Incredibly, forty per cent of criminals with at least three . previous convictions are given soft sentences, such as fines, cautions, . community punishments or suspended jail terms. In . a move backed by Home Secretary Theresa May, Education Secretary . Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Mr Grayling is . proposing to use a new Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to make . sentencing tougher for knife possession.

Stabbed: Conservative ministers want the measure put before MPs within weeks, following the death of 61-year-old Ann Maguire in her Leeds classroom on Monday . But . the documents leaked to the Mail reveal that the proposal has become . the subject of a fierce argument at the top of the coalition. One . well-placed source said Mr Clegg, who chairs the Cabinet home affairs . committee, declined even to discuss it when it was raised in a meeting . of the senior ministers on the body on Wednesday. ‘Chris . Grayling pointed out that they had not talked about this change in the . law to introduce much more serious penalties for knife crime and this . was the forum to discuss it,’ said the source. ‘Nick . Clegg said “we haven’t discussed it and I am not going to have it . discussed”. He said “I’m in charge of this committee - forget it”. It . was unbelievable.’ Furious . Tories say they now plan to vote in favour of the measure despite the . Lib Dem stance, with a Commons motion expected to be tabled as soon as . today by backbench MP Nick de Bois. Rejected: Danny Alexander wrote this letter, leaked to the Mail, telling Nick Clegg the laws would be too costly . In . a letter dated April 29, sent by Mr Alexander to Mr Clegg ahead of the . meeting, the Chief Secretary said he had ‘serious concerns’ about . tightening the law. ‘It . would impose a substantial new pressure on the prison population as soon . as it is implemented. The Ministry of Justice’s budget is already under . significant strain and this proposal would certainly not be affordable . before 2016/17,’ he wrote. ‘It . is very hard to see how it could be afforded afterwards given the . further fiscal consolidation required in the next Parliament.’ Mr . Alexander acknowledged Mr Grayling’s pledge only to implement the new . system when it is affordable, but added: ‘My strong view is that we . should not be seeking to put measures on the statute book if they could . not realistically be commenced for several years at best. ‘The Treasury does not support this amendment and I am not willing to clear it.’ Schools . minister Mr Laws, in a letter to Mr Clegg dated April 14, insisted . judges should be free to give repeat offenders whatever punishment they . see fit. David Laws branded the mandatory minimum sentence 'too blunt an instrument' in his letter to Nick Clegg . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (left) said now is the time to discuss a change in the law but Liberal Democrat and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (right) insists tighter restrictions would be too costly . ‘The principle of . judicial discretion is the cornerstone of our sentencing framework and . mandatory minimum sentences restrict such discretion and can lead to . unintended or unwelcome outcomes,’ he wrote. ‘I . have concerns about the impact on the prison population and the . deliverability of the policy within this Parliament. I am therefore . unwilling to clear this proposal.’ Another . coalition source said veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, who was . Mr Grayling predecessor as Justice Secretary and was attacked as too . liberal by MPs on the Right of his party, is understood to be the only . senior Conservative backing the Lib Dem position. ‘Ken . doesn’t like any toughening up of the justice system at all,’ said the . source. It is understood that the tightening in the law so that anyone . convicted on their second offence – or more – would automatically be . jailed. It would mean . several hundreds more offenders a year facing jail and sent a powerful . message to criminals that the use of blades will not be tolerated. Tragic: Hundreds of tributes have been left outside Corpus Christi College for Mrs Maguire after her death, believed to be the first killing in a British classrom, shook the nation . Today Mrs Maguire's family gathered to read the tributes as Conservative leaders were said to be drafting plans to legislate so that offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed . The . Tories made toughening the law on knife crime a key manifesto pledge, . suggesting before the last general election that anyone caught carrying a . knife should expect to face a prison sentence. To . the fury of Right-wing Tories, Mr Clarke abandoned the idea of a . blanket promise, but the Government has taken a series of steps to . tighten the law for some offenders. The . Government introduced an offence of ‘aggravated knife crime’ for . over-16s who use a knife to threaten or endanger others in a public . place, which is supposed to carry a mandatory custodial sentence. The offence of aggravated knife possession came into force at the end of 2012. Judges . must impose a custodial sentence - a minimum six months for an adult or . a four-month detention and training order for 16 and 17 year olds - . unless the court considers there are special circumstances which would . make it unjust to do so. Despite . the crackdown, Government figures last year found that even in such . cases, fewer than half of those found guilty of threatening someone with . a knife were receiving a jail term. A senior Lib Dem source said: 'This . policy is under discussion and no decisions have been taken.

"Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp picked Diego Costa as one of his 10 players to watch at the beginning of the season, writing: 'Watch him wrestling with defenders, pulling and scratching and diving to win penalties. Jose will love him, defenders will hate him! He is a finisher - and I fancy him to settle quickly and score plenty.' After watching Diego Costa closely at Atletico Madrid last season, I picked him as one of my 10 to watch this time around. So far, so good. The Spaniard is an absolute animal and has made a sensational start to his Chelsea career. He charges around like the Tasmanian devil and the Everton defence looked petrified of him at Goodison Park. Every game he looks like scoring. That’s because he is so hungry and you don’t always see that same drive in every striker. Jose Mourinho accused some of the Everton players of picking on Costa, but he doesn’t look like the kind of person you can bully! He can be wound up but his spat with Seamus Coleman didn’t bother me in the slightest. He’s a winner and can be a revelation in this league. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho praise Diego Costa after Everton win . Have some of that! Diego Costa celebrates in front of Seamus Coleman as Chelsea beat Everton on Saturday . How's he missed that? Mario Balotelli might've had a hat-trick on his Liverpool debut away at Tottenham . In and out debut: Angel di Maria wasn't able to make a significant impact on the game at Burnley . The best thing that happened to Liverpool on Sunday was Mario Balotelli not scoring. If he had, the game and the headlines would all be about him. Instead it was another team display that showed the gulf in class between Spurs and Liverpool. Balotelli bought into the work ethic and Brendan Rodgers will hope he keeps it up. As for his team-mate, Raheem Sterling is now England’s best player. He is lightning fast, beats defenders for fun and has all the ability to become our talisman. What a start to the season for Nathan Dyer and Swansea. The winger has three goals in three games and Swansea are joint top of the league with nine out of nine points. Garry Monk is doing a fine job, bringing in good players like Bafetimbi Gomis but also clearing out others like Chico Flores, who I always felt was a bit of a David Luiz defender — something of a liability. A lot of people tipped Swansea to go down this season. On this form? Not a chance. All smiles: Morgan Schneiderlin is mobbed by his Southampton team-mates as they beat West Ham . After getting sacked by Man City in 2009, Saturday’s win will have felt very good for Stoke boss Mark Hughes. He and his players will have watched City tear apart Liverpool last week and probably thought to themselves: ‘My god, this could be a nightmare for us.’ A lot of teams will go to the Etihad with damage limitation in mind, but not Stoke. They arrived with a game plan and were well organised. City only lost once at home last season — to Chelsea in February — so full credit to Stoke. You will have to go a long way to find a better result in the league this season. No matter how much he cost, Angel di Maria was never going to arrive at Old Trafford, wave a magic wand and turn them into the United of old. He showed glimpses of quality at Burnley but the team are playing with fear, probably for the first time in their lives. Louis van Gaal will hate not being able to work with several players over the international break, because there is a lot to be done. But after planes over the stadium and being made a scapegoat last season, David Moyes must be relieved to know it was not just down to him. Too much too soon? Youngster Yaya Sanogo struggles when he leads the line for Arsenal . Only a few days ago Arsene Wenger said Yaya Sanogo could be the man to lead the line for Arsenal in their title challenge this season. No goals in 16 games shows he is not the answer. Arsenal have a team of playmakers but imagine if they had a world-class striker to finish off those chances? Even with Olivier Giroud fit they lack firepower. Wenger now says he will be active in the transfer market to solve the problem, but to leave it this late is ridiculous. After his year at Man United did not go to plan, Wilfried Zaha has, to an extent, come home to Palace. The key for him is having a boss who believes in him. The fans already love him at Palace and will even more after his late equaliser at Newcastle. He has talent and this is a good chance for him to remind us all what he’s capable of. Five years ago Charlie Austin was playing for Poole Town. Now he’s scoring goals in the Premier League. As a player you always have some doubts and missing that penalty on the opening day won’t have helped, but there’s no doubt he can cut it. I saw him the evening after the game and congratulated him, but when I asked my dad if I should buy him a bottle of champagne, it was a definite no! That’s the dedication needed at the top level these days. Storming run: Mame Biram Diouf travelled 70 yards to score Stoke's winner against Manchester City . Tottenham v Liverpool is now the joint highest scoring Premier League fixture in history, with Liverpool v Newcastle. Both fixtures have had a total of 129 goals. I had an element of sympathy for Morgan Schneiderlin this summer. He wanted out but had to watch as his friends were all sold off around him. But results like Saturday’s will make it much easier for him to stay a little while longer at Southampton. Players have been known to go on strike to force a move but it looks like the Frenchman is happy to knuckle down. He is a box-to-box midfielder who can do it all and, with Ronald Koeman giving him licence to play further forward, he’s adding goals to his game, too. But if he does keep his shooting boots on, he needs to remember to celebrate a bit more. His body language was slightly odd at West Ham — goals don’t come along that often from midfield so you have to enjoy them! Where's this come from?

"Demands by the taxman for the power to raid ISAs were met with a wave of opposition last night. HM Revenue and Customs wants unprecedented power to settle unpaid tax bills. It has already been revealed that this includes taking money directly from current accounts – including joint accounts. But the controversial proposals would also make it possible for money to be seized from your tax-free ISA whether it is held in cash or stocks and shares. The move has been widely criticised by MPs and accountants who fear HMRC, which has a track record of incompetence, will target the wrong people by mistake. Controversial proposals would make it possible for money to be seized from your tax-free ISA by HM Revenue and Customs (library image) One think-tank, the Adam Smith Institute, said the proposals represent ‘a fundamental assault on the rule of law’ and many of the victims will be ‘completely innocent’. Anyone who owes £1,000 or more in tax could be affected – and HMRC will not even need to get a judge’s approval to withdraw the cash. The proposals were published in the Budget in March and are subject to a public consultation which ends on July 29. HMRC expects to seize around £375million over the next four years under the Direct Recovery of Debts powers, due to come into force next year. It predicts around 17,000 people a year will have money taken, the majority self-employed. Tina Riches, national tax partner at accountancy and investment firm Smith & Williamson, said the proposals ‘provide inadequate assurance for honest taxpayers’ who risked being hit by HMRC errors. HMRC insists it will not take the money unless the person will be left with at least £5,000 across all their bank accounts and Isas after the tax debt has been paid. By including Isas, HMRC’s chances of withdrawing money are significantly increased as they are hugely popular. Around 23million people have a total of £442billion saved in them. Miss Riches said people must be properly compensated if a mistake is made as a result of the taxman’s new powers. ‘I do not mean that they just get their money back with a bit of interest on top,’ she said. ‘They must be compensated so that their Isas are put back in the position that they would have been in if HMRC had not made a mistake.’ HMRC expects to seize around £375million over the next four years under the Direct Recovery of Debts powers, due to come into force next year (library image) This is because they could miss out on huge rises in share values if the money in their Isa is seized. Simon Wilks, a tax partner at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘It is absolutely right that people should pay tax that is due. ‘But in our view, any benefits from these proposals are far outweighed by the potentially extremely serious consequences for individuals and businesses if errors are made.’ Frank Haskew, head of the tax faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said there is considerable concern from both taxpayers and accountants about the proposals. ‘Such powers are unprecedented in the UK and could be open to mistakes and misuse,’ he said. ‘Fundamentally, we believe that money should only be taken from someone’s bank account by agreement or under the supervision of a court.’ A major concern surrounds joint accounts. For example, a woman might pay all the money into it and be unaware that her husband owes money to the taxman. Last week, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: 'It will help to level the playing field between those who pay what they owe, when they owe it and those who do not' Miss Riches said: ‘There are many reasons why an account may be in joint names. For example, an elderly parent may have added a son or daughter to their account. ‘Is it fair that the parent’s bank balance could be reduced because the son or daughter has not paid tax?’ Typically, the people targeted will owe an average of £5,800. In the consultation document, published last week, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: ‘It will help to level the playing field between those who pay what they owe, when they owe it and those who do not.’ He said the rules will only target ‘the truly non-compliant’, who he described as ‘a small core of taxpayers who owe significant debts of over £1,000 and have sufficient funds in their accounts to pay’. A Treasury Committee report warned last week: ‘This policy is highly dependent on HMRC’s ability accurately to determine which taxpayers owe money and what amounts they owe... an ability not always demonstrated in the past.’ HMRC insists it will only seize the money if it has made every effort to contact the taxpayer about the debt. Its consultation document says it will typically have contacted a taxpayer who has ‘a good history of compliance’ nine times by letter and telephone concerning the debt. The minimum is four times. Around half of those who will be affected have more than £20,000 in their bank and building society accounts and Isas. Cheats who fail to pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding them cost Britain around £35billion a year, according to HMRC. An HMRC spokesman said last night: ""Where an error by HMRC results in funds being mistakenly transferred out of an ISA we will ensure that funds are replaced and that the account holder does not lose any of their tax free limit for the year.""","HMRC calling for unprecedented powers to settle unpaid tax bills .

"These are the three Christmas miracles - sent from heaven. Anna Mitchell tragically lost four babies and thought she would never be a mum. But when her own mother died, she left Anna some money in her will and she used it to pay for IVF treatment. Amazingly she found she was pregnant with not just one baby - but three. Anna Mitchell is celebrating her first Christmas as a mother of triplets after previously losing four babies . Anna and husband, Nick, conceived babies Summer (centre), Joseph (left) and Jacob via IVF using money left by her late mother, Nicola, after she died of cancer . She gave birth to her triplet gifts from heaven in July - and the family are set to have their first ever Christmas together. Anna, 30, from Mansfield, who lives with husband Nick, said: ‘We haven’t bothered decorating our house for years, as there was just the two of us and no children to fill it. 'But this Christmas we have three wonderful little reasons to decorate the house from top to toe with baubles, tinsel and lights. 'It’s the first Christmas we have with our three little miracles, Summer, Joseph and Jacob - and we mean to make the most of it. 'But there is one thing we won’t forget - and that's mum, who made it all possible.’ The couple had been trying for a baby when Anna’s mum, Nicola, discovered she had liver cancer. She lost her first baby through an ectopic pregnancy - where the baby develops in the fallopian tube instead of the womb - whilst her mum was in a hospice, before she died. Anna said her three babies were a gift sent from heaven from her mother Nicola who died from liver cancer . Anna said she and her new family are looking forward to 'the most amazing Christmas, with our three gifts from heaven' She lost her second baby, also through an ectopic pregnancy, in summer of 2010, and then lost her third baby in November 2010. She was rushed into the operating theatre after losing her second baby and doctors removed her fallopian tube. Anna said: ‘It was life-threatening to me to lose these babies as each time my fallopian tube could have burst. ‘Doctors removed one of my fallopian tubes. It was devastating, it was taking away some of the chance I would have to be a mum. ‘After losing my third baby I couldn’t believe it. I had already lost three babies. I was terrified I was never going to be a mum.’ The doctors broke the news to Anna that she would be unlikely ever to fall pregnant naturally. So the couple came to the decision to try IVF treatment, using the money that Anna had been left by her mother. Anna lost four babies - three after suffering ectopic pregnancies - before finally giving birth to her triplets . She said: ‘I was going to use it to . start having IVF treatment. If I couldn’t be a mum naturally, then I . needed help. And mum’s money was a perfect gift from her. She knew how . much I wanted to be a mum, and now she was giving me the chance. The couple had their first course of fertility treatment at CARE fertility in Nottingham, but it didn’t work. Anna said: ‘It was devastating, but I knew that we had to keep trying. It’s what mum would have wanted.’ So in April 2012, they tried again for the second time, but again Anna had an ectopic pregnancy - and lost her fourth baby. They decided to have one final go in December 2012, and she fell pregnant. Anna and Nick have decorated the house for the first time in years as they celebrate Christmas as a family . Anna, pictured on her wedding day, said she feared she would never become a mother . She said: ‘I lay on the scanning table . hardly daring to breathe. 'And there it was - a little heartbeat pumping . away. I cried with relief. I’d lost four babies, and now here it was, a . heartbeat in the right place at last. 'I felt as though mum was looking . down on me and helping me along.’ But at 13 weeks pregnant, the sonographer had amazing news for them - there wasn’t just one baby in there, but three. She said: ‘I nearly fell off the table with shock. Then I started crying all over again. I wasn’t just having one baby, I was having three. 'I’d waited all these years to have a baby, and now three were all coming at once. And it was all thanks to mum, it was her triple gift from heaven for me.’ The babies were born one after the other in July, by caesarian at the Kingsmill Hospital in Mansfield. Summer weighed 3Ib8 and the identical twins Joseph at 3Ib8, and Jacob at 4Ib5. Anna added: ‘It will be the most amazing Christmas ever this year, with our three gifts from heaven. 'I’ve decorated the house from top to toe, and I know that somewhere out there, mum is looking down on us. 'Having three babies has made up for all that heartbreak. 'And it’s all thanks to mum and her amazing gift that we are going to have the best Christmas ever.’","Anna Mitchell feared never becoming a mother after losing four babies .

"Brandon Krenzler’s daughter has leukemia and he’s adamant that the only thing that keeps her happy through the illness and pain is marijuana. Just after her cancer diagnosis and subsequent chemotherapy, the effects of which Krenzler called ‘terrifying,’ 7-year-old MyKayla Comstock began using marijuana. Despite the apparent benefits of the drug for MyKayla’s health and permissive marijuana laws in the family’s home state of Oregon, not everyone is thrilled with Krenzler’s choice of medicine. Scroll down for video... Medicinal? Brandon Krenzler of Portland, Oregon has vocally defended his decision to administer medical marijuana to 7-year-old daughter MyKayla Comstock, who has leukemia . Though Oregon legalized medical marijuana in 1998 and currently lists over 55,000 on its medical marijuana registry, the fact that MyKayla is so young has some people appalled by Krenzler’s choice. ‘The doctor’s response was not very good at all,’ Krenzler recently said in an interview with Huffington Post as MyKayla sat beside him, smiling brightly. ‘She called us, basically, criminals.’ Krenzler said they’ve since had to find a new oncologist. Undaunted, Krenzler has continued to administer cannabis to his daughter. He’s also appeared on several news programs to discuss his choice and actively posts about the issue on his Cannadad blog. Better? Without marijuana, Krenzler said MyKayla would be sick and tired and at risk for secondary illnesses due to chemotherapy . ‘Before the marijuana,’ Krenzler said, ‘she didn’t want to eat anything. She was unhappy. She was overly fatigued. Basically, she was experiencing everything you wouldn’t want your daughter to experience.’ MyKayla said she was tired before she began using marijuana. ‘All I wanted to do was watch movies.’ Now, MyKayla receives ‘about a gram of cannabis oil two to three times daily’ as well as the raw juice of marijuana for ‘non-psychoactive effects,’ Krenzler said. He said they also administer cannabis topically for its benefits to the skin. Krenzler told HuffPost he fears what life would be like for his daughter without the drug. Right decision? Krenzler staunchly defends his choice to give MyKayla a gram of cannabis oil several times per day, though her first oncologist looked at him 'like a criminal' for his decision . ‘She would be sick every single day,’ he said. ‘She would be in pain for her continuous bone marrow biopsies and lumbar punctures. She would be under the influence of narcotic drugs such as Vicodin and OxyContin.’ Krenzler said MyKayla, by using marijuana, has managed to avoid secondary illnesses like extreme nausea and neuropathy, which can be caused by chemotherapy. So, with his daughter better able to fight for her life, Krenzler has continued to be common presence on the web as he fights for his right to choose medical marijuana for MyKayla. Alongside a Thomas Jefferson quote, Krenzler defended his choice on Facebook yesterday: . ‘No Human should ever have to fear persecution from their government for their choice in Medicine.’","Brandon Krenzler began administering marijuana to daughter MyKayla soon after her cancer diagnosis .

"Lorenzo Insigne's agent has shot down claims that Arsenal have made a move to sign the Italian winger. Reports suggested the Gunners were ready to make a £20m bid for the 23-year-old, who has recently returned from the World Cup in Brazil following Italy's elimination. But the diminutive playmaker's agent, Fabio Andreotti, has denied that Arsenal have made contact - but the Gunners are among a host of big clubs chasing Insigne. Appeal: Italy star Lorenzo Insigne knows nothing of any interest from Arsenal, his agent says . 'We have not been contacted by Arsenal for Lorenzo Insigne and Napoli has not notified us of this interest,' Andreotti said to Italian radio station Radio Crc. 'Lorenzo is a target of several European sides so it wouldn't surprise me if big clubs are interested in him. 'However, Napoli don't want to put him in the market.' In demand: Insigne has been attracting interest from across Europe but Arsenal are yet to bid . Insigne was three years remaining on his deal at Napoli where he has spent his entire career - bar three loan spells at other Italian clubs. Insigne scored eight goals in all competitions for Napoli last season as Rafa Benitez's men finished third in Serie A to secure Champions League qualification. He scored twice in a 3-1 win over Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia final and has been attracting interest from clubs across Europe.

"A man found guilty of the horrific rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl has been given a life sentence. South African Johannes Kana was handed two life sentences by a court near Cape Town. State prosecutors had asked for the sentence, without parole, for Kana. The BBC, reporting from the court in Swellendam, say Kana's uncle clapped his hands and laughed as the judge announced the sentence. 'This is a joke,' he said. National outcry: Hundreds of mourners gather for the funeral of 17-year-old Anene Booysen who was brutally raped and murdered in a crime that has shocked south Africa . Anene Booysen was discovered by security guards on a building site in the sleepy town of Bredasdorp, 80 miles east of Cape Town. According . to a Health Department spokesman, her injuries were so severe that her . family asked authorities not to release the details. However it was later revealed that her stomach had been slit open down to her genitals and that she had died from her injuries in hospital. She managed to identify one of her attackers before her death and two men have appeared in court charged with rape and murder. Jonathan Davids, 22, and Johannes Kana, 21, covered their faces to hide from television cameras and photographers as they made their way into the courtroom. The magistrate ordered the pair court to remain behind bars until Feb. 26 when their bail application will be heard. They face a maximum life sentence if found guilty. Police freed a third man arrested after the incident due to lack of evidence linking him to the crime, but said they were investigating whether there were others also involved. A crowd of 100 people protested outside . the courthouse in Bredasdorp, carrying placards saying 'Show no . mercy to rapists' and 'No bail to murderers'. Booysen's brother told local media he knew one of the suspects. He said: 'He was a friend of mine, we went to school together, stayed in one house, we were like brothers.' The girl was attacked in the sleepy town of Bredasdrop where two men have been charged with her rape and murder . On . Friday, hundreds of people marched through Bredasdorp, chanting 'enough . is enough' and hundreds attended the funeral on Saturday. Hundreds . of mourners, including politicians, packed a church in the town of . Bredasdorp, while a tent was set up to accommodate those who couldn't . fit inside. The killing . echoed the gang rape of a student on a New Delhi bus last year, and has . focused attention on South Africa's high rates of sex crime. Booysen was found by security guards lying a short distance from her house after partying at a bar last Friday evening. The Women's League of the ruling . African National Congress is trying to mobilise the public into similar . action to the protests against anti-female violence that took place in . India after the New Delhi attack. On . Saturday, South African media reported police had arrested a . Johannesburg pastor for luring a woman into his church and raping her. President . Jacob Zuma expressed shock and outrage, calling for the harshest . possible sentences for the killers and a concerted campaign 'to end this . scourge in our society'. He labelled the atrocity 'shocking, cruel and most inhumane'. According to a Health Department spokesman, Booysen's injuries were so severe that her family asked authorities not to release the details . South Africa's women's minister called on Tuesday for the toughest possible to be imposed. Minister of Women Lulu Xingwana, who has met with the victim's family said: 'We are saying to the court today there must be no bail for these criminals and monsters.' 'We expect the toughest and the harshest sentence that can act as a deterrent to other criminals that abuse and kill our women and children.' 'As an activist I strongly push that there should be no bail for these monsters. What would they do if this happened to any of their family members?' said Faraah September. South Africa has the highest number of reported rapes per head of population of any Interpol member country, with more than 64,500 reported in 2011/2012. A rape is said to be committed in South Africa every four minutes. Even when suspects are caught, only 12 percent of cases end in conviction and sex crimes seldom cause much public concern.","Murder of teenager Anene Booysen sparked national outcry .

"Barack Obama's behaviour at an important summit in Beijing has enraged Chinese internet users - because he was seen chewing gum. The U.S. President, a known user of Nicorette, a gum used to stop smoking cravings, was seen chomping away at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) after emerging from his limousine at the Water Cube, the Olympic swimming venue, while traditional dancers performed around him. Chinese Internet users, used to far greater levels of formality from their leaders, branded him an 'idler' and a 'rapper'. Scroll down for video . Furore: Barack Obama's behaviour at an important summit in Beijing has enraged Chinese net users - because he was seen chewing gum. Pictured, the President, who uses Nicorette gum, with Chinese President Xi Jinping . Yin Hong, a professor of journalism at Beijing's Tsinghua University, took to the Sina Weibo micro-blog service to voice his disapproval, reports USA Today. He said: 'We made this meeting so luxurious, with singing and dancing, but see Obama, stepping out of his car chewing gum like an idler.' Beijing pulled out all the stops for the gathering, which has seen 21 world leaders including  Russia's Vladimir Putin descend on Beijing, is the biggest event yet hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who took office last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) and U.S. President Barack Obama (right) stand with Chinese President Xi Jinping (second left) and other leaders during the APEC Summit family photo in Beijing . Some of the Chinese public are angry at the disruption it has caused. Authorities have banned wood fires to curb pollution and help ensure blue skies for the leaders instead of the usual grey smog, leading to freezing nights for villagers on the outskirts of Beijing. 'I now sleep under three quilts at night,' said a man who gave only his surname, Bai, as is typical of many Chinese when speaking to journalists. 'There cannot be any smoke, and we cannot heat our brick beds,' said the 68-year-old. Obama poses as he participates in a tree-planting ceremony outside the International Conference Center in Yanqi Lake, north of Beijing. Right, with Chinese President Xi Jinping . Traditional raised sleeping platforms in frigid northern Chinese houses are often heated by coal and provide warmth during both the day and night. Authorities also ordered one of China's most popular air pollution-reporting apps to remove data provided by the U.S. embassy, a company spokesman said Tuesday. The Chinese capital is periodically hit by choking, acrid haze, with particulate levels soaring far beyond recommended limits and public anger mounting over the issue. While the city government provides its own air pollution data, a separate reading by the US embassy in Beijing is widely considered more reliable.","Chinese 'netizens' unhappy Obama was chomping away at Beijing summit .

"There was a time when the  British class system was quite simple. Often the subject of satire – most notably in the Frost Report sketch of the 1960s – it basically came down to Upper, Middle and Lower. Half a century on, however, the BBC and academics claim that is outdated and we now fall into seven social groups. Scroll down for video and to take the test yourself . Top dogs: There is an 'elite' - just 6 per cent of people - who have savings of more than £140,000, many social contacts and education at top universities, according to the BBC's Great British Class Survey . At the bottom: The 'precariat' group is 'marked by the lack of any significant amount of economic, cultural or social capital', said Professor Mike Savage, of the London School of Economics and Political Science . Wealthy: The average age of this group is 46 and they tend to work in management or traditional professions and mainly come from middle class backgrounds . For instance, if you’re a van driver on less than £160 a week who doesn’t like jazz, you must be a member of the Precariat. On the other hand, if your income is . over £89,000 a year, you have a comfortable  private pension, and you go . to dinner  parties with lawyers and dentists, you belong to the Elite. The new social scale, backed by the . BBC and called the Great British Class Survey Experiment, tries to . take into account the music we listen to, the people we mix with, and . the likelihood that we use social networks, to determine where we stand. More than 160,000 people took part in the poll via the BBC website. New class: Only six per cent of people are classed as Technical Middle Class. People in this group tend to mix with people similar to themselves and enjoy highbrow culture and tend to live in the suburbs . Bang in the middle: The New Affluent Workers are youthful and are sit in the middle in terms of wealth. Many of the group tend to live in former manufacturing areas in the Midlands and North West . On the decline: A much smaller percentage than may have been expected are in the Traditional Working Class group, which has the oldest average age at 66 . Financially insecure: The 19 per cent of Britain that are classed as an Emergent Service Worker tend to be young and have low scores for saving and house value but spend time enjoying emerging culture and socialising . Freshly-identified classes include a . Technical Middle Class, which contains aircraft pilots, radiographers . and social researchers, and New Affluent Workers, children of the old . working class who went to new universities, many of them people working . in sales. Call centre workers and chefs fall . into an ‘Emergent Service Sector’ of educated young people in insecure . jobs who are well versed in popular music, sport and social networks. The Precariat – a word coined from . precarious and the Marxist jargon proletariat – make up nearly one in . six of the population. The survey said they have tiny incomes, no . savings, rent their homes, have the least cultural interests of any . social class, and are ‘the most deprived’. A high concentration of the Precariat, . the survey claims, can be found in Stoke-on-Trent. One of the academics . who drew up the new scale,  Manchester University sociology professor . Fiona Devine, said it  presented a ‘more sophisticated, nuanced picture . of what class is like now’. She added: ‘It is what is in the middle . which is really interesting and exciting, there is a much more fuzzy . area between the traditional working class and traditional middle . class.’ But author and social commentator Jill . Kirby said: ‘This survey has kept sociologists busy, but it is a . doubtful use of BBC resources. It does show how difficult it is to . categorise people. 'But it also shows there is plenty of social mobility – . even the Precariat can escape more easily than the working class of 50 . years ago.’ The BBC scale, produced with the help . of the state-run Economic and Social Research Council and academics from . six universities, follows the 1980s teachings of French philosopher . Pierre Bourdieu, who said class depended on culture, taste and who you . mix with as well as the kind of job you have. The report said: ‘We have been able to . discern a distinctive elite, whose sheer economic advantage sets it . apart from other classes. 'The fact this elite group is also shown to . have the most privileged backgrounds is an important demonstration of . the accentuation of social advantage at the top of British society.’ It said fewer than four out of ten people are counted as part of traditional working or middle classes. The Frost Report sketch from 1966 made fun of the British class system but was acclaimed for its simplicity. It featured Ronnie Barker saying to a . tall John Cleese: ‘I look up to him because he is upper-class.’ He then . added to small Ronnie Corbett: ‘But I look down on him, because he is . lower-class. I am middle-class.’ Now click here or scroll down to take the test.

"As she bit into a banana, Consi Taylor noticed some strange spots on its skin. At first she thought it was just bruising...until each tiny mark dropped on to her carpet and scurried off into hiding. But while her horror at the creepy-crawly stowaways was bad enough, there was worse to come. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Taylors were forced to stay in a hotel when their home became infested with Brazilian wandering spiders . One of the world's most venomous spiders, the female of the species can grow to have a leg span of 6in . After sending a photograph of the insects to pest control experts, she was told they were suspected to be Brazilian wandering spiders, one of the world’s most venomous types, whose bite can kill within two hours. And worse still, her home could now be infested. The female of the species can grow to have a leg span of 6in. Mrs Taylor, aged 29, and her teacher husband Richard, 37, were forced to spend three nights in a hotel with their children, Benjamin, three, and four-month-old Annabel, while their house was fumigated and deep-cleaned. Yesterday housewife Mrs Taylor told how her semi-detached home in Hampton, south-west London, was invaded by the toxic arachnids.' She had taken the fruit from a £1 bunch of Colombian Fair Trade bananas bought in her local Sainsbury’s, and eaten about half when she noticed the 3mm-long dots that resembled mould or bruising. But then she spotted the white nest at the bottom of the fruit. ‘I screamed, it was horrible,’ she said. ‘I’m scared of spiders anyway so I had to get a friend to come round to hoover them up. Then we cleaned the floor with anti-bacterial wipes.’ Luckily her son had turned down a share of the banana before he went out to play football. At first Consi Taylor thought her banana was bruised... until each tiny mark dropped on to her carpet . Sainsbury’s gave Mrs Taylor a £10 voucher when she returned the fruit, but she insisted on having the spiders identified. She sent a picture of the creatures to a pest control company, which quickly named them as ‘lethal’ Brazilian wandering spiders – and warned there could still be some lurking in her home. Guinness World Records lists the species as the most toxic spider on earth. Its venom is said to be 30 times more powerful than that of a rattlesnake. Humans bitten by one can suffer an irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, vomiting and eventual death. To emphasise its nastiness, the spider’s scientific name is ‘phoneutria nigriventer’ – the first word being Greek for ‘murderess’. Hatchlings do not pack the full poisonous punch of mature adults, but the pest controllers advised evacuating the three-bedroom house. The family is now back home and Sainsbury’s has paid them £2,800 for the inconvenience. Evacuated: Consi Taylor and her family were forced to flee their south-west London home for a hotel . Sainsbury's paid £1,000 to cover the family's hotel bill, fumigation and dry cleaning now the Taylors have returned home (file picture). They were initially offered just a £10 voucher . Yesterday a store spokesman issued an apology, saying: ‘We do have rigorous controls on imported products at all stages – from harvesting to transportation – which is why this is so rare.’ A source at the chain insisted the creatures are unlikely to survive in Britain either inside or outside, because they need warmth and humidity. Mrs Taylor said: ‘The pest control people said every living thing in our house is now dead, but I’m still terrified one is still alive. ‘I’d never heard of Brazilian wandering spiders before all this and I can’t imagine what it would be like facing a fully grown one. I was trembling and shaking inside when I found out what they can do to you. We kill every spider we see in the house now. ‘We used to use a postcard and paper cup and carry them outside and put them in the garden, but we’re killing them all now for our safety and sanity.’ She added: ‘I still like bananas very much, but I can’t put my hand near them in the shop any more, so my husband has to buy them for me now.’","Pest control firm warned of possible infestation of the deadly spiders .

"More than 20 beaches in England are expected to fail cleanliness tests when tougher European standards are introduced next year, new figures show. Almost all beaches in England (99.5 per cent) currently meet the basic standards for clean bathing water, but that figure is expected to drop to 94.5 per cent once the rules change. Just two spots failed to reach the mandatory grade this year – Lyme Regis Church Cliff Beach in Dorset and Staithes in North Yorkshire. Staithes, North Yorkshire was one of two spots that failed to reach the mandatory grade this year . The other spot that failed to make the grade in 2014 was Lyme Regis Church Cliff Beach in Dorset . But five per cent of beaches which are currently meeting the minimum standards will be classed as ‘poor’ next year, including Blackpool North, Blackpool Central, Lancashire and Seaton and East Looe in Cornwall. The UK government said some areas remain vulnerable to the effects of heavy rainfall and pollution from human and animal sources. The bathing water statistics from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) showed the number of beaches which reached mandatory levels for cleanliness increased from 98.8 per cent in 2013 to 99.5 per cent this year in England. Blackpool North is expected to be one of the beaches that will be classified as 'poor' under stricter tests . In Northern Ireland 95.7 per cent of all beaches tested met the mandatory level of cleanliness . Water minister Dan Rogerson said: 'Water quality is improving and has now reached a record high, which means families across the country can make the most of what nature has to offer. 'We know that seaside tourism is hugely valuable to the economy, contributing over £3.6 billion every year. That is why it is so important to protect our seas and lakes, allowing our seaside communities to thrive. 'We know meeting the tough new targets is going to be a challenge but that is why we are doing everything we can to help prepare. Everyone has an important role to play, from a range of sectors to local government and the communities they represent.' New figures show that 97.5 per cent of bathing spots in Scotland passed water quality tests . Percentage of beaches that met basic water quality standards: . Percentage of beaches that met higher guideline standards: . In Wales all beaches tested met the mandatory level of cleanliness, while 97.5 per cent of those in Scotland passed bathing water tests and 95.7 per cent in Northern Ireland made the grade. The figures also showed that the proportion of beaches reaching existing higher guideline standards of cleanliness fell slightly in 2014. In England, 80.7 per cent of beaches met the higher grade, a slight drop from 83.5 per cent in 2013. Dr Paul Leinster, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said: ‘This year a record 99.5 per cent of beaches passed bathing water quality tests, a dramatic improvement in water quality since 1988 when only 65 per cent of beaches passed. ‘Successful work with our partners to reduce pollution has benefited the environment and people. ‘While 94.5 per cent of beaches would pass the new tougher water quality standards the Environment Agency will continue to urge water companies, local authorities, farmers and businesses to take steps to reduce pollution and protect water quality where improvements are needed.’ In Wales 88.1 per cent of bathing spots achieved the higher standards, as did 55.6 per cent in Scotland and 69.6 per cent in Northern Ireland – where it fell from 87 per cent the previous year. In Wales all 101 beaches tested met the mandatory water standards, and 89 also made the higher grade. In Wales 88.1 per cent of bathing spots achieved the higher standards . Carl Sargeant, Welsh minister for natural resources, said: ‘Our bathing waters are an important natural resource that has environmental, social and economic benefits for the whole of Wales, with our fantastic beaches and beautiful coastlines enjoyed by millions every year. ‘I'm delighted to see Wales achieve these excellent results for the 2014 bathing season. 'We must now continue to work with our partners to build on the high standards we have set so that communities across Wales and beyond can continue to bathe in top quality Welsh water for years to come.’","More than 20 beaches in England will fail to meet new standards .
